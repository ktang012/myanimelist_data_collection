            "content": "Special A is primarily a Shoujo Rom/Com that starts off slow but gets better as you go. Based on the inability of Hikari to understand Kei's true feelings for most of the plot. Normal laws of physics are generally ignored by the seeming superhuman duo of Kei and Hikari, who also are both at the top of their school academically.\r\nThe story isn't the most original story ever, relying on the interaction of the seven members of the Special A (SA from now on) class and not involving many other characters. While somewhat predictable, it still manages to be entertaining most of the time if notfrustrating because of the general lack of development between the main couple's relationship. (The anime does have several minor changes in its adaptation of the manga's story) \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty normal for your typical shoujo. The character models are somewhat odd in their unusually elongated limbs, but it's nothing that should ruin the show for you. The scenery and colors are good, if nothing fantastic, and I particularly liked the animation of the romance scenes where they would employ a pastel like color scheme which enhanced the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, much like the art, is, for the most part, good while not great. The background music appropriate and never seemed to get annoying or repetitive. The OPs and EDs have mixed opinions. The first OP and ED didn't really go over well with me and i doubt anyone would mind skipping right over them. The second OP and ED didn't seem to be much better at first either, but surprisingly they grew on me and ended up being pretty catchy. I don't have any complaints about the VAs, they all seemed to fit their characters and Kei and Hikari's VAs particularly were good, bringing out the same character that was seen in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters were developed well, with the other members of the SA getting their own spotlight at times. While the main focus is on the Kei x Hikari pairing, there are a few other pairings that show up and will get episodes developing them. Obviously, being the two main characters, Kei and Hikari are developed the most and are both likable, though you might want to strangle Hikari a few times for being as stupid/ignorant as she is. Still, she definitely has her own great moments and you should be able to mostly ignore her own shortcomings and cheer her (and Kei) on.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment varies as the series goes on, starting off somewhat weak compared to its peak later on in the anime. The comedy of the anime compared to manga is just as good if not better than the original. The romance on the other",

            "content": "Special A is a Shoujo, Romantic, Comedy, Drama about the extravagant lives of some prestigious individuals and the romantic endeavours some of them pursue. It contains some side-splitting comedy but tends to fail when circumstances get too serious.\r\nThe story&hellip; well it sort of has one and sort of doesn&rsquo;t. For the most part, the series follows the random antics of an elite group of students known as the S.A (Special A). This usually involves any random theme you can imagine, be it competitions or festivals, whilst exaggerating the wealth of these students. This brings about some truly hilarious slapstick comedy moments, which varies depending onthe character delivering the joke nevertheless some jokes can become really repetitive. Then there are times it focuses on a specific member of the S.A, providing the viewers with some much needed back-story on one the characters and developing them further. However the transitions between the comedy &amp; drama relies too much on clich&eacute;s that it becomes tiresome very quickly. Not only that but a lot of the character arcs were completely ruined during the transition from manga to anime. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that the main romance between Kei &amp; Hikari is constantly prevented from moving forward and in the end you probably would have lost interest.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Kei &amp; Hikari, they certainly made an interesting pair; Kei being the typical cold &amp; calculating guy (Jun Fukuyama perfect for the job ^^) and Hikari being a sort of na&iuml;ve, brutish girl. Strange combination I must say. Then there are the 5 other members of the S.A who have their individual personalities and traits, making them all an integral part of the story. They each have their own funny, intriguing and annoying side, so it just depends on which has the biggest impact on you.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is exactly what you can expect from your typical shoujo anime; lustrous environments that go well with the wealthy theme and slender character designs to appeal to the standard shoujo viewers. The comedy is certainly executed well on the other hand the romance would have been perfect without the annoying effects (especially when things go artsy for a brief moment). The music here is nothing special and can get very repetitive, along with some of the dialogue. It&rsquo;s only the voice actors that do a good job in bringing out the most from their characters, allowing me to give the sound department a decent score. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I though that Special A began as a really great Rom/Com that could compete with something like Lovely Complex, but the countless amount of clich&eacute;s and cheesy moments failed to have a positive effect on the romance and drama. The fact that the story is rather inconsistent and the characters don&rsquo;t have the same feel as in the manga, will certainly disappoint the fans of the manga but those who can ignore the numerous faults will be able to enjoy this great anime for what it is.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Special A was anything but special. It was very cliche, but it's hard to avoid that in shoujo anime. There was nothing mind-blowing about neither the music or the art.\r\nThe story is pretty basic. In all honesty, I don't really think there is such a thing as orginality, but it's up to the people writing or directing to make it seem real. We know Shakespeare based Romeo and Juliet off a book someone had already written. How many times have we heard the story of 'I must defeat him...oh, wait I just found out he loves me?' but the issue isn't whether it was originalor not, it's simply that they didn't know how to move the plot efficiently.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, one of the most important, if not the primary, thing to a story is character. If you have believable characters, then the audience will automatically simpathize and invest their own emotions into those characters. Yes, it is a comedy. Most of the things in the show defied the laws of physic, to say the least, but take Akira for example. The problems of her past evolving Yahiro really gives her more depth. As compared to Hariki who mentally retarded but ended up in the S.A. anyway. They should have developed a bit more of the characters. What's the point if it's just the same thing again and again? Yes, we know she thinks of him as his rival, but wouldn't it be more interesting if she had become aware of her own feelings on her own and had to defeat him in order to prove to herself she wasn't in love? Or what if he suddenly let her win (and I'm not talking about that crap challenge with the flower) what would she have done? Would she have realized that she probably really didn't want to win?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm saying is that there could have been so much more done to make them more human. Why doesn't he let her win, anyway? Does he feel she'll love him that way?\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, though, I really liked the less fictional aspects of the show. It wasn't TOO bad, in all honesty. I won't watch it again, and I got bored about half way though, but hey, it had it's good parts. I can't think of any NOW, but I remember liking somethings....",

            "content": "If I've never read the manga, I'd probably enjoy this anime for the crack that it is. But knowing how really great the manga is, I'm really disappointed with the anime adaptation.\r\nI know that when animes are set with a strict 24 episodes border they have to leave out things from the original story and alter things so that it makes a coherent story in tha anime, too. Lovely Complex, for example,  managed to pull this off well - even though they changed many things and left out a lot of chapters, the general mood still remained the same, so it was enjoyable formanga readers, too. \\n\\n\r\nBut I feel like Special A isn't being true to the manga, and it's really bad adaptation wise.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the anime makers change a story a bit, manga readers can usually enjoy any kind of scenes with their beloved characters. The main problem with SA is that it didn't manage to grab the character's personalities at all. It seems like they looked at the characters, remembered a few traits they have then they animated them between these traits, without really paying attention to the character's depth. I don't want to get into spoilers, but the anime couldn't portray Kei's relationship with his brother well, and the end of that episode had a completely different message then it originally had in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the anime doesn't have the same mood as the manga at all. In the manga, these 7 people are extraordinarily talented, but still, normal people. The anime made them look really out of this world, especially in the first and the seventh episode. What most of the readers liked about the original story is that these characters were normal people, just outstanding ones. The anime completely took this aspect away.\\n\\n\r\nThe SA anime is only really enjoyable for those who hasn't read the manga, so if you want to watch all of the episodes while enjoying it, I'd like to recommend you not reading the manga. However, when the anime is over and you had your fun with it, I'd like to ask you to read the manga, which has a lot more levels.",

            "content": "Delightful anime.\r\nFrom the very start you are drawn in. Hikari is not the usual clumsy, slightly dumb, female protagonist. She's a warrior basically. Learning the art of wrestling from a young age, she defeated everyone. Then she meets Kei and he is the first to defeat her. Her mission in life becomes defeating Kei in every aspect of life. \r\nFast forward several years.\r\nThey are both in High school apart of \"Special A\" a class of nine students who are the top 9 in the school. Hikari, of course, is number 2 which she hates because the number one spot is held by none other thanher arch nemesis/rival Kei. What she doesn't know is that Kei is in love with her. And so the story begins.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The plot line is great so far. Kei keeps his feelings hidden but several things slowly reveal to Hikari that Kei might hold deeper feelings for her. She sees him only as her rival and is oblivious to most of these cues. They compete episode after episode with Hikari slowly realizing that there might be more to the situation than she originally believes. Not the most original plot, but with the great characterization, animation, and plot circumstances, the story becomes great!\\n\\n\r\nArt: I love the art in this anime. Not the best in the word but good enough. Hikari is beautiful, Kei extremely handsome. The fight scenes are fluid. Facial expressions and everything else are so hilarious, yet cute and appropriate. I love when they do the soft animation for scenes where Kei realizes or appreciates something new about Hikari. *Update* I really like the art in this anime. Even with the stick figures (which show up every once in a while to emphasize the long length of the characters legs and works to be more comical than anything else) the characters are drawn either cutesy or very attractive. I especially like the way the eyes are drawn in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say here. Fitting with the theme of the show. :) Loves it. The opening theme is cute and appropriate. I tend to like the ending theme's more tan the opening, which is also the case for me in Special A. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development is what the show is all about. everyone  has a very unique and distinct personality. idiosyncrasies are utilized for comic effect and works very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10! Hands down! I love this show. I'm a connoisseur of great shoujo anime and this definitely  makes my list.  You will be sucked into the hilarious cuteness of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10. Just watch it. I promise you wont regret it. :)",

            "content": "Special A is a 24-episode anime adaptation of a manga by Maki Minami. It stars a group of teen-aged students of the super elite school Hakusenkan. The protagonist (considering the anime is of the shojo demographic) is a female called Hanazono Hikari. She, of course, is an elite student belonging to the A-class, which is considered special (hence the title). B- to F-classes are highly inferior to the A-class. It&rsquo;s a good thing that A-class students don&rsquo;t overestimate themselves, though they always stand out wherever and whenever they go. \r\nThe story Special A features is a mixture of comedy, some bits of drama, and ofcourse romance. Hikari sees Kei only as a rival and doesn&rsquo;t really take interest in her love life. It has become obvious ever since the first episode that Kei looks up to Hikari as someone he loves. But on the contrary Hikari is somewhat dense, as many would consider her to be, and takes only a little pint of interest in her love life.  Romance is exhibited by the main of the main characters, Hikari and Kei, only at the latter part of the series. The other major characters, on the other hand, have taken one step (or two) ahead of Hikari and Kei. More and more characters pop up and end up getting paired with the earlier characters. Their love stories do not take a turn to another phase easily. They have so-called &lsquo;issues&rsquo; that would make each of their stories more interesting. In short, they are not revolving around a simple romance story. Making the other characters go ahead is quite a good idea. It won't have that much of an impact if the lead characters develop ahead of the others. Comedy, on the other hand, is demonstrated via exaggeration. It is acceptable for them to do almost impossible things since, of course, they are highly regarded &lsquo;elite&rsquo; students [and are in an anime]. The comical parts (which is also equivalent to the romantic parts) of the story are not what many would consider corny or half-witted.  Drama is the least of the three genres this anime falls under. There may not be enough tear-jerking scenes, but there are quite a good number of heart-trending thoughts and deeds displayed by some characters.  \\n\\n\r\nAlmost each episode of the anime features one certain thing Hikari does to prove herself better than Kei. However, it&rsquo;d be boring if there weren&rsquo;t anyone to stir up some schemes. Sometimes, the characters deal with seemingly antagonistic guys or a group of jealous students. Such &lsquo;antagonists&rsquo; make the story unpredictable as they prove themselves to be misunderstood&mdash;quite a good method of making twists in the plot. Most of the time, however, their 'opponents' would be themselves. Conflict featured is often psychological.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, though it advances slowly and focuses almost entirely on Kei&rsquo;s growing love for Hikari and Hikari&rsquo;s intimate passion for defeating Kei, is unique in its own way. The planning of events by the manga-ka is not mediocre, though it would always show a little bit too much of one thing. The story isn&rsquo;t always (and very seldom) predictable, except for parts about Hikari losing to Kei in whatever task they perform. You would only find the events unsurprising if you know the characters too well. The plot isn&rsquo;t that much complicated and is good enough for young viewers. One event leads to another and doesn&rsquo;t jump to an irrelevant setting. The characters are regarded equal senses of importance. They&rsquo;re not intended to look second-rate to either Hikari or Kei. Each possesses a distinctive trait/s, so they aren&rsquo;t boring&mdash;they give off the same aura of enthusiasm as the lead characters do. Their looks befit their characteristics, too. The music is as of any other typical shojo anime&mdash;soft, melodious, and is not in a gloomy atmosphere. The art and animation are good, though not perfect (like duh). The animation seems not rushed, the coloring and shading aren&rsquo;t bad, and the strokes are light. There are only a few unnoticeable discrepancies. But in one certain part of the series we could say that the animators are somewhat &lsquo;experimenting.&rsquo; Changing the style of animation and strokes isn't exactly that good of an idea, considering the viewers are already adept with the previous style. Nevertheless, watching this anime won&rsquo;t be considered a total waste of time&mdash;it&rsquo;s not dull and it features a good storyline. Overall, Special A deserves a commendable 8/10.",

It wasn't horrible, far from it! But since I'm comparing it from the manga, it comes short. It was okay, but...just okay.\r\nBut then episode 2 came. And then ep 3. And then 4. And then 5... And then I decided that I had to edit my review here in MyAnimeList. The deliverywas getting better by the episode, I think. Or maybe the anime just grew on me. Either way, if you didn't like the first episode, stick around and you'll eventually enjoy yourself. If you liked the first episode, then good for you! It'll get better from there.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I still maintain that the manga is more enjoyable than the anime. But seeing as some people simply like moving art than still ones, then to each his own, I guess. After all, there are some things that are more hilarious on print, and there are some things that are delivered better in motion.\\n\\n\r\nMy suggestion: if you like the manga, FORGET ABOUT IT for 30 minutes every time you watch the anime. If you like the anime, then READ THE MANGA!\\n\\n\r\n(As much as I like this anime now, though, I'm still miffed that Kei isn't blonde. :( It's not just character design... It's in his CHARACTER.

Sadly I just couldn't take it anymore.  \r\nThis one was a mediocre to bad romance/comedy anime series.  The characters were uninteresting and on some levels very annoying.  I kept waiting for the series to go some where.  I know romance anime sometimes start off slow like Love Hina, Onegai Teacher, Suzuka and others, but this one went no where.  The animation done by Gonzo and AIC was the best part of theseries.  What Gonzo gets involved in is good, but even they couldn't save this series.  The music was also decent but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall another average to bad romance/comedy anime series.",

There is much more to this story than that but this is the main focus. I really enjoyed watching it even though I think since the main focus is the developing relationship between Kei Takishima(male main character) and Hikari (female main character), that the show should have focused on them mostly. \r\nI got a little discouraged seeing that they really didn't have more kei and Hikari episodes but the ones that did focus on them was great. But basically you have a story about7 main characters attending this elite school called Special A and the bonds that grow and the challenges that they have to face.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7: I give the story a 7 just because I think they didn't really focus on the main characters enough and the ending wasn't what I hoped.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: I enjoyed the art even though I think most of the characters were a little skinny.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Sound was oustanding\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: I think all the characters in this anime were very likable. Some a little annoying but likable. Kei was the sweet and smart charmer that was great in everything and also the main females' rival. Hikari was caring and valued friendship and energetic. She works hard to accomplish things. As far as the other five Special A members, they all had something special about them but I dont want to go into detail about it or this would be too long of a review.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: I enjoyed this anime a lot and even put it as one of my favorites because it was that enjoyable and something I could watch over and over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave Special A a 10 because I love the romance/comedy genre and this anime sure has both and it was enjoyable.",

            "content": "First off, I've only seen the first six episodes of this anime and never read the seemingly well known manga, so take my review with a grain of salt.\r\nThis show is yet another romantic, shoujo, school life kind of anime:\r\nStory:\r\nFrom what I've seen up till now, there is really barely a story. There are a few story arcs, which at most go over 2 episodes. I'd say the story is just stuck onto the relationship between the 2 main characters and kind of obsolete. Other than that, I really don't know what to say about the story, except maybe the relationship between the two:\r\nThe showis all about how Hikari Hanazono has always been second to Kei Takishima, who is more than perfect in everything. She always calls him her rival, which destroys any romance from really building up in the first few episodes. I guess the idea of each story arc is, thatHikari challenges Kei to something and the story then revolves around the competition, and maybe creates a few romantic moments. I really don't see any proper story, though that may change with future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art really bothered me. The way the characters are drawn is really strange and kind of put me off right from the start. Every person in this anime is extremely tall and thin with very long legs. Some shots through out the show just look really wrong because the proportions don't seem to match.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is OK. It's not amazing to the point where I would have to by the CD, but not bad to the point where it would disturb me. It just fits well into the &quot;story&quot; and &quot;plot&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI find every character, except Kei, annoying and/ or unlikable. I guess the anime could turn out great it they did the character development well, but Hikari is just too annoying for me to handle and I really didn't at all sympathize with her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI flat out did not enjoy watching these episodes. I had to push myself to episode six and had forgotten what had happened in the &quot;plot&quot; till then, if that tells you anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is really kind of unfair to bash an anime of which I've only seen six episodes, but I really disliked it. The show does have some potential and I really hope that it will make use of it.\\n",

            "content": "Not many have heard of this anime, living in the shadow of Ouran High School Host Club . Though not a harem, this one can definitely shine on it's own. I LOVE OHSHC but it's not the only one out there. \r\nSummary: You could skip if wanted :)\r\nHikari was the best fighter, that title was hers for a long time until her dad introduced her to Kei, the one person she can't win against. Always placing second to him in everything from sports to academics, she vows to beat him and follows him from elementary to high school. In high school the Special A (S.A)clubis formed, in it are seven members, and even there Kei is first. What Hikari doesn't know is that Kei is and has been in love with her since they were small. This anime follows the lives of S.A members as they deal with life, love and high school.\\n\\n\r\nIs the idea original? No. Don't get me wrong it's entertaining. I mean, just the rivalry between Kei and Hikari is enough to get me to watch this again and again. But the whole school special club of kids has been done time and time again, off the top of my head I think about Ouran High School and Shugo Chara (minus magical element). And most of the things are severely exagerrated (for proof see the second part of of the first episode)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this anime.\\n\r\nThey are, most of them, original. You will see some of you in one of them.\\n\\n\r\n-From Kei, the quiet yet chivalrous guy in love with his 'rival.' Reminds me of what Lelouch as a normal high schooler would have been like. But then again Lelouch wouldn't be Leouch if not for his ability to make an entrance and his Lelouchness. His facial expression alone will make you smile, swoon and laugh, sometimes at the same time.\\n\\n\r\n-Twins Megumi and Jun who try to never be separate an have horrible social skills. Megumi with her never specking out loud to preserve her singing voice and always using signs. Jun being awkward and not know how to act around people.\\n\\n\r\nTadashi and Akira who with are their animosity towards each other and all the cooking you know there is something there. Akira is hilarious when she's mad and if they were real, she'd be in anger management classes. Tadashi is fun, he's the guy you'd party with.\\n\\n\r\nRyuu who loves nature and animals and frankly is sweetly weird.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is Hikari , who with her being number one obsession you can't help but do the \"ha ha!\" *Melvin laugh from Simpsons* when she ranks in second.\\n\\n\r\nCan't say much else without spoilers and I REFUSE to leak this one!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime color and style look good. The characters limbs look so long and stick figurish like and that takes some getting used to. Also I'm not sure if someone else noticed but most characters have the same posture and hands in the same place when they stand, I noticed the second time I watched episode 1, towards the end. But it's sweet, bubbly and funny. The way they are drawn makes them stand out a little from other anime but they are regularly drawn. there is no weird hair color or cool purple eyes, It's one of it's charms to be normal looking. \\n\r\nMusic flows with the scenes and nothing feels out of place, though the ending song isn't my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly I love the ending and I specially liked that even though similar to OHSHS the endings were different, though something leading up to it weren't. My rating on this one is based on smile ability. Making watchers smile unconsciously is a rare thing on anime, well not on good ones.\\n",

            "content": "Let me get one thing straight. I am a huge fan of the romantic comedy category. I was introduced to it by the show \"Kaichou wa Maid-sama!\", one that many rom-com aficionados credit as being one of the best rom-com manga/anime you can read/watch. After my introduction to this category, I began watching other notable shows: Toradora!, Clannad, and if it may be counted, Oreimo, all of which I enjoyed wholeheartedly. But the issue with the rom-com genre is the use of generic elements, some of them out of choice and some of them because there were no other alternatives.\r\nGetting past that issue, I oftenrefer to Toradora! as the benchmark rom-com, the [nearly] perfect rom-com. I refer to Clannad as a tearjerker with quite possibly the strongest storyline of any anime show. Oreimo, with its controversial title and incestuous elements, offers something new to the rom-com genre. Each of them had a black horse cleverly tucked under their sleeve and proceeded to expose and conceal it at the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is what surprises me the most about Special A. It has no black horse, no tricks, no twists, and as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't even have sleeves, yet it still draws positive ratings from viewers. Special A is the dead basic rom-com. This is what every writer strives to surpass, because it's really that easy.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, where the Student Council President is a maid. Toradora!, where a boy and a girl have romantic interest in each other's best friends and help each other try to win their hearts. Oreimo, where it's quite possible that your lover is the otaku girl living in the room next to yours. How does it sound with Special A? \\n\\n\r\n\"Special A, where a girl goes to school.\"\\n\r\nIs that it?\\n\r\n\"No, her rival is also in the same club.\"\\n\r\nAnything else?\\n\r\n\"......they get good grades.\"\\n\\n\r\nYou think, okay, that's just about every other high school rom-com out there, but rom-com's have always shared the same generic format, the same elements, and in that essence, the same problems and situations. This would be like watching a sitcom on Disney Channel or Nickelodeon. They exist on different channels. They can switch up the characters all they want, but when it comes down to writing, they all use the exact same storyboard. For a high school rom-com, the typical format would be a girl that goes to school. She has some type of  issue relating to the male lead, but in the end, they end up together.\\n\\n\r\nWe know that's going to happen. We know that as soon as you show us the male and the female lead, they will end up together because there is honestly no other way it ends. What we're really interested in is how they get there or if there is any sort of twist that will distinguish this show from everything else, and offering nothing but the barebone story itself portrays lack of thought from the writers. Special A shows us the main characters. We know that they will end up together by the end of the series. We know the female protagonist has a problem with the male protagonist, and we have identified that as the main issue. However, since there is no twist or any supporting element that occurs alongside the storyline, that leaves us with the protagonists in a high school. Where's the fun in that?\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think the only reason why this show is even remotely distinguishable is the art style. The characters seem taller than average and anorexic due to their long, skinny limbs, but the backgrounds for each scene were really appealing. One instance, in particular, would be the scene between Akari and Tadashi, when they leave the school to \"see the night\". Otherwise, I don't think the animation has grown on me yet, nor will it ever grow on me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are as generic as generic can get. Not like a parody show or a satirical piece where characters can get away with being generic because they portray common stereotypes. In a rom-com, what's there to make fun of, and who is there to address anyways? That leaves, nobody. These characters aren't generic to prove a point or to make anybody laugh. They're generic, because that's just how they are.\\n\\n\r\nThis seems to explain their distinct lack of energy as well. For example, Hanazono Hikari, the series protagonist, is bright, energetic, and dense. If any of you have watched School Rumble, the protagonist Tsukamoto Tenma shares all of the same traits. They both play a role as their respective series' protagonist, but while Tenma has enough energy to literally BE the Energizer bunny, Hikari, for the traits used to describe her, could be more likened to a desert: flat, dry, and a comparable lack of life. I believe that characters portray the mood of a scene through their words and actions, but how do you expect the viewers to catch on if the characters seem to lack the spirit?\\n\\n\r\nAs you continue down the line, you'll begin to notice that every character in this show is more insignificant than the last, the secondary characters in particular receiving an elevated form of neglected attention. The Yamamoto twins, for example, lack presence in this series; two characters in the Special A club who supposedly make up the main cast who could be easily mistaken for secondary characters, which they aren't supposed to be. Sure, we're quite aware that the primary protagnoists are Hanazono Hikari and Takishima Kei, but let it be known that they aren't the only characters in this series. There are other characters with interesting side stories. Shed a little more light on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bear in mind that you are watching a show about perfect people living perfect lives with the perfect amount of wealth going to the perfect school, making this show difficult to relate to as a normal person. You can be jealous, envious, or vicariously living through the lives of these characters, but I'll be honest; I have better chances of relating to a giant blender fighting outer space aliens across all seven dimensions. I may be wrong on this one, especially because we're talking about characters that can break through the bottom of cooking pots with their palms, but for a show that doesn't acknowledge science fiction, fantasy, or supernatural elements, why do I get the feeling that the writer set up Special A to be some kind of \"superhuman fighting force from the distant future\"? Was it implied in the name or did the writer think his idea for a superhero show would get scrapped? A rom-com doesn't have to be a slice of life to be able to relate to it, but why is Special A so out of reach?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'll admit it. I enjoyed certain parts of this show, but if I wanted to rewatch any one of those scenes, I'd log into YouTube and find them myself. Even keeping that in mind, I'm absolutely certain that there are other shows with normal scenes much better than the ones found in Special A, so why would I rewatch them anyways? This leaves me back where I started, avoiding Special A altogether. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: In my eyes, Special A is average at best, marking the most standard rom-com on the market. The writing is Disney Channel sitcom generic, the characters were likely picked from a hat, the art might as well be an advertisement to the world's most effective weight loss program, and the comedy is as good as that time Jeff Dunham picked up a puppet and reminded everyone of the joke he made on the last Comedy Central special. I can hardly say that I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nRemember earlier when I said that rom-com's tend to be generic either by choice or because there is no other way? There's a reason why writers choose to be generic: some do so to play it safe and gather a guaranteed fanbase. Special A would fit that category of shows that are generic by choice.\\n\\n\r\nWhile writers take this route as an express ticket to quick profit (because writing is a difficult profession), a generic show is only average at best. Don't expect to engrave this show into the back of your head anytime soon.",

            "content": "This is my first review , so don't be to hard on me (as I will be on this anime)  :):\r\nSpecial A is another *of the numerous* \"school\" animes , so there are plenty of funny scenes , romance and other stuff that usually comes with this type of anime . And when there is romance , usually there is a \"baka\" person who doesn't understand the concept of love and love \"signs\" . Unfortunately that's the case here .\r\nThe story is about class Special A , in which only the best seven students of the school can go , and by coincidence (ornot?) six of them are from rich families (Does that mean that only the rich students are the smart ones??) . And if U wonder what those extra-smart students do at school all day , the answer is :\"They drink tea and eat sweets and cookies all day long\" :D . And then they wonder why the most of the students from the school hates them ....\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyway ... the focus is on the two main characters Kei and Hikari , and the 1000 ways of Kei showing Hikari his love for her , although she just can't get it . Kei is a typical cold guy , who works all day and night and don't have much time for fun , but somehow *I really wonder why?*  he is in love with Hikari and he tries in all possible ways to show her his love . But when U have a \"baka\" person as Ur \"opponent\" , it's almost impossible to archive Ur goal . The situation is similar to Kenji and Temna from School Rumble with some extra annoying scenes . \\n\r\nThe other 5 characters in Special A have their own stories and they are usually about some bad memories from their past or some weird sides of their personalities . But there are also some funny stories , although they are in minority here . \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is typical for this kind of anime , although there were some scenes where the characters would become all shiny and colored (usually in some romance scene) which annoyed me . The sound was pretty much ok . I didn't like the OP and ED , since it wasn't my type of music , so I just skipped them on each episode. The voice actors did a good job , and most of the voices fit with the characters (expect maybe for Kei's father).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime deserves a 6/10 . But if U like the \"baka\" type of girls U can add 2 or 3 grades to my score . Otherwise , I would recommend U to watch some other (and better) \"school\" animes like Ouran High School Host Club , Clannad or Lovely Complex.",

            "content": "This is one for fans of highschool romcoms. Its not a bad show but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are particularly a fan of the genre or really in the mood.\r\nSo Special A is everything you expect from a romcom, a bunch of affluent highschool students hang out with a single poor student, one of them is very popular with the ladies but hopelessly in love with our plucky but unaware heroine. We see them get places in a series of romantic situations but she just can't seem to get it. Some laughs are had along the way and I don't want to spoilanything but everything works out pretty well int he end.\\n\\n\r\nIn this series the extravagant private school they characters attend has inexplicably decided to devote considerable resources to giving the 7 top students an impressive glass greenhouse where they basically drink tea all day. Part of their gifted and talented program to encourage the top students to slack off all day I am sure. But somehow they all manage stay on top, and when I say on top I mean on top. They are the best at literally everything, boxing, PR, athletics you name it! Except for the occasional bad cooking gag they are pretty much perfect but its actually not too annoying, once you get used to the ridiculous premise that is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad show, don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable.  It can be funny at times, sometimes I was laughing with it sometimes I was laughing at it, but that's not always a bad thing, I did actually enjoy myself. I found the art style quite annoying. I got used to the weird long limbs but the male lead has these really weird eyes. He looks really cool in a single episode and I thought maybe things were looking up but maybe they just had a different artist, or maybe it was the black suit. In any case if you are particularly sensitive to art and that sounds like it could be annoying maybe just do an image search.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say for Special A is that unlike other shows of its genre the characters lives don't revolve around the female lead. The supporting cast has their own stuff going on and occasionally I found it even more interesting than the what the lead characters were doing. It felt a bit more interesting and full that way, and I quite liked that about this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the kind of show that you will enjoy if you enjoy watching plucky heroines and the rich boys that love them and kidnap them lovingly in their private helicopters. That's the kind of show it is and its a solid addition to the genre. But it doesn't stand out, and if it doesn't sound like your thing I would give it a miss.",

Watching two oddly paired people fall in love with each other sure was a journey. I didn't really enjoy it as much towards the end, although it had a pretty interesting ending. I was confused on how the anime ended, but after doing some research, I understand it. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe quality of this anime was amazing. The details of every little thing was included, and I absolutely loved the scenery. \r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nThe music was outstanding, and the voice actors / actresses did an amazing job of expressing their characters' personalities, especiallyKei and Hanazono. Kei really showed that he was serious most of the time, and Hanazono is a very joyful girl who just wants to be better than her rival, Kei. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe characters were very well animated and drawn. All characters were unique in their own little way, and also had very interesting personalities, especially Kei. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime, although I wished it was really centered only around Kei and Hanazono. This anime included many other love relationships between many other people towards the ending, and I was really looking forward to what would happen between Kei and Hanazono, of course, I figured that out at the end. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nOverall, ending... sad. I cried a little bit, but it had a happy ending, and made me smile. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "I tried to like this anime. I really did. I was so excited when they announced the Special A anime because I had been following the manga for so long. This manga has a lot of memories for me and I know that anime tend to add new things, take things out, and change up the story a little to meet the limitations of the time constraints, but it was just impossible for me to love this anime.\r\nIf I hadn't read the manga, I might've enjoyed watching this anime, but I agree, this anime really has nothing special compared to other student council anime (andthat includes the harem/ecchi ones!). \\n\r\nThe characters have a few note features that are from the manga, but it feels like they took out a lot of core elements to the characters and added whatever they wanted to fit. I have such an issue with the change in character stories as well. Was it necessary to give Kei a stupid background story for why he wanted Hikari's bento? Couldn't it just be that he wanted to eat her cooking? That's simple as it is and very sweet; perfect for a romcom, but no, let's make it less romantic and more childish. Oh, and another thing, Kei's personality just isn't right. It feels completely off the entire time. Instead of cool and collected, Kei just seems a little pompous--or maybe that's just the voice actor who plays him. I just feel like he lost a lot of his appeal as a male love interest. Hikari just seems kind of innocent, which is fine, but she lost a lot of other traits that made her so distinct as a main character.\\n\r\nI know a lot of things are changed for comedic effect or drama to keep the audience on their toes, but the manga's story was a lot funnier and the drama that does happen in the manga really hits you deep. This anime failed to execute any of it properly.\\n\r\nMaybe if I hadn't absolutely loved the manga, I would have enjoyed myself, but maybe I would have complained about the generic characters and lack of originality. Either way, I am not happy with this anime.",

The short stories covering blocks of episodes were very entertaining, allowing for the audience to see the dynamics between and the growth of the characters.  However, some of these short stories lack originality, but then again, the romantic comedy genre can easily be repetitious.  \r\nArt: Artwork for the anime is good and pretty consistent throughout.  The animation is still considered good even though I believe that the art of thisanime was not meant to be spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The seiyuus were well-matched with each character; they were able to bring the series to another level of humor and enjoyment.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There could have been more character development in this anime.  While the story did go briefly into each character's history, more background would have been useful and entertaining.  However, considering the genre and the lightness of the overall anime, the creators of the series did well in presenting the past and present character drama and issues.

            "content": "When one sees visuals of &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; and reads that the main premise of the series follows the school days of a select group of intelligent, rich students at their prestigious school that has created an exclusive elite class for them called S.A., one can't help but to think of &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo;. Add the shared element that the wealth, insane levels of talent and skill that some of the members possess is often plastered all over the screen. The fact the group in &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; has one commoner among them, Hikari, quickly makes one think of Haruhi from &ldquo;Ouran High School HostClub&rdquo; to boot. \\n\\n\r\nHowever comparisons end roughly there as Hikari and Haruhi are quite different characters. The relationship between the &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; leading couple Kei and Hikari and the &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo; couple Tamaki and Haruhi also plays out differently, and although both anime series don't have an entirely conclusive ending regarding the main pairing, the relationship between Tamaki and Haruhi does feel just that bit better paced and played out.\\n\\n\r\nSpanning 24 episodes, &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; pulls the plot card of Kei and Hikari's love and possible relationship fairly soon in the series and even though enough episodes revolve around it, no real progress is made until the final episodes. Given that a large part of that is due to Hikari being totally oblivious to Kei's and her own feelings, her being an airhead about it may become annoying to some viewers. Especially since Hikari is no idiot but has excellent academic skills and is only dense about love, especially when it involves Kei and her own feelings.\\n\r\nSeeing several romantic pairings between the other characters form in the episodes in-between, perhaps it might have been better if they had only touched upon Kei and Hikari's relationship a bit later on so its pacing would not have been so slow.\\n\r\nLuckily the Kei and Hikari pairing is an unexpectedly good one. Childhood friends due to their fathers being acquainted, the straightforward and honest Hikari is a perfect match for the near emotionless genius Kei since she literally brings a ray of light in his else very cold and businesslike environment. No doubt that is why he has always loved her, she may not be of wealthy descent but she holds everything he lacks in that world. \\n\r\nThe added gimmick that Hikari sees Kei as her ultimate rival and is hell bent on beating Kei in whichever task or test they perform adds some uniqueness and is the source of many jokes. Though it gets a bit repetitive towards the end when Hikari seems to desperately grab on to seeing Kei as a rival in order to not have to face up to the fact she's in love with him and always has been.\\n\\n\r\nThe other members of the S.A each have their own distinct personalities which offsets their more generic visual appearance, or their unique quirks which in turn leads to scenes filled with laughter but also when brought at the wrong time, can seem a little annoying when it causes the series to switch from a serious tone to a humoristic one too fast.\\n\r\nThroughout the series, some other characters are brought forth as seemingly purely evil influences bent on hurting the SA group, but most are redeemed as the series progresses, though it is especially Yahiro that is initially brought front as a nemesis. \\n\r\nOne could say the final episode where Hikari pursues Kei makes it seem the rest of the cast are just dragged into it to show off their most common trait or role, but it also serves to show their group is a tightly knit band of friends that stands together. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the romantic pairings and story, what I most appreciated in &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo; is the continuous barrage of humor and jokes that could have one laughing through their tears. Next to the romantic elements &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; also delivers tons of humor and jokes, however it doesn't seem to really reach up the level of &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo;. In that, &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; is nice but not really special since it doesn't excel. It is a nice comedy, but not the best one out there.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation throughout the series is decent to good, save for several scenes where corners are cut or the animation drops slightly it's always enjoyable to watch and never drops far. Typical for such a romantic school comedy are the bright colors, stylish school uniforms and extravagant settings.\\n\r\nA welcome change is the more realistic hair colors of the main characters, it's always nice to see a series that can have a diverse cast of characters that sport realistic hair colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is generic for series of its genre, it does not really stand out but accompanies the scenes well. The OP songs are another matter, I must confess out of my own personal taste I found them both to be rather atrocious and soon skipped through them when watching an episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have not read the &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; manga so I can not say how the anime compares to it or how faithful an adaptation it is. \\n\r\nRegardless, &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; will be an enjoyable romantic school comedy for everyone that they will surely enjoy and have a lot of laughs each episode!",

The female lead no matter how she tries to catchup with him does not succeed. While initially doing a good job of racking up the tension between the characters, thefailure to follow up and lack of closure leaves much to be desired. There is so little difference between the lead characters' abilities and the outcome so predictable that I could not help feel let down.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters at least had better character development, though they get just an episode or two at most per character. Throw in a bunch of mistaken malicious anti-hero and a trillion dollar powerful corporation who pulls no stops in getting our reluctant hero to take over the reins as the heir. Other animes such as Ouran high and Kaichou wa maid sama have a much better storyline in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up my verdict, the ranking was not a good indicator of the expectations I had from this anime.

Based on the inability of Hikari to understand Kei's true feelings for most of the plot. Normal laws of physics are generally ignored by the seeming superhuman duo of Kei and Hikari, who also are both at the top of their school academically.\r\nThe story isn't the most original story ever, relying on the interaction of the seven members of the Special A (SA from now on) class and not involving many other characters. While somewhat predictable, it still manages to be entertaining most of the time if notfrustrating because of the general lack of development between the main couple's relationship. (The anime does have several minor changes in its adaptation of the manga's story) \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty normal for your typical shoujo. The character models are somewhat odd in their unusually elongated limbs, but it's nothing that should ruin the show for you. The scenery and colors are good, if nothing fantastic, and I particularly liked the animation of the romance scenes where they would employ a pastel like color scheme which enhanced the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, much like the art, is, for the most part, good while not great. The background music appropriate and never seemed to get annoying or repetitive. The OPs and EDs have mixed opinions. The first OP and ED didn't really go over well with me and i doubt anyone would mind skipping right over them. The second OP and ED didn't seem to be much better at first either, but surprisingly they grew on me and ended up being pretty catchy. I don't have any complaints about the VAs, they all seemed to fit their characters and Kei and Hikari's VAs particularly were good, bringing out the same character that was seen in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters were developed well, with the other members of the SA getting their own spotlight at times. While the main focus is on the Kei x Hikari pairing, there are a few other pairings that show up and will get episodes developing them. Obviously, being the two main characters, Kei and Hikari are developed the most and are both likable, though you might want to strangle Hikari a few times for being as stupid/ignorant as she is. Still, she definitely has her own great moments and you should be able to mostly ignore her own shortcomings and cheer her (and Kei) on.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment varies as the series goes on, starting off somewhat weak compared to its peak later on in the anime. The comedy of the anime compared to manga is just as good if not better than the original. The romance on the other",

It contains some side-splitting comedy but tends to fail when circumstances get too serious.\r\nThe story&hellip; well it sort of has one and sort of doesn&rsquo;t. For the most part, the series follows the random antics of an elite group of students known as the S.A (Special A). This usually involves any random theme you can imagine, be it competitions or festivals, whilst exaggerating the wealth of these students. This brings about some truly hilarious slapstick comedy moments, which varies depending onthe character delivering the joke nevertheless some jokes can become really repetitive. Then there are times it focuses on a specific member of the S.A, providing the viewers with some much needed back-story on one the characters and developing them further. However the transitions between the comedy &amp; drama relies too much on clich&eacute;s that it becomes tiresome very quickly. Not only that but a lot of the character arcs were completely ruined during the transition from manga to anime. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that the main romance between Kei &amp; Hikari is constantly prevented from moving forward and in the end you probably would have lost interest.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Kei &amp; Hikari, they certainly made an interesting pair; Kei being the typical cold &amp; calculating guy (Jun Fukuyama perfect for the job ^^) and Hikari being a sort of na&iuml;ve, brutish girl. Strange combination I must say. Then there are the 5 other members of the S.A who have their individual personalities and traits, making them all an integral part of the story. They each have their own funny, intriguing and annoying side, so it just depends on which has the biggest impact on you.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is exactly what you can expect from your typical shoujo anime; lustrous environments that go well with the wealthy theme and slender character designs to appeal to the standard shoujo viewers. The comedy is certainly executed well on the other hand the romance would have been perfect without the annoying effects (especially when things go artsy for a brief moment). The music here is nothing special and can get very repetitive, along with some of the dialogue. It&rsquo;s only the voice actors that do a good job in bringing out the most from their characters, allowing me to give the sound department a decent score. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I though that Special A began as a really great Rom/Com that could compete with something like Lovely Complex, but the countless amount of clich&eacute;s and cheesy moments failed to have a positive effect on the romance and drama. The fact that the story is rather inconsistent and the characters don&rsquo;t have the same feel as in the manga, will certainly disappoint the fans of the manga but those who can ignore the numerous faults will be able to enjoy this great anime for what it is.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Special A was anything but special. It was very cliche, but it's hard to avoid that in shoujo anime. There was nothing mind-blowing about neither the music or the art.\r\nThe story is pretty basic. In all honesty, I don't really think there is such a thing as orginality, but it's up to the people writing or directing to make it seem real. We know Shakespeare based Romeo and Juliet off a book someone had already written. How many times have we heard the story of 'I must defeat him...oh, wait I just found out he loves me?' but the issue isn't whether it was originalor not, it's simply that they didn't know how to move the plot efficiently.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, one of the most important, if not the primary, thing to a story is character. If you have believable characters, then the audience will automatically simpathize and invest their own emotions into those characters. Yes, it is a comedy. Most of the things in the show defied the laws of physic, to say the least, but take Akira for example. The problems of her past evolving Yahiro really gives her more depth. As compared to Hariki who mentally retarded but ended up in the S.A. anyway. They should have developed a bit more of the characters. What's the point if it's just the same thing again and again? Yes, we know she thinks of him as his rival, but wouldn't it be more interesting if she had become aware of her own feelings on her own and had to defeat him in order to prove to herself she wasn't in love? Or what if he suddenly let her win (and I'm not talking about that crap challenge with the flower) what would she have done? Would she have realized that she probably really didn't want to win?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm saying is that there could have been so much more done to make them more human. Why doesn't he let her win, anyway? Does he feel she'll love him that way?\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, though, I really liked the less fictional aspects of the show. It wasn't TOO bad, in all honesty. I won't watch it again, and I got bored about half way though, but hey, it had it's good parts. I can't think of any NOW, but I remember liking somethings....",

            "content": "If I've never read the manga, I'd probably enjoy this anime for the crack that it is. But knowing how really great the manga is, I'm really disappointed with the anime adaptation.\r\nI know that when animes are set with a strict 24 episodes border they have to leave out things from the original story and alter things so that it makes a coherent story in tha anime, too. Lovely Complex, for example,  managed to pull this off well - even though they changed many things and left out a lot of chapters, the general mood still remained the same, so it was enjoyable formanga readers, too. \\n\\n\r\nBut I feel like Special A isn't being true to the manga, and it's really bad adaptation wise.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the anime makers change a story a bit, manga readers can usually enjoy any kind of scenes with their beloved characters. The main problem with SA is that it didn't manage to grab the character's personalities at all. It seems like they looked at the characters, remembered a few traits they have then they animated them between these traits, without really paying attention to the character's depth. I don't want to get into spoilers, but the anime couldn't portray Kei's relationship with his brother well, and the end of that episode had a completely different message then it originally had in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the anime doesn't have the same mood as the manga at all. In the manga, these 7 people are extraordinarily talented, but still, normal people. The anime made them look really out of this world, especially in the first and the seventh episode. What most of the readers liked about the original story is that these characters were normal people, just outstanding ones. The anime completely took this aspect away.\\n\\n\r\nThe SA anime is only really enjoyable for those who hasn't read the manga, so if you want to watch all of the episodes while enjoying it, I'd like to recommend you not reading the manga. However, when the anime is over and you had your fun with it, I'd like to ask you to read the manga, which has a lot more levels.",

            "content": "Delightful anime.\r\nFrom the very start you are drawn in. Hikari is not the usual clumsy, slightly dumb, female protagonist. She's a warrior basically. Learning the art of wrestling from a young age, she defeated everyone. Then she meets Kei and he is the first to defeat her. Her mission in life becomes defeating Kei in every aspect of life. \r\nFast forward several years.\r\nThey are both in High school apart of \"Special A\" a class of nine students who are the top 9 in the school. Hikari, of course, is number 2 which she hates because the number one spot is held by none other thanher arch nemesis/rival Kei. What she doesn't know is that Kei is in love with her. And so the story begins.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The plot line is great so far. Kei keeps his feelings hidden but several things slowly reveal to Hikari that Kei might hold deeper feelings for her. She sees him only as her rival and is oblivious to most of these cues. They compete episode after episode with Hikari slowly realizing that there might be more to the situation than she originally believes. Not the most original plot, but with the great characterization, animation, and plot circumstances, the story becomes great!\\n\\n\r\nArt: I love the art in this anime. Not the best in the word but good enough. Hikari is beautiful, Kei extremely handsome. The fight scenes are fluid. Facial expressions and everything else are so hilarious, yet cute and appropriate. I love when they do the soft animation for scenes where Kei realizes or appreciates something new about Hikari. *Update* I really like the art in this anime. Even with the stick figures (which show up every once in a while to emphasize the long length of the characters legs and works to be more comical than anything else) the characters are drawn either cutesy or very attractive. I especially like the way the eyes are drawn in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say here. Fitting with the theme of the show. :) Loves it. The opening theme is cute and appropriate. I tend to like the ending theme's more tan the opening, which is also the case for me in Special A. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development is what the show is all about. everyone  has a very unique and distinct personality. idiosyncrasies are utilized for comic effect and works very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10! Hands down! I love this show. I'm a connoisseur of great shoujo anime and this definitely  makes my list.  You will be sucked into the hilarious cuteness of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10. Just watch it. I promise you wont regret it. :)",

            "content": "Special A is a 24-episode anime adaptation of a manga by Maki Minami. It stars a group of teen-aged students of the super elite school Hakusenkan. The protagonist (considering the anime is of the shojo demographic) is a female called Hanazono Hikari. She, of course, is an elite student belonging to the A-class, which is considered special (hence the title). B- to F-classes are highly inferior to the A-class. It&rsquo;s a good thing that A-class students don&rsquo;t overestimate themselves, though they always stand out wherever and whenever they go. \r\nThe story Special A features is a mixture of comedy, some bits of drama, and ofcourse romance. Hikari sees Kei only as a rival and doesn&rsquo;t really take interest in her love life. It has become obvious ever since the first episode that Kei looks up to Hikari as someone he loves. But on the contrary Hikari is somewhat dense, as many would consider her to be, and takes only a little pint of interest in her love life.  Romance is exhibited by the main of the main characters, Hikari and Kei, only at the latter part of the series. The other major characters, on the other hand, have taken one step (or two) ahead of Hikari and Kei. More and more characters pop up and end up getting paired with the earlier characters. Their love stories do not take a turn to another phase easily. They have so-called &lsquo;issues&rsquo; that would make each of their stories more interesting. In short, they are not revolving around a simple romance story. Making the other characters go ahead is quite a good idea. It won't have that much of an impact if the lead characters develop ahead of the others. Comedy, on the other hand, is demonstrated via exaggeration. It is acceptable for them to do almost impossible things since, of course, they are highly regarded &lsquo;elite&rsquo; students [and are in an anime]. The comical parts (which is also equivalent to the romantic parts) of the story are not what many would consider corny or half-witted.  Drama is the least of the three genres this anime falls under. There may not be enough tear-jerking scenes, but there are quite a good number of heart-trending thoughts and deeds displayed by some characters.  \\n\\n\r\nAlmost each episode of the anime features one certain thing Hikari does to prove herself better than Kei. However, it&rsquo;d be boring if there weren&rsquo;t anyone to stir up some schemes. Sometimes, the characters deal with seemingly antagonistic guys or a group of jealous students. Such &lsquo;antagonists&rsquo; make the story unpredictable as they prove themselves to be misunderstood&mdash;quite a good method of making twists in the plot. Most of the time, however, their 'opponents' would be themselves. Conflict featured is often psychological.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, though it advances slowly and focuses almost entirely on Kei&rsquo;s growing love for Hikari and Hikari&rsquo;s intimate passion for defeating Kei, is unique in its own way. The planning of events by the manga-ka is not mediocre, though it would always show a little bit too much of one thing. The story isn&rsquo;t always (and very seldom) predictable, except for parts about Hikari losing to Kei in whatever task they perform. You would only find the events unsurprising if you know the characters too well. The plot isn&rsquo;t that much complicated and is good enough for young viewers. One event leads to another and doesn&rsquo;t jump to an irrelevant setting. The characters are regarded equal senses of importance. They&rsquo;re not intended to look second-rate to either Hikari or Kei. Each possesses a distinctive trait/s, so they aren&rsquo;t boring&mdash;they give off the same aura of enthusiasm as the lead characters do. Their looks befit their characteristics, too. The music is as of any other typical shojo anime&mdash;soft, melodious, and is not in a gloomy atmosphere. The art and animation are good, though not perfect (like duh). The animation seems not rushed, the coloring and shading aren&rsquo;t bad, and the strokes are light. There are only a few unnoticeable discrepancies. But in one certain part of the series we could say that the animators are somewhat &lsquo;experimenting.&rsquo; Changing the style of animation and strokes isn't exactly that good of an idea, considering the viewers are already adept with the previous style. Nevertheless, watching this anime won&rsquo;t be considered a total waste of time&mdash;it&rsquo;s not dull and it features a good storyline. Overall, Special A deserves a commendable 8/10.",

It wasn't horrible, far from it! But since I'm comparing it from the manga, it comes short. It was okay, but...just okay.\r\nBut then episode 2 came. And then ep 3. And then 4. And then 5... And then I decided that I had to edit my review here in MyAnimeList. The deliverywas getting better by the episode, I think. Or maybe the anime just grew on me. Either way, if you didn't like the first episode, stick around and you'll eventually enjoy yourself. If you liked the first episode, then good for you! It'll get better from there.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I still maintain that the manga is more enjoyable than the anime. But seeing as some people simply like moving art than still ones, then to each his own, I guess. After all, there are some things that are more hilarious on print, and there are some things that are delivered better in motion.\\n\\n\r\nMy suggestion: if you like the manga, FORGET ABOUT IT for 30 minutes every time you watch the anime. If you like the anime, then READ THE MANGA!\\n\\n\r\n(As much as I like this anime now, though, I'm still miffed that Kei isn't blonde. :( It's not just character design... It's in his CHARACTER.

            "content": "First off, I've only seen the first six episodes of this anime and never read the seemingly well known manga, so take my review with a grain of salt.\r\nThis show is yet another romantic, shoujo, school life kind of anime:\r\nStory:\r\nFrom what I've seen up till now, there is really barely a story. There are a few story arcs, which at most go over 2 episodes. I'd say the story is just stuck onto the relationship between the 2 main characters and kind of obsolete. Other than that, I really don't know what to say about the story, except maybe the relationship between the two:\r\nThe showis all about how Hikari Hanazono has always been second to Kei Takishima, who is more than perfect in everything. She always calls him her rival, which destroys any romance from really building up in the first few episodes. I guess the idea of each story arc is, thatHikari challenges Kei to something and the story then revolves around the competition, and maybe creates a few romantic moments. I really don't see any proper story, though that may change with future episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art really bothered me. The way the characters are drawn is really strange and kind of put me off right from the start. Every person in this anime is extremely tall and thin with very long legs. Some shots through out the show just look really wrong because the proportions don't seem to match.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is OK. It's not amazing to the point where I would have to by the CD, but not bad to the point where it would disturb me. It just fits well into the &quot;story&quot; and &quot;plot&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI find every character, except Kei, annoying and/ or unlikable. I guess the anime could turn out great it they did the character development well, but Hikari is just too annoying for me to handle and I really didn't at all sympathize with her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI flat out did not enjoy watching these episodes. I had to push myself to episode six and had forgotten what had happened in the &quot;plot&quot; till then, if that tells you anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is really kind of unfair to bash an anime of which I've only seen six episodes, but I really disliked it. The show does have some potential and I really hope that it will make use of it.\\n",

            "content": "Not many have heard of this anime, living in the shadow of Ouran High School Host Club . Though not a harem, this one can definitely shine on it's own. I LOVE OHSHC but it's not the only one out there. \r\nSummary: You could skip if wanted :)\r\nHikari was the best fighter, that title was hers for a long time until her dad introduced her to Kei, the one person she can't win against. Always placing second to him in everything from sports to academics, she vows to beat him and follows him from elementary to high school. In high school the Special A (S.A)clubis formed, in it are seven members, and even there Kei is first. What Hikari doesn't know is that Kei is and has been in love with her since they were small. This anime follows the lives of S.A members as they deal with life, love and high school.\\n\\n\r\nIs the idea original? No. Don't get me wrong it's entertaining. I mean, just the rivalry between Kei and Hikari is enough to get me to watch this again and again. But the whole school special club of kids has been done time and time again, off the top of my head I think about Ouran High School and Shugo Chara (minus magical element). And most of the things are severely exagerrated (for proof see the second part of of the first episode)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this anime.\\n\r\nThey are, most of them, original. You will see some of you in one of them.\\n\\n\r\n-From Kei, the quiet yet chivalrous guy in love with his 'rival.' Reminds me of what Lelouch as a normal high schooler would have been like. But then again Lelouch wouldn't be Leouch if not for his ability to make an entrance and his Lelouchness. His facial expression alone will make you smile, swoon and laugh, sometimes at the same time.\\n\\n\r\n-Twins Megumi and Jun who try to never be separate an have horrible social skills. Megumi with her never specking out loud to preserve her singing voice and always using signs. Jun being awkward and not know how to act around people.\\n\\n\r\nTadashi and Akira who with are their animosity towards each other and all the cooking you know there is something there. Akira is hilarious when she's mad and if they were real, she'd be in anger management classes. Tadashi is fun, he's the guy you'd party with.\\n\\n\r\nRyuu who loves nature and animals and frankly is sweetly weird.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is Hikari , who with her being number one obsession you can't help but do the \"ha ha!\" *Melvin laugh from Simpsons* when she ranks in second.\\n\\n\r\nCan't say much else without spoilers and I REFUSE to leak this one!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime color and style look good. The characters limbs look so long and stick figurish like and that takes some getting used to. Also I'm not sure if someone else noticed but most characters have the same posture and hands in the same place when they stand, I noticed the second time I watched episode 1, towards the end. But it's sweet, bubbly and funny. The way they are drawn makes them stand out a little from other anime but they are regularly drawn. there is no weird hair color or cool purple eyes, It's one of it's charms to be normal looking. \\n\r\nMusic flows with the scenes and nothing feels out of place, though the ending song isn't my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly I love the ending and I specially liked that even though similar to OHSHS the endings were different, though something leading up to it weren't. My rating on this one is based on smile ability. Making watchers smile unconsciously is a rare thing on anime, well not on good ones.\\n",

            "content": "Let me get one thing straight. I am a huge fan of the romantic comedy category. I was introduced to it by the show \"Kaichou wa Maid-sama!\", one that many rom-com aficionados credit as being one of the best rom-com manga/anime you can read/watch. After my introduction to this category, I began watching other notable shows: Toradora!, Clannad, and if it may be counted, Oreimo, all of which I enjoyed wholeheartedly. But the issue with the rom-com genre is the use of generic elements, some of them out of choice and some of them because there were no other alternatives.\r\nGetting past that issue, I oftenrefer to Toradora! as the benchmark rom-com, the [nearly] perfect rom-com. I refer to Clannad as a tearjerker with quite possibly the strongest storyline of any anime show. Oreimo, with its controversial title and incestuous elements, offers something new to the rom-com genre. Each of them had a black horse cleverly tucked under their sleeve and proceeded to expose and conceal it at the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is what surprises me the most about Special A. It has no black horse, no tricks, no twists, and as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't even have sleeves, yet it still draws positive ratings from viewers. Special A is the dead basic rom-com. This is what every writer strives to surpass, because it's really that easy.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, where the Student Council President is a maid. Toradora!, where a boy and a girl have romantic interest in each other's best friends and help each other try to win their hearts. Oreimo, where it's quite possible that your lover is the otaku girl living in the room next to yours. How does it sound with Special A? \\n\\n\r\n\"Special A, where a girl goes to school.\"\\n\r\nIs that it?\\n\r\n\"No, her rival is also in the same club.\"\\n\r\nAnything else?\\n\r\n\"......they get good grades.\"\\n\\n\r\nYou think, okay, that's just about every other high school rom-com out there, but rom-com's have always shared the same generic format, the same elements, and in that essence, the same problems and situations. This would be like watching a sitcom on Disney Channel or Nickelodeon. They exist on different channels. They can switch up the characters all they want, but when it comes down to writing, they all use the exact same storyboard. For a high school rom-com, the typical format would be a girl that goes to school. She has some type of  issue relating to the male lead, but in the end, they end up together.\\n\\n\r\nWe know that's going to happen. We know that as soon as you show us the male and the female lead, they will end up together because there is honestly no other way it ends. What we're really interested in is how they get there or if there is any sort of twist that will distinguish this show from everything else, and offering nothing but the barebone story itself portrays lack of thought from the writers. Special A shows us the main characters. We know that they will end up together by the end of the series. We know the female protagonist has a problem with the male protagonist, and we have identified that as the main issue. However, since there is no twist or any supporting element that occurs alongside the storyline, that leaves us with the protagonists in a high school. Where's the fun in that?\\n\\n\r\nArt: I think the only reason why this show is even remotely distinguishable is the art style. The characters seem taller than average and anorexic due to their long, skinny limbs, but the backgrounds for each scene were really appealing. One instance, in particular, would be the scene between Akari and Tadashi, when they leave the school to \"see the night\". Otherwise, I don't think the animation has grown on me yet, nor will it ever grow on me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are as generic as generic can get. Not like a parody show or a satirical piece where characters can get away with being generic because they portray common stereotypes. In a rom-com, what's there to make fun of, and who is there to address anyways? That leaves, nobody. These characters aren't generic to prove a point or to make anybody laugh. They're generic, because that's just how they are.\\n\\n\r\nThis seems to explain their distinct lack of energy as well. For example, Hanazono Hikari, the series protagonist, is bright, energetic, and dense. If any of you have watched School Rumble, the protagonist Tsukamoto Tenma shares all of the same traits. They both play a role as their respective series' protagonist, but while Tenma has enough energy to literally BE the Energizer bunny, Hikari, for the traits used to describe her, could be more likened to a desert: flat, dry, and a comparable lack of life. I believe that characters portray the mood of a scene through their words and actions, but how do you expect the viewers to catch on if the characters seem to lack the spirit?\\n\\n\r\nAs you continue down the line, you'll begin to notice that every character in this show is more insignificant than the last, the secondary characters in particular receiving an elevated form of neglected attention. The Yamamoto twins, for example, lack presence in this series; two characters in the Special A club who supposedly make up the main cast who could be easily mistaken for secondary characters, which they aren't supposed to be. Sure, we're quite aware that the primary protagnoists are Hanazono Hikari and Takishima Kei, but let it be known that they aren't the only characters in this series. There are other characters with interesting side stories. Shed a little more light on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bear in mind that you are watching a show about perfect people living perfect lives with the perfect amount of wealth going to the perfect school, making this show difficult to relate to as a normal person. You can be jealous, envious, or vicariously living through the lives of these characters, but I'll be honest; I have better chances of relating to a giant blender fighting outer space aliens across all seven dimensions. I may be wrong on this one, especially because we're talking about characters that can break through the bottom of cooking pots with their palms, but for a show that doesn't acknowledge science fiction, fantasy, or supernatural elements, why do I get the feeling that the writer set up Special A to be some kind of \"superhuman fighting force from the distant future\"? Was it implied in the name or did the writer think his idea for a superhero show would get scrapped? A rom-com doesn't have to be a slice of life to be able to relate to it, but why is Special A so out of reach?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'll admit it. I enjoyed certain parts of this show, but if I wanted to rewatch any one of those scenes, I'd log into YouTube and find them myself. Even keeping that in mind, I'm absolutely certain that there are other shows with normal scenes much better than the ones found in Special A, so why would I rewatch them anyways? This leaves me back where I started, avoiding Special A altogether. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: In my eyes, Special A is average at best, marking the most standard rom-com on the market. The writing is Disney Channel sitcom generic, the characters were likely picked from a hat, the art might as well be an advertisement to the world's most effective weight loss program, and the comedy is as good as that time Jeff Dunham picked up a puppet and reminded everyone of the joke he made on the last Comedy Central special. I can hardly say that I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nRemember earlier when I said that rom-com's tend to be generic either by choice or because there is no other way? There's a reason why writers choose to be generic: some do so to play it safe and gather a guaranteed fanbase. Special A would fit that category of shows that are generic by choice.\\n\\n\r\nWhile writers take this route as an express ticket to quick profit (because writing is a difficult profession), a generic show is only average at best. Don't expect to engrave this show into the back of your head anytime soon.",

            "content": "This is my first review , so don't be to hard on me (as I will be on this anime)  :):\r\nSpecial A is another *of the numerous* \"school\" animes , so there are plenty of funny scenes , romance and other stuff that usually comes with this type of anime . And when there is romance , usually there is a \"baka\" person who doesn't understand the concept of love and love \"signs\" . Unfortunately that's the case here .\r\nThe story is about class Special A , in which only the best seven students of the school can go , and by coincidence (ornot?) six of them are from rich families (Does that mean that only the rich students are the smart ones??) . And if U wonder what those extra-smart students do at school all day , the answer is :\"They drink tea and eat sweets and cookies all day long\" :D . And then they wonder why the most of the students from the school hates them ....\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyway ... the focus is on the two main characters Kei and Hikari , and the 1000 ways of Kei showing Hikari his love for her , although she just can't get it . Kei is a typical cold guy , who works all day and night and don't have much time for fun , but somehow *I really wonder why?*  he is in love with Hikari and he tries in all possible ways to show her his love . But when U have a \"baka\" person as Ur \"opponent\" , it's almost impossible to archive Ur goal . The situation is similar to Kenji and Temna from School Rumble with some extra annoying scenes . \\n\r\nThe other 5 characters in Special A have their own stories and they are usually about some bad memories from their past or some weird sides of their personalities . But there are also some funny stories , although they are in minority here . \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is typical for this kind of anime , although there were some scenes where the characters would become all shiny and colored (usually in some romance scene) which annoyed me . The sound was pretty much ok . I didn't like the OP and ED , since it wasn't my type of music , so I just skipped them on each episode. The voice actors did a good job , and most of the voices fit with the characters (expect maybe for Kei's father).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime deserves a 6/10 . But if U like the \"baka\" type of girls U can add 2 or 3 grades to my score . Otherwise , I would recommend U to watch some other (and better) \"school\" animes like Ouran High School Host Club , Clannad or Lovely Complex.",

            "content": "This is one for fans of highschool romcoms. Its not a bad show but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are particularly a fan of the genre or really in the mood.\r\nSo Special A is everything you expect from a romcom, a bunch of affluent highschool students hang out with a single poor student, one of them is very popular with the ladies but hopelessly in love with our plucky but unaware heroine. We see them get places in a series of romantic situations but she just can't seem to get it. Some laughs are had along the way and I don't want to spoilanything but everything works out pretty well int he end.\\n\\n\r\nIn this series the extravagant private school they characters attend has inexplicably decided to devote considerable resources to giving the 7 top students an impressive glass greenhouse where they basically drink tea all day. Part of their gifted and talented program to encourage the top students to slack off all day I am sure. But somehow they all manage stay on top, and when I say on top I mean on top. They are the best at literally everything, boxing, PR, athletics you name it! Except for the occasional bad cooking gag they are pretty much perfect but its actually not too annoying, once you get used to the ridiculous premise that is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a bad show, don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable.  It can be funny at times, sometimes I was laughing with it sometimes I was laughing at it, but that's not always a bad thing, I did actually enjoy myself. I found the art style quite annoying. I got used to the weird long limbs but the male lead has these really weird eyes. He looks really cool in a single episode and I thought maybe things were looking up but maybe they just had a different artist, or maybe it was the black suit. In any case if you are particularly sensitive to art and that sounds like it could be annoying maybe just do an image search.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say for Special A is that unlike other shows of its genre the characters lives don't revolve around the female lead. The supporting cast has their own stuff going on and occasionally I found it even more interesting than the what the lead characters were doing. It felt a bit more interesting and full that way, and I quite liked that about this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the kind of show that you will enjoy if you enjoy watching plucky heroines and the rich boys that love them and kidnap them lovingly in their private helicopters. That's the kind of show it is and its a solid addition to the genre. But it doesn't stand out, and if it doesn't sound like your thing I would give it a miss.",

Watching two oddly paired people fall in love with each other sure was a journey. I didn't really enjoy it as much towards the end, although it had a pretty interesting ending. I was confused on how the anime ended, but after doing some research, I understand it. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe quality of this anime was amazing. The details of every little thing was included, and I absolutely loved the scenery. \r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nThe music was outstanding, and the voice actors / actresses did an amazing job of expressing their characters' personalities, especiallyKei and Hanazono. Kei really showed that he was serious most of the time, and Hanazono is a very joyful girl who just wants to be better than her rival, Kei. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe characters were very well animated and drawn. All characters were unique in their own little way, and also had very interesting personalities, especially Kei. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime, although I wished it was really centered only around Kei and Hanazono. This anime included many other love relationships between many other people towards the ending, and I was really looking forward to what would happen between Kei and Hanazono, of course, I figured that out at the end. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nOverall, ending... sad. I cried a little bit, but it had a happy ending, and made me smile. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "I tried to like this anime. I really did. I was so excited when they announced the Special A anime because I had been following the manga for so long. This manga has a lot of memories for me and I know that anime tend to add new things, take things out, and change up the story a little to meet the limitations of the time constraints, but it was just impossible for me to love this anime.\r\nIf I hadn't read the manga, I might've enjoyed watching this anime, but I agree, this anime really has nothing special compared to other student council anime (andthat includes the harem/ecchi ones!). \\n\r\nThe characters have a few note features that are from the manga, but it feels like they took out a lot of core elements to the characters and added whatever they wanted to fit. I have such an issue with the change in character stories as well. Was it necessary to give Kei a stupid background story for why he wanted Hikari's bento? Couldn't it just be that he wanted to eat her cooking? That's simple as it is and very sweet; perfect for a romcom, but no, let's make it less romantic and more childish. Oh, and another thing, Kei's personality just isn't right. It feels completely off the entire time. Instead of cool and collected, Kei just seems a little pompous--or maybe that's just the voice actor who plays him. I just feel like he lost a lot of his appeal as a male love interest. Hikari just seems kind of innocent, which is fine, but she lost a lot of other traits that made her so distinct as a main character.\\n\r\nI know a lot of things are changed for comedic effect or drama to keep the audience on their toes, but the manga's story was a lot funnier and the drama that does happen in the manga really hits you deep. This anime failed to execute any of it properly.\\n\r\nMaybe if I hadn't absolutely loved the manga, I would have enjoyed myself, but maybe I would have complained about the generic characters and lack of originality. Either way, I am not happy with this anime.",

            "content": "A romantic comedy that is very fun, light, and enjoyable.  \r\nStory: While there lacked a clear overall story, development in the relationships between characters linked the series as a whole.  The short stories covering blocks of episodes were very entertaining, allowing for the audience to see the dynamics between and the growth of the characters.  However, some of these short stories lack originality, but then again, the romantic comedy genre can easily be repetitious.  \r\nArt: Artwork for the anime is good and pretty consistent throughout.  The animation is still considered good even though I believe that the art of thisanime was not meant to be spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The seiyuus were well-matched with each character; they were able to bring the series to another level of humor and enjoyment.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There could have been more character development in this anime.  While the story did go briefly into each character's history, more background would have been useful and entertaining.  However, considering the genre and the lightness of the overall anime, the creators of the series did well in presenting the past and present character drama and issues.  The characters and their personalities were very well-suited for this series; the show contained typical characters: a louder, aggressive female with a calmer, smart-mouthed male counterpart.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series was very enjoyable and had all the necessary (and audience-wanted) elements for this genre.",

            "content": "When one sees visuals of &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; and reads that the main premise of the series follows the school days of a select group of intelligent, rich students at their prestigious school that has created an exclusive elite class for them called S.A., one can't help but to think of &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo;. Add the shared element that the wealth, insane levels of talent and skill that some of the members possess is often plastered all over the screen. The fact the group in &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; has one commoner among them, Hikari, quickly makes one think of Haruhi from &ldquo;Ouran High School HostClub&rdquo; to boot. \\n\\n\r\nHowever comparisons end roughly there as Hikari and Haruhi are quite different characters. The relationship between the &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; leading couple Kei and Hikari and the &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo; couple Tamaki and Haruhi also plays out differently, and although both anime series don't have an entirely conclusive ending regarding the main pairing, the relationship between Tamaki and Haruhi does feel just that bit better paced and played out.\\n\\n\r\nSpanning 24 episodes, &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; pulls the plot card of Kei and Hikari's love and possible relationship fairly soon in the series and even though enough episodes revolve around it, no real progress is made until the final episodes. Given that a large part of that is due to Hikari being totally oblivious to Kei's and her own feelings, her being an airhead about it may become annoying to some viewers. Especially since Hikari is no idiot but has excellent academic skills and is only dense about love, especially when it involves Kei and her own feelings.\\n\r\nSeeing several romantic pairings between the other characters form in the episodes in-between, perhaps it might have been better if they had only touched upon Kei and Hikari's relationship a bit later on so its pacing would not have been so slow.\\n\r\nLuckily the Kei and Hikari pairing is an unexpectedly good one. Childhood friends due to their fathers being acquainted, the straightforward and honest Hikari is a perfect match for the near emotionless genius Kei since she literally brings a ray of light in his else very cold and businesslike environment. No doubt that is why he has always loved her, she may not be of wealthy descent but she holds everything he lacks in that world. \\n\r\nThe added gimmick that Hikari sees Kei as her ultimate rival and is hell bent on beating Kei in whichever task or test they perform adds some uniqueness and is the source of many jokes. Though it gets a bit repetitive towards the end when Hikari seems to desperately grab on to seeing Kei as a rival in order to not have to face up to the fact she's in love with him and always has been.\\n\\n\r\nThe other members of the S.A each have their own distinct personalities which offsets their more generic visual appearance, or their unique quirks which in turn leads to scenes filled with laughter but also when brought at the wrong time, can seem a little annoying when it causes the series to switch from a serious tone to a humoristic one too fast.\\n\r\nThroughout the series, some other characters are brought forth as seemingly purely evil influences bent on hurting the SA group, but most are redeemed as the series progresses, though it is especially Yahiro that is initially brought front as a nemesis. \\n\r\nOne could say the final episode where Hikari pursues Kei makes it seem the rest of the cast are just dragged into it to show off their most common trait or role, but it also serves to show their group is a tightly knit band of friends that stands together. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the romantic pairings and story, what I most appreciated in &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo; is the continuous barrage of humor and jokes that could have one laughing through their tears. Next to the romantic elements &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; also delivers tons of humor and jokes, however it doesn't seem to really reach up the level of &ldquo;Ouran High School Host Club&rdquo;. In that, &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; is nice but not really special since it doesn't excel. It is a nice comedy, but not the best one out there.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation throughout the series is decent to good, save for several scenes where corners are cut or the animation drops slightly it's always enjoyable to watch and never drops far. Typical for such a romantic school comedy are the bright colors, stylish school uniforms and extravagant settings.\\n\r\nA welcome change is the more realistic hair colors of the main characters, it's always nice to see a series that can have a diverse cast of characters that sport realistic hair colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is generic for series of its genre, it does not really stand out but accompanies the scenes well. The OP songs are another matter, I must confess out of my own personal taste I found them both to be rather atrocious and soon skipped through them when watching an episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have not read the &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; manga so I can not say how the anime compares to it or how faithful an adaptation it is. \\n\r\nRegardless, &ldquo;Special A&rdquo; will be an enjoyable romantic school comedy for everyone that they will surely enjoy and have a lot of laughs each episode!",

This anime for me was a huge disappointment.\r\nSo you have this lead character with the resilience of superman, with the intelligence, charisma and wealth of Ironman and needless to say looks to match all in one cheesy shoujo manga basket. The female lead no matter how she tries to catchup with him does not succeed. While initially doing a good job of racking up the tension between the characters, thefailure to follow up and lack of closure leaves much to be desired. There is so little difference between the lead characters' abilities and the outcome so predictable that I could not help feel let down.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters at least had better character development, though they get just an episode or two at most per character. Throw in a bunch of mistaken malicious anti-hero and a trillion dollar powerful corporation who pulls no stops in getting our reluctant hero to take over the reins as the heir. Other animes such as Ouran high and Kaichou wa maid sama have a much better storyline in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up my verdict, the ranking was not a good indicator of the expectations I had from this anime. Wouldn't have missed anything by skipping this anime.",

            "content": "As you can see from my ratings I clearly hate this anime dearly. The only component I enjoyed was the character animations as it reminded me of CLAMPS characters designs. Other than that I cannot give this show anything else in particular that it excelled at.\r\nI have only seen 2 episodes, but that is all I require. I can easily predict how this anime is going to play out its mediocre storyline with egotistical characters who are so boring ESPECIALLY the main heroine. I honestly hate her so much that I cannot even recall her pathetic name. \r\nShe is one of the truly dense charactersfor the sole purpose to continue on with the pathetic romance that this anime is when clearly the protagonist has feelings of affection for her. Literally, the sole purpose of this anime is for Hikari(female heroine) to defeat Kei in whatever the contest may be. This obviously ranges from test scores(of course both are top of the school because that is original)to the amount of moves used in a boxing match. It is utter shit.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot stand this anime, which is exactly why I dropped it immediately after episode 2. I have seen enough anime to know which I will enjoy and which I won't, especially in romance. If you are like me and don't enjoy these pathetic anime series that is similar to Kimi to Todoke then watch Itazura No Kiss or Skip Beat with an ACTUAL story with characters that don't want you punching your screen.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly wish I never watched this anime because before I watched those 2 dreadful, wasteful, infuriating episodes my impression of the show was a positive one. I thought it looked like Bokura Ga Ita(which to be honest was still annoying with the characters love bouncing back and forth, still not as bad as Kimi To Todoke though) which appealed to me at the time.\\n\\n\r\nI know it is good practice to give an anime time to lay the foundations for the premise of the story and characters development, but I don't care. This anime is atrocious. If you are reading this review and have similar tastes to myself just stay away from this anime. Plenty of other QUALITY anime out there, don't waste your time here.",

            "content": "There are shows out there that many will experience where even though there are so many flaws in a show that you can point out, you can't help but love the show regardless. In my experience of watching anime, these shows are fairly rare, since normally my enjoyment correlates with how many or little flaws there are. Special A is one of these shows. Special A is one of those rare cases.\r\n One thing I really enjoyed about this show was it's pacing. Although it is probably the cause of some of the rushed parts of the show, the fast pacing never left me bored,and is probably the reason that it alleviates so many of this show's flaws for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe multiple settings are also a big part in keeping the show fresh. Even though we are following a bunch of high school kids once again, the convenience of having most all of them be filthy stinking rich keeps them moving from place to place. When they aren't having a conversation in their conservatory at school, they could be at a private island, someone's mansion, etc. Hell, they even go to both London and Hawaii. Although it would've been nice to have the characters explore those settings much more than they did, it was a nice change of pace than having a rom-com set in a high school for the ten-billionth time. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I'll mention about the story is how it tries to make light of some of the actual problems that higher class students may face. For example, having pre-arranged marriages to keep the family business afloat, people pretending to be your friends so they can have the taste of luxury, etc. These problems help the main cast (aside from Hikari, since she is from a working class family) from feeling like snobby rich kids, and this in turn makes them much more relatable.\\n\\n\r\nAs of now, I've been giving this show nothing but praise when I said there were a multitude of problems with it. This show does genuinely get some things right, as previously mentioned, but it also get's many things wrong as well, the latter more likely outweighing the former at points.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the dialogue. Almost half the dialogue is exposition, sometimes for scenes we have already seen. This isn't just annoying, but it makes it feel like the staff isn't taking it's source material or the viewer seriously. A lot of the other dialogue encompasses either the romantic/comedic parts of the show. While the comedy does have some brilliant moments here and there, a lot of it is just silly character quirks being played for laughs that are repeated over and over again. And while those brilliant moments of comedy are indeed hilarious at the time of viewing, I find myself hard-pressed to remember a lot of these scenes because they lack memorability. \\n\\n\r\nExcluding the main two leads, Hikari and Kei, the other five members of SA each consist of a few character traits, to the point that they just don't feel like real people. Granted, they do try put at least some focus on them, and sometimes it does work. Akira's backstory does feel melodramatic at times, but still managed to elevate her character enough so she wasn't just the really annoying tsundere, and her relationship with Tadashi is actually pretty compelling as far as secondary romances go. Ryu only really gets one episode focused on him, but that one episode was handled well enough to the point where I am content with it.\\n\\n\r\nYahiro, who serves as an antagonist (yes, a rom-com actually has some sort of main antagonist, even if it doesn't last) was one of things that this show handles exceptionally well. He is an absolute scoundrel at the beginning of the show, but throughout the entire runtime of this anime, he slowly becomes more and more acceptable (for lack of a better word) to the point where he becomes a likeable character and love interest for one of the main characters without feeling forced or rushed. His motives for his actions in the beginning make sense as well. He wasn't much of a villain in the end, but he was one of the only characters in this show to actually feel like a person.\\n\\n\r\nHikari and Kei, the main characters, were also good characters. Hikari herself is a very outgoing individual who always tries her hardest to make things right, or as Akira describes her, \"straightforward and pure\". She is incredibly dense, however, to Kei's feelings toward her, and while that didn't annoy me as much as it should have, I can see this as being really annoying for others. Her relationship with Kei was also very well handled as well. It was compelling, and there was a multitude of nice romantic scenes here and there.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I'll talk about Jun's backstory as well briefly. It's fucking stupid. I can't say what it is because it doesn't happen to well into the second half of the series, but it just plain doesn't make sense. I know a lot of this show breaks a lot of logic boundaries, what with Kei's godlike physical capabilities and whatnot, but I can handle that as it adds to the dynamic between Kei and Hikari, but Jun's backstory just feels like something they just randomly added in to give him some sort of depth, because other than that, Jun has no real personality. His romantic subplot was subpar as well because of how rushed it felt.\\n\\n\r\nNow, lets talk about what seems to be a hot topic when it comes to this show. The character designs. At first, I hated them. They looked like a shitty ripoff of CLAMP designs, take that as you will. I didn't understand why they looked so lanky, when a fairly major plot point early on was that both Kei and Hikari's dads were into pro wrestling. They are both extremely athletic and strong, so shouldn't that mean their bodies shouldn't look like sticks? That being said, I felt it was a jarring move when in the middle of the series, they decided to tweak the designs to look a little better. And while they did look technically better, I got used to those earlier designs, to changing them halfway through just didn't make sense to me. \\n\\n\r\nNothing else about the art or animation is that great, either. From the colour palette to the backgrounds to the movement of characters, everything about it was just average. There wasn't a particularly good looking scene ever in this anime, but there wasn't any bad ones either. Well, except when they did those really awful CGI panning shots that made everything look like you were seeing through a fish eye lens. There were only two of those in the whole series, so it's a minor complaint. Well, if you expect much from studio Gonzo anyways in terms of art and animation, most of the time you are gonna be shit out of luck.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the sound. When it comes to any sort of romance anime, I normally say that the music fit the show but it wasn't memorable. This time, I can't even say that. There was very little variety to the soundtrack, and there wasn't even a memorable piece in that soundtrack. Hell, a lot of the sound effects where just cheap sound bytes you've heard used a million times before. \\n\\n\r\nI normally never talk about Japanese voice acting in my reviews, mainly because I know nothing about it and I generally accept it as good all the time. I'm only talking about it now because both opening and ending themes were sung by each member of the main cast. Two of the songs were sung by the males, and the other two by the females. They were the only good parts about the sound in my opinion. It does sound like karaoke at times, but they for the most part they did a good part in those songs. And while I'm at it, they all did a very good job in their roles, with my standout performances being the voices of Kei, Tadashi, and Akira.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to it's title, Special A really isn't all that special. It does have some changes in it's setting to make it a little different from most, but when it comes to it, it is just another rom-com. But for some reason, I enjoyed almost every bit of it immensely. There are flaws littered throughout this show, but I just don't care. I can't recommend this show fully in good conscience because of these flaws, because I doubt many others will find it as enjoyable as I did because of them. However, if you are looking for a decently funny show with great romances (except for Jun's), and can look past the negatives I mentioned, give it a try. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I go, I have to mention one thing. The ending. There are some stupid things that happen in this show, but the very last scene of the last episode takes the cake. If you watched the show, you will know what I am talking about. It tries to make this really nice romantic scene which probably would have worked if they didn't do what they did. I know it sounds weird to people who haven't watched the show, but I want to avoid spoilers :P",

            "content": "Special A was a promising representative of the shojo genre. Was. Up until the seventeenth episode it was fun, cute, hilarious...everything a good shojo anime should be. The characters never escape the usual shojo mold, but still they were very likable and entertaining. Up until the seventeenth episode, I rated Special A with a subjective 9, because it made me smile, it made me burst into laughter, and because it was dynamic and simply fun. And I kept thinking: I can't wait to re-watch this one.\r\nHow did it tumble down to a pathetic 2?\r\nEpisode 17 -  24 were made. Then starts the downfall ofSpecial A. The story was concentrated on two main characters which suddenly lost their leading parts, and became \"those two who you would wanna see, but won't because we have to make more episodes\". Instead of dispersing the stories about the supporting characters, they shove them all together. This might actually be acceptable, if it doesn't happen as the series nears it's completion.\\n\r\nThe characters I liked, became annoying and idiotic. Hikari and Kei are supposed to be these exceptionally intelligent and capable characters, but with all the unnecessary playing around you just get the feeling they are a bit slow, and possibly somewhat challenged in the brain department. I mean, every other character realizes his/her feelings, but our two main characters remain adamant in their silence (Kei) or their blatant ignorance (Hikari).\\n\r\nAll in all, I'm pissed off. I regret they screwed up a potentially good anime. It could have been saved by a good ending. But no. The ending is so profoundly stupid and anticlimactic, that it subtracts from the overall grade.\\n\r\nI guess that's a problem when you make an anime out of an ongoing manga - you don't make it so it's great - you make it lacking so that the people feel the need for closure. Then those people think: \"Maybe I should pick up the manga.\" I'm going to be a sucker and do just that, because I'm dying to know if it's any good.\\n",

I don't particularly like anime that centers purely around romance without any other plot, and I usually despise shojo heroines because they're dumb and innocent and blush too much and are so starstruck I just can't deal with them. \r\nI prefer action heroines who kick ass, after all. \r\nI think I found myself a new Ouran High School Host Club in Special A. \r\nOuran is one of my favorite animes of all time, mostly because of the characters and group dynamic, which I found in Special A:and it made me really, really happy with the structure of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is interesting, with the arcs never taking more than two-three episodes before quickly moving on to maintain interest. The arcs don't fade into nothingness either-- instead, they sit on the backburner and show up later to create more fun plot twists. \\n\\n\r\nThe story deals with teenage love, friendship, protective and overprotectiveness, friendly competition, jealousy, and family problems all in one. The characters are fresh and interesting, with interesting dynamics between all of them. Each of them has special talents and traits that makes them unique and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed this anime much more than I should've, and I'll definetly be recommending it to other people and reading the manga as well!",

            "content": "\"Miss second place\", these are common words in this anime, but is the series capable of even reaching second place? I think so.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story revolves around a group of friends all in the \"Special\" class, some because of academics and skill, and some because of money, and some because of necessity. This story is one of romance which is something I don't really enjoy, but this series has a sweet childlike love to it that not many shows can match, it even got me supporting the main protagonist at the end; rest assured with the character arcs present here you'll get to appreciate each characterin this show.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThe art style is rather pretty, with lots of greens, whites, and well... natural, organic colors that's pleasing to the eye. It fall short some on the textures as they do look a bit low on the resolution scale, and some lines do need some more anti-aliasing; luckily it can be easily overlooked by the lovely art and vibrancy present.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe music complements the story and scenes well, nothing seems really out of place. Both the original voices and the dub are very nice, some however may be a bit harsh on Kikari as her voice some seem to be higher pitched than everyone else but I think it suits her characters personality.\\n\r\nNow lastly let me just touch on the opening and closing tracks for the show. The opening track I found rather underwhelming compared to the show, I think the actual video supporting it was much better, with the music acting like a crutch to the art present; the closing track however was spot-on, it was playful, fun, romantic, and really symbolised the show well, it made me want to watch the next one (although the endings of the show made we want to too of course).\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe cast of characters are not really well thought off, they're all basic archertypes; you've got your Mr perfect, the dumb competitive child, the shy singer, ect. For me however I forgot about how stereotypical they are as the scenarios they're put it give the characters some (a very small amount) of depth to them which more than makes up for it.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nIn case you cannot tell I enjoyed the show, it's one of my favorite romance stories out their; looking back on it the overall feel it reminds me of F.R.I.E.N.D.S (A very popular show back in the 90s). 100% recommend watching it.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n9/10",

Nakakilig si Kei nu? Ang sweet nya ke Hikari!\u201d \u2014> Translation: \u201cHey, did you watch Special A last night? Kei\u2019s so sweet with Hikari right?\u201d. I was really curious, so I tried watching an episode. I liked it too, but I didn\u2019t have the time to continue watching it because of my hectic schedule (this was way back in High School).\r\nHere comes my Summer Vacation from College! My boyfriend downloaded this anime forme because I was planning to write fanfiction this summer and it would be better if I know the original story from the Anime. I didn\u2019t expect that I was going to be so hooked with it.\\n\\n\r\nStory? The story was nice. It is an anime full of genres, and every episode is unexpected, it will really surprise you. The characters are usually growing and developing on every episode.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics? I don\u2019t comment much on the graphics, (since I\u2019m not really a very good art critic) but I think it\u2019s alright although the characters are thin or they all have the same body built. I also noticed the same usage of clothing on different episodes, and I find it quite simple though.\\n\\n\r\nLikes? The story, the variety of each characters from one another and the insertion of comedic relief on every situation. It doesn\u2019t bore me.\\n\\n\r\nDislikes? There is a rare development on every love story or the relationship between each love team. And the ending left me hanging. So I really expect a Season 2 or an OVA from this Anime. Swear, all those who have watched this anime want more right?\\n\\n\r\nSpecial A is an anime where you\u2019ll be learning, laughing, cherishing and crying.  You\u2019ll definitely enjoy it. No, it\u2019s not corny because of the love tandems around. It\u2019s really worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, Special A.. All I can say is, more please? I regret reading the manga 1st before watching the Anime because now I am expecting more! I\u2019ll give you an overall rating of 8! One of the best Anime I had watched, and one of my favorites. Suggesting this to all Anime fans! Be in love. :)",

A romantic relation should develop as a series progresses but that's completely lacking here. after watching a few episodes, u kinda get bored seeing hikari's acting. so move on to some other anime if u can.\r\nThe only god thing in this anime that i can say was the characters. all their story was what kept me pushing to finish off this anime. the humor level is ok though. if it was crappy,i would long ago deleted the series (like before 5 episodes). and the story is pretty childish too. its has a feel free go along with it flow, so if u dont like it, it does nothing to convince u. if u felt a particular episode to be boring, no assurance that the next oe will be good. that's how it is or we can say that's how the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nhope u found my review helpful XD",

            "content": "This is primarily going to be a deliberate rant about how much I hated the Special A dub, and this is coming from someone who only watches dubs. The anime is fine by its own right, so I'm not gonna delve too deep into any elements other than the voice acting. I'm just gonna briefly rate the other elements, and that's it.\r\n----------\r\nSound: 0\r\nI have several problems with this dub. The first being Andrew Love, a voice actor that specializes in deep voices is the voice of Tadashi. Oh, hell no. There's plenty of other voice actors in the Houston area that could fit the bill.Like Adam/Scott Gibbs, for instance. \\n\\n\r\nThe second is the sheer fact that Brittney Karbowski and Shelley Calene-Black are used for practically every single female extra. You should never cast two voice actresses with highly distinct voices to play as extras. It's extremely grating to hear the same voice over and over again. There's no variety, texture or taste in that at all.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, Clint Bickham is cast as Sui, Hajime AND Satoru. Multicasting is not a problem if the voice actor could differentiate their performances to make them sound distinct, but this? God no. Clint barely sounded different with these three roles; it's even worse with Sui and Satoru because they're father and son.\\n\\n\r\nFourthly, going back to Brittney, not only is she practically cast as every female extra, but her performance of Chitose was absolutely HORRENDOUS! It is, quite honestly, the WORST attempt at a male kid voice performed by a female. Hell, Brittney's male roles in other dubs (Black Star in Soul Eater, for instance) are kind of bad, too. The thing is, Brittney's voice just isn't suited for male roles, kid or teen. Doesn't help that one of the male teen extras (He's one of Hajime's lackeys, if I recall correctly) was voiced by Britteny as well, and honestly? It sounds like a female trying too hard to sound like a male. If anything, it sounded like an older woman more than anything else.\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nConclusion: Special A is a good anime if it had better voice acting; something it obviously doesn't have. While the acting is fine, the horrendous casting choices mentioned above makes it impossible for me to rate it higher than a 0. Special A is one of Sentai Filmworks's worst dubs. Only reason why I finished the dub is because I'd rather understand the context by ear than read subtitles. That, and I don't like the Japanese language. Either way, I won't recommend the dub to anyone that's new to the show. If you're ok with subs, it's better to just watch it subbed.",

I figured since my sister was obsessed with this anime it couldn't be that bad, however i was right to stay away from this anime the first time I saw it and after watching nine cringe worthy episodes I've decided to drop this anime. However I want all to know this is my own opinion and I hope I don't deter people from watching this anime based on my opinion alone. Like I stated before my sister enjoyed this anime so I'm suresome people out there will find it enjoyable but for the people out there who hate animes that are based on stupid cliches ( with the exception of Ouran High School Host Club :D) then you should stay far away from this anime. The only thing I enjoyed from this anime was the art however everything else happened to fall flat, the characters were boring and unoriginal with the exception of a few funny characters, but not even they were able to keep my enjoyment up for long. The main character Hikari was annoying and very dense to the point it was too much for me, not even the good looking bishies were enough to keep my attention. The story just falls flat after the first couple of episodes and doesn't manage to gain my attention even after seven more episodes. So my overall score was a 6/10.",

            "content": "I like Hikari a lot. Hikari is a high-school teenager who is in permanent competition with Kei, a boy whom she had known since their childhood. I repeat myself: I like Hikari a lot because of her fired-up spirit; she is a very energetic person, who wants to develop, to improve herself and her way of testing her evolution is to compete with Kei.\r\n\tIt is so amusing to me to see what kind of challenges Hikari invents so that she could measure up with Kei: Who does get the greatergrades? Who can run faster? Who can jump higher? The answer is the same for all questions: Kei. So, Hikari is the permanent \u201cMiss Rank Two \u201c.\\n\\n\r\n\tBut still, Hikari doesn\u2019t lose hope; every time she seems to be more motivated to achieve what she wants. Hikari herself admits that if Kei succeeds by only trying once, she will succeed by hard work. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhat I find admirable in Hikari\u2019s character is her noble personality: she is very kind, very polite; even though she is in the elite class of her school, she doesn\u2019t look down on anyone from other classes. She treats everyone equally, she tries to be of use as much as she can and she helps every person that calls for her. She is pure, and maybe this innocence of her can be confused sometimes with stupidity. But still, she gives the world a magnificent view: full of life and happiness.\\n\\n\r\n\tBecause the world can be seen different through her eyes, Kei falls for her. He, an introverted guy, with many international prizes won at a very young age, he, a boy who supports his family\u2019s business, he, a teenager who is top 1 in his school, feels that something in his heart trembles. He realizes that he wants Hikari to be safe; that\u2019s why he helps her no matter what.\\n\\n\r\n\tAt the beginning, Kei hided pretty well his feelings for Hikari: always annoying her because she was always the loser of their challenges; but Kei, opened up to Hikari. Although he received a delayed response from Hikari, Kei was happy because the girl felt the same way for him.\\n\\n\r\n\tI like this story; it\u2019s so pure, funny and deep. The good part is that this show has more than my review reveals. So, watch Special A Class. It is an anime that deserves your attention.   \\n",

            "content": "First, I would like to mention that a score of five on my scale means 'average' and not 'awful - don't watch ever!!!'.\r\nMany comedies rely on characters' stupidity or misfortunes, raised to absurd levels, to produce the comic effect. Since I don't like these approaches, and don't find those things funny, I tend to stay away from comedies. Since SA characters were supposed to be extra smart, extra fast, extra strong, etc, I hoped this show would have a different approach to comedy - otherwise why the hell make the characters like that.\r\nIt turned out that the only reason the characters are like that isto explain the rivalry between Kei and Hikari. True, this rivalry is important, however, considering the characters are only supposed to be smart, but  their actions are generally stupid, except Yahiro and maybe Takishima's, the rivalry point also falls apart somehow. I have to admit, the characters are as strong as (actually, a lot stronger than) they are supposed to be, but this is also overused.\\n\\n\r\nSo while they are presented as extraordinary, most of the characters are typical and their actions are more or less clich\u00e9d. They have their good moments, though, so I would class them as average (5)\\n\\n\r\nThis paragraph will mention a little about the romance. It will include some spoilers. To mask them, so that you wouldn't accidentally read them, I will put them in {brackers} and insert some letters 'u' randomly. I have to say, the story is worse than typical {tuhue cuhuauraucutueurs fuaull in luouvue, tuhuueuy stubbornly duouunuuu't cuouunuufueusuus tuhueuir feueuluiunugus until tuhue uvueuruy ueunudu, aunud tuhuis cuauuusueus puruoubulueumus bueutuwueueun them; what's more, this happens nuout ounuluy fuour ounue, but fuour tuwuo of the cuouuupulueus in the show}. For a typical romance story to be good, you need good characters. Since in our case they are average, the story would be average at best. Unfortunately, this story is worse than typical, and with average characters driving it, I have to rate it below average - at most 4. It's execution was funny enough to deserve a 4, though.\\n\\n\r\nI won't comment the art and sound much, as I don't usually pay them special attention. They weren't annoying and did a good job setting the mood, which I find a good enough achievement to rate at least 7, but never impressed me, so not good enough for an 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an average show - enjoyable if you have nothing better to do and not dull enough to drop, but nothing more than that. I wouldn't advice you against watching it if you like romantic comedies, but I wouldn't recommend it either.",

Everything was great, right down to the last sketch and I felt it compulsory to write a review.\r\nStory:\r\nWell, you have probably already read the basis on it.  It is a funny, and clever twist on school life, and shows you how determination can get you anywhere.\r\nThe plot was good, and it was set out episode by episode in a fantastic sequence.\r\n/The story itself was heart warming and never failed to make me laugh.  Even in a serious episode, it still made me chuckle, which I think is agood sign.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI like this kind of anime style, its realistic, but still a cartoon-ish drawing.  The eyes are cute on girls, while boys have more of a serious vibe coming off them.\\n\r\nThere are scenes where the characters look either really weird, or just so life-like (for a cartoon) that I've said to myself \"Wow, how is anyone THAT thin?\" or \"OMW she looks SO real!\"  But usually, it just looks great, and normal.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI think the sound on this anime is absoleutly incredible, the voices match the character perfectly and every beat, line and pitch is delievered exactly how it should be.  The voice actors have done an amazing job with this anime, and I'm pleased to say, its perfect.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters (excluding some CERTAIN characters!) are very lovable, funny and well, unique.  \\n\r\nTheir each individual personalities fit in so well with the others, yet they are so different at the same time.\\n\r\nEach character holds their own special talent and unique ability that is so precious and super, really.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n(I only gave it a 9, because of a certain character >",

            "content": "They say that you can't judge a book by its cover. Although I think that hardly relates to the matter at hand (ie: watching an anime series), in some ways I was surprised to find that the principle still works.\r\nUnlike many other series I've seen, I felt this strong aversion to the anime having already read the manga and been satisfied with it. When I started watching the series, for the first time ever, I actually wanted to drop it rather than to continue watch the panel zoom to Kei's face as his eyes widen when he gets \"caught off guard\" by Hikari's comments 7+times every episode and then see that trippy white-with-glowing-colored-lights-background at each romantic moment. Way to ruin what I thought was a great manga.\\n\\n\r\n- - -\\n\\n\r\nSTORY AND CHARACTERS:\\n\r\nOkay, my comments so far haven't been very favorable for this anime, but I don't think here is the place it gets better. I was disappointed in the anime particularly in the earlier storyline because I felt that it cut most of the points which I found made this series so much better than the rest. The manga depicted Kei as a cool and collected guy who is prepared for anything (mostly to appeal to those bishonen lovers out there who like that \"distant\" feel... but whatever) yet if he's really like that, why is it that he's caught off-guard by every stupid remark Hikari makes that seems mildly intelligent? \\n\\n\r\nWait, moreover, why are all of Hikari's comments so dumbed down in the first place? Like Kei's character, I feel that Hikari's character changed from what it was in the manga as well. At least in the manga she seemed to be a \"rival\" to Kei. She could stand up for herself more often and didn't end up blushing and crying for every little thing. The anime depicted her as much more of the typical good-for-nothing-but-talking female lead. It was mainly due to Hikari and Kei's personalities that annoyed me enough to consider dropping the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, I decided to go through with it and simply skip those long, boring and very pointless staring contests that Hikari and Kei seemed to enjoy having. I figured it would be pitiful and I would get tired of skipping over half the episode in this way eventually. To my surprise (yes, I was surprised though I'm sure you who reads this review won't be) the episodes really did get better. It spent more time focusing on the rest of the Special A members (even elaborating on things that weren't covered in the manga)  rather than on the main couple which I found a refreshing change. In the latter half of the series I found it much more difficult to skip any scenes because they were all pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nNow that my long rant about the storyline is over, time to revert to my minor comments. The art seemed quite good to me. Although I'm no pro, I prefer anime art styles such as this one which involves simple yet defined colors to distinguish the characters from the backgrounds. At first the extremely long figures annoyed me (and greatly reminded me of CLAMP's work, Tsubasa Chronicles) but as time went on I think I adjusted to it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nAgain, I'm no expert with sound but I found it to be pretty good. I liked the opening and ending songs and (with the exception of maybe Kei) I found that the voice actor choices fit the characters pretty well.\\n\\n\r\n- - -\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think that this anime is worth being recommended to watch. It's not perfect, but perfection is quite difficult to come by anyways. If you do watch this anime I recommend doing as I did and skipping through the pointless scenes if you lose interest because the later episodes ARE worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nThis is late to be saying this but, of course, this is a shoujo anime with a mix of romance and comedy so I recommend it for those interested in that. The setup of the storyline made me relate this anime to other manga such as Hana Yori Dango, Hana ni Arashi, Kaichou wa Maid-sama and such, so if you liked those it may be worth a try. I think that's about it then. Enjoy~",

It sort of reminded me of Ouran HSHC... and of course since it did, I immediately fell in LOVE with it.\r\nWell, Special A (or SA) is about this rivalry between a girl and a boy (Hikari and Kei), wherein the guy always seems to beat the girl in all contests the girl challenges the guy with. Ah! But here's the catch: the guy likes the girl whilethe girl is DENSER THAN LEAD to even know the guy's feelings :P Cute, I know...\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, having read the manga, I liked the anime just as much as(if not more than) the manga. I suppose with such a short run (just 1 season, standard number of episodes for a single anime season (24)), you have to be a bit creative with how to present the story. And it did this SO WELL, in my opinion, since it covers a lot of the romance and pairings that took quite a bunch of chapters to develop, and somehow squeezes it in that short amount of time without it feeling TOO rushed. (Although Kei to me seems a bit...er desperate, as compared to his manga self) \\n\\n\r\nThere are of course some differences (but I think they work!) in the anime as compared to the manga, but if I go on about all of it, this review would be meaningless. Better you just read AND watch to decide! Also, I enjoyed that Host Club episode! The manga doesn't have it! Well sort of does, but not like in the anime!\\n\\n\r\nI feel a little sad though that Ryuu didn't get his pairings (which are in the manga)\\n\r\nMy favorite characters have to be Ryuu, Jun, Tadashi, Kei (his faces are just...priceless!), Megumi (Independence Day Attack-voice!), the school president (although he also annoys me), Kei's dad (ehehe) and I suppose Hikari is good too (since she's so hardworking..but her utter denseness annoys me).\\n\\n\r\nI however am so angry with the fact that Aoi was portrayed here as someone like \"the devil's advocate\", (with Kei's ojisan being the devil) because in the manga, his motives are better explained, and he is redeemed (will in my book anyway! He's one of my fave characters :P)",

At no point does it ever really try to be original or break of its shell, nor does it ever need to.\r\nA lot of the appeal to me is how straight-faced it presents its ridiculousness. At one point there's a subplot of OH MY GOD WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO CLASS AND NOT DRINK TEA IN THE GREENHOUSE ALL DAY. At no point does anyone treat this like a joke. They are legitimately mortified. And that is funny on its own. Special A's tendency to take its own hilarious stupidityseriously hits a really strong note with me.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Kei suffer is fun. He is a jerk and it is infuriating watching him be literally The Very Best At Everything Ever With No Effort. His constant romantic failures never fail to make me happy inside, even after a rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nI found the other characters attractive and easy to root for despite their ridiculously out-of-touch problems. Watching them interact with each other is fun and that is what matters. They're not exactly bastions of complexity, but they don't need to be to make the series work.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine but not really that distinctive. The soundtrack is completely unmemorable with a single exception that you'll know when you hear, and even that song is more tied with the moment it plays in.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe my interpretation of this series as a deliberately straight-faced parody isn't what was intended. But watching the series through that lens makes it really funny to me and hell, I was even a little moved a couple times. If you too are ready to embrace the cliche, you'll probably have a lot of fun watching this series.",

Even still, theguys that fell for them were perfectly matched too (and no matter the relationship the guys figures out that he's in love first). The anime starts off nice and light, throw in a few cringe-worthy moments of embarrassment, a whole lot of heart and a bit of a tragic past for each character and you have it all! not sure why I can't seem to give this a perfect 10, but it was dang near close.

            "content": "A ranking system, based on grades. The top 7 get treated elegantly and specially, now who would want that? Well, I do, because that would motivate me to actually study.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSpecial A is the type of anime that doesn't have a lot of story. It starts off really slow, but picks up its pace and goes full speed at the end. I know some people are thinking, \"Wow, that sounds boring\" but you're half right, half wrong. The main aspect that I liked about this anime is the romance side. It's very sweet and light hearted, and a lot of relationships build up in thisanime. The comedy was mediocre, as there weren't a lot of jokes. The funniest part I would say about this anime is Megumi's facial expressions and what she says on her sketchbooks. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was somewhat decent and the first time I saw the anime, I thought that this anime was produced around 2006-7. The colors in the anime are actually nice, and the animation was somewhat ok. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSince it's a 24 episode anime, there's bound to be at least 2/3 OP and ED. In my opinion, I liked the 2nd OP the most. No idea why, but I thought it fit the anime nicely. To me, the first OP sounded like it was sung by someone who just woke up and had no desire to sing. The first ED was above average, as it fits the role of being the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character in the anime is very unique and fit their own roles.\\n\\n\r\nKei Takashima, the most talented man in the anime owns the Takishima Group. He's very wealthy, athletic and good looking. He's also very hard-working, kind and always thinks mostly of Hikari and sometimes the other SA members about their safety. 1st in SA.\\n\\n\r\nHikari Hanazono, the average girl and the only one who isn't rich in the SA group. Hard-working and always wants to see everyone smile and not be sad. Though, I hate the type of people who would pry into everyone's issues. Very athletic and smart. 2nd in SA.\\n\\n\r\nJun Yamamoto, a very quiet and anti-social person. He does not like to be with any girls except for his twin sister. 3rd in SA.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi Yamamoto, a girl who barely talks in the anime and uses a sketchbook to communicate with others. In my opinion, my favorite character in the anime. She has funny facial expressions and what she writes on her sketchbooks can sometimes be funny too. 4th in SA.\\n\\n\r\nTadashi Karino, the idiot of the anime. Of course, when the character is voiced by Shimono Hiro, you automatically think the character is a massive idiot. He likes to eat food and is very dense romantically. Though, he can be helpful sometimes. 5th in SA.\\n\\n\r\nAkira Toudou, the cook in SA and likes to hit Tadashi whenever he does something that annoys Akira or goes with other girls. Of course, she's a tsundere. She's obsessed with Hikari, a lot. 6th in SA.\\n\\n\r\nRyu Tsuji, the animal-loving freak in the anime. Though, he can be very calm and he is basically a father-figure to Megumi and Jun. He cooks for them, cares for them and does anything a father can do for their child. He also has a fighting nature, but in a violent way. 7th in SA.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though I put the anime on hold for nearly half a year, after coming back to it, I actually enjoyed it. The comedy and romance, they both fit together in the anime. I would find myself skipping to parts of the episode if it gets too boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA light-hearted, somewhat funny anime. Hikari and Kei resemble both Usui and Misaki in the anime Kaichou-wa Maid-sama! in my opinion.  Would I re-watch this anime? Maybe not.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Special A is based off of two main characters, a boy and a girl, one extremely talented and the other one is innocent, maybe too innocent in fact. These two characters are Takashima Kei, and Hanazono Hikari. Our story starts off when these two are children, Hikari the girl practices martial arts with her father and enjoys beating up other people. She builds great confidence over her victories, too much confidence. Until, one day Takashima Kei, the boy is shown by her father and asks to have a sparring match. Hikari is confident that she will win, especially because of Kei's face and size, underestimatingKei, Kei easily defeats her with ease and puts almost no effort in crushing Hikari's confidence. Afterwards, Hikari challenges him again is once again destroyed by Kei. Special A begins after they grow up etc etc, and Hikari swears that she will one day defeat Kei. Enough of the main characters, Special A is about a group of seven elite members and how they help each other to keep their group together.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much of a real story to this but I find it entertaining to watch especially Kei, he's a total badass super genius almost robot like guy with little emotions. Each episode has it's own small story and many interesting scenes, it's more of a light hearted story with comedy in between and a bit of romance and how each Special A member contributes to helping each others problems.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow if you've watched Special A at all, you'll be wondering, are you serious? A 9 for the art? I agree with you, it's not that fancy or wonderful, however, each episode has a special part where each character will \"glow\" or two characters will \"glow\" together showing off a special moment between these two and I think it was an excellent way to display the scene, you'll understand what I mean when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is not really anything special, but there were moments where the sound effects were awesome and it really displayed the scene well. It had it's moments but overall the sound it decent and there isn't anything super special, except for maybe when megumi sings or when Hikari is sick, best moment of the series at least in my opinion ;). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the BEST part of the entire series, each character has their own unique personality, you've got the genius, the guy with gynophobia, the idiot, the girl who always seems to be beating up that one guy. But, personally Kei, my absolute favourite in the series, his intellect, badass, and abnormal strength and literally defying laws of physics or even life, I won't spoil it but you'll know what I'm talking about when you see him in action. Hikari, is a bit of an idiot or maybe a total idiot in fact, however she has this pure aura about her and Hikari is the only one that can \"move\" Kei and get him to show emotions. Nonetheless, she is an interesting character. You'll learn about each the character's and I'm sure you'll end up loving one of them at least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with a strong plot, unfortunately you've took the wrong path, however if you're interesting in a simple light hearted series with a badass main character and some comedy mixed in between, as well as friendship then you'll be enjoying this series I think at least ;). This anime definitely had it's flaws, but it's also got it's moments, I never found myself bored with this anime and I hope you'l enjoy it as much as I did :).",

            "content": "WARNING: First review. You're warned, don't lie about it.\r\nSpecial A. You could think that this is an ordinary Shoujo anime - which isn't really a mistake - but It actually has some really interesting used elements what makes this beloved anime for girls really more enjoyable for us.\r\nYou might wondering why I would recommend this anime? If you're a guy, I would say that you're just on the wrong place, provided that you like typical shoujo romance anime, Gomen'nasai. Look, if you are just bored and don't know what to watch, this anime would be fitting your situation. It is really simple minded and nota really deep story. \\n\\n\r\nThe main element which is high ranked in this anime is character development. Besides the whole storyline this is the most important thing in the anime. Beside that it is all about our typical rival/love standard en some side characters.. Lets take a look at the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo it is about a girl named Hikari. She wants to beat her rival, named Kei. He is better in almost everything she is good in. (Only thing he can't beat her is in cooking the worse, for sure) The only reason that she comes to their school is to beat Kei. \\n\r\nIn school they have different \"levels\" that are based on scores. So you have F to A and the \"best of the bests\" are in class Special A. They count seven pupils. Each one has his or her own rank place. The best is first, the less best in S.A (Special A) is of course seven. And well.. Guess what? First place we have Kei Takishima, and second place \"Miss Rank Two\" is Hikari Hanazono. So her biggest \"dream\" is to beat him and become first place.. But it is easy to say, hard to exercise. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is really easy, but easy isn't always something negative. The romance is probably a good thing about this anime. It is really based on it and the main genre, I think. It is good executed and I loved each pairing in this anime. Our main pairing, Hikari and Kei was really cute and how their relation developed was cute and interesting in many ways. But I have to confess something, their were two couples in this anime I liked more than our main couple. But that is personal taste in developing, so let's give it not that much spotlight. \\n\r\nI also laughed alot of times. I love slapstick in animes and this anime has a lot of this kind of comedy. Well.. What else can I say? I cannot complain about anything. \\n\r\nONLY thing I have in mind is that some characters do have a lot of development (Kei, Hikari, Yahiro, Akira) and some of them have a little bit of it or really weak development (Mainly talking about our twin, actually) and I wanted more interactions with them instead of too much screentime for our main two. I mean.. In MAL they are labeled as main too.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't make me mad in a good or bad way. It is just an ordinary kinda Shoujo rom/com. The character designs do fit their personality and are just good. The colouring is great and I loved some of their special effects besides the original art. Only problem - I know many of us have the same problem - is that they look ways too skinny and have really strange legs. But hey, like I'm better in drawing and animating? No.. Just no. So I don't have to complain because it is something I cannot reach, even not in thousand years with my zero percent talent in drawing. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was mostly really fitting the situation. You has some really funny and energetic mentions and funny but quiet beautiful piano pieces, but nothing special. I loved both openings and endings, mainly because it is sang by the characters itself. I was later mentioned it, so not only that was making it funny. Just the songs are really catchy and cool, I just loved them. But as I said again, it was not blowing me away or something. Just great.\\n\\n\r\nProbably my favorite part, the characters. I can say I have good feelings about this one. The characters in this anime are really likable and I can't really name a girl or boy that really do pissed me off. But YES, I have an opinion about some of the characters. Because I didn't like everyone with the same passion.\\n\r\nLet's start with Hikari. She is the main girl character. She is this really kind, energetic girl and is really competitive. She always cares for others and her dream is to finally beat Kei. I liked her, but not with a big passion. Her relation with Kei was really adorable too, as I mentioned before. Sometimes her situation was just kinda overdramatic and I just couldn't put myself in her shoes. And her voice was annoying sometimes too.. But besides that, nothing wrong with er.\\n\r\nOur second one is Kei. Okay, to be honest sometimes I am just not a girl. Of course I watch shoujo romcoms, but not for \"the hot guys\" and.. I have a strange opinion about what kind of guys I like. Kei was that type of guy that is not really interesting, just made labeled \"hot\".. wel.. In my opinion. Of course everything was cute and stuff, but I wasn't really attracted to him or did really like him. But of course I did not hate him.\\n\r\nThe twins was a point of cuteness. I loved them both and Megumi is so adorable. I also loved her relationship with Yahiro in the end. Although it was kinda out of nowhere, I did enjoy it. Yahiro was another hot view to excite the female readers and watchers, but he was not a really cool character actually. Meh, I did not hate him but I didn't feel bad for him either, I just didn't care about him that much. Tadashi was our comic relieve, in my opinion. Just there in the show to make me smile. I also really loved him and his relation with Akira, but I saw it coming so I was shipping it since the first episode. Then we have Ryuu, our animal lover. He was really cute, although he had not that much development and was the less interesting and important character in the anime. DON'T ATTACK ME FANGIRLS. And at last we have Akira, she is this typical tsundere character, and really loves (almost in a romantic way sometimes) and I can't help loving her. But that is personal taste, because I totally understand why you would hate her. Because she is really fast pissed off and always sulks at Kei and Tadashi. But I really liked her.\\n\\n\r\nWell.. As you noticed, I really enjoyed watching this anime. It was just simple and my favorite genre is romance. Because I am really passionate in it, this was giving me an enjoyable area and I have only watched this anime with a bright smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love shoujo romcoms with likeable characters and development, this anime is our perfect match! So.. I definitely would recommend this anime.",

            "content": "Special A is definitely one of the best anime everyone will watch. It may sound cliche as it seems because it's a shojo romance. I also at first find this anime a bit boring because of the Special A only have persons who have the best grades in the cohort. But as I dwell deeper into their lives, I realised that there is something more interesting than just having good grades. They have their personal problems and they deal with it very well. \r\nThey really learn how to make good use of love not like the cast from School Days who abuse love. In fact,the cast really developed a lot from annoying characters to understanding and caring characters. That was what I like to see.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the story starts off as generic but skyrocketed up to great perfection and the characters and plot have very great depth. I believe that these characters really put in faith and determination in what they do to make Special A very special to them and to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, Hikari sees Kei as rival, but as time develops Hikari and Kei started to like each other. Basically, there are 3 favorite characters in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt was very good to see that love takes time to develop and Special A really handles relationships very well. In fact, I love to see more flashbacks and development of other characters like Ryuu Tsuji.\\n\\n\r\n#1: Ryuu Tsuji (He does better when he is not worrying a lot about his twins, Jun and Megumi)\\n\\n\r\n#2: Megumi Yamamoto (She reminds me of Kukuri from 11eyes. She is quiet, calm and is not a hindrance even to Yahiro, whom she loved in the end)\\n\\n\r\n#3: Kei Takishima (He might be quite boring due to the fact that he does things perfectly, but inside him, he brings fun and joy and teases Hikari. He is also a nice person.)\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was really well done which deserves a 9.\\n\r\nThe art and sound were equally good and they both deserve an 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with this anime is that some of the side characters never get fully realised. My favorite character is Ryuu Tsuji, he is an interesting character but sadly he doesn't have enough episodes focus on him. In fact I would love to know more about him.\\n\\n\r\nFor this anime, I am very lenient when it comes to slice of life anime genre. This anime is really a very good factor and mixing both elements of slice of life and romance from Clannad, Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi, Kaichou wa Maid sama. In fact, Gonzo really did a good job in this part. Even though you may find that these characters annoy you, try watching more episodes and you will see that the characters are actually have more depth in it and you will find that they really are likeable.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that I learn a lesson from this anime saying \"Humanity is never perfect but humanity has something special inside them\".\\n\\n\r\nSpecial A will remain special in my life.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I give it an 8.",

The face and body animation  composure is not proportional. the anime characters  (leaving Kei), don't look appealing as they are in the manga. Akira looks really bad in the anime and the others look fairly OK(somehow i feel  it)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nthe music is really classy and goes according to the mood. its like a typical shojo score !Quite nice music is given for the elite situations and the funny scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nAll the chara have a great role and are drafted quite nicely.

            "content": "I\u2019ve been rewatching some shojo that I really enjoyed when I first started getting into anime, and Special A happened to make that list. Unfortunately, this anime has a lot of flaws that I didn\u2019t see when I was in middle school! It\u2019s a fun romance if you\u2019re younger or just getting into anime, but after seeing quite a bit of shojo, this anime has a lot going against it. \r\nFor one, characterization is lacking, especially for surrounding characters. In other shows with similar dynamics, such as Ouran or Maid-Sama, the background characters have a lot more depth compared to the cast in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is slower-paced, making some of the episodes drag, and Kei, the main love interest, puts all the responsibility on Hikari to discover his feelings for her. (Spoiler: she can\u2019t read minds!) This is charming for about three episodes. It\u2019s hard to sympathize with the male lead when he makes no attempt to convey his feelings, yet gets frustrated at being misunderstood. \\n\\n\r\nIn Maid-Sama, the closest comparison for me to this show, at least Usui Takumi makes it more obvious he has feelings for Ayuzawa and appears more patient with her denseness. Kei barely does anything besides looking shocked when Hikari does something he likes, or seems pissed off/possessive on the flipside, giving Hikari (and the viewers) emotional whiplash. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the underdeveloped characters, the frequent, more serious turns in the plot just cannot be taken seriously. The humor in this show is the strong suit, but with the plot developments, the conflicts are cheesy, over-the-top, and fairly transparent. There are also some classist undertones that go unaddressed/can\u2019t be offset by the main characters. In Ouran, Haruhi\u2019s character offered the \u201ccommoner\u201d point of view, which worked well to humor and ridicule the portrayed aristocracy. There is no such character in Special A, often making the plot about rich people being rich. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this criticism, Hikari is not the MOST annoying lead in shojo. The humor and cute moments made me remember why I thought this show was so charming. Though I don\u2019t think my opinion of it is very high, objectively, it could be fun for a shojo-lover.\\n",

            "content": "So this part will be up to the point where I am right now as it's a 24 episode.. \r\nEP 9:\r\nOverall: Honestly at the moment I'm have some many mixed emotions about Hikari, most times she's getting on my last nerve and it just makes me want to stop watching all together but I'm draw back in by the other characters surrounding her.. I heard a good statement from episode 9 recently, \"You're an idiot who relies on brute force\". To be honest I agree and then some.. She is so dense and for a romance series she ruins every 'romantic' that goes on. She'sclueless so far and it's painful to watch. That's basically my only and biggest problem so far. I like the art for it even though it's little \"uncut\" if you know what I mean,, It doesn't look right for some reason. Sound I'm not to bothered about, as long as it sounds good I don't care.. Characters I really like Kei and the mysterious side to him and his past! I hope he has a really good backstory to go with him. Everyone else seems well thought in.. I also just noticed how unrealistic this series is so far.. I feel like it's meant for the younger ages!\\n\\n\r\nAs I've now finished the full series I pretty much have nothing new to say.. Even though the ending was a lil bit iffy? It was still a good watch.. I don't think Hikari and Kei's relationship and emotions were that much shown and felt like it was rushed towards the end.. The ending could of gone a different way but I understand why they went that way.. It could even possibly go into a season 2, but that would be just stupid.. Everything was pretty much explained and the story came along! I would of loved alot more backstory to other characters as well as the main characters.. For a 24 episode series I was expecting that but it never really came, I love backstories and think everyone should include them into a anime.. especially if it's going to be one like this where a lot of different types of people come into it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'd recommend this series if you're not a hardcore romantic anime type person.. You will not find extreme romantic moments in this! You will find parts where they make it awkward for the female lead and parts where they just throw their arms around or explode when they get embarrassed! In the end, give this show a watch! I still really enjoyed it..",

The overall animation was decent and it fit perfectly with the settings and scenarios being portrayed.  The voices were a little off and it there was always this strange music playing in the background.  Some parts were absolutely hilarious.  Hikari's personality, for example is just so oddthat it's totally amusing...  It did get annoying at times though.  For someone so smart, it seems like she has awful judgment and needs to calm down.  I also thought it was strange that out of all the members in the Special A, she was the only one who wasn't rich and the only one who was ever studying.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, Special A was hilarious and I wish there were more episodes to it.",

For those who love the 'School Life' genre, I really recommend this. Just how do you take it when someone who you love doesn't care about your feeling and only think about matches with you? The characters are designed better than the manga (believe me, because its hard to differentiate between characters in the manga). The sounds are not bad, mainly because I do not really care about it. However, thisis an anime that you'll never get bored by it and you'll never be satisfied with the  ending, and end up reading the manga :-p",

The art is amazing and the soundtrack couldn't be better, the story was interesting and the comedy didn't make it silly or cliche actually it just made it more interesting. The romance between characters was involving and made it so much more different than other anime. The characters were mostly handsome boys and cute girls with a little bit of a strange personalities. There was a lot of violence and a lot of romance so i believe that both girls and boys would enjoy. In one word it was, is and will be astrangely intresting and involving anime ;D",

            "content": "Special A is an anime that is near and dear to my heart. I\u2019ve grown quite fond of it, mainly because of how wonderful the characters are. This anime is full of ups and downs\u2014laughs, fun, confusion, sadness\u2026 The best part of this anime is the fact that, although there are clich\u00e9 elements, there are some great things that set this apart from some other shoujo anime out there.\r\nThe story isn\u2019t, by any means, that unique, but it is enjoyable and comes across the way that it\u2019s meant to. Once again, there\u2019s the school setting that we all know\u2014it seems ever-present in shoujo\u2014but there issomething unique about this school. That\u2019s the special class that the main characters are in. I found this appealing, but some people might not agree.\\n\\n\r\nSpecial A slides pretty well between fun, slice-of-life moments and seriousness. The plot is low-key and relaxed, unable to really be explained in a concrete way. The best part of this anime\u2019s plot, though, is how comedy and romance is executed. The jokes are almost always got me laughing, and the little romantic moments made my heart flutter.\\n\\n\r\nThere is, however, a problem with the pacing. The main part of the story keeps getting pushed near the end, stretching the story out to the point where some people might just lose interest. Special A starts slow, gets better near the middle, and slows down again before the last hoorah.\\n\\n\r\nI actually find the art style here quite favorable. It\u2019s pleasing to the eyes and better than some things I\u2019ve seen. The characters are tall and lanky, as per usual for the shoujo style. Although it seemed taken too far when I started watching, the style grew on me. All of the boys are extremely handsome; I\u2019m quite fond of the character designs, as well.\\n\\n\r\nEverything gets fuzzy and colorful during sweet moments. I actually find this quite cute, and am not annoyed by it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that bothers me with the art is the fact that, more than once, you can easily spot times when the animators started experimenting. Eyes have more lashes, faces are drawn a bit differently, etc. I thought this was really unprofessional. The artwork is still good, but the random changing isn\u2019t appealing.\\n\\n\r\nOpenings were pretty well done. I\u2019m really fond of the first one, more so than the second OP, but both were catchy and fit the mood of the anime. The music during the show fit wonderfully, as well. Voice acting is good\u2014the boy\u2019s voices were particularly seductive, if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Special A are some of my favorites. They are all so human, with so many emotions and such dimension in their personalities. When you realize what they\u2019ve been through, and what goes on in their heads, you feel an unbreakable bond with them.\\n\\n\r\nYahiro, one of my favorites, comes across one way, only to have his motives explained in a heart-wrenching twist. Akira and Tadashi are a perfect, hilarious and emotional pair. Megumi, Ryuu, and Jun are lovely friends and great characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe true main characters, Hikari and Kei, make an awesome, unique pair. Hikari, competitive and a little thick (but adorable), harbors resentment towards Kei because he\u2019s always in first place. Kei comes across as your normal jerk of a love interest\u2014handsome, cold, calculating, perfect\u2014but, while his perfection at most things is sometimes annoying, it becomes apparent that he has some flaws to him, too. Because they added personality to him, and made his love for Hikari so darn sweet, he\u2019s become one of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nSome things that I didn\u2019t find favorable is the fact that everyone was so privileged, the fact that they were all so popular, and the fact that they pretty much got to do whatever they wanted without problems. What\u2019s also annoying is the fact that this was never explained very well.\\n\\n\r\nThere is another thing that I must mention. My main problem with this anime is the ending. I was looking for something really big, something that would make me feel accomplished, but in the end, I felt that something was missing, and that tarnished the experience a little.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the flaws, Special A is currently one of my favorite shoujo anime, simply because it harbors so many wonderful emotions and just has a magical quality about it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something funny with sweet romance and great characters, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to try Special A out. It\u2019s a great anime. I hope that, if you try it, you enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\n(At the moment, I have never read the manga, but will be reading it soon. I will edit my review once I finish.)",

            "content": "*some spoilers, but not major*\r\nSpecial A isn't a very 'special' plot. Basically the top seven pupils of quite a high-ranking school are immediately placed into 'Special A', a group where they do not (seem) have to attend classes, and they have their own area of the school to themselves.\r\nThe thing that bugs me about Special A is the fact I don't actually like the protagonists that much. The whole 'competitive' thing, while funny to watch, was unbelievably aggrivating, especially when it came to her finding herself liking Kei back and realising she'd 'lost' the competition between them because of it.\r\nI find Kei a bit tooaloof and just arrogant for my liking. Saying that, I do like that in some characters, but I just find him a little too tiresome and boring for my liking. For me to like a main, especially shoujo, male character, there has to be a little bit more in him, so maybe having flaws, aside from the whole fact of him loving her ( oh please, like thats not happened before in a shoujo manga ), would have enabled me to warm to him a little more.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Hikari, in theory. I thought her sweet and lovably clueless. But as the series went on, I found her cluelessness becoming more and more irritating.\\n\\n\r\nSaying this, you'll probably wonder why I gave this anime such a high mark. To be honest, it's the supporting characters. Suprisingly, I loved the other members of Special A and their stories. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it's essentially about Kei and Hikari, romance follows almost all of the rest of the group (Jun, Megumi, Akira, Tadashi and Ryuu). You will laugh at moments, and at others you will clutch at your heart for the tenderness of it.\\n\r\nThe music is beautiful, and suits the anime to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd recommend you to watch this, but don't expect a stellar plot and brilliant main characters.",

            "content": "Although the art was fantastic, it was unsuccessful in trying to cover up the mediocre plotline, and unoriginal characters. Hikari is like every other shoujo character; she's kind, energetic, pretty, feminine, smart and yet boyish at the same time. The only fault that the mangaka tries to portray is that she's dense, which isn't really that big of a fault. Basically, she's too perfect, and she has two guys chasing her after the first five episodes. She fits a category of 2D characters; Mary Sue. The storyline is also unoriginal. Oh yeah, the girl can't be too perfect, so a guy character ALWAYS has tobeat her. Most of us can't even possibly achieve 2nd place in a prestigious school, have time to flirt and fool around, AND do competitive fighting. Do they even LEARN anything in the class? All that happens is that they lounge around drinking tea and having fun, which is probably the opposite of a special class. \\n\r\nOh a guy HAS to fall in love with her, but if she liked him back, that wouldn't make a story. So the mangaka tosses in density, which is very much stereotypical. It's just uneventful, with the audience waiting for the 'big kiss' which isn't very surprising. I haven't watched all of it, but I can guess that they'll kiss at the last episode, with fireworks, and everyone's happy! The end.\\n\r\nBig whoop'd do. Anyone can write a clich\u00e9d story like that. It's boring, especially when the audience watches it over and over again. Instead, couldn't the main character be ugly? Or maybe dumb? Just something that makes her different from other shoujo characters, because I swear, they're all the same with different names. That's it. \\n\r\nNow, onto Takashima Kei. He's hot, smart, rich, and athletic, but with a bad attitude that doesn't make readers dislike him, it just makes him even more lusted-after. Another stereotypical character. The hottie of the school HAS to fall in love with the protagonist. It's like...The unbreakable rule in clich\u00e9d stories. He's almost exactly like Hikari, only just an introvert. Huh, that'll be like falling in love with yourself...Scary.\\n\r\nNaturally, the audience knows little to NOTHING about the supporting characters(unless they go to Wikipedia). Y'know why? Because the protagonist HAS to take the spotlight all the fricken time. If the protagonist isn't in a single episode, it might as well be a CRIME for all the fan girls that protest. Basically, the supporting characters' lives SURROUND the protagonist, like they have no life of their own. Just mindless drones that follow Hikari's every word.\\n\r\nIt's criminal to have sympathy to the guy driving the fated couple apart! Y'know why?...I don't either. Why does the guy/girl that tries to drive the other couples away flawed? He's got ALL the flaws that the protagonist and antagonist don't have. He's so flawed that he's also 2D. Why can't the guy be funny, entertaining, and not extremely mean to the point where we want to kill him? \\n\r\nMy point is only this; PRETTY ART CANNOT COVER UP MARY SUE CHARACTERS AND CLICH\u00c9D PLOTLINES!\\n",

            "content": "If I had to describe Special A in a few words, it'd be: light-hearted, bubbly, upbeat, and cute. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe theme is pretty much the typical slice of life about rich elite students (a group called S.A) and their high school life. Special A uses a conventional plot of an initial rivalry relationship blossoming into love. What is awesome about Special A is that the main couple's romance (Hikari and Kei) aren't the ONLY focus. It also features arcs for the side characters, so even if you're not loving the main couple, you can still follow the interesting side arcs :) Having fun arcs forside characters provides more variety plot-wise. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nWhat I love about Special A is its abundance of fun and nicely developed characters. Unlike many shojos that have the spotlight on the main couple and then neglect the side characters (or give them too little depth etc), Special A manages to give all 7 students in S.A. enough screen time and development to make all of them seem real. There's animal-loving Ryuu, music geniuses Megumi and Jun, and the adorable Tadashi who has the funniest love-hate relationship with Akira. The side characters are not flimsy people just to fill up space.\\n\r\nAs for the main character Hikari, she always tries her best (in academics, sports etc), but she can be RIDICULOUSLY dense and oblivious when it comes to realizing Kei's feelings. This can get frustrating, but she's so nice and down to earth you really can't hate her for it.\\n\r\nKei is every girl's dream boyfriend: good-looking ;) smart, athletic and has an aura that just screams \"COOL\". But he also has a cute (almost vulnerable) side when it comes to Hikari. The two have a really endearing and cute love-hate relationship. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe first thing you'll notice when watching Special A is OMG, THEY HAVE LOOOONG LEGS. Lanky frame aside, the characters are drawn quite nicely, a bit better than average. The way the S.A. greenhouse and some characters' mansions are drawn also adds grandeur.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI really loved the second opening of Special A, because the 4 voice actors for the boys (Kei, Tadashi, Jun, Ryuu) are actually the ones singing the song! What is also really unique is that, each character has their own \"character song\" that is featured in certain episodes. (WATCH FOR MEGUMI'S, HER VOICE IS AMAZING)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Special is a really cute slice of life anime, the love-hate relationships are really amusing, the rivalries are cute, and the romance is sweet. I enjoyed watching Special A (and I think I've actually rewatched it a couple of times :D).\\n\\n",

You'll go from feeling giddy to frustrated to confused to sad to giddy again. I feel like this would be amazing to watch while on your period (sorry if that's tmi). It was very sad ending the series, simply because it's one of those showsthat you will go away missing. The characters feel like people you have genuine connections with.",

            "content": "Well, like seemingly all romantic comedies, this one failed to wrap-it-up. Without trying spoiling anything, you'll see what I mean by the final episode. \r\nIt's perplexing to me that a genre so devoted to love lacks exactly that when you come down to it. And honestly, the creators shouldn't be hesitant to put the hammer down and say, \"This is who he/she ends up with. Love it or hate it.\" After all, this is a love story. I at least expected an, \"I love you\" at the end, but that was not to be.\r\nWhew, with that out of the way let's get to the review:\r\nStory:8\\n\r\nNice and cute pretty much sums it up. Childhood friends and rivals growing up; well you can see where that's going.... Not too heavy, and pretty much sticking to the lighter side of life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThis would be a much lower score if they hadn't added in the beautiful pastel scenes during the lovey-dovey moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nPretty good. Nothing amazing, solid voice acting, good ambient sounds too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis was the most appealing part of the series to me. Characters, literally developed, since childhood should be pretty darn good. And they are. Each has a clear and defined personality that's easily distinguished from one another. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nTypical rom/com frustration will arise in you, for sure, but this would've been higher if the ignorance of Hikari and others were decreased. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nA solid romantic anime. But, be warned: if you're the kind of person who needs to be told EXPLICITLY who ends up with whom (like me), be prepared for some hair-tearing.\\n\\n\\n",

It was the basic \"I love her/him but they're to ignorant to see it\". At the beginning of the anime I found myself frustrated with Hikari because she couldn't take a hint. It was annoying at first, how she always came to the conclusion of 'Rival' to explain everything. I was so overjoyed when she finally realized her true feelings, that i almost fell out of my chair. I couldn't believe it took her that many episodes. \r\nIn the first episode I thought the characters were drawnkind of awkwardly. Their frames were tall and skinny. In my opinion I would've preferred the girls shorter. The way the limbs were drawn also bothered me. They were mainly straight with no curves. You easily get accustomed to it though. Other than that things were fine. \\n\r\nThe character development was great in this anime. Even though the main focus was Hikari and Kei, each episode was themed around a different character each time. You got to know a lot of background info which helped explain the character's personalities.\\n\r\nOverall it was a decent anime. Lots of laughs. Lots of fun. Pleasure to watch.",

Special A stuck to the storyline and the characters. \r\nAnother positive key is that the story and all the characters are really positive. There are no events that leave you frustrated and wishing it should have gone differently. It really satisfied me knowing it wasa happy story and a happy ending. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough at many times predictable, Special A is a somewhat cliche but yet it was an enjoyable ride by keeping its linear progression. Overall, it was an enjoyable anime. However, if you're looking at an anime that will leave you on the edge of your seat, this isn't the one. The ride is slow and peaceful",

            "content": "This anime was pretty good. It was a sweet little anime that I enjoyed and kept up my interest for the most part. It's not exactly special (lol like it's name) but it's very funny and cute. I liked the characters a lot. For most of them their personalities seemed pretty developed and not just, generic. Hikari is a fairly good protagonist who is sweet, tsundereish, and determined. She is actually like any other girl her age if you really look she's girlier then most people view her as. Anyways I really liked the characters even the minor ones like Yahiro and Aoi were someof my very favorites.\\n\r\nThe story was pretty good though pretty predictable. I liked the music in the anime like the opening and ending were very enjoyable. Megumi is a very good singer! :D Anways I would recommend this series but don't expect too much out of it, it's just a good and fun series to watch with some friends.",
