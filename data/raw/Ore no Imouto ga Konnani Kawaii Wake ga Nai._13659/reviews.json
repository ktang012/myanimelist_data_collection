            "content": "OreImo has had something of a controversial history. And that's not too much of a surprise-- it pushes the notion that wanting to bone your (perhaps nonexistent) sister is perfectly fine. Mind you, there is nothing inherently wrong with incestuous themes when handled maturely. But OreImo is not mature. It had no intentions of being so. \r\nAnd yet, there was still more to OreImo than the incest appeal. The first season provided a social commentary on otaku culture and its perception in everyday society. It focused on characters that behave and react like human beings do, sometimes even at the cost of likability. When Kyousukeexpressed any interest in his sister around others, he was treated like a pervert and smacked upside the head. It almost wanted you to feel that there was something wrong with Kyousuke's and Kirino's growing relationship. Not entirely, perhaps, but there were always deeper, more intelligent themes than \"hey, this dude likes his sister\". \\n\\n\r\nOreImo's second season has none of this. There is no social commentary. There are no believable characters. Whatever the series had to set itself apart from any other ecchi or harem series is now gone. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are relentlessly crippled by this downfall and Ayase receives the full extent of it. She was characterized as being level-headed and diligent in the first season; the proverbial \"model student\", albeit with a tendency to berate anybody she sees as odd. Where is this in the second season? Apparently nowhere. Ayase has become victim to the 'yandere' stereotype, cranked up to eleven, knife and crazy-eyes included. For no conceivable reason, she also develops (and acts on her) feelings for Kyousuke, entirely contradicting her belief that Kirino's happiness is most important. The most believable character in the series has been reduced to wrapping paper. \\n\\n\r\nKirino is a love-or-hate character, and whichever side you lean towards, the second season is not going to do much to change your mind. There is plenty more of the rampant complaining that she was so known for in the first season, including an episode comprising of her lying to Kyousuke, insulting him and proceeding to slap him across the face. I could never really get myself to hate her, though, because while she embodies everything wrong with teenage girls, there are always signs that she has remorse for her actions. That and the fact that she's voiced by Ayana Taketatsu. \\n\\n\r\nYou will likely develop a more positive opinion of Kuroneko, though. For the middle third of the story, she is made the principal character. A love interest, too. And unlike the rest of the female cast (Kirino excluded) whose feelings seem entirely forced and superficial, Kuroneko's feelings for Kyousuke are explored in detail. Her love is genuine. It doesn't feel shoehorned in to add an extra number to the harem, and that is perhaps the greatest compliment an anime like this can receive. \\n\\n\r\nBut her story arc eventually blunders about. It is marred, like most things, by superfluous drama at the end. The end of Kuroneko's arc simply consists of Kirino screaming at Kuroneko for the entire episode. Worse, Kuroneko's motivations are not even established once the conflict is finally resolved. All we get are a few ambiguous statements which further contradict her actions. What an awful note to end it on. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say that everything has gone wrong; a few of the episodes are legitimately good. Kuroneko's lighthearted episodes exemplify the good points of the series (and are wholly adorable), while Saori's backstory provides an interesting glimpse into the life of otaku while fleshing out her character in equal measure. The show is plenty capable of being fun; it just regularly chooses not to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending will leave many scratching their heads. It might even be misleading to call it an ending, as it wraps up nothing and shamelessly expects the audience to follow up with the OVAs for answers. Still, it's a nice way to detail Kyousuke's and Kirino's relationship as children and shed some light as to why they act the way they do. Suddenly Kirino doesn't seem half as infuriating as she used to. \\n\\n\r\nTechnicals considering, OreImo 2 is an impressive anime. It looks better than the previous season which was already impressive in itself. There are few scenes where the artwork manages to dip in quality, and the depth of field effect between character and scenery achieves in giving the show a more professional look. The facial expressions are also drawn and animated fluidly, which serves well to enhance the comedic scenes and portray the emotions of each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing spectacular but does the job perfectly fine. Occasionally the soundtrack works to the story's advantage, and scenes that would otherwise feel hackneyed are instead able to stir up a few emotions. On the other hand, the opening is a generic J-Pop song that you will forget almost immediately as it ends. The ending sequences are pleasant, though perhaps not as much for the animation or songs as they are for the variety. It's hard to argue against a new ending for every episode.  \\n\\n\r\nOreImo 2 is not a bad anime, but it is a bad sequel. Whatever you found appealing about the first season is likely to be gone here. It is made to be palatable solely to harem fans and incest fetishists, and those stuck somewhere in between are bound to find this season lacking any sort of cohesion.\\n\\n\r\nA good sequel aims to improve, not to throw away everything that made it unique in the first place. OreImo 2 is a fundamentally broken anime.",

            "content": "This will be my review on Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai S2 (OreImo2), one of the more popular animes depicting sibling relationships in detail.\r\nOreImo2 takes place right after the events of the specials of season 1. In a fitting opening episode, the still-awkward relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke can be readily seen, demonstrating that the two of them still have a ways of bonding to go, until the girl's otaku habits bring the two of them together. \r\nThere's a distinct change between this second season and the preceeding season. While the first season focused on Kirino's 'initiation' into otaku culture, andher brother earnestly helping her with that transition... the second season delves into the relationship between the two of them, and their friends around them; particularly Kuroneko and Ayase. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, OreImo2 may seem like it degraded to a harem rom-comedy, and that argument wouldn't be entirely false. However, seeing the relationships between Kyousuke and Kirino develop over the season's events, and how they deal with the reality that they someday might find a significant other was something that I particularly enjoyed. Of course, some scenes felt a little over the top at times, but the intentions and feelings were there. Kuroneko's arc was also a treat; her feelings for Kyousuke felt very real and sincere, and through her actions it's evident that she still cares for her best friend Kirino, regardless of her affections for her brother. Seeing these conflicting emotions is one of the selling points of this season. \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint would be Ayase's arc... while she's still an enjoyable character to watch, and though she might report me for saying this, her sudden attraction towards Kyousuke was a little unexplained and came off a little too... harem-esque... if you catch my drift. \\n\\n\r\nOther than those main caveats, the season is filled with episodes that were just nice to watch, such as Saori's past, and Kirino/Kyousuke's childhood. Regardless of their content, the main themes and feelings of OreImo are still there. The characters are still a blast to watch and the gags they make are funny. Never once did I feel that there was 'something wrong' with the second season. \\n\\n\r\nThose tired with the harem rom-com angle with animes may find this season lacking and disappointing, but for those who enjoyed the first season and don't mind the change of pace, will still find the new OreImo just as enjoyable as the old. \\n",

            "content": "The idea of incest makes my stomach turn so as you can imagine the title \u201cMy Little Sister Can\u2019t Be This Cute\u201d (English translation) put me off big time. However, after watching the first season of this show by the recommendation of a friend, I found that not only was this show incest free, but also hugely entertaining and surprisingly deep just like \u201cBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\u201d.\r\nThe key word here is surprisingly deep. \r\nHow so? Enter season 2 -\r\nThe first, fourth, fifth and sixth episode of this season hint at what this show is really about: a guy who was outshined by his littlesister, the resentful little sister who lost the close bond she once shared with her older brother when they were young, the formerly close relationship that was ruined by the older brother\u2019s resentment and their awkward attempts to rebuild their relationship as siblings after the little sister\u2019s secret hobby comes to light. \\n\\n\r\n(My interpretation is based off of that dream Kyosuke had at the prologue of episode one, Kyosuke\u2019s inner monologue in episode four, Kyosuke\u2019s reaction to Kirino\u2019s revelation in episode five and six and Kirino\u2019s reactions to what Kyosuke says and does in episode 5\u2026you know your agent wasn\u2019t following you guys, Kirino\u2026GTFO\u2026also some stuff Kirino says involving Kyosuke\u2019s childhood friend Manami in the first season)\\n\\n\r\nThrough Kirino\u2019s secret otaku hobby, both protagonists gain different things: Kirino slowly gets to spend time with the older brother she thought she lost again without having to lose the pride and hard fa\u00e7ade she built up to mask her hurt feelings (if the dream sequence of episode one really happened). \\n\\n\r\nKyosuke on the other hand gains friends, potential love interests, excitement in his life and most importantly the little sister he rejected when they were young, whose cold reaction to him (pre-secret-revelation and the misadventures they have together again post-secret-revelation) make him realize just how much he cares about her (if episode one sequence is foreshadowing and I\u2019m not reading too much into this).\\n\\n\r\nUntil this show, \u201cBen-To\u201d and \u201cBoku wa Tomodachi\u201d, I\u2019ve always hated Light Novel adaptations because they were too fantastical and obnoxious, a cramming of too many outrageous ideas that could potentially be amazing but didn\u2019t go anywhere (The sharp object wielder in \u201cBakemonogatari\u201d, the walking church character in \u201cA Certain Magical Index\u201d and that done to death Masou Shoujou joke of \u201cIs This a Zombie\u201d come to mind). \\n\\n\r\nIf your mind isn\u2019t already racing with this review let me add that this show is fantastic and inspiring, a concept that is deceptively simple, yet hides layers of touching depth.  Just like \u201cBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\u201d (a show you should also check out and watch for what it is, a light read novel that has been animated)\\n\\n\r\nWatch it, you won\u2019t regret it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "So....what would you do when you find out your cute little sister who you haven't seen in years is a closet otaku?\r\nA) Be in denial and pretend it's a lie\r\nB) Never face your sister again\r\nC) Tell her to end her hobby (this could result in some bitch slaps and higher hospital fees)\r\nD) Support her and swear on your life to never tell anyone about it\r\nThink hard. Well, it doesn't' matter which choice you pick because either way, you will be stuck with your cute little sister with the undeniable fact that she is a closet otaku. In the end, you're just going to have todeal with it and think ahead.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's back. Ore no Im\u014dto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai (My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute) is the direct sequel that aired from the Spring line up of 2013 that directly continues from the True End arc. Yes, it is actually required to watch those four episodes so if you haven't done so yet, do it now. There's nothing stopping you. At any rate, the series is back and with a title this long, it's hard to take it seriously right? Well, no but this sequel does have a lot of entertainment, some rubbed in the right and others in the wrong way. For the purpose of my laziness and ease of reading, I'll just simply refer to this sequel as Oreimo 2.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie here. This was one of my most anticipated series from the Spring lineup. Going by the MAL statistics, I might not been the only one with the amount of hype surrounding this sequel. At any rate, Oreimo 2 is here! To do a little refreshment, we have the cute little sister Kirino who we know from the beginning is known as a closet otaku. Her tastes in games seems to be related to little sisters and the eroge genre. This seems to rub her brother Kyosuke the wrong way. In fact, the two does not get along at all. Kyousuke tries to be the supportive brother like a good sibling but Kirino sees him as the following: pervert, lolicon, and a brother who may have the sister complex. While not all of these may truly describe Kyousuke for who he is, there's certainly tension between the duo. Their relationship seems to not go along well most of the time. Kirino is the dominant of the duo and often ridicules Kyousuke at many occasions. It seems like Kyousuke has to deal with her tsundere tendencies, outbursts, and rather awkward accusations. At many times, there's the misunderstandings too that further implements problems. Long story short, Kirino and Kyousuke does not get along very well and in this sequel, it doesn't get off to a good start with that either.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are times in this season that does show a supportive side from both sides of the siblings. Although they both seem to deny it, it's quite obvious that both Kirino and Kyousuke are frustrated if either one of them gets a lover. In other words, there's something in their heart that seems to tell their brutal honest selves that they don't want the other side to enjoy a healthy relationship. I guess perhaps their relationship does have a loving side, in that sibling way. And speaking of love, there's more ways than just one.\\n\\n\r\nIn Oreimo 2, love is in the air especially with our other characters. Well, it can come into many shapes and sizes such as the yandere Ayase. I'm not a big fan of her's but her screen time was definitely appreciable for the way she seems to talk down Kyousuke but at the same time seems to enjoy their awkward relationship. Otherwise, there's my favorite cosplayer and arch-rival of Kirino from this series....the one and only one.....*drum roll*.....\\n\\n\r\nRuri \u201cKuroneko\u201d Goko!\\n\\n\r\nVoiced by the ultra talented voice actress Kana Hanazawa, Kuroneko gets quite the spotlight that she deserves in this sequel. Just like in season one, Kuroneko is like the opposite of Kirino and gets in her face at almost everything. Think of it this way. They are like oil and water, snake and mongoose, colors dyed red and blue. It's hate at first sight defined at its finest. Nonetheless, the two simply does not get along at all. The catch is in this sequel, there's even an new additional factor added in that causes Kyousuke to be part of the equation. And no it doesn't involve eroge. That's part of the 2D world.\\n\\n\r\nAmong other things, Oreimo 2 seems to like to push drama forward between various characters. Well, there's more than just our can't-get-along-at all siblings. Rather, it also deals with other characters. For instance, we even have supporting characters who plays various roles in steaming up some awkward moments. This usually results in Kirino lashing out her tsundere tendencies at full force. The receiving side usually seems to be our poor Kyousuke who is accused of being a lolicon, sister-con, etc etc. Well, not everything rides on Kyousuke's bad side though. There are some nice girls such as Manami, Kuroneko's siblings, and even a track rival of Kirino's. Unfortunately, Kyousuke is too damn dense to ever notice anything most of the time. It doesn't help with the various misunderstandings either that often again puts Kyousuke on the wrong side of life such as drama in the club room. Get your popcorn out folks and watch those moments go fly in the air.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the fan service goes, this sequel surprisingly doesn't have as much as I had thought. Well, it does have some though. While it omits the typical beach episode, the series has Kyosuke at edge of some awkward camera angles. Then, there's the outfit that Kirino wears that seems to either be for eye candy or even perhaps a foreshadowing. Either way, the fan service of this series is not as much as you may imagine. What Oreimo 2 does offer more though is doses of fun gags. It's not just those catchy end cards that some people might miss at the end of each episode. Rather, it's the dialogues such as the typical \u201cI hate you\u201d from Kirino that seems to have a completely opposite meaning. Then, there's also innocent talks with some dirty words mixed in spoken by kids too young. If \u201cbitch brother\u201d isn't part of that gag, I don't know what it is. Oh and let's not forget the rather indirect references to eroge games like sausage eating.\\n\\n\r\nThe story structure of the series seems to be a bit loose although middle part seems to be the main dish of the meal. Some of the other episodes seems to be more as ingredients. By ingredients, I mean the supporting characters. With its blissful cast of side characters, there's a lot of screen time for many of them. Kirino though is still the main girl. Regardless, Kirino can barely stand Kyousuke while the latter has trouble dealing with her own love issues. In fact, Kyousuke becomes the sort of center of attention with the girls as he gets quite a lot of surprises in this sequel. Kirino on the other hand isn't happy by this but being the tsundere that she is, it's obvious how she responds. I found this a bit out of place and way out there. What deserved have been there though should be materials that were intact from the light novels. Perhaps the development of the story requires some cramming but it's something not too consistent enough for my liking. \\n\\n\r\nIn technical terms of artwork, the series remains its similar style as the previous season. If artistic value is taken account, one could imply the adorable way some of the designs are drawn in particular the younger cast and Kuroneko. The way she cosplays is also quite catchy whether Kirino likes it or not. That gothic getup with the cat ears is just appealing and something most of us might not be able to take eyes off of. It's not too shabby either with the backgrounds too in terms of animation values. I would say that the overall artwork of season 2 is relatively the same as its prequel. \\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack, the series continues the pattern of lighthearted pattern. To add to some extra gags, each of the ending episode concludes with a different song with different artwork. You might want to keep your hands on that print screen button because those end cards are something worth of a thousand words. Most of the seiyuu voices portrays their voices as well to fit their characters. Kirino remains a tsundere with her voice. Kyousuke's tone often reflects both supportive and frustration. Kuroneko's soft and touching voice gives off that feeling of adorableness. The OP song \"reunion\" by ClariS brings back indeed a reunion between many of the characters. There's also a bit of perhaps foreshadowing in the song as there seems to be a famous red string of fate at the finger tips of Kyousuke swining to one side but never reaching its target. Hmm.....\\n\\n\r\nBy all means, Oreimo 2 is not a masterpiece. At least it did something right to get more people to watch this series from the first place with its unusual premise. Perhaps the drama can be seen differently from some to others. Then, there's those dialogues. Some of them are catchy while others tries too hard. What it did catch though is a burst of laughter at several occasions for me. With all set and done, this sequel awaits you but only if you finished season 1 and its true end. For fans of Oreimo, this is a continuation. After all, there's no way a series you've finished season one and true end can be just dropped without giving at least the first episode a try.",

            "content": "To be honest, I still don\u2019t really understand Oreimo. Even after the second season, there\u2019s still things that I\u2019m unsure of. At a glance, the title suggests a story between a sister and a brother, but the thing is, looking back at two seasons of Oreimo, I really don\u2019t think that definition fits all too well.\r\nHere\u2019s the thing - yes, it is a story about a sister and her brother. But that\u2019s not all - Oreimo isn\u2019t just that. Oreimo doesn\u2019t just explore the relationship between a brother and a sister, Oreimo divulges into everyday life, in this case I suppose, the everyday life ofan otaku schoolgirl struggling through her slightly different lifestyle. It\u2019s also the story of a very average brother trying to do his best to protect his beloved sister - in which their relationship, has long fallen apart. And again, that\u2019s not all. It\u2019s also the story of friends, friends joined by a common interest, friends joined together to enjoy life, and solve each other's problems. That, is Oreimo. Daily life. Of an otaku, or rather, several otakus and their non-otaku friends.\\n\\n\r\nIn that aspect, it\u2019s not hard at all to call Oreimo simple. It really is, just the daily lives of a sister and her brother, and the people that surround them. There\u2019s no intense magical girl fighting (at least, not *real* magical girl fighting), emotionally depressing family problems, no sword-wielding monster-slaying chicks that cross between worlds, no insane amount of unrealistic harem situations, no no, there\u2019s none of that at all. Oreimo, is simple, yet enjoyable. Why? Because it speaks to it\u2019s audience. I found myself divulged in Oreimo in the same way that Kirino was obsessed with Meruru. In the same way Kirino has her collection of Meruru figurines, I have my own personal collection of anime paraphernalia that I treasure and admire. Hell, even I want to go to Akihabara.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose such a pretense leads to a few issues - like the fact that Oreimo slightly lacks focus. Although it\u2019s undoubtedly true that Oreimo spends a lot of time focused on the brother-sister relationship between Kyousuke and Kirino, it also spends a lot of time exploring things that are slightly random. It\u2019s like every once in awhile, Oreimo simply benches the brother-sister relationship backstory, and focuses on other aspects of it\u2019s story. Of course, I\u2019m not really complaining, because if it had not done that, it really would have been solely a story of a brother and a sister, and nothing more. And I for one, believe that such a story probably wouldn\u2019t have been all too interesting. Because it\u2019s not like this lack of direction really affects the anime at all - it\u2019s not like we\u2019re lacking character or story development, every single \u201carc\u201d within Oreimo, does develop both the cast and the story. Everything somehow ties back to one main idea in the end, and there are no useless episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, if there was one thing about Oreimo that I really appreciated, was the cast. i don\u2019t think I ever found myself in absolute hatred of a character after finishing the finale of Oreimo. In fact, I was pretty attached to the entire cast as a whole - they were fleshed out pretty well, and although in some places were underdeveloped, all in all, they were pretty well done. I suppose if I had to label a single problem to Oreimo, it would be that some of the characters, are slightly underdeveloped. If I were to label them, theres no doubt in my mind that I would have loved to see more of Kanako, the Akagi sister-brother pair, and a little more of Saori, although she was actually pretty well developed. I suppose to an extent, this lack of development is acceptable, since if Oreimo were to really develop all of these characters, the story really would have lost focus and became random to the point of being bad.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I\u2019m not really complaining, because realistically, not only were the characters fleshed out pretty well, they were also drawn pretty well. The animation is pretty well done, although something like that is to be expected of an anime produced in 2013.\\n\\n\r\nThe other well-produced aspect of Oreimo, is more than likely the soundtrack. Like the animation, it\u2019s to be expected that an anime produced in 2013 should have a good, acceptable soundtrack, and Oreimo is no exception, but to be honest, although it was well produced, there was nothing really special to it. The opening, on the other hand, is a great choice. It would have been bad for Oreimo to have broken the style of the opening theme from the original, first season of Oreimo. Although I do have to say that I\u2019m not too sure about carrying over the concept of a different ending for EVERY episode from the first season of Oreimo was too good of an idea. I really think that it would have been better to just have another ClariS song as the ending. But then again, the ever-changing ending animation was pretty interesting, and I don\u2019t doubt that a decent amount of work was put into it, because instead of pasting the same ending animation on every episode, Oreimo has a different ending animation, and song, for every episode, which I found mildly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nRealistically though, between Oreimo 1 and Oreimo 2, I can strongly say that nothing has really changed. For me, Oreimo 2 is only better because it\u2019s a continuation, and I get to see more of the Kirino that I\u2019ve enjoyed for two seasons straight, and get to explore more of the relationships and stories of friends surrounding Kirino and her brother.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I suppose that Oreimo is one of those animes that never try to be overtly flashy. Oreimo didn\u2019t try to provoke anything overtly powerful within it\u2019s viewers. It merely set out to explore the lives of it\u2019s cast, and in doing so, pleased it\u2019s audience quite well. It\u2019s the kind of anime that doesn\u2019t need anything more other than more episodes to do the same thing it\u2019s been doing for it\u2019s entire life span. But the thing is, having said all that, Oreimo isn\u2019t the kind of anime that you just bench once it\u2019s done. Some would disagree with me, but I know for myself at the very least, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is the kind of anime that I probably wont forget, and given the choice to stick Kirino on my back windshield, or any other anime character, I\u2019d probably pick Kirino.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s just that cute.\\n",

            "content": "If you liked or even slightly appreciated this show at all don't read or comment or rate this review in anyway just get out. This isn't for you this is for everybody who hated or has yet to see this show.\r\nSecondly if you are thinking of watching this show DON'T DO IT. You'll hate your life and it will make you beyond depressed. DON'T DO IT.\r\nOverall (after season 1) I had hope for this show. A lot of hope actually. But it didn't even try to make the story worthwhile. It became a game to see how many girls he could make cry in thespace of three episodes (the last three) and then after he picks the girl he wants aka his sister (yes this is incest) they stop dating. Basically leaving him with no girls at all from where before he has five bitches/lovely ladies to choose from. He could have had a loli, a childhood friend, a hot model girlfriend but no. He chooses his annoying little sister, who he knows is annoying and doesn't even make it last. I really hope this writer is happy because I'm not. Pathetic writing. I get that it's different but you shouldn't write to just depress your audience. I can even do that, shit I could make the whole world cry from a story if i wanted to. Getting them attached to a character or even a set of characters then systematically tear their love life apart easily without feeling. That's why this anime sucks. Waste of animation budget that could have been used on something else. This may seem like a nerd rant but seriously think of it this way. If you don't have a girlfriend/wife/lover/etc (if you do pretend you don't) and then imagine you have all these girls around you wanting to be your special lover. Most are willing to do about anything. Now reject each and everyone, watch them cry without feeling sad. That is feeling this anime gave me. If you love watching girls cry go ahead watch this anime, otherwise run, run and never look back at this crapfest. goodbye fellas next review is Seikon No Qwaser.. I'm not excited about it either.",

            "content": "OreImo. The anime that I couldn't figure out for the life of me is now more obvious than a vegetarian in a grocery shop and about as complex as a technical drawing of a hammer. It has stooped down to the level of your average harem and the studio didn't even do a good job at that.\r\nNow let's recap what made the first season fairly decent. First of all, it was realistic with a capital R and focused not only on the relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino but also on the Otaku community at large. The characters behaved naturally and in my opinion were asclose as any anime has gotten to simulating real human beings. Now bear this in mind as we describe what happens with that realism in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story takes Kyosuke and virtually all the girls in the cast, puts massive magnets on them and lets the pinball games begin. Some girls repel each other, some girls end up being pushed away but they're all eventually attracted to Kyosuke. The complexity and the realness set forth by the first season is brutally crushed, replaced with plot points and confessions that you could see coming from a mile away with both of your eyes covered. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just when the series begs for mercy a spectacular coup de gr\u00e2ce is delivered. Kyosuke, the martyr and defender of logic and reason from the first season turns more into your average perverted harem lead, welcoming this new found female attention hand over fist, without thinking about it too much. Shower spying, perverted fantasies, conversations about tits... fanservice? Yeah it's all here. OreImo2 is up to its knees with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe female cast itself is a mixed bag as far as plot progression and character development goes. Kirino is as annoying as ever. First she hates her brother and wipes the floor with him, second she gets all lovey-dovey and clings to him like a bubble gum to a shoe sole... before proceeding to wipe the floor with the poor guy yet again. You'd wish she'd just give it to him straight. Nope. She loves, hates and is neutral towards him while he dances around her like a jester before a King in a castle courtyard. \\n\\n\r\nKuroneko and Saori though receive considerable time and go through some much needed character development. Saori's background story deepens her character and shows us that not all things might be as they seem. Kuroneko on the other hand opens up more and we see the more shy and vulnerable side of her as well as her true feelings for Kyosuke. I have to say that out of all the characters, her story arc was the most satisfying and emotionally engaging. For a few episodes at least, you get to see a genuine romance.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Manami, Ayase and Kanako - it's nothing short of a disaster. Manami gets royally shafted for the entire duration of this season. She's only there to provide advice once in a blue moon, appears in a flash back or two but don't hope for any development, not between her and Kyosuke or anyone else for that matter. Ayase, seemingly the only girl possessing common sense among her circle of friends becomes wholly shallow and is the first casualty, becoming nothing more than an addition to Kyouske's harem. Do not expect anything remotely interesting from her. Kanako ends up the same way as Ayase and though not confessing directly you can see what's going on because at this point the show becomes so predictable and un-realistic you might as well watch paint dry or play ping-pong with a can of soda.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode of OreImo2 is inconclusive and will leave you with a headache and a rash, both probably from anger and disappointment. Which means, yes flashbacks pertaining to Kyosuke and Kirino. While it gave us an insight as to why his sister disses him all the time, it was not a good way to end the anime. \\n\\n\r\nMany fans and casual watchers alike (myself among them) have been looking forward to the second installment in this series, hoping for a decent follow-up on the brother-sister relationship centered around the otaku culture. More than anything I think, everyone was hoping for some sort of a conclusion. However it is obvious now that the studio is intent on milking this series as much as possible and that means that the cast and the plot will be severely dumbed down.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the visual and audio aspect - it stays exactly the same. Well drawn characters, attention paid to every detail and a decent OST. The opening and ending songs might seem a bit plain but personally I've never paid any attention to that and never include it as part of my grading criteria.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, OreImo2 is a failure. The story doesn't progress as much as I feel it should have given 13 episodes, though we are given a superb Kuroneko arc and Saori's own story was engaging too. Those two gems are surrounded by harem and a vast repository of bogus drama and Kirino's bipolarity. This season does not carry the plot of the first one well and as such, there's not much left to like about this anime anymore.",

            "content": "OreImo is back! Now with more fanservice and less fun!\r\nNo but really, when I heard OreImo gets a second season I was pretty excited. I loved the first season, it was really entertaining and I had a blast with it. It wasn\u2019t anything great but a good laugh and a lot of Otaku references.\r\nWith season 2 though a lot of this changed. I\u2019m not sure if it is me that changed or if A1 Pictures is at fault, or even if the source material is not that good. But season 2 was the biggest disappointment of the year so far.\r\nStory/Content\r\nKyouske and his sister Kirino areback, this time it revolved all around their relationship and more drama/romance as in contrast to the first season which had more comedy.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that Season2 didn\u2019t have any comedy, but just not as much.\\n\r\nThe start is slow and not very good, it gets scattered episodes that are actually enjoyable only to mix in the ones that are bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt just doesn\u2019t work. The romance part of the show should a) not be with Kirino and her Brother and b) not so dramatic.\\n\r\nEverything is just really unrealistic and over the top, you cannot make real drama seem appropriate in a show that is so nonsensical. It harmed the overall feel of the show big time and I was mostly at the verge of dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nThank goodness the last episode was actually good, so I\u2019m not writing this with fury but rather a calm disappointed aftertaste of what the show was in general.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWhile everyone was as they were in season 1, it kinda felt like a magical reset. I know they want you to get into it again, but the feeling of starting from 0 was still there.\\n\r\nWe got some insight on other characters this time but nothing that had any impact on the show overall.\\n\r\nI mean what was the point of a backdrop for Saori if she is missing most of the time?\\n\r\nI mean nice to know what other people have as backdrop but in the end the focus was on Kirino.\\n\r\nEven the hoped for romance between Kuroneko and Kyousuke was disappointing and went nowhere.\\n\r\nAnd the worst of it all was Kirino, as she was a worse TSUNdere than ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus was weak this season, everyone got a tiny bit only to be sacrificed by Kirino which pissed a lot of people off.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe original was done by studio AIC, this time A1 Picture did the job.\\n\r\nNormally A1 has pretty good production values, and it\u2019s not like OreImo looked bad, but an average looking show can\u2019t be helped.\\n\r\nWhat we did get though were a lot of asses.\\n\\n\r\nI mean A1 Pictures kinda needs to squeeze in a lot of Ass-Fanservice in every show they make, at least that\u2019s what I see.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not really that it would ruin the show, since it is already not a serious show to begin with, so fanservice doesn\u2019t ruin it. But the amount of it was definitely increased.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest is the same, character designs look pretty bland, the sceneries are just as underwhelming, and animation is average stuff.  \\n\\n\r\nNot the worst looking show of the season, but sure right in the middle of mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nEven worse is the music in OreImo 2. I can\u2019t quite remember what it sounded like in season one, but I guess it wasn\u2019t much better.\\n\r\nThe opening is cheezy and the general BGM just fitting but not great.\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors are you normal to good modern presentation. I mean we have Kana Hanazawa and Yuuichi Nakamura. They are all talented so yeah it\u2019s good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWell apart from a few episodes or scenes season 2 was a let down. I sometimes even hated it and just wanted to throw my computer out the window on how bad it was.\\n\r\nWhile the enjoyable episodes were good enough to fill my sparse free time with some good moments.\\n\r\nThe last episode really helped the show not to leave behind this image of the worst thing ever in my memory.\\n\r\nBut I guess this is it for me. If a season 3 comes out, nope thank you. It\u2019s not worth it anymore and it lost its magic.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\\n\r\nContent 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise and Setting 0 (same as before, also not great) \\n\r\nGenre Execution -1 (compared to season 2 a failure)\\n\r\nDialogues and Cleverness 0 (not as funny as season 2 but had its moments)\\n\r\nInterest keeping 0 (sometimes I thought I\u2019d drop it, but then it saved it with a good episode)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality 0 (cliches but fun to watch)\\n\r\nBehavior and Chemistry 0 (enjoyable from time to time)\\n\r\nDevelopment and Progression 0 (not really there)\\n\r\nMotivation and Backdrop +1 (we actually got some backdrop for some of the characters)\\n\r\nLikability 0 (while some of them are very likable, Kirino is not)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle 0 (generic)\\n\r\nQuality 0 (okay)\\n\r\nBackground 0 (unremarkable)\\n\r\nCharacter Designs -1 (cheap looking)\\n\r\nVisual Effects 0 (used not often)\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting +1 (many talented people)\\n\r\nOpening and Ending -1 (waaaaay too cheesy)\\n\r\nSoundtrack 0 (uninteresting)\\n\r\nSound Effects 0 (the usual)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 0 (okay)\\n\r\nSound 0 (almost bad, but voice actors are good enough to enjoy it nonetheless)\\n\r\nStory and Content -1 (too many annoying episodes)\\n\r\nCharacters 0 (a different focus would have made it better)\\n\r\nValue 0 (unlike season 1 I will hopefully forget about this one)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOreImo2 is my disappointment of the year... It\u2019s sad and it made me angry. Suddenly I focused too much on the bad aspects of the show and couldn\u2019t enjoy myself like I used to in season 1.\\n\r\nWhile it ends not as terrible as it starts out, it still was just very bad overall.\\n\\n\r\n4,2/10\\n\r\n~4/10 (bad)\\n",

Because I honestly thought that this would be a nice tale about brother and sister who regaintheir relationship as normal siblings. Oh how was I disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nStory is rubbish and even though it's a cliche: You see the rushed ending coming a mile away. Seriously don't waste your time. Learn from my mistakes.

            "content": "OreImo is the pandering of everyday events of the siblings: Kyousuke and Kirino. If you want an anime with siblings of the opposite gender, along with love interests for the main male character, and very basic plot devices, then this is the anime for you. Plot devices in this anime are used in the most basic of forms, meaning an unexpected twist. To make the predictable unpredictable is one major gripes that I have with OreImo, and it just fails so miserably when the story steers itself back in the direction it came from. The twist just became absolutely unnecessary. It also doesn\u2019t help whenside characters introduced from the previous season are completely eliminated just so the plot can better flow.\\n\\n\r\nAt no point while watching this anime did I feel even remotely attached to any of the characters, and this is due to the fact that I\u2019ve previously stated: The pandering of everyday events. It\u2019s like watching a dog circle around a patch of grass, sniffing the ground for that sweet spot to lay a pile of dung, and then simply walk away once it had done its task. Not a care in the world even though it went through so much effort to find that sweet spot. This is what OreImo is. It panders the story around in a way that turns the characters into backdrops and reminding you that you should have some emotional attachment only when they implement their unnecessary plot twist. It tries to build the characters in a way that you would relate and find attachable, but the end result is meaningless, and again, this is attributed to the fact that the story manages to steer itself back into its predictable plot line even after a twist has occurred.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the characters develop their meaningless relationships, expect many moments of comic relief because this is about as funny as it\u2019ll ever get. As a comedy, OreImo relies on short skits to make you have a quick laugh. Combined with the more serious tone of the plot, this is an anime that lacks a central focus.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the main plot had run its course, the writers decide to re-introduce a love interest for the male protagonist. A character that they\u2019ve neglected. And the story was so bad. It felt like they had to write and animate this short story just to appease the fans or simply meet the thirteen episode quota. A complete waste of time and money.",

            "content": "I'd like to start this review off with my thoughts and opinions on the show's story. \r\nIn my opinion, I thought the story was very relatable (Minus the harem). Will someone out  in the world  disagree with me? I think yes. Because not everyone will think this show is relatable. During the first season, you see Kirino as an Otaku who is simply trying to keep it a secrete that she plays little sister eroge games. I relate to that because in my society, anime watchers are simply classified as \"nerds\". The story really goes deep inside the life of not only ahigh school student's life, (If Japanese student life includes harem and a lot of misunderstanding relationships between a brother and sister), and a life of an Otaku who is trying to live a normal life. \\n\\n\r\nFor the art of this anime, I found it wonderful. In some episodes when two characters find themselves arguing, They end showing you this other world (an alternate dimension if you will) where they have these magical girl clothing on and they begin to fight. Which I found very cool. If I wasn't very descriptive I apologize. Basically the cool fighting stuff in Chuunibyou Demo Shikai, or Black Rock Shooter you see in those shows is what I was trying to explain. I found those scenes very amusing. When they aren't in those action scenes, the art was overall good and was goofy when something funny happens.\\n\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack in this anime, I found both of the openings catchy because of it's upbeat rhythm. The endings how ever I tend to skip unless the ending credits were rolling as the episode was still playing its last few moments. I will tell you that each episode has a different song. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters, I can't say every character developed from start to finish. But at least the main characters such as Kyousuke, Kirino, Kuroneko, Saori (boy did she have a bug development in a non perverted way), and Ayase had development. I'd say why and how but I can't do it without spoiling a lot of the story plot. You'll just have to watch and see. Also I say that these characters are the only ones with development because the other characters in the anime just didn't touch your heart unlike the characters mentioned above\\n\\n\r\nNow if you're going to ask me if I enjoyed this anime, I would have to say, I enjoyed it very much. It had lots of comedy that you will find extremely funny no matter who you are. You will find a lot of it's emotional scenes touching, and despite the development of some of the characters, you will eventually end up loving all of them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall yes I did enjoy this wonderful anime. It made me realize that siblings have an intense bond that can never be broken. No matter how much you THINK you hate them. Deep inside you know you love them as a family. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for comedy, and a just a fun anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow that this anime review is over, I bid you farewell ^o^\\n\r\n~SuperNinja\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'd be the first person to tell you that Season 1 was way better than I thought it would be. I actually liked it, which surprised me, as I thought I would hate it. Hearing there was a second season, I was a little mixed, because I had this feeling that if the show went on any longer it might actually lead to incest. I was fine with the Season 1 ending, but I watched Season 2 anyway. I'm here to say I made a huge mistake. \r\nWhere Season 1 was funny, different, and just a joy to watch, Season 2 was boring, cliche, andannoying to watch. The show got too serious for its own good, and it suffered because of it. It also doesn't help that this season had the same amount of time to adapt 2 extra light novels, so a lot of the books were taken out (more than what was taken out in Season 1 at least). \\n\\n\r\nI didn't like where they went with any of the characters. Kirino was even more of a bitch than she was last season, Kyousuke became really freaking weird (it was borderline creepy really), and nobody else was important. Aside from Kuroneko, who is cool. We learn more about Saori, which was a good thing, but that wasn't enough to save the rest of this show from being really bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values in this show stayed the same from the previous season, which was another good thing. I will admit that I didn't find either of the jpop openings or ending particularly good, but they aren't bad either. But no amount of amazing openings and endings would make this shows story any better (and it isn't the kind of show you can watch just for how good it looks and sounds). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think you are better off just not watching Season 2, and letting the show end at Season 1 (after the 4 OVAs). A good ending might have changed my vote, but I got spoiled of the ending and all I'll say is this: it isn't good.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 61/100\\n",

            "content": "Well I didn't plan on reviewing this but the \"controverse\" about it makes me want to.\r\nSpoilers to be expected here and there.\r\nFirst, let's start with the easy stuff.\r\n- Art is outstanding, as you would expect it's in that \"light novel\" style that makes it very soft and eye-catching. We see pretty easily that oreimo season 2 was given a large budget.\r\n- Sound was pretty good, although not as nice as in season 1, and the OP/ED themes all were deceiving to me compared to their season 1 peers.\r\n- The story overall, not including character relations, made use of pretty enjoyable comedy, never failed at entertainingme and always proved more than interesting, and with a nice progression speed, even if it wasn't generally surprising apart for some very specific moments.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters.\\n\r\nAs in season 1 we have very stereotypical characters, but their personnalities are developed a lot more in this season as we learn about their respective past, so we understand more where they come from, especially for Kirino's tsundere behavior toward her brother, and also, surprisingly, about his almost masoschistic behavior by bearing with his little sister.\\n\r\nKuroneko gets much more importance in this season, almost as if there was a whole \"arc\" dedicated to her, what wasn't unpleasant as we could get a bit more knowledge about herself, and not only the role she made for herself. She's also the first one to \"guess\" inside the show what is gonna be the end.\\n\r\nAs for Ayase (\"My lovely angel Ayase-tan\" as Ky\u014ds\u016bke says), she's still a bit put off, like Manami with few on-screen time, but they weren't the most important characters for the plot in the first place, despite being both really cute in they own ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs of the controversial point (i.e.  that we clearly guess a Kyo\u014ds\u016bke x Kirino feeling end), all one might want to do is re-read the title of the show : \"My little sister can't be this cute\".\\n\r\nNow I wonder how one can not find this explicit enough regarding the \"true\" end of the show...\\n\r\nAlthough I can see why one would be unsatisfied by that, it was obvious since the very beginning, and much more in the season 2 that the title was a true hint for the conclusion the author wanted.\\n\r\nWhat was confirmed by the spoilers fo the last volume of the light novel that was recently released.\\n\\n\r\nNow to end this review, the notation is hard, as it'll hugely depend on the way you feel with that end.\\n\r\nI guess one might dislike it and put something around 8 as an end you dislike can't erase the whole show that was fantastic (no one can deny that), and if you like it, like me, it's definitely a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'll give it a 10, as it's one of those shows that you won't forget as soon as it stops airing, and for good reasons.

            "content": "The following review involves only my very own opinion and my personal experiences. Minor spoilers included, read at your own risk. You may or may not like it. Provided that you do not like my review, feel free to vote it down. Or even better: write an own one.\r\nForeword\r\nYou are looking for a funny and entertaining romcom? You might have found one - OreImo is quite funny and somewhat entertaining. But be aware: Do not expect too much, this show truly is about reckless, brave and yeah, pretty silly people.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nThe core point of OreImo is a highly complicated (love?) relationship of two blood relatives.This anime shows us how a sister relearns to trust her brother, and how a brother is trying to get in touch with an odd culture.\\n\r\nThe story about siblings falling for each other is nothing new. However, the side stories (Otaku culture, Saori\u2019s arc) are pretty interesting and well executed. I wish I could say the same about the main story: for the most part of the series there is no story at all, which is very disappointing and unsatisfying. Near the end of season two the main arc gets more intense and culminates in a fairly peculiar ending. While being a romcom, the show is not efficiently romantic or funny at all. But for all that, the part I disliked the most is the ridiculous attempt on a harem in the last episodes. Out of nowhere. \\n\r\nWhatsoever, all those things fits the show pretty well. Even though the plot routes of OreImo might indeed seem strange and cloudy, again: the show is about silly, grotesque persons. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOreImo is a double edged sword at this point. The show has some really nice supporting characters like Kuroneko and Saori, who do have interesting backgrounds and their own personalities. On the other side there are characters like Ayase, whose nature is just absurd. Speaking of absurd things I can\u2019t avoid mentioning the truly weakest point of OreImo: main characters. They act, again, highly absurd. Their actions and decisions feel borderline unreasonable, beyond any belief.  Oddly enough this fact fits the main arc pretty well, which may or may not be advantageous.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the animation of OreImo, it fits the whole show in a good manner. The colours are pretty deep and sharp, the scenes are colourful. However, in many scenes you can see some really sterile and lowly animated backgrounds, which is a pity.\\n\r\nA couple of words about the music. The opening and ending themes are fine and consistent with the show. The sounds in the show itself are pretty good, but sadly I couldn\u2019t notice any memorable compositions. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOreImo is not that bad. The sad part is: it\u2019s not any good, either. Even though there are some funny and good parts, in the end you might feel highly cheated and disappointed. There are tons of much better romcoms out there, so don\u2019t waste your time on mediocre shows like this one.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are into siscon, try the great Koi Kaze, a mature and serious story about the forbidden love.\\n",

So far so good.\r\nBut then comes season 2... And  more precisely the second half of season 2. Here the characters relationships start to run amok, make no sense and destroy everything good the series otherwise had built up. I have watched many animes where the ending had either been lacking or confusing. But OreImo takes the price. It leaves you with nothing but bad taste in your mouth. \r\nIn short, do watch season1. It's okay to good depending on your taste. But don't watch season 2. And should you decide to anyway, only watch the first half. But whatever you do, don't watch the 3 last episodes. It's like ending a good date being told your partner has cheated on you.",

            "content": "They've done it now. Officially. An anime series has got on my nerves.Even though I don't do reviews for older shows I feel frenzied and obliged to write this just to get the load off me.\r\nThis is late but it comes audacious and up to date, it's not just a review, these are my sentiments (unplugged) about this series,that have been collected right after I watched it so they are afresh, so much that I'm not even able to think straight and am punching the keyboard buttons aggressively to type. I am going to give my emotions a voice and I am going to dothat by ranting here, now either you can just read it or sod off but I'm doing it for my sake. \\n\r\nJudgments can prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond the appearances but my feelings are galvanizing my thoughts about this anime and framing a lot of them too. \\n\\n\r\nNOTE- If u have actually watched the prequel it'll help you in understanding my grievances better as my review draws heavy comparisons between both the seasons. My review also includes the specials (episodes 14-16) \\n\r\nAlso, I'm giving HEAVY SPOILERS out on this review but nothing I say can wreck this anime more than it already is. The damage has been done. \\n\\n\r\nI am so mad because I feel I've just been trolled? OreImo has disappointed me in more than one way.\\n\r\nOreImo is the story between a brother & a sister and how their relationship as siblings' changes and gets mend, given the time. I had read somewhere that beneath the simple-looking plot, OreImo is a gem for all anime fans (agreed) \\n\r\nThough happy about a second season I was ascertain and my concerns weren't wholly nugatory. I had enjoyed watching the first 12 episodes of the first season but encouraging it to continue further would eventually lead to this road. Now, I am sure you've heard from hither-tither that the second season leads towards incest. All the viewers who have previously watched OreImo have already killed the story by frivolously debating over OreImo's Incestual plot and have already broken this news to those who're yet to view the anime. \\n\r\nThey decided to specifically target all the qualities I cherished about this anime and turn it into something I incredibly detest. A \"BAD\" Rom-com Harem, I do not hate that genre but this is amateurish. \\n\r\nHow has Oreimo 2 failed? To answer that there is nothing \"Oreimo\" about Oreimo2 but apparently they claim it to be a sequel.\\n\r\n-there's not much in it on the life of an Otaku\\n\r\n-the life consults are gone\\n\r\n-Kirino is bitchier. \\n\r\n-There's too much blast from the past, clips from season 1 and Dejavu.\\n\r\n-During every argument our harem Hero stands their gaping while the Heroines engross themselves in a fist-fight. \\n\r\n-The idea of slapstick comedy, butt-kicking, bitch-slapping, screaming like kingkong and yelling words like \"baka,hentai\" is so hackneyed that it's not even funny anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAbove stated are only few of the numerous things in the show that agitated me. \\n\r\nAll that gone, something else must be stirring? Mmm... Romance! \\n\r\nThe feelings that the show gives off changed, Well being 32 episodes long (first and second season combined) the plot had to feel like it was moving and going somewhere, so it followed behind the VN/Light novel and caught up with the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to dive deep into this stuff because the art,music,voice-acting has changed the least, mostly remained similar. I understand less about technicalities so my review is solely based on observations made by myself. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10) The art is precise & vibrant.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) \\n\r\nKyousuke, for once is not the weak kind of male protagonist who is torn between girls, he is a baka, liar, hentai, lolicon, masochist, lech but he is not a sissy and while Kirino keeps shouting at the top of her lungs that Kyousuke has a sis-fetish, Kirino's actions suggest that she has a brother complex MORE THAN ANYTHING.Our female characters are the perfect mix you might find in a harem and you'll grow fond of each of them independently, even if it takes a while.\\n\\n\r\nMusic (6/10) \\n\r\nThe OP song is by ClariS again, very J~Poppy with catchy tunes it might not be remembered distinctly as all their songs sound the same but for as long as I was watching the series the OP song boomed in my head several times, it's very fitting for the title, The background music is primarily a guitar instrumental. Every episode has a new ED sung by the Seiyuus that I don't listen to before I move on to another episode. \\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting (8.5/10) \\n\r\nThe voice actors are chosen aptly for their roles, they're perfect and also popular (like Ayana Taketatsu and Kana Hanazawa) \\n\\n\r\n------x------\\n\r\nSo does OreImo get its fairytale ending? \\n\r\nThe second season ends at a cliffhanger without deducing anything and relies on the OVA to conclude the most important part and bring the series to a finish. \\n\r\nI'd be enraged if the series would end at a cliffhanger (Code Geass R1, Urggh) but then OVAs decided to make me angrier than I'd imagined, I was angry they chose an incestuous path but I was filled with fury once they decided to cop out because I always knew OreImo couldn't handle incest. Mind you, I am not trying to act righteous here, Who're we to decide if Incest is wrong or right but did the execution have to be so poor? I've seen \"Yosuga no Sora\" and liked it because it was able to place itself in that setting properly, What they do with OreImo is silly, it never sets the mood well for incest which is a way mature topic, It is manhandled jokingly like it's child's play. They, with their light-headedness take upon the idea, know they can't pull it off and then trash it. They take a whimsical on Incest and it's so terrorizing it's not even laughably bad, there's nothing gleeful or merriment about it just because the attempt is so chucklesome. It only provides distress to the watcher. OreImo feels like a half-hearted attempt of becoming extremely intense. With all that half-assed seriousness and half-baked emotions shoved into the show, OreImo was supposed to be a fun show with a message for siblings but they decided to go ahead and add bullscrap to it to make it deep, I don't know if Incest is morally right or wrong, it's arbitrary but it is morally wrong to go around spoiling if not polluting and corrupting a well-developed brother-sister relation,While their relationship as siblings is well-constructed and fleshed out. The love they both shared was familial and I never once sensed a romantic vibe.They had really matured in a relationship but not as lovers but as two siblings, Kyousuke is a protective, caring and reliable brother that Kirino admired, Kirino is his younger sister who Kyousuke adored. That never meant they had to fall in love with each other. Someone must be sick in the brain if they thought it's necessary to bring such a stupid,stupid plan to effect.\\n\\n\r\nI had to constantly keep my composure or else I really wanted to reach out and create a deep dent on the monitor screen. (Grr.. Makoto Itou, Shinji Matou) It's only the second time I've so strongly reacted to an anime after \"School Days\"\\n\r\n\"Let's just make them fall in and out of love because we can.\" Ha Ha. Right? Like a hot knife sliding through butter. \\n\r\n\"Let's date for a few days and go back to being brother & sister\" *blech* like that could ever happen unless you were merrily infatuated and only wanted to try things out. \\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't take itself too seriously,you shouldn't either because if you do you'll be crestfallen by the end, like me. As it was a really special anime to me and to other Otakus who could relate to it so flee away if you were a huge fan of the past season and aren't just ready to be so overwhelmed yet. My enjoyment was actually at its peak (8/9) while watching OreImo and though I'd give the previous season an overall score of 8 this season will have to be happy with a 5 or 6, I'd have given it a 6 if it weren't the sequel to OreImo which really set the bar high, but I am settling for a  5/10 as it is a bad sequel to a good prequel, everything that set it apart from the other harems has been neglected, OreImo2 is just a meagre Rom-Com now and I hate to say it but even \"Twilight makes a better love story than this\"\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts after watching OreImo2- \" Don't always go by the book \" (literally, do not)",

The first episode of the new series is fairly standard and is more about portraying the characters' \"REUNION\" ( a very fitting opening theme right there).\r\nThe real story makes progress as of episode 2 where Kirino is confronted by her best friend Ayase and about how kirino doesnt spend enough time with her and from then on each episode seems better than the previous one.

Back in 2010 when I first watched it I was almost kinda \"meh\" but boy was I wrong.

            "content": "Quite possibly the most fan-dividing anime of the year, OreImo is a tough cookie to even begin to review. If you've seen the first series, then the sudden u-turn in almost all aspects of the show will be shocking, to say the least. It might well go down in history as the anime which alienated the most fans, or it might even be the trendsetter for future harems, because what OreImo has to offer in controversy is matched by its brilliance.\r\nIf we were to ignore the original series, let alone forget that there is even a light novel that precedes it, then you couldprobably score OreImo a 9/10 and be done with it. There's delightful animation, hilarious romantic comedy, in depth characters, an insight into otaku culture, and an unique exploration of the once-taboo theme of incest. The problem is, this anime is a direct sequel to something far greater in almost every way. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nMuch to the disappointment of fans from season one, there are very few redeeming factors about the story of the second season. Gone is the eccentric plot revolving around the life advice sessions, with almost no sign of a story to replace it. There is next to no mention of Kirino's success with producing her own anime; Kirino's modelling and racing career is also sidelined but no replacement can be found. The only reliable plot that occurs involves Kyousuke and his new love interest in Kuroneko, which is probably one of the only bricks holding the fort together. It is relieving to know then that Kuroneko and Kyousuke's miniature plot-arc is possibly the best in the season. However, the rest of the series tries too hard to juggle the numerous characters in the harem without much in the way of linking them together. Overall, it would be wise to abandon hopes of a thrilling plot, as you will be better off focusing on the characters and comedy that will blow you away further than the story even travels.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThere is no mistaking the beautiful art that OreImo manages to tease our eyes with. Rich, vibrant colours and a wide variety of settings provide eye candy that many other animation studios envy. The character animation is superb and the attention to detail is impressive, to say the least. It doesn't quite have a masterpiece touch to make it a 10/10, but it's not far off. In general, high performance once again from a high-quality studio - cute girls have rarely been cuter.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nPersonally I have always found the soundtrack to this series entertaining in its own right, and whilst I slightly preferred the music from the first season, the quality is definitely the same across both. OP and ED are worth listening to in their own right, and you may find yourself occasionally humming a tune or two whilst doing the dishes. The voice acting is as per season one spot on, with believable accentuations and real emotion - particularly from the voice actor of Kuroneko (Hanazawa, Kana). As a whole, there is good reason to praise the sound artists, who are often undervalued for the factor they play in creating the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThis was undeniably a tough decision to make, because as far as a harem goes the two deciding factors for its worth are usually how funny it is and how good the characters and relationships are. Sadly, there are too many failures in OreImo for them to go unnoticed. Without wanting to spoil anything, my entire point can be summed up in one character: Asuna. Everything you knew about her has rapidly and inexplicably changed. It's no use arguing that \"it's explained in the light novels\" because the anime was designed to be watched alone and not to accompany its source. The script writers simply did a bad job of introducing the changes to her character. For reference, imagine taking Simon from Gurren Lagann in episode one, and then suddenly transition next episode to the Simon from the final episode. There is no impossibru face strong enough to describe how atrocious that would be, and yet the story decides it's appropriate with what used to be the anime's only grounded character. That being said, a few characters do escape the butcher's knife - the best being (luckily) the protagonists and Kuroneko. Kirino retains her enraging bitchiness whilst still managing to make you sympathetic towards her because of how (relatively) real she remains. Kyousuke actually feels more like the harem king this time around, as he becomes legitimately involved in the eroge games and shows his feelings about the other girls more acutely. A personal favourite of mine (and indeed of many) is Kuroneko, who cute factor aside, becomes possibly the deepest of all the characters explored in the entire anime. Her feelings are not an obsessive fad, or a confused bundle of emotions, but true and honest love. If you haven't yet seen the series, expect a treat amongst the waves of deplorably ignorant relationships. In conclusion, the characters probably won't meet your expectations - the controversy killing off many a fan - but there's probably a silver lining in there somewhere. You just need to look at it really hard.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nWhilst there are many pitfalls and dangerous waters (especially ship lovers - I won't even begin to mention the OVAs), OreImo does contain a multitude of comedic moments, of which at least some will have you laughing. It might not be crying-tears-of-laughter hilarious, but you might wake up your next door neighbour with an untimely fit of giggles, on at least one occasion. Making up for where the show lacks in story and plugging a few of the character void-holes has helped to make season 2 more than bearable. Even when characters do something completely out of character, it's more than likely that two seconds later Kyousuke will mess up or act silly in such a way that you can't help but smile. And whilst this should probably go in the character or story section, the sheer enjoyment from the Saori backstory plot is enough to carry three or four episodes alone. To summise, be prepared for anything. No seriously, anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThere are too many problems with OreImo season 2 for me to completely wash over them with the entertainment banner, but that being said it is not a bad anime either. As I initially said, most of the disappointment comes from this being a sequel to a contender for greatest harem of all time. The verdict? If you have seen the first season and the first set of OVAs, then season 2 is still worth watching, just don't expect to end on the exact same note as before. If not, then why are you watching this when you could be watching the first season? What you should really be worrying about is preparing to replace your monitor; because if you don't punch a hole through it after watching the second season OVAs, you truly are a master of control. \\n",

            "content": "OreImo has had something of a controversial history. And that's not too much of a surprise-- it pushes the notion that wanting to bone your (perhaps nonexistent) sister is perfectly fine. Mind you, there is nothing inherently wrong with incestuous themes when handled maturely. But OreImo is not mature. It had no intentions of being so. \r\nAnd yet, there was still more to OreImo than the incest appeal. The first season provided a social commentary on otaku culture and its perception in everyday society. It focused on characters that behave and react like human beings do, sometimes even at the cost of likability. When Kyousukeexpressed any interest in his sister around others, he was treated like a pervert and smacked upside the head. It almost wanted you to feel that there was something wrong with Kyousuke's and Kirino's growing relationship. Not entirely, perhaps, but there were always deeper, more intelligent themes than \"hey, this dude likes his sister\". \\n\\n\r\nOreImo's second season has none of this. There is no social commentary. There are no believable characters. Whatever the series had to set itself apart from any other ecchi or harem series is now gone. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are relentlessly crippled by this downfall and Ayase receives the full extent of it. She was characterized as being level-headed and diligent in the first season; the proverbial \"model student\", albeit with a tendency to berate anybody she sees as odd. Where is this in the second season? Apparently nowhere. Ayase has become victim to the 'yandere' stereotype, cranked up to eleven, knife and crazy-eyes included. For no conceivable reason, she also develops (and acts on her) feelings for Kyousuke, entirely contradicting her belief that Kirino's happiness is most important. The most believable character in the series has been reduced to wrapping paper. \\n\\n\r\nKirino is a love-or-hate character, and whichever side you lean towards, the second season is not going to do much to change your mind. There is plenty more of the rampant complaining that she was so known for in the first season, including an episode comprising of her lying to Kyousuke, insulting him and proceeding to slap him across the face. I could never really get myself to hate her, though, because while she embodies everything wrong with teenage girls, there are always signs that she has remorse for her actions. That and the fact that she's voiced by Ayana Taketatsu. \\n\\n\r\nYou will likely develop a more positive opinion of Kuroneko, though. For the middle third of the story, she is made the principal character. A love interest, too. And unlike the rest of the female cast (Kirino excluded) whose feelings seem entirely forced and superficial, Kuroneko's feelings for Kyousuke are explored in detail. Her love is genuine. It doesn't feel shoehorned in to add an extra number to the harem, and that is perhaps the greatest compliment an anime like this can receive. \\n\\n\r\nBut her story arc eventually blunders about. It is marred, like most things, by superfluous drama at the end. The end of Kuroneko's arc simply consists of Kirino screaming at Kuroneko for the entire episode. Worse, Kuroneko's motivations are not even established once the conflict is finally resolved. All we get are a few ambiguous statements which further contradict her actions. What an awful note to end it on. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say that everything has gone wrong; a few of the episodes are legitimately good. Kuroneko's lighthearted episodes exemplify the good points of the series (and are wholly adorable), while Saori's backstory provides an interesting glimpse into the life of otaku while fleshing out her character in equal measure. The show is plenty capable of being fun; it just regularly chooses not to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending will leave many scratching their heads. It might even be misleading to call it an ending, as it wraps up nothing and shamelessly expects the audience to follow up with the OVAs for answers. Still, it's a nice way to detail Kyousuke's and Kirino's relationship as children and shed some light as to why they act the way they do. Suddenly Kirino doesn't seem half as infuriating as she used to. \\n\\n\r\nTechnicals considering, OreImo 2 is an impressive anime. It looks better than the previous season which was already impressive in itself. There are few scenes where the artwork manages to dip in quality, and the depth of field effect between character and scenery achieves in giving the show a more professional look. The facial expressions are also drawn and animated fluidly, which serves well to enhance the comedic scenes and portray the emotions of each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing spectacular but does the job perfectly fine. Occasionally the soundtrack works to the story's advantage, and scenes that would otherwise feel hackneyed are instead able to stir up a few emotions. On the other hand, the opening is a generic J-Pop song that you will forget almost immediately as it ends. The ending sequences are pleasant, though perhaps not as much for the animation or songs as they are for the variety. It's hard to argue against a new ending for every episode.  \\n\\n\r\nOreImo 2 is not a bad anime, but it is a bad sequel. Whatever you found appealing about the first season is likely to be gone here. It is made to be palatable solely to harem fans and incest fetishists, and those stuck somewhere in between are bound to find this season lacking any sort of cohesion.\\n\\n\r\nA good sequel aims to improve, not to throw away everything that made it unique in the first place. OreImo 2 is a fundamentally broken anime.",

            "content": "This will be my review on Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai S2 (OreImo2), one of the more popular animes depicting sibling relationships in detail.\r\nOreImo2 takes place right after the events of the specials of season 1. In a fitting opening episode, the still-awkward relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke can be readily seen, demonstrating that the two of them still have a ways of bonding to go, until the girl's otaku habits bring the two of them together. \r\nThere's a distinct change between this second season and the preceeding season. While the first season focused on Kirino's 'initiation' into otaku culture, andher brother earnestly helping her with that transition... the second season delves into the relationship between the two of them, and their friends around them; particularly Kuroneko and Ayase. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, OreImo2 may seem like it degraded to a harem rom-comedy, and that argument wouldn't be entirely false. However, seeing the relationships between Kyousuke and Kirino develop over the season's events, and how they deal with the reality that they someday might find a significant other was something that I particularly enjoyed. Of course, some scenes felt a little over the top at times, but the intentions and feelings were there. Kuroneko's arc was also a treat; her feelings for Kyousuke felt very real and sincere, and through her actions it's evident that she still cares for her best friend Kirino, regardless of her affections for her brother. Seeing these conflicting emotions is one of the selling points of this season. \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint would be Ayase's arc... while she's still an enjoyable character to watch, and though she might report me for saying this, her sudden attraction towards Kyousuke was a little unexplained and came off a little too... harem-esque... if you catch my drift. \\n\\n\r\nOther than those main caveats, the season is filled with episodes that were just nice to watch, such as Saori's past, and Kirino/Kyousuke's childhood. Regardless of their content, the main themes and feelings of OreImo are still there. The characters are still a blast to watch and the gags they make are funny. Never once did I feel that there was 'something wrong' with the second season. \\n\\n\r\nThose tired with the harem rom-com angle with animes may find this season lacking and disappointing, but for those who enjoyed the first season and don't mind the change of pace, will still find the new OreImo just as enjoyable as the old. \\n",

            "content": "The idea of incest makes my stomach turn so as you can imagine the title \u201cMy Little Sister Can\u2019t Be This Cute\u201d (English translation) put me off big time. However, after watching the first season of this show by the recommendation of a friend, I found that not only was this show incest free, but also hugely entertaining and surprisingly deep just like \u201cBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\u201d.\r\nThe key word here is surprisingly deep. \r\nHow so? Enter season 2 -\r\nThe first, fourth, fifth and sixth episode of this season hint at what this show is really about: a guy who was outshined by his littlesister, the resentful little sister who lost the close bond she once shared with her older brother when they were young, the formerly close relationship that was ruined by the older brother\u2019s resentment and their awkward attempts to rebuild their relationship as siblings after the little sister\u2019s secret hobby comes to light. \\n\\n\r\n(My interpretation is based off of that dream Kyosuke had at the prologue of episode one, Kyosuke\u2019s inner monologue in episode four, Kyosuke\u2019s reaction to Kirino\u2019s revelation in episode five and six and Kirino\u2019s reactions to what Kyosuke says and does in episode 5\u2026you know your agent wasn\u2019t following you guys, Kirino\u2026GTFO\u2026also some stuff Kirino says involving Kyosuke\u2019s childhood friend Manami in the first season)\\n\\n\r\nThrough Kirino\u2019s secret otaku hobby, both protagonists gain different things: Kirino slowly gets to spend time with the older brother she thought she lost again without having to lose the pride and hard fa\u00e7ade she built up to mask her hurt feelings (if the dream sequence of episode one really happened). \\n\\n\r\nKyosuke on the other hand gains friends, potential love interests, excitement in his life and most importantly the little sister he rejected when they were young, whose cold reaction to him (pre-secret-revelation and the misadventures they have together again post-secret-revelation) make him realize just how much he cares about her (if episode one sequence is foreshadowing and I\u2019m not reading too much into this).\\n\\n\r\nUntil this show, \u201cBen-To\u201d and \u201cBoku wa Tomodachi\u201d, I\u2019ve always hated Light Novel adaptations because they were too fantastical and obnoxious, a cramming of too many outrageous ideas that could potentially be amazing but didn\u2019t go anywhere (The sharp object wielder in \u201cBakemonogatari\u201d, the walking church character in \u201cA Certain Magical Index\u201d and that done to death Masou Shoujou joke of \u201cIs This a Zombie\u201d come to mind). \\n\\n\r\nIf your mind isn\u2019t already racing with this review let me add that this show is fantastic and inspiring, a concept that is deceptively simple, yet hides layers of touching depth.  Just like \u201cBoku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\u201d (a show you should also check out and watch for what it is, a light read novel that has been animated)\\n\\n\r\nWatch it, you won\u2019t regret it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "So....what would you do when you find out your cute little sister who you haven't seen in years is a closet otaku?\r\nA) Be in denial and pretend it's a lie\r\nB) Never face your sister again\r\nC) Tell her to end her hobby (this could result in some bitch slaps and higher hospital fees)\r\nD) Support her and swear on your life to never tell anyone about it\r\nThink hard. Well, it doesn't' matter which choice you pick because either way, you will be stuck with your cute little sister with the undeniable fact that she is a closet otaku. In the end, you're just going to have todeal with it and think ahead.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's back. Ore no Im\u014dto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai (My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute) is the direct sequel that aired from the Spring line up of 2013 that directly continues from the True End arc. Yes, it is actually required to watch those four episodes so if you haven't done so yet, do it now. There's nothing stopping you. At any rate, the series is back and with a title this long, it's hard to take it seriously right? Well, no but this sequel does have a lot of entertainment, some rubbed in the right and others in the wrong way. For the purpose of my laziness and ease of reading, I'll just simply refer to this sequel as Oreimo 2.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie here. This was one of my most anticipated series from the Spring lineup. Going by the MAL statistics, I might not been the only one with the amount of hype surrounding this sequel. At any rate, Oreimo 2 is here! To do a little refreshment, we have the cute little sister Kirino who we know from the beginning is known as a closet otaku. Her tastes in games seems to be related to little sisters and the eroge genre. This seems to rub her brother Kyosuke the wrong way. In fact, the two does not get along at all. Kyousuke tries to be the supportive brother like a good sibling but Kirino sees him as the following: pervert, lolicon, and a brother who may have the sister complex. While not all of these may truly describe Kyousuke for who he is, there's certainly tension between the duo. Their relationship seems to not go along well most of the time. Kirino is the dominant of the duo and often ridicules Kyousuke at many occasions. It seems like Kyousuke has to deal with her tsundere tendencies, outbursts, and rather awkward accusations. At many times, there's the misunderstandings too that further implements problems. Long story short, Kirino and Kyousuke does not get along very well and in this sequel, it doesn't get off to a good start with that either.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are times in this season that does show a supportive side from both sides of the siblings. Although they both seem to deny it, it's quite obvious that both Kirino and Kyousuke are frustrated if either one of them gets a lover. In other words, there's something in their heart that seems to tell their brutal honest selves that they don't want the other side to enjoy a healthy relationship. I guess perhaps their relationship does have a loving side, in that sibling way. And speaking of love, there's more ways than just one.\\n\\n\r\nIn Oreimo 2, love is in the air especially with our other characters. Well, it can come into many shapes and sizes such as the yandere Ayase. I'm not a big fan of her's but her screen time was definitely appreciable for the way she seems to talk down Kyousuke but at the same time seems to enjoy their awkward relationship. Otherwise, there's my favorite cosplayer and arch-rival of Kirino from this series....the one and only one.....*drum roll*.....\\n\\n\r\nRuri \u201cKuroneko\u201d Goko!\\n\\n\r\nVoiced by the ultra talented voice actress Kana Hanazawa, Kuroneko gets quite the spotlight that she deserves in this sequel. Just like in season one, Kuroneko is like the opposite of Kirino and gets in her face at almost everything. Think of it this way. They are like oil and water, snake and mongoose, colors dyed red and blue. It's hate at first sight defined at its finest. Nonetheless, the two simply does not get along at all. The catch is in this sequel, there's even an new additional factor added in that causes Kyousuke to be part of the equation. And no it doesn't involve eroge. That's part of the 2D world.\\n\\n\r\nAmong other things, Oreimo 2 seems to like to push drama forward between various characters. Well, there's more than just our can't-get-along-at all siblings. Rather, it also deals with other characters. For instance, we even have supporting characters who plays various roles in steaming up some awkward moments. This usually results in Kirino lashing out her tsundere tendencies at full force. The receiving side usually seems to be our poor Kyousuke who is accused of being a lolicon, sister-con, etc etc. Well, not everything rides on Kyousuke's bad side though. There are some nice girls such as Manami, Kuroneko's siblings, and even a track rival of Kirino's. Unfortunately, Kyousuke is too damn dense to ever notice anything most of the time. It doesn't help with the various misunderstandings either that often again puts Kyousuke on the wrong side of life such as drama in the club room. Get your popcorn out folks and watch those moments go fly in the air.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the fan service goes, this sequel surprisingly doesn't have as much as I had thought. Well, it does have some though. While it omits the typical beach episode, the series has Kyosuke at edge of some awkward camera angles. Then, there's the outfit that Kirino wears that seems to either be for eye candy or even perhaps a foreshadowing. Either way, the fan service of this series is not as much as you may imagine. What Oreimo 2 does offer more though is doses of fun gags. It's not just those catchy end cards that some people might miss at the end of each episode. Rather, it's the dialogues such as the typical \u201cI hate you\u201d from Kirino that seems to have a completely opposite meaning. Then, there's also innocent talks with some dirty words mixed in spoken by kids too young. If \u201cbitch brother\u201d isn't part of that gag, I don't know what it is. Oh and let's not forget the rather indirect references to eroge games like sausage eating.\\n\\n\r\nThe story structure of the series seems to be a bit loose although middle part seems to be the main dish of the meal. Some of the other episodes seems to be more as ingredients. By ingredients, I mean the supporting characters. With its blissful cast of side characters, there's a lot of screen time for many of them. Kirino though is still the main girl. Regardless, Kirino can barely stand Kyousuke while the latter has trouble dealing with her own love issues. In fact, Kyousuke becomes the sort of center of attention with the girls as he gets quite a lot of surprises in this sequel. Kirino on the other hand isn't happy by this but being the tsundere that she is, it's obvious how she responds. I found this a bit out of place and way out there. What deserved have been there though should be materials that were intact from the light novels. Perhaps the development of the story requires some cramming but it's something not too consistent enough for my liking. \\n\\n\r\nIn technical terms of artwork, the series remains its similar style as the previous season. If artistic value is taken account, one could imply the adorable way some of the designs are drawn in particular the younger cast and Kuroneko. The way she cosplays is also quite catchy whether Kirino likes it or not. That gothic getup with the cat ears is just appealing and something most of us might not be able to take eyes off of. It's not too shabby either with the backgrounds too in terms of animation values. I would say that the overall artwork of season 2 is relatively the same as its prequel. \\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack, the series continues the pattern of lighthearted pattern. To add to some extra gags, each of the ending episode concludes with a different song with different artwork. You might want to keep your hands on that print screen button because those end cards are something worth of a thousand words. Most of the seiyuu voices portrays their voices as well to fit their characters. Kirino remains a tsundere with her voice. Kyousuke's tone often reflects both supportive and frustration. Kuroneko's soft and touching voice gives off that feeling of adorableness. The OP song \"reunion\" by ClariS brings back indeed a reunion between many of the characters. There's also a bit of perhaps foreshadowing in the song as there seems to be a famous red string of fate at the finger tips of Kyousuke swining to one side but never reaching its target. Hmm.....\\n\\n\r\nBy all means, Oreimo 2 is not a masterpiece. At least it did something right to get more people to watch this series from the first place with its unusual premise. Perhaps the drama can be seen differently from some to others. Then, there's those dialogues. Some of them are catchy while others tries too hard. What it did catch though is a burst of laughter at several occasions for me. With all set and done, this sequel awaits you but only if you finished season 1 and its true end. For fans of Oreimo, this is a continuation. After all, there's no way a series you've finished season one and true end can be just dropped without giving at least the first episode a try.",

            "content": "To be honest, I still don\u2019t really understand Oreimo. Even after the second season, there\u2019s still things that I\u2019m unsure of. At a glance, the title suggests a story between a sister and a brother, but the thing is, looking back at two seasons of Oreimo, I really don\u2019t think that definition fits all too well.\r\nHere\u2019s the thing - yes, it is a story about a sister and her brother. But that\u2019s not all - Oreimo isn\u2019t just that. Oreimo doesn\u2019t just explore the relationship between a brother and a sister, Oreimo divulges into everyday life, in this case I suppose, the everyday life ofan otaku schoolgirl struggling through her slightly different lifestyle. It\u2019s also the story of a very average brother trying to do his best to protect his beloved sister - in which their relationship, has long fallen apart. And again, that\u2019s not all. It\u2019s also the story of friends, friends joined by a common interest, friends joined together to enjoy life, and solve each other's problems. That, is Oreimo. Daily life. Of an otaku, or rather, several otakus and their non-otaku friends.\\n\\n\r\nIn that aspect, it\u2019s not hard at all to call Oreimo simple. It really is, just the daily lives of a sister and her brother, and the people that surround them. There\u2019s no intense magical girl fighting (at least, not *real* magical girl fighting), emotionally depressing family problems, no sword-wielding monster-slaying chicks that cross between worlds, no insane amount of unrealistic harem situations, no no, there\u2019s none of that at all. Oreimo, is simple, yet enjoyable. Why? Because it speaks to it\u2019s audience. I found myself divulged in Oreimo in the same way that Kirino was obsessed with Meruru. In the same way Kirino has her collection of Meruru figurines, I have my own personal collection of anime paraphernalia that I treasure and admire. Hell, even I want to go to Akihabara.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose such a pretense leads to a few issues - like the fact that Oreimo slightly lacks focus. Although it\u2019s undoubtedly true that Oreimo spends a lot of time focused on the brother-sister relationship between Kyousuke and Kirino, it also spends a lot of time exploring things that are slightly random. It\u2019s like every once in awhile, Oreimo simply benches the brother-sister relationship backstory, and focuses on other aspects of it\u2019s story. Of course, I\u2019m not really complaining, because if it had not done that, it really would have been solely a story of a brother and a sister, and nothing more. And I for one, believe that such a story probably wouldn\u2019t have been all too interesting. Because it\u2019s not like this lack of direction really affects the anime at all - it\u2019s not like we\u2019re lacking character or story development, every single \u201carc\u201d within Oreimo, does develop both the cast and the story. Everything somehow ties back to one main idea in the end, and there are no useless episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, if there was one thing about Oreimo that I really appreciated, was the cast. i don\u2019t think I ever found myself in absolute hatred of a character after finishing the finale of Oreimo. In fact, I was pretty attached to the entire cast as a whole - they were fleshed out pretty well, and although in some places were underdeveloped, all in all, they were pretty well done. I suppose if I had to label a single problem to Oreimo, it would be that some of the characters, are slightly underdeveloped. If I were to label them, theres no doubt in my mind that I would have loved to see more of Kanako, the Akagi sister-brother pair, and a little more of Saori, although she was actually pretty well developed. I suppose to an extent, this lack of development is acceptable, since if Oreimo were to really develop all of these characters, the story really would have lost focus and became random to the point of being bad.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I\u2019m not really complaining, because realistically, not only were the characters fleshed out pretty well, they were also drawn pretty well. The animation is pretty well done, although something like that is to be expected of an anime produced in 2013.\\n\\n\r\nThe other well-produced aspect of Oreimo, is more than likely the soundtrack. Like the animation, it\u2019s to be expected that an anime produced in 2013 should have a good, acceptable soundtrack, and Oreimo is no exception, but to be honest, although it was well produced, there was nothing really special to it. The opening, on the other hand, is a great choice. It would have been bad for Oreimo to have broken the style of the opening theme from the original, first season of Oreimo. Although I do have to say that I\u2019m not too sure about carrying over the concept of a different ending for EVERY episode from the first season of Oreimo was too good of an idea. I really think that it would have been better to just have another ClariS song as the ending. But then again, the ever-changing ending animation was pretty interesting, and I don\u2019t doubt that a decent amount of work was put into it, because instead of pasting the same ending animation on every episode, Oreimo has a different ending animation, and song, for every episode, which I found mildly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nRealistically though, between Oreimo 1 and Oreimo 2, I can strongly say that nothing has really changed. For me, Oreimo 2 is only better because it\u2019s a continuation, and I get to see more of the Kirino that I\u2019ve enjoyed for two seasons straight, and get to explore more of the relationships and stories of friends surrounding Kirino and her brother.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I suppose that Oreimo is one of those animes that never try to be overtly flashy. Oreimo didn\u2019t try to provoke anything overtly powerful within it\u2019s viewers. It merely set out to explore the lives of it\u2019s cast, and in doing so, pleased it\u2019s audience quite well. It\u2019s the kind of anime that doesn\u2019t need anything more other than more episodes to do the same thing it\u2019s been doing for it\u2019s entire life span. But the thing is, having said all that, Oreimo isn\u2019t the kind of anime that you just bench once it\u2019s done. Some would disagree with me, but I know for myself at the very least, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is the kind of anime that I probably wont forget, and given the choice to stick Kirino on my back windshield, or any other anime character, I\u2019d probably pick Kirino.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s just that cute.\\n",

This isn't for you this is for everybody who hated or has yet to see this show.\r\nSecondly if you are thinking of watching this show DON'T DO IT. You'll hate your life and it will make you beyond depressed. DON'T DO IT.\r\nOverall (after season 1) I had hope for this show. A lot of hope actually. But it didn't even try to make the story worthwhile. It became a game to see how many girls he could make cry in thespace of three episodes (the last three) and then after he picks the girl he wants aka his sister (yes this is incest) they stop dating. Basically leaving him with no girls at all from where before he has five bitches/lovely ladies to choose from. He could have had a loli, a childhood friend, a hot model girlfriend but no. He chooses his annoying little sister, who he knows is annoying and doesn't even make it last. I really hope this writer is happy because I'm not. Pathetic writing. I get that it's different but you shouldn't write to just depress your audience. I can even do that, shit I could make the whole world cry from a story if i wanted to. Getting them attached to a character or even a set of characters then systematically tear their love life apart easily without feeling. That's why this anime sucks. Waste of animation budget that could have been used on something else. This may seem like a nerd rant but seriously think of it this way. If you don't have a girlfriend/wife/lover/etc (if you do pretend you don't) and then imagine you have all these girls around you wanting to be your special lover. Most are willing to do about anything. Now reject each and everyone, watch them cry without feeling sad. That is feeling this anime gave me. If you love watching girls cry go ahead watch this anime, otherwise run, run and never look back at this crapfest. goodbye fellas next review is Seikon No Qwaser.. I'm not excited about it either.",

            "content": "OreImo. The anime that I couldn't figure out for the life of me is now more obvious than a vegetarian in a grocery shop and about as complex as a technical drawing of a hammer. It has stooped down to the level of your average harem and the studio didn't even do a good job at that.\r\nNow let's recap what made the first season fairly decent. First of all, it was realistic with a capital R and focused not only on the relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino but also on the Otaku community at large. The characters behaved naturally and in my opinion were asclose as any anime has gotten to simulating real human beings. Now bear this in mind as we describe what happens with that realism in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story takes Kyosuke and virtually all the girls in the cast, puts massive magnets on them and lets the pinball games begin. Some girls repel each other, some girls end up being pushed away but they're all eventually attracted to Kyosuke. The complexity and the realness set forth by the first season is brutally crushed, replaced with plot points and confessions that you could see coming from a mile away with both of your eyes covered. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just when the series begs for mercy a spectacular coup de gr\u00e2ce is delivered. Kyosuke, the martyr and defender of logic and reason from the first season turns more into your average perverted harem lead, welcoming this new found female attention hand over fist, without thinking about it too much. Shower spying, perverted fantasies, conversations about tits... fanservice? Yeah it's all here. OreImo2 is up to its knees with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe female cast itself is a mixed bag as far as plot progression and character development goes. Kirino is as annoying as ever. First she hates her brother and wipes the floor with him, second she gets all lovey-dovey and clings to him like a bubble gum to a shoe sole... before proceeding to wipe the floor with the poor guy yet again. You'd wish she'd just give it to him straight. Nope. She loves, hates and is neutral towards him while he dances around her like a jester before a King in a castle courtyard. \\n\\n\r\nKuroneko and Saori though receive considerable time and go through some much needed character development. Saori's background story deepens her character and shows us that not all things might be as they seem. Kuroneko on the other hand opens up more and we see the more shy and vulnerable side of her as well as her true feelings for Kyosuke. I have to say that out of all the characters, her story arc was the most satisfying and emotionally engaging. For a few episodes at least, you get to see a genuine romance.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Manami, Ayase and Kanako - it's nothing short of a disaster. Manami gets royally shafted for the entire duration of this season. She's only there to provide advice once in a blue moon, appears in a flash back or two but don't hope for any development, not between her and Kyosuke or anyone else for that matter. Ayase, seemingly the only girl possessing common sense among her circle of friends becomes wholly shallow and is the first casualty, becoming nothing more than an addition to Kyouske's harem. Do not expect anything remotely interesting from her. Kanako ends up the same way as Ayase and though not confessing directly you can see what's going on because at this point the show becomes so predictable and un-realistic you might as well watch paint dry or play ping-pong with a can of soda.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode of OreImo2 is inconclusive and will leave you with a headache and a rash, both probably from anger and disappointment. Which means, yes flashbacks pertaining to Kyosuke and Kirino. While it gave us an insight as to why his sister disses him all the time, it was not a good way to end the anime. \\n\\n\r\nMany fans and casual watchers alike (myself among them) have been looking forward to the second installment in this series, hoping for a decent follow-up on the brother-sister relationship centered around the otaku culture. More than anything I think, everyone was hoping for some sort of a conclusion. However it is obvious now that the studio is intent on milking this series as much as possible and that means that the cast and the plot will be severely dumbed down.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the visual and audio aspect - it stays exactly the same. Well drawn characters, attention paid to every detail and a decent OST. The opening and ending songs might seem a bit plain but personally I've never paid any attention to that and never include it as part of my grading criteria.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, OreImo2 is a failure. The story doesn't progress as much as I feel it should have given 13 episodes, though we are given a superb Kuroneko arc and Saori's own story was engaging too. Those two gems are surrounded by harem and a vast repository of bogus drama and Kirino's bipolarity. This season does not carry the plot of the first one well and as such, there's not much left to like about this anime anymore.",

            "content": "OreImo is back! Now with more fanservice and less fun!\r\nNo but really, when I heard OreImo gets a second season I was pretty excited. I loved the first season, it was really entertaining and I had a blast with it. It wasn\u2019t anything great but a good laugh and a lot of Otaku references.\r\nWith season 2 though a lot of this changed. I\u2019m not sure if it is me that changed or if A1 Pictures is at fault, or even if the source material is not that good. But season 2 was the biggest disappointment of the year so far.\r\nStory/Content\r\nKyouske and his sister Kirino areback, this time it revolved all around their relationship and more drama/romance as in contrast to the first season which had more comedy.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that Season2 didn\u2019t have any comedy, but just not as much.\\n\r\nThe start is slow and not very good, it gets scattered episodes that are actually enjoyable only to mix in the ones that are bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt just doesn\u2019t work. The romance part of the show should a) not be with Kirino and her Brother and b) not so dramatic.\\n\r\nEverything is just really unrealistic and over the top, you cannot make real drama seem appropriate in a show that is so nonsensical. It harmed the overall feel of the show big time and I was mostly at the verge of dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nThank goodness the last episode was actually good, so I\u2019m not writing this with fury but rather a calm disappointed aftertaste of what the show was in general.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWhile everyone was as they were in season 1, it kinda felt like a magical reset. I know they want you to get into it again, but the feeling of starting from 0 was still there.\\n\r\nWe got some insight on other characters this time but nothing that had any impact on the show overall.\\n\r\nI mean what was the point of a backdrop for Saori if she is missing most of the time?\\n\r\nI mean nice to know what other people have as backdrop but in the end the focus was on Kirino.\\n\r\nEven the hoped for romance between Kuroneko and Kyousuke was disappointing and went nowhere.\\n\r\nAnd the worst of it all was Kirino, as she was a worse TSUNdere than ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus was weak this season, everyone got a tiny bit only to be sacrificed by Kirino which pissed a lot of people off.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe original was done by studio AIC, this time A1 Picture did the job.\\n\r\nNormally A1 has pretty good production values, and it\u2019s not like OreImo looked bad, but an average looking show can\u2019t be helped.\\n\r\nWhat we did get though were a lot of asses.\\n\\n\r\nI mean A1 Pictures kinda needs to squeeze in a lot of Ass-Fanservice in every show they make, at least that\u2019s what I see.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not really that it would ruin the show, since it is already not a serious show to begin with, so fanservice doesn\u2019t ruin it. But the amount of it was definitely increased.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest is the same, character designs look pretty bland, the sceneries are just as underwhelming, and animation is average stuff.  \\n\\n\r\nNot the worst looking show of the season, but sure right in the middle of mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nEven worse is the music in OreImo 2. I can\u2019t quite remember what it sounded like in season one, but I guess it wasn\u2019t much better.\\n\r\nThe opening is cheezy and the general BGM just fitting but not great.\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors are you normal to good modern presentation. I mean we have Kana Hanazawa and Yuuichi Nakamura. They are all talented so yeah it\u2019s good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWell apart from a few episodes or scenes season 2 was a let down. I sometimes even hated it and just wanted to throw my computer out the window on how bad it was.\\n\r\nWhile the enjoyable episodes were good enough to fill my sparse free time with some good moments.\\n\r\nThe last episode really helped the show not to leave behind this image of the worst thing ever in my memory.\\n\r\nBut I guess this is it for me. If a season 3 comes out, nope thank you. It\u2019s not worth it anymore and it lost its magic.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\\n\r\nContent 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise and Setting 0 (same as before, also not great) \\n\r\nGenre Execution -1 (compared to season 2 a failure)\\n\r\nDialogues and Cleverness 0 (not as funny as season 2 but had its moments)\\n\r\nInterest keeping 0 (sometimes I thought I\u2019d drop it, but then it saved it with a good episode)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality 0 (cliches but fun to watch)\\n\r\nBehavior and Chemistry 0 (enjoyable from time to time)\\n\r\nDevelopment and Progression 0 (not really there)\\n\r\nMotivation and Backdrop +1 (we actually got some backdrop for some of the characters)\\n\r\nLikability 0 (while some of them are very likable, Kirino is not)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle 0 (generic)\\n\r\nQuality 0 (okay)\\n\r\nBackground 0 (unremarkable)\\n\r\nCharacter Designs -1 (cheap looking)\\n\r\nVisual Effects 0 (used not often)\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting +1 (many talented people)\\n\r\nOpening and Ending -1 (waaaaay too cheesy)\\n\r\nSoundtrack 0 (uninteresting)\\n\r\nSound Effects 0 (the usual)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 0 (okay)\\n\r\nSound 0 (almost bad, but voice actors are good enough to enjoy it nonetheless)\\n\r\nStory and Content -1 (too many annoying episodes)\\n\r\nCharacters 0 (a different focus would have made it better)\\n\r\nValue 0 (unlike season 1 I will hopefully forget about this one)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOreImo2 is my disappointment of the year... It\u2019s sad and it made me angry. Suddenly I focused too much on the bad aspects of the show and couldn\u2019t enjoy myself like I used to in season 1.\\n\r\nWhile it ends not as terrible as it starts out, it still was just very bad overall.\\n\\n\r\n4,2/10\\n\r\n~4/10 (bad)\\n",

I have only this to say:\r\nI didn't do any research before starting this story so I had no idea what I was going into. First I read the short manga and then just had to see the anime how the story progresses. I really had high hopes that the tale wouldn't be about romantic relations with siblings. Of course I was wrong and wasted a lot of time to see incest romance unravel itself.\r\nWhy did I keep watching? Because I honestly thought that this would be a nice tale about brother and sister who regaintheir relationship as normal siblings. Oh how was I disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nStory is rubbish and even though it's a cliche: You see the rushed ending coming a mile away. Seriously don't waste your time. Learn from my mistakes. There isn't even any depth to the topic of incest. I wish I never watched this.",

            "content": "OreImo is the pandering of everyday events of the siblings: Kyousuke and Kirino. If you want an anime with siblings of the opposite gender, along with love interests for the main male character, and very basic plot devices, then this is the anime for you. Plot devices in this anime are used in the most basic of forms, meaning an unexpected twist. To make the predictable unpredictable is one major gripes that I have with OreImo, and it just fails so miserably when the story steers itself back in the direction it came from. The twist just became absolutely unnecessary. It also doesn\u2019t help whenside characters introduced from the previous season are completely eliminated just so the plot can better flow.\\n\\n\r\nAt no point while watching this anime did I feel even remotely attached to any of the characters, and this is due to the fact that I\u2019ve previously stated: The pandering of everyday events. It\u2019s like watching a dog circle around a patch of grass, sniffing the ground for that sweet spot to lay a pile of dung, and then simply walk away once it had done its task. Not a care in the world even though it went through so much effort to find that sweet spot. This is what OreImo is. It panders the story around in a way that turns the characters into backdrops and reminding you that you should have some emotional attachment only when they implement their unnecessary plot twist. It tries to build the characters in a way that you would relate and find attachable, but the end result is meaningless, and again, this is attributed to the fact that the story manages to steer itself back into its predictable plot line even after a twist has occurred.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the characters develop their meaningless relationships, expect many moments of comic relief because this is about as funny as it\u2019ll ever get. As a comedy, OreImo relies on short skits to make you have a quick laugh. Combined with the more serious tone of the plot, this is an anime that lacks a central focus.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the main plot had run its course, the writers decide to re-introduce a love interest for the male protagonist. A character that they\u2019ve neglected. And the story was so bad. It felt like they had to write and animate this short story just to appease the fans or simply meet the thirteen episode quota. A complete waste of time and money.",

            "content": "I'd like to start this review off with my thoughts and opinions on the show's story. \r\nIn my opinion, I thought the story was very relatable (Minus the harem). Will someone out  in the world  disagree with me? I think yes. Because not everyone will think this show is relatable. During the first season, you see Kirino as an Otaku who is simply trying to keep it a secrete that she plays little sister eroge games. I relate to that because in my society, anime watchers are simply classified as \"nerds\". The story really goes deep inside the life of not only ahigh school student's life, (If Japanese student life includes harem and a lot of misunderstanding relationships between a brother and sister), and a life of an Otaku who is trying to live a normal life. \\n\\n\r\nFor the art of this anime, I found it wonderful. In some episodes when two characters find themselves arguing, They end showing you this other world (an alternate dimension if you will) where they have these magical girl clothing on and they begin to fight. Which I found very cool. If I wasn't very descriptive I apologize. Basically the cool fighting stuff in Chuunibyou Demo Shikai, or Black Rock Shooter you see in those shows is what I was trying to explain. I found those scenes very amusing. When they aren't in those action scenes, the art was overall good and was goofy when something funny happens.\\n\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack in this anime, I found both of the openings catchy because of it's upbeat rhythm. The endings how ever I tend to skip unless the ending credits were rolling as the episode was still playing its last few moments. I will tell you that each episode has a different song. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters, I can't say every character developed from start to finish. But at least the main characters such as Kyousuke, Kirino, Kuroneko, Saori (boy did she have a bug development in a non perverted way), and Ayase had development. I'd say why and how but I can't do it without spoiling a lot of the story plot. You'll just have to watch and see. Also I say that these characters are the only ones with development because the other characters in the anime just didn't touch your heart unlike the characters mentioned above\\n\\n\r\nNow if you're going to ask me if I enjoyed this anime, I would have to say, I enjoyed it very much. It had lots of comedy that you will find extremely funny no matter who you are. You will find a lot of it's emotional scenes touching, and despite the development of some of the characters, you will eventually end up loving all of them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall yes I did enjoy this wonderful anime. It made me realize that siblings have an intense bond that can never be broken. No matter how much you THINK you hate them. Deep inside you know you love them as a family. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for comedy, and a just a fun anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow that this anime review is over, I bid you farewell ^o^\\n\r\n~SuperNinja\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'd be the first person to tell you that Season 1 was way better than I thought it would be. I actually liked it, which surprised me, as I thought I would hate it. Hearing there was a second season, I was a little mixed, because I had this feeling that if the show went on any longer it might actually lead to incest. I was fine with the Season 1 ending, but I watched Season 2 anyway. I'm here to say I made a huge mistake. \r\nWhere Season 1 was funny, different, and just a joy to watch, Season 2 was boring, cliche, andannoying to watch. The show got too serious for its own good, and it suffered because of it. It also doesn't help that this season had the same amount of time to adapt 2 extra light novels, so a lot of the books were taken out (more than what was taken out in Season 1 at least). \\n\\n\r\nI didn't like where they went with any of the characters. Kirino was even more of a bitch than she was last season, Kyousuke became really freaking weird (it was borderline creepy really), and nobody else was important. Aside from Kuroneko, who is cool. We learn more about Saori, which was a good thing, but that wasn't enough to save the rest of this show from being really bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values in this show stayed the same from the previous season, which was another good thing. I will admit that I didn't find either of the jpop openings or ending particularly good, but they aren't bad either. But no amount of amazing openings and endings would make this shows story any better (and it isn't the kind of show you can watch just for how good it looks and sounds). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think you are better off just not watching Season 2, and letting the show end at Season 1 (after the 4 OVAs). A good ending might have changed my vote, but I got spoiled of the ending and all I'll say is this: it isn't good.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 61/100\\n",

            "content": "Well I didn't plan on reviewing this but the \"controverse\" about it makes me want to.\r\nSpoilers to be expected here and there.\r\nFirst, let's start with the easy stuff.\r\n- Art is outstanding, as you would expect it's in that \"light novel\" style that makes it very soft and eye-catching. We see pretty easily that oreimo season 2 was given a large budget.\r\n- Sound was pretty good, although not as nice as in season 1, and the OP/ED themes all were deceiving to me compared to their season 1 peers.\r\n- The story overall, not including character relations, made use of pretty enjoyable comedy, never failed at entertainingme and always proved more than interesting, and with a nice progression speed, even if it wasn't generally surprising apart for some very specific moments.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters.\\n\r\nAs in season 1 we have very stereotypical characters, but their personnalities are developed a lot more in this season as we learn about their respective past, so we understand more where they come from, especially for Kirino's tsundere behavior toward her brother, and also, surprisingly, about his almost masoschistic behavior by bearing with his little sister.\\n\r\nKuroneko gets much more importance in this season, almost as if there was a whole \"arc\" dedicated to her, what wasn't unpleasant as we could get a bit more knowledge about herself, and not only the role she made for herself. She's also the first one to \"guess\" inside the show what is gonna be the end.\\n\r\nAs for Ayase (\"My lovely angel Ayase-tan\" as Ky\u014ds\u016bke says), she's still a bit put off, like Manami with few on-screen time, but they weren't the most important characters for the plot in the first place, despite being both really cute in they own ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs of the controversial point (i.e.  that we clearly guess a Kyo\u014ds\u016bke x Kirino feeling end), all one might want to do is re-read the title of the show : \"My little sister can't be this cute\".\\n\r\nNow I wonder how one can not find this explicit enough regarding the \"true\" end of the show...\\n\r\nAlthough I can see why one would be unsatisfied by that, it was obvious since the very beginning, and much more in the season 2 that the title was a true hint for the conclusion the author wanted.\\n\r\nWhat was confirmed by the spoilers fo the last volume of the light novel that was recently released.\\n\\n\r\nNow to end this review, the notation is hard, as it'll hugely depend on the way you feel with that end.\\n\r\nI guess one might dislike it and put something around 8 as an end you dislike can't erase the whole show that was fantastic (no one can deny that), and if you like it, like me, it's definitely a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'll give it a 10, as it's one of those shows that you won't forget as soon as it stops airing, and for good reasons.

            "content": "The following review involves only my very own opinion and my personal experiences. Minor spoilers included, read at your own risk. You may or may not like it. Provided that you do not like my review, feel free to vote it down. Or even better: write an own one.\r\nForeword\r\nYou are looking for a funny and entertaining romcom? You might have found one - OreImo is quite funny and somewhat entertaining. But be aware: Do not expect too much, this show truly is about reckless, brave and yeah, pretty silly people.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nThe core point of OreImo is a highly complicated (love?) relationship of two blood relatives.This anime shows us how a sister relearns to trust her brother, and how a brother is trying to get in touch with an odd culture.\\n\r\nThe story about siblings falling for each other is nothing new. However, the side stories (Otaku culture, Saori\u2019s arc) are pretty interesting and well executed. I wish I could say the same about the main story: for the most part of the series there is no story at all, which is very disappointing and unsatisfying. Near the end of season two the main arc gets more intense and culminates in a fairly peculiar ending. While being a romcom, the show is not efficiently romantic or funny at all. But for all that, the part I disliked the most is the ridiculous attempt on a harem in the last episodes. Out of nowhere. \\n\r\nWhatsoever, all those things fits the show pretty well. Even though the plot routes of OreImo might indeed seem strange and cloudy, again: the show is about silly, grotesque persons. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOreImo is a double edged sword at this point. The show has some really nice supporting characters like Kuroneko and Saori, who do have interesting backgrounds and their own personalities. On the other side there are characters like Ayase, whose nature is just absurd. Speaking of absurd things I can\u2019t avoid mentioning the truly weakest point of OreImo: main characters. They act, again, highly absurd. Their actions and decisions feel borderline unreasonable, beyond any belief.  Oddly enough this fact fits the main arc pretty well, which may or may not be advantageous.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the animation of OreImo, it fits the whole show in a good manner. The colours are pretty deep and sharp, the scenes are colourful. However, in many scenes you can see some really sterile and lowly animated backgrounds, which is a pity.\\n\r\nA couple of words about the music. The opening and ending themes are fine and consistent with the show. The sounds in the show itself are pretty good, but sadly I couldn\u2019t notice any memorable compositions. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOreImo is not that bad. The sad part is: it\u2019s not any good, either. Even though there are some funny and good parts, in the end you might feel highly cheated and disappointed. There are tons of much better romcoms out there, so don\u2019t waste your time on mediocre shows like this one.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are into siscon, try the great Koi Kaze, a mature and serious story about the forbidden love.\\n",

So far so good.\r\nBut then comes season 2... And  more precisely the second half of season 2. Here the characters relationships start to run amok, make no sense and destroy everything good the series otherwise had built up. I have watched many animes where the ending had either been lacking or confusing. But OreImo takes the price. It leaves you with nothing but bad taste in your mouth. \r\nIn short, do watch season1. It's okay to good depending on your taste. But don't watch season 2. And should you decide to anyway, only watch the first half. But whatever you do, don't watch the 3 last episodes. It's like ending a good date being told your partner has cheated on you.",

            "content": "They've done it now. Officially. An anime series has got on my nerves.Even though I don't do reviews for older shows I feel frenzied and obliged to write this just to get the load off me.\r\nThis is late but it comes audacious and up to date, it's not just a review, these are my sentiments (unplugged) about this series,that have been collected right after I watched it so they are afresh, so much that I'm not even able to think straight and am punching the keyboard buttons aggressively to type. I am going to give my emotions a voice and I am going to dothat by ranting here, now either you can just read it or sod off but I'm doing it for my sake. \\n\r\nJudgments can prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond the appearances but my feelings are galvanizing my thoughts about this anime and framing a lot of them too. \\n\\n\r\nNOTE- If u have actually watched the prequel it'll help you in understanding my grievances better as my review draws heavy comparisons between both the seasons. My review also includes the specials (episodes 14-16) \\n\r\nAlso, I'm giving HEAVY SPOILERS out on this review but nothing I say can wreck this anime more than it already is. The damage has been done. \\n\\n\r\nI am so mad because I feel I've just been trolled? OreImo has disappointed me in more than one way.\\n\r\nOreImo is the story between a brother & a sister and how their relationship as siblings' changes and gets mend, given the time. I had read somewhere that beneath the simple-looking plot, OreImo is a gem for all anime fans (agreed) \\n\r\nThough happy about a second season I was ascertain and my concerns weren't wholly nugatory. I had enjoyed watching the first 12 episodes of the first season but encouraging it to continue further would eventually lead to this road. Now, I am sure you've heard from hither-tither that the second season leads towards incest. All the viewers who have previously watched OreImo have already killed the story by frivolously debating over OreImo's Incestual plot and have already broken this news to those who're yet to view the anime. \\n\r\nThey decided to specifically target all the qualities I cherished about this anime and turn it into something I incredibly detest. A \"BAD\" Rom-com Harem, I do not hate that genre but this is amateurish. \\n\r\nHow has Oreimo 2 failed? To answer that there is nothing \"Oreimo\" about Oreimo2 but apparently they claim it to be a sequel.\\n\r\n-there's not much in it on the life of an Otaku\\n\r\n-the life consults are gone\\n\r\n-Kirino is bitchier. \\n\r\n-There's too much blast from the past, clips from season 1 and Dejavu.\\n\r\n-During every argument our harem Hero stands their gaping while the Heroines engross themselves in a fist-fight. \\n\r\n-The idea of slapstick comedy, butt-kicking, bitch-slapping, screaming like kingkong and yelling words like \"baka,hentai\" is so hackneyed that it's not even funny anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAbove stated are only few of the numerous things in the show that agitated me. \\n\r\nAll that gone, something else must be stirring? Mmm... Romance! \\n\r\nThe feelings that the show gives off changed, Well being 32 episodes long (first and second season combined) the plot had to feel like it was moving and going somewhere, so it followed behind the VN/Light novel and caught up with the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to dive deep into this stuff because the art,music,voice-acting has changed the least, mostly remained similar. I understand less about technicalities so my review is solely based on observations made by myself. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10) The art is precise & vibrant.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) \\n\r\nKyousuke, for once is not the weak kind of male protagonist who is torn between girls, he is a baka, liar, hentai, lolicon, masochist, lech but he is not a sissy and while Kirino keeps shouting at the top of her lungs that Kyousuke has a sis-fetish, Kirino's actions suggest that she has a brother complex MORE THAN ANYTHING.Our female characters are the perfect mix you might find in a harem and you'll grow fond of each of them independently, even if it takes a while.\\n\\n\r\nMusic (6/10) \\n\r\nThe OP song is by ClariS again, very J~Poppy with catchy tunes it might not be remembered distinctly as all their songs sound the same but for as long as I was watching the series the OP song boomed in my head several times, it's very fitting for the title, The background music is primarily a guitar instrumental. Every episode has a new ED sung by the Seiyuus that I don't listen to before I move on to another episode. \\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting (8.5/10) \\n\r\nThe voice actors are chosen aptly for their roles, they're perfect and also popular (like Ayana Taketatsu and Kana Hanazawa) \\n\\n\r\n------x------\\n\r\nSo does OreImo get its fairytale ending? \\n\r\nThe second season ends at a cliffhanger without deducing anything and relies on the OVA to conclude the most important part and bring the series to a finish. \\n\r\nI'd be enraged if the series would end at a cliffhanger (Code Geass R1, Urggh) but then OVAs decided to make me angrier than I'd imagined, I was angry they chose an incestuous path but I was filled with fury once they decided to cop out because I always knew OreImo couldn't handle incest. Mind you, I am not trying to act righteous here, Who're we to decide if Incest is wrong or right but did the execution have to be so poor? I've seen \"Yosuga no Sora\" and liked it because it was able to place itself in that setting properly, What they do with OreImo is silly, it never sets the mood well for incest which is a way mature topic, It is manhandled jokingly like it's child's play. They, with their light-headedness take upon the idea, know they can't pull it off and then trash it. They take a whimsical on Incest and it's so terrorizing it's not even laughably bad, there's nothing gleeful or merriment about it just because the attempt is so chucklesome. It only provides distress to the watcher. OreImo feels like a half-hearted attempt of becoming extremely intense. With all that half-assed seriousness and half-baked emotions shoved into the show, OreImo was supposed to be a fun show with a message for siblings but they decided to go ahead and add bullscrap to it to make it deep, I don't know if Incest is morally right or wrong, it's arbitrary but it is morally wrong to go around spoiling if not polluting and corrupting a well-developed brother-sister relation,While their relationship as siblings is well-constructed and fleshed out. The love they both shared was familial and I never once sensed a romantic vibe.They had really matured in a relationship but not as lovers but as two siblings, Kyousuke is a protective, caring and reliable brother that Kirino admired, Kirino is his younger sister who Kyousuke adored. That never meant they had to fall in love with each other. Someone must be sick in the brain if they thought it's necessary to bring such a stupid,stupid plan to effect.\\n\\n\r\nI had to constantly keep my composure or else I really wanted to reach out and create a deep dent on the monitor screen. (Grr.. Makoto Itou, Shinji Matou) It's only the second time I've so strongly reacted to an anime after \"School Days\"\\n\r\n\"Let's just make them fall in and out of love because we can.\" Ha Ha. Right? Like a hot knife sliding through butter. \\n\r\n\"Let's date for a few days and go back to being brother & sister\" *blech* like that could ever happen unless you were merrily infatuated and only wanted to try things out. \\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't take itself too seriously,you shouldn't either because if you do you'll be crestfallen by the end, like me. As it was a really special anime to me and to other Otakus who could relate to it so flee away if you were a huge fan of the past season and aren't just ready to be so overwhelmed yet. My enjoyment was actually at its peak (8/9) while watching OreImo and though I'd give the previous season an overall score of 8 this season will have to be happy with a 5 or 6, I'd have given it a 6 if it weren't the sequel to OreImo which really set the bar high, but I am settling for a  5/10 as it is a bad sequel to a good prequel, everything that set it apart from the other harems has been neglected, OreImo2 is just a meagre Rom-Com now and I hate to say it but even \"Twilight makes a better love story than this\"\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts after watching OreImo2- \" Don't always go by the book \" (literally, do not)",

The first episode of the new series is fairly standard and is more about portraying the characters' \"REUNION\" ( a very fitting opening theme right there).\r\nThe real story makes progress as of episode 2 where Kirino is confronted by her best friend Ayase and about how kirino doesnt spend enough time with her and from then on each episode seems better than the previous one. We see some backstory to Saori (a tall otaku girlwith swirly glasses and how she became the way she is today...all the way to Kuroneko's big love confession to Kyosuke...etc. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is far deeper than one may think initially. Back in 2010 when I first watched it I was almost kinda \"meh\" but boy was I wrong. The story about Kyosuke and his little sister with whom he has no relationship is truly remarkable in how it carefully transforms their ignorance/hate into care/love.\\n\\n\r\nWithout writing too much. here's my scoring\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality - its very good and detailed , though the characters themselves are a bit simple but not bad\\n\\n\r\nSounds/music - very good fitting openings.

            "content": "Quite possibly the most fan-dividing anime of the year, OreImo is a tough cookie to even begin to review. If you've seen the first series, then the sudden u-turn in almost all aspects of the show will be shocking, to say the least. It might well go down in history as the anime which alienated the most fans, or it might even be the trendsetter for future harems, because what OreImo has to offer in controversy is matched by its brilliance.\r\nIf we were to ignore the original series, let alone forget that there is even a light novel that precedes it, then you couldprobably score OreImo a 9/10 and be done with it. There's delightful animation, hilarious romantic comedy, in depth characters, an insight into otaku culture, and an unique exploration of the once-taboo theme of incest. The problem is, this anime is a direct sequel to something far greater in almost every way. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nMuch to the disappointment of fans from season one, there are very few redeeming factors about the story of the second season. Gone is the eccentric plot revolving around the life advice sessions, with almost no sign of a story to replace it. There is next to no mention of Kirino's success with producing her own anime; Kirino's modelling and racing career is also sidelined but no replacement can be found. The only reliable plot that occurs involves Kyousuke and his new love interest in Kuroneko, which is probably one of the only bricks holding the fort together. It is relieving to know then that Kuroneko and Kyousuke's miniature plot-arc is possibly the best in the season. However, the rest of the series tries too hard to juggle the numerous characters in the harem without much in the way of linking them together. Overall, it would be wise to abandon hopes of a thrilling plot, as you will be better off focusing on the characters and comedy that will blow you away further than the story even travels.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThere is no mistaking the beautiful art that OreImo manages to tease our eyes with. Rich, vibrant colours and a wide variety of settings provide eye candy that many other animation studios envy. The character animation is superb and the attention to detail is impressive, to say the least. It doesn't quite have a masterpiece touch to make it a 10/10, but it's not far off. In general, high performance once again from a high-quality studio - cute girls have rarely been cuter.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nPersonally I have always found the soundtrack to this series entertaining in its own right, and whilst I slightly preferred the music from the first season, the quality is definitely the same across both. OP and ED are worth listening to in their own right, and you may find yourself occasionally humming a tune or two whilst doing the dishes. The voice acting is as per season one spot on, with believable accentuations and real emotion - particularly from the voice actor of Kuroneko (Hanazawa, Kana). As a whole, there is good reason to praise the sound artists, who are often undervalued for the factor they play in creating the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThis was undeniably a tough decision to make, because as far as a harem goes the two deciding factors for its worth are usually how funny it is and how good the characters and relationships are. Sadly, there are too many failures in OreImo for them to go unnoticed. Without wanting to spoil anything, my entire point can be summed up in one character: Asuna. Everything you knew about her has rapidly and inexplicably changed. It's no use arguing that \"it's explained in the light novels\" because the anime was designed to be watched alone and not to accompany its source. The script writers simply did a bad job of introducing the changes to her character. For reference, imagine taking Simon from Gurren Lagann in episode one, and then suddenly transition next episode to the Simon from the final episode. There is no impossibru face strong enough to describe how atrocious that would be, and yet the story decides it's appropriate with what used to be the anime's only grounded character. That being said, a few characters do escape the butcher's knife - the best being (luckily) the protagonists and Kuroneko. Kirino retains her enraging bitchiness whilst still managing to make you sympathetic towards her because of how (relatively) real she remains. Kyousuke actually feels more like the harem king this time around, as he becomes legitimately involved in the eroge games and shows his feelings about the other girls more acutely. A personal favourite of mine (and indeed of many) is Kuroneko, who cute factor aside, becomes possibly the deepest of all the characters explored in the entire anime. Her feelings are not an obsessive fad, or a confused bundle of emotions, but true and honest love. If you haven't yet seen the series, expect a treat amongst the waves of deplorably ignorant relationships. In conclusion, the characters probably won't meet your expectations - the controversy killing off many a fan - but there's probably a silver lining in there somewhere. You just need to look at it really hard.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nWhilst there are many pitfalls and dangerous waters (especially ship lovers - I won't even begin to mention the OVAs), OreImo does contain a multitude of comedic moments, of which at least some will have you laughing. It might not be crying-tears-of-laughter hilarious, but you might wake up your next door neighbour with an untimely fit of giggles, on at least one occasion. Making up for where the show lacks in story and plugging a few of the character void-holes has helped to make season 2 more than bearable. Even when characters do something completely out of character, it's more than likely that two seconds later Kyousuke will mess up or act silly in such a way that you can't help but smile. And whilst this should probably go in the character or story section, the sheer enjoyment from the Saori backstory plot is enough to carry three or four episodes alone. To summise, be prepared for anything. No seriously, anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThere are too many problems with OreImo season 2 for me to completely wash over them with the entertainment banner, but that being said it is not a bad anime either. As I initially said, most of the disappointment comes from this being a sequel to a contender for greatest harem of all time. The verdict? If you have seen the first season and the first set of OVAs, then season 2 is still worth watching, just don't expect to end on the exact same note as before. If not, then why are you watching this when you could be watching the first season? What you should really be worrying about is preparing to replace your monitor; because if you don't punch a hole through it after watching the second season OVAs, you truly are a master of control. \\n",

            "content": "My first review...and it had to be about this infamous controversial anime... Heheh... Anyway, let's start.\r\nI'll be honest, when I started watching the show, I didn't know what to expect about it. As I watched through the entire show, I learnt a lot of lessons. Screw the sibling love for a while and look at the other aspects. The series has really gone through many aspects of real-life scenarios that I have faced before, and it taught me to be strong in these situations. Which is why, I really found that most of the characters had something to take from.\r\nWhen I reached the final episodeof the show, excluding the specials, I felt that it ended quite abruptly, and there were plenty of loose ends. And thus, I watched the final three episodes of...controversy... And I enjoyed it. It was good, and I can only smile when I think of Kyousuke and Kirino, I'm not saying that we should learn everything we see from anime, this one for instance. I just think that it should be something looked upon as good. To break social norms just like that. What is stopping us? Judgement from public? There are no proper restrictions stopping us from doing anything. Love comes in many forms. This is just one example, and a good one at that. The last 3 episodes tied up many doubts the viewers had and ended without much haste.\\n\\n\r\nThe other aspects like music was quite okay. I like the opening for both seasons. Quite catchy. xP The animation was good, a different style from shounen(duh), but the design was nice. There was no doubt that I laughed in every single episode. The humour is also something we can relate to I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the main point of this review was actually to tell those that haven't watched it yet to ignore anything you hear about this anime. Even if you've heard about its controversies. Screw it. Watch it for yourself and get your own opinion of it. See if you learnt a thing or two from the show, even if you didn't like it.\\n\\n\r\nFor those that already finished it, good job. You survived. xD Honestly, I know it's tough seeing something so unexpected like that just appear on your screen. But if you don't like it, it's fine. Just don't impose your opinion on to others with different beliefs. It's nice to share opinions, but in this society, as seen from the anime, we can't really say that there's a 'right' decision, can we? be accepting to all kinds of people and thoughts. It'll be beneficial one day.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, I think I've spent enough time. I hope it wasn't too...much... Ehh, thanks, and...bye...?",

            "content": "\"Why are you in my way, pervert?\"\r\n-Kirino Kosaka\r\nThis poignant quote is just a sample of the masterpiece that is Oreimo. Oreimo pushed the boundaries of what we as humans define as \"good\" into a new genre altogether. But all in all, the main reason why this anime scored a perfect 10/10 was because it did something no anime has ever been able to achieve before: By actually fucking up a simple slice of life premise into oblivion.\r\nThe story of Oreimo in itself is quite unique. So unique, in fact, that it can be classified as a whole new genre of anime. I like to callthis new genre \"shit in a bucket on a screen.\" It took a simple premise such as love, put it in a food processor, and blended it into oblivion. In that sense, it is a lot like fate/zero because both start with a premise that soon gets deconstructed over the course of time.\\n\\n\r\nArt is perfect. It brought back the nostalgia of my youth spending days on end staring for hours at dried up pieces of concrete, memories everyone has as a child. Similarly, the sound is flawless. In order to fully enjoy this series, I reccomend you scrap those old speakers of yours and listen to some radio static on full volume as you watch this one of a kind masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI reccomend this show to everyone. And my reccomendation means a LOT, I am a true anime master that has seen a ton of shows like bleach naruto onepiece fairy tale, and attack on the titans (shingeki no kyojin for those of us who have leanred a little japanese ^_^)",

            "content": "Oh my, this series took a real nosedive in the second season. \r\nAll inclusive, the whole series (all episodes from both seasons) was an interesting ride to say the least. It started off so strong, limped through the back half off of it's story, and then fell flat on it's face right before the end in one of the biggest ass pulls I've seen in anime. I don't even have a metric for this because this is the literal worst endings I have seen, but I'll get to that.\r\nTL;DR: Overall I enjoyed this series, it had a lot to say about the perspectiveof how people pursue their hobbies and frames the otaku culture as something that, while not without flaws, cannot be labeled as an immediate negative in someone's life. Even if this topic is constructed within a pretty vanilla harem series with only one male character worth mentioning, it explored the ideas of what makes someone who they are and the risk of losing their identity if even a small part of that was removed from their life. I actually enjoyed the whole ride along... until the end. \\n\\n\r\nMy breakdown through MAL's separation of episodes are as follows:\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1\\n\r\n- Episodes 1-13: 6\\n\r\n- Episodes 14-16: 7\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2\\n\r\n- Episodes 1-13: 3\\n\r\n- Episodes 14-16: 1\\n\\n\r\nI have decided to put this all encompassing review in this part because it is last full season and not a part of MAL's classification of \"specials.\" As per request of MAL's guidelines, I will attempt to voice my reasons for these scores without spoiling major plot points, but here is your official spoiler warning.\\n\\n\r\n***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis was by far the strongest part of this series as a whole. It was probably the only reason I watched the second season in it's entirety seeing as the major themes had been explored to an acceptable degree, the characters have all had \"their arc,\" and the ending (whichever one you prefer) had closure for the main arc. Season two just tried to milk all the goodwill that the series had earned through its first arc. I will say that it did not help that I was watching this through Crunchyroll which did not have the specials so upon watching the first episode of the second season I was confused about all this story that I missed. I was undoubtedly frustrated upon returning to this episode which may have colored my consumption of the first two episodes in a slightly more negative light than deserved. However, this was not earned back upon a rewatch of the first episodes of the second season. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, this story appeals to me more as a study of the community aspect of otaku culture and self identity, and less so as a \"bed the sister tale.\" I would be lying if I said that there weren't moments where the brother-sister relationship didn't speak to me as my sister and I went through a similar experience of being good friends as little kids, growing a part as I moved into high school, and becoming better siblings upon the realization that we were both into anime. I really enjoyed how their relationship developed from circumstance and blossomed into a believable, if a bit extreme, functional brother-sister relationship. \\n\\n\r\nI want to take a moment to address that the \u201cbed the sister\u201d part of the story did not really bother me from a storytelling point of view. I cannot shake that I am a bit bothered by the reality of incest and avoid it wherever I can, but did not distract me from the relationship that Kirino and Kyousuke developed. I thought it was something that developed over time instead of coming out of nowhere like some other characters in this show. Make no mistake that it is entirely possible to have a distaste for incest relationships and observe one develop. \\n\\n\r\nGetting back on track, I thought that the structure and pacing of the first season was on point. It established our characters, led them through a few trials and tribulations, and brought all the tension to a head right when the relationships between Kyousuke and his harem had been touched on. I was thoroughly crushed when I saw the bad ending for the first time. All that progress that he had made in mending his relationship just dropped like a rock with no pretenses, no warning. That stuck with me. I felt abandoned, but in a way that I didn\u2019t feel betrayed by the story. If the series had ended there, it would have been a fairly average series that made its mark on the anime landscape with a small cast of intimate and likable characters that struggled through something together and all of them became better because of the experience. \\n\\n\r\nBut no, the show must go on. How could we end with Kirino disappearing without telling anybody? Will Kyousuke bed his sister? What will become of Kuroneko and Saori? I\u2019m sure fans that didn\u2019t read the manga were left wanting to find out what happened to the group. I have to admit, I was one of those people. I wanted to see what the heck happened, and so I went onto season two\u2026 But not without detour since episodes 14-16 were not on Crunchyroll. I actually liked these specials even more because it answered some of these questions. Unfortunately, they also brought up more questions and left me wanting more. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was a trap! Oh my, did the story take a big dump on itself and devolve into a bait harem show. The writing was on the walls when I could tell that Manami was going to be a real contender for Kyousuke\u2019s affection, but no it didn\u2019t stop there. Every girl that was wasn\u2019t Kyousuke\u2019s mother (and the one girl from the computer club who was a yaoi fantasizer) had to have it, and they will not be denied. By the end, there were six girls fighting over him. I get it, it is supposed to be a male fantasy, but that was obnoxious at best and disgusting at worst. I will remind you that with the exception of Saori who\u2019s age was not explicitly made clear to me (I may have missed it), all of these girls are in middle or high school, but all want to take care of him like a housewife would. Maybe I was just not aware of this in the first season, but the characters in the second season have the agency of adults. We only get a glimpse of the Kousaka family\u2019s parental figures (Kuroneko\u2019s parents are oddly missing from the picture), but Kyousuke had to sneak out in the middle of the night and lie to his parents to do some of the favors for Kirino, but in the second season, it seems like they can just do whatever they wanted without much consequence. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I have to give the story credit for is that is atypical of harem shows is that, despite his indecisiveness, Kyousuke actually chose who he wanted to be with in the end and rejected all the other girls with absolute clarity. I have to applaud this because I\u2019m so sick and tired of shows slogging through themselves and ultimately come to no conclusion because the main guy is indecisive or none of the girls will admit that they love him. This show had the balls to not only have all the girls state their affection and get rejected. This surely will come to a satisfying conclusion right?\\n\\n\r\nBaited and outsmarted. Not by episode 13, that one didn\u2019t need to exist. It could have been put in the beginning of the series and made a heck of a lot more sense, or omitted entirely and the show would not have lost anything other than showing young Kyousuke, Kirino, and Manami. But, goddammit I have never been more pissed at an ending ever in my life. I don\u2019t have the expansive knowledge of anime like some people, but I have wanted enough romantic comedies and harem shows to be thoroughly disappointed by how the main couple, or any of the relationships never take flight. It is almost a staple of the genre and I was ready for this story to take that chance and actually make an actual couple out of the characters that went for it and sacrificed everything in order to accomplish it. So, what did they do with it? The ending has no metric for disappointment, simply because it blows all the other unsatisfying and rage inducing endings out of the water. I\u2019ve seen this ending compared to the ending of Berserk which has an infamous ending that angered a lot of the fanbase. However, from what I\u2019ve heard from different reviews was that it was infuriating, but it made sense. The ending has no logic. No rhyme. No reason to go off of. Kyousuke and Kirino had nothing to gain from having that kind of relationship last for the time that it did. Even if you go to the extreme and say that they had sex (mission accomplished right?), it doesn\u2019t make this logic any less broken and undercut the last 4+ episodes of cutting down possible relationships just to have this one. In the end, what did that get them? They went right back to being siblings. The only possible thing that I can think of that makes any amount of sense for myself is that they had sex, got over the appeal of it, and returned to their season one interactions, just without the incest undertones. \\n\\n\r\nA Quick Note:\\n\r\nFor the rest of this review I will be separating my critique between season one and season two. This is because the story, and to some extent its characters, can be mostly judged as a whole because it is a light novel adaptation and the high points and flaws can be attributed to the source material. Outside of the character development, the rest of the anime is left up to its adaptation. Season one was adapted by AIC Build and season two was adapted by A1 Pictures. While both of these studios are under Aniplex, I got the impression that the two seasons were treated VERY differently. I will make it clear that I hate A1 Pictures and what they have created for shows like this. Their apparent lack of effort towards some of their works is just horrific and most of it comes in the form of its art.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe first season was nothing special. The character designs of the girls were all fairly cute, even if some of them were a bit generic. I was never blown away with any of the animation, but I was never distracted by it either. The settings and set pieces followed suit. The animation was fairly consistent and standard. It was solid. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe second season was an abomination, mostly in the animation department. There were multiple times per episode where I would be distracted by background characters frozen in space in an expression that I was hard pressed to believe anybody would keep. The classroom scenes were the biggest offenders of this. There was also an over-reliance on panning shots on still images. While this is an acceptable, even if low effort, way to do establishing shots, but when there are times where characters would actually cover each others\u2019 mouths in order to not show them talking. Now I don\u2019t know the actual amount of frames that this actually saves, but this is just unacceptable in scenes where there is no need for it. Other times speaking characters would be on the wrong side of the shot, reverse shot camera technique to show the black expression. My biggest complaint was the overuse of previously animated footage that seemed to infect all parts of the second season after the first couple of episodes. Some of these were even shot for shot copies of previous part in the anime with different outfits. These techniques and more were pervasive throughout the second season and whether I just didn\u2019t notice any of this in the first season or they did not bother me, this wasn\u2019t abused to the extent it was in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nMy main complaint of A1 Pictures as a whole is that their animation is garbage as a whole. That\u2019s not to say that they cannot animate at all, there are some scenes and still images that are well designed, but when these shots make up maybe 10% of the runtime of the entire episode, I have to call them out somewhere. It is all that more apparent in a series like this where two different studios are in charge of two different seasons. I would have to say that the second season had about 10% of its animation on par or slightly above the first season as a whole, and the other 90% was drastically worse. This is most apparent in shots where the characters are in crowds of people. Rarely did I see these characters have any sort of attention to their movements outside of the Meruru concerts, and even then there were times where the concert would be in full swing and there would be people in the background standing still not doing anything. I do not understand that at all.\\n\\n\r\nI generally parse the bad from the good when I see a scene where extras are visible, but the focus is supposed to be on the main characters. Do these extras have any distinct features? Are they dressed appropriately for the weather and time of day? Are they moving? If they are standing still, are they standing still for a believable reason? Even if they look like a real person, if all these conditions aren\u2019t met, it throws me off. If extras are going to be treated without much if any care, it has to be a conscious style choice. Good examples of this are Acchi Kocchi (where everyone outside of the cast is a white figure) and Kill La Kill (where all the extras have the exact same design because they are mindless drones). In both of these series, a significant less time was devoted to the design of the extras, but they communicate to the viewer that they are not relevant to the story and I don\u2019t need to pay any attention to them. In season two, and other A1 Pictures shows, extras are given character designs, but they are given just enough detail to be distinct from one another, but not enough to be believable to me at least. I was so distracted by this, that anything new artwise (read not much considering they go a grand total of five new locations and 3 of them are rooms) totally flew under the radar of garbage that was the second season\u2019s animation. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, the decision to include random bits of A1 works like SAO into the show rubs me in a way that fuels the rage of a thousand nerds getting 360 no scoped in Call of Duty\u2026 It\u2019s annoying, I hate it, and I wish A1 Pictures would stop doing it. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound design was not to my taste. It didn\u2019t so much convey an emotion, but rather pull one out of me. Scene that\u2019s supposed to be funny? Better start the funny music! Have a heartfelt moment coming up? Queue the feels track! The tracks all fit the scenes they were in, but I am not sure if that is because I am or was conditioned to feel that way with the sounds. I found this annoying in the first season (3/10) and unbearable in the second season (2/10). The best scenes in this series where the music was either so quiet that the characters overpowered them, or there was none at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs a whole, I liked the cast of the show, but man were they generic as can be.  Kyousuke was a generic main character in a romance or harem series. He\u2019s generally well mannered, extremely nice, reliable, etc. Everything that you want your main character to be for the rest of the harem. Kirino is a typical tsundere, but she has a reason to be initially abrasive towards her brother. She loved her brother in the past, but hates the person he\u2019s become from her perspective. Kuroneko is a deadpan loli. She\u2019s shy and tries to keep up this role player persona because she loves the show MASCHERA. Saori is a split between a rich girl and a generic otaku. I appreciate that the show explored why she was the way she is, but the execution in certain parts was odd to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast are one note characters. To complete the harem, there is Manami, Ayase, and Kanako who are as follows: childhood friend, tsundere (type B), and bitchy. Manami is the only one of the three who like the main character who is given any sort of explanation, but most of this boils down to \u201cbecause childhood friend.\u201d I still don\u2019t know why Kanako confessed to Kyousuke. I guess it is because he was her first fan as an idol, I\u2019m not sure but that\u2019s my best guess. The mother is a generic loving mother and the father is a hardass. \\n\\n\r\nI admittedly liked the dad and Kuroneko the best, but that is more due to personal preference because they\u2019re still fairly generic. Manami\u2019s grandparents were amusing in their own right, but they weren\u2019t very relevant other than to provide suggestions that Kyousuke and Manami were childhood friends who \u201cshould get married already.\u201d At least they had the decency to serve their purpose and then never show up again, unlike many of the other supporting cast that just seemed to randomly appear because they appeared once. Even the girl who bought the first doujin randomly showed up in the line to the next event because why not. The biggest offender of this was Mikagami Kouki. Why did he join the computer club at a different school? Why was he there after Kyousuke\u2019s graduation? He should have disappeared after the whole fake boyfriend arc was done. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first season, all the generic characters of the show were given the agency of middle and high schoolers. As I previously stated, Kyousuke and Kouhei had to lie to their parents about where they were at night so they could sneak out and buy eroge for their little sisters. While this is a small detail, it made them believable high schoolers. This was done time and time again throughout the first season to show the audience that these were in fact teenagers with no real agency over their lives. Is it weird that Kirino is a successful model? A little bit, but they weave that into the story very well. Her friends are all models who happen to go to her school, she dresses very stylishly, she has to hide her otaku side from said friends, she uses her money from modeling to buy eroge, and she\u2019s a knockout by middle school standards. I know if she went to my middle school, she would have been the asked out constantly and while this was never shown, it was mentioned more than once in the anime. The main cast all have fairly well knit characters before they even come together. This breaks down as the cast gets less and less relevant, but I believe that the characters were created with purpose and placed in a realistic world that would treat them as such. You know, minus the whole shouting in public that either nobody hears or cares about that seems to be pervasive of anime characters. (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season, all of this goes to shit. Parents questioning where Kirino and Kyousuke are going constantly together? Is this a restriction meant to convey that they are kids? Nope, it\u2019s a plot device to see who gets to play housewife. Kuroneko moves without saying anything? Family trip, but she\u2019s out wandering alone in an unfamiliar town. Also Kirino and Kyousuke just get there without any sort of parental supervision. Yes Kirino did this when she went to America, but she went to a track and field camp for kids her age where you can safely assume it would be run by adults. Kyousuke wants to have a hotel room for himself and a girl? No problem! Nevermind he doesn\u2019t have a job unless that manager thing actually pays. The second season abandons the fact that these are still kids outside of maybe Saori, who in one episode can rent a hotel room, custom order cosplay, and manages at least one servant, but by the end of the season is trying to take Kyousuke for herself for no apparent reason. The fact that they\u2019re all still generic and the supporting cast of girls are given little to no reason to like Kyousuke other than \u201cThey are girls\u2026 They have speaking lines\u2026 They\u2019re in a light novel adaptation\u2026 What else could they be doing?\u201d (Digibro, The Asterisk War Sucks series). It\u2019s all just terrible and it abandoned the one thing anchoring the characters in reality. The only thing moment of characterization that saves this from being a 1 is Kuroneko. The emotion that was put into her actions towards the end deserve merit in isolation even if the show did nothing but hurt its characters with it. (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite the lengthy criticism of this show, especially the second season, I actually enjoyed watching it. Yes there are A LOT of things that could be better, but I found myself having a good time throughout the entire season save the last minutes of the last episode. I cannot stress how much that one situation ruined the last 3 episodes for me. I was prepared to rate that one the better of the second season with a 6 because it built up the idea that Kyousuke and Kirino were going to go through with their plan and do everything they could to accomplish it, but no. The show just had to backpedal on itself. If the show cut at a specific point, I would have given the last 3 episodes a 6 on principal alone. Not only at that point were all the storylines tied up, albit rushed sometimes, but they would have made a statement and done something that no other show has done. But then it all just fell apart. Ugh\u2026\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nSo overall I enjoyed the show, flaws in all. It could be a much better series, but it was a good one. The first one earned my respect, and the second one milked it for all it was worth. If I were to judge the show based on everything up until that one moment, I would give it a 5. Nothing groundbreaking, but it told a decent story. It dragged itself out a bit, but in a way that was more enjoyable for myself and different than shows of similar nature. The animation quality dipped drastically and in ways that bother me a lot. However, it was a decent ride all in all. If I were to include that moment and everything afterwards, I have to bump it down to a 3. That\u2019s to say that the one moment in question was so bad and such an insult to its fanbase that it docks three points. Three points for what? Just so the show can have the incest relationship, but also keep its distance. It really is a tragedy that the second season, which did scratch that itch to see the characters develop their romances further, ultimately brought the show down so much in overall quality. It isn\u2019t impossible to see all the harem business being dealt with in a series of OVA\u2019s that show Kyousuke getting to know all the girls outside of Kuroneko and Kirino better, developing chemistry together, but end with him saying that he loves someone else. As much as I\u2019m not a fan of the \u201cbed the sister\u201d shows that are cropping up, I hope that maybe one of them can be to the level of the first season of Oreimo.",

            "content": "Oreimo S2. A series many wanted, and a series that was given. Did it live up to expectations? \r\nAs sequel series go, this is better than the first. There are simple reasons behind this. Most would agree that character development was what made Oreimo S2 so much better than S1. The anime is very solid in the idea that it is quite simply, showing the lives of people who are slightly different to normal society. It shows the interests, the friendships, and the struggles of these people, which is something people relate to. When you can watch something that's making you feel like you relateto emotions of a character, you get the real perspective. This is something people clearly enjoy, and I agree on this. The main element is a troubled sibling relationship, which is a typical theme, but this series seems to be very real in its ideas about the troubles between the two main characters. This element of real conflict is a great aspect to it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a thoroughly enjoyable series for it gives you surprises also. Developments happen suddenly, and also leave you on a knife edge. This is definitely a positively entertaining factor. \\n\\n\r\nI like the characters too. I think that each one demonstrates a type of person not thought about in the society. Kyousuke, the secretly protective\\n\r\nkirino, the aspirational and self motivated\\n\r\nkuroneko, the committed but unrecognised\\n\r\nSaori, distant and misunderstood yet strong\\n\r\nI think when you see it this way, you can understand why Oreimo S2 is very firm on being something people relate to. It has strong values and feels very realistic. This is for me, something that makes it worth watching. However I struggle to see why people have a love for Kirino. Personally she drags the series down a little, I want to throw her off a building if I'm honest. I don't know why but that's what I think.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, Oreimo S2 is unusual in that it is better than the first series. It makes it's improvement in showing the who the characters really are. However it isn't amazing. The story still feels a little like there's more to it, mainly due to the amount of sub plots to aid character development. If there is series 3 (which the last episode seemed to hint at) then maybe this can be forgiven. They had to either finish the story or develop characters, and I think they did the right thing in developing the characters. If they continue, then I can safely say combined, Oreimo is a must watch for anybody.",

It's like never-ending story like One Piece, Dragon Ball, where all characters' habit is constant. But there are also development in skills, feelings and looks.\r\nThis anime is semi-harem because the main protagonist made all nearby girls love him. But it's lovewith reasons not like most harem anime. That's why it's not boring. Love without reason is what you always found in harem anime but not this one.

I started myself down a path I\u2019m not too upset about, because I feel like the reward was every bit as satisfying as the ride itself. Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (or Oreimo [or My Little Sister Can\u2019t Be This Cute]) is a series full of misconceptions and misdirection which would explain why people write it off as dumb, fetish-y, siscon garbage and they\u2019d be right to anyone who accepts an opinion as fact before watching a series. Now I\u2019m not saying that Oreimo\u2019s second season doesany better to provide us with less incestuous undertones (I\u2019ve just been on  roll with this incest shit lately), because it actually makes our impression of the Kousaka household worse (until a certain point).\\n\\n\r\nWhen series change studios between seasons (look at that alliteration huehuehue) there\u2019s a certain level of difference that\u2019s acceptable before it feels like a totally different show, but as far as artistic style is concerned there wasn\u2019t too drastic a difference between AIC and A-1\u2019s Oreimo so it gets a thumbs up in my book. Soundtrack remains the same, ClariS still handles the opening song (which is stupid catchy, by the way). You get much of the same with this season, but a little different. I see why this series is classified as harem (pardon my ignorance for not having read the light novel) and that was something that I just kind of suffered through to get to the end. This season hits lower points than the first, but it comes back way stronger than the first season ever did and honestly adds justification to all of Kirino and Kyousuke\u2019s quirks. While there may still be indecent undertones the siblings\u2019 love for one another (whether you take that to mean romantic or otherwise is on you) comes through and is a sweet little ending to this adventure.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s better at points than the first season and worse at others, but it\u2019s not bad. There\u2019s more harem stuff and some characters get ignored, but there\u2019s also more emotional stake in the characters and that makes it worth it to me. You\u2019ve stuck it out this long, might as well finish.",

            "content": "The first season of Oreimo was a delightful anime, full of colorful and amusing characters. It played with a lot of anime tropes and aspects of anime culture in general in interesting ways and was thoroughly fun. It was the sort of show that surprised with how good it was. So, yes, a second season was definitely very much welcome... but while I still overall enjoyed the second season, it simply isn't quite as successful as the first. It fails to deliver in some important regards, and for that it is a bit of a disappointment.\r\nThe production values are not where the show goes wrong.A-1 Pictures has proven themselves capable of producing very visually appealing, well made anime and this is no exception. It looks great and sounds great. The art is crisp, glossy and appealing, the music is good and the voice actors come across as quite comfortable in their roles. \\n\\n\r\nOreimo has great characters. Kyosuke is a great male lead; relatable, fun, not weak. Kirino is an interesting if at times frustrating female lead, but overall works as a character for her infectious energy. Kuroneko is just adorable and awesome. The rest of the cast is all mostly very likable and they remain that way in the second season. Some of them are developed really well too. The episode Saori gets is one of the high points of the season and makes me wish they had done more with her character. Kuroneko's arc in the middle also has a lot of very sweet high points, even if the resolution is rather weak and infirm. Even Kirino gets some good development in places, especially in the final flashback episode.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the character development is not as good. Ayase is the biggest disaster. At the beginning of the second season she seemed right and in fact more likable and interesting than ever, but in her arc toward the end her characters was pretty close to ruined. I had never once thought she was supposed to have advanced feelings of any sort for Kyousuke. They don't have a chemistry that suggests that and never have, which just makes everything that suggests otherwise between them seem painfully forced. It's quite telling that minor character Kanako's tacked on late developing affections for Kyousuke are more believable. Which brings me to the point that the second season tries far too hard to draw up the harem situations. The characters naturally play off each other in interesting ways. Not every single one has to be in love with Kyousuke. It really cheapens things, especially since the core relationships, especially Kyousuke and Kuroneko remain so strong. As for Kyousuke and Kirino, most of the time it's as interesting a dynamic as it ever was... but it perhaps plays the incest card a little too strongly, making the characters harder to relate with. Really, Oreimo S2's biggest fault is that it makes things too complicated for their own good.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, if you really enjoy these characters and the way they interact with each other as I do, you will most likely still find a lot to love. It's not fully satisfying--it's not even fully completed, any kind of resolution being saved for the OVAs--but it's still Oreimo. I wish the approach had been slightly different and for it there were moments that were frustrating, but as a fan of the original, this second season still had more than enough high points to justify the lows.",

            "content": "Introduction\r\nTo start with I'll have to confess that season one of Oreimo is one of my all-time guilty pleasures. There are so many reasons to not enjoy it, but it had the charisma to keep you watching and to care about the characters despite their fairly trite characteristics. Season two of Oreimo is enjoyable, to the extent that I'd still call it a good anime. It's not great, but it's perfectly enjoyable.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nWe follow on from the 'True Ending' of the first season, Kyousuke has brought Kirino back from America and everything is returning to an equilibrium.  The story of the second seasonis not particularly strong; we're led through a few of the lesser seen characters' back stories and home lives which is fun enough but I found that the stories felt a little rushed, which was most likely a result of trying to push a lot of Light Novel material into only one or two episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't really fault the art; it's nothing we haven't seen before in regard to distinctiveness but it's fluid, vivid and it doesn't distract us from what's actually happening in the story. There are plenty of cutesy character designs and most tastes appear to be catered to. Even introducing the 'Plain Girl' Manami, a character design which is rarely seen in any degree of spotlight.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and EDs are all very light and fun. Personally, I don't think the new OP is as enjoyable as the old one as the old one was weirdly enjoyable and the new one doesn't do much for me. The background sound is excellent for setting the appropriate mood for the scenes. The voice actors are all convincing in their roles and Kuroneko's VA (Hanazawa Kana) in particular deserves a mention as she has quite a large fanbase.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not as if the characters are bad, they aren't particularly original but they are pretty okay. We're shown a few back stories and there's a fair amount of character development seen in this season - some felt pretty rushed - and we see sides to some characters that we wouldn't have expected, which is often nice to see in an anime. The characters each have their own distinct sense of humour and they all carry it off very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws it is still an anime I genuinely enjoy. Provided that you don't expect it to be a masterpiece you should really enjoy it as well. The humour of Oreimo can be very good and I would say it's certainly one of the show's strong points.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's a good anime, it isn't as good as the first season but it's still worth watching. If you do want to enjoy it without any spoilers you should stay away from the forums until you're finished; they're rife with the things.",

            "content": "Coming into this anime you would think that it's about a brother who adores his little sister, and you'd be right. But what this anime does good is hide the fact that there's much more going on than what we're lead to believe. \r\nOreimo 2 continues it's adventures with Kirino and her friends as they go and learn more about each other and grow as individuals. The biggest improvements being with Saori, and the story about her life, and why she's so keen about wearing her strange glasses. As well as rapping up why Kirino has always had the burning passion to dislike her brother.It follows the same formula as the first season, but doesn't really improve anywhere, nor does it do worse.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen many anime, and this one has that same \"plain\" look we have all seen before. But that doesn't mean the animations don't work when they're present, because they do. The OP is simple and has a nice beat, and is quite similar to the first season, but I happen to like the first seasons OP.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly does this season improve on, well not much. As I said before we got more insight as to why Saori wears her glasses. And I started noticing Kirino change her attitude as the season goes on. Kyousuke is still average as ever, but his average-ness provides a nice barrier in-between Ruri's crazy fanatics, and Kirino's hot temper. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this season neither improves, nor does it get worse. It's just the same slice of life, comedy anime we all saw the first time around, but with more Kirino and Ruri. I liked it, and it's definitely worthy of a watch if you're into this kind of thing. But like I said earlier, it's not just what the title insinuates, it gets a bit deeper than that.",

            "content": "I wanted to get my impressions off my chest before the special episodes air that should wrap up this storyline. Actually, I have deliberately postponed writing this review, because the second season of Oreimo left me feeling undecided about what it was trying to say.\r\nThat seems like a very strange thing to say about a series titled \"There's No Way My Little Sister is this Cute!\", right? Because it seems so obvious that this story must be all about the taboo on relationships between siblings, especially given the amount of time spent on the phenomenon of 'little sister eroge'. And yet, even after letting thestory of the second season sink in for a couple of weeks, I still feel that this is all a red herring. In my opinion, the eye-catching taboo of sibling relationships is used here to explore a more subtle theme. Then again, maybe I'm reading too much into this, given all the comedy and harem elements present in this second season. Still, I could not help but feel that just like some anime have a \u2018true route\u2019, there can also be a \u2018true theme\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nTrue theme\\n\r\nThe true theme of this series is meddling. Meddling with people\u2019s lives based on the meddler\u2019s selfish needs, or based on the meddler\u2019s projections of their own fears or suspicions (or possibly even hidden desires?). Without spoiling any specific plot points, I feel that in Oreimo 2 the most prominent meddlers are Kuroneko and Manami. Just ask yourself when watching this series: (almost) every time the probability of a relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke increases, is this not due to the interference of other characters who feel that they have the right to shape the lives of Kirino and Kyousuke? I will even go so far as to say that if it had not been for all this meddling, then Kirino and Kyousuke would never have had any trouble being normal siblings. At this point, I have no idea if an actual relationship between these two will be the end result, but if this should occur then this series might as well have been titled \u201cThe Meddlers Made Me Realize Just How Cute My Little Sister Is!\u201d. And that enormous irony would be the painful punishment for all this meddling aimed at preventing just such a relationship. \\n\r\nAll kidding aside, this theme is actually a lot more serious than the often rather light tone of this series suggests. Just ask yourself how you would feel if at some point in your life you realized that people close to you had been manipulating you for years, robbing you of the chance of having your life take its natural course? So many lies told, so many roads you might have wanted to take closed off, so much harm done. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe build-up of the story is rather strange this season. For some reason, it was decided that the first few episodes should be personal epilogues for some of the secondary characters who then disappear from the series for quite some time. Both Saori and Ayase get this treatment, and although it was touching to learn more about them, I felt that their absence for much of the rest of the season hurt the show. I mean, they are two of the five central characters shown during the opening credits of each episode (excluding the episode with the Meruru opening), so why are they absent for so much of this season? Even stranger, it was decided to include an epilogue for a character who had only been referred to in the first season, but was never really shown: the roommate Kirino had when she was briefly staying in the US. \\n\r\nThe main part of the story does not get under way until about episode 4 or 5 and when it does the pacing is decent and the feeling of watching one unrelated short story after another abates. The feelings and interactions of Kirino and Kyousuke come across naturally and are very easy to empathize with. They once again made me care for these two characters. \\n\r\nThe final episode was a prequel and takes place earlier than any other episode before it in both seasons. Interestingly, it is told from Kirino\u2019s point of view and as such is a much needed reminder that we as viewers have up to that point been forced to see things the way Kyousuke does. The reason for including this episode so late in this series is a little obscure to me, since it changes so much in retrospect. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is decent, but after recent anime triumphs such as Haganai it did feel a little outdated. What\u2019s more, during the early episodes of the season the characters of Kirino, Ayase and Saori look far too much alike, especially after Saori takes off her glasses and lets her hair down. Some effort might have been spent on making the character drawings more unique instead of tending toward the generic. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending theme are beautiful, dreamy songs. The background music is mostly the same as during the first season, but still a joy to listen to. Especially the somewhat reggea-style comedy theme is nice. \\n\r\nThe voice actors once again do a good job. Taketatsu Ayana really brings Kirino to life with a very specific voice she seems to have created just for her (compare this to her far more standard fare approach to her part in Date A Live). Also, she portrays the emotions Kirino experiences with an almost chilling realism. A perhaps more unexpected feat of voice acting is displayed here by Hayami Saori who gives Ayase such a lively, emotional voice. Compare this to her chilling rendition of ice queen Yukinoshita Yukino on \u2018Yahari No Seishun\u2019 this very same season and you know that you are listening to a rare talent. The ever adorable Hanazawa Kana portrays Ruri (Kuroneko) with effective seriousness. Would you believe that she portrays such a similar character on Haganai, but in a comical way (Kobato)? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the seriousness of this series\u2019 theme is not reflected in the depth given to the characters. As mentioned, some of the secondary characters get their own epilogue episodes, but then rarely appear in this season anymore (Saori and to a lesser extent Ayase), while most of the others seem to serve little other function than comedy (Kanako, Kuroneko\u2019s sisters). Kirino and Kyousuke are clearly the only characters that are supposed to be \u201creal\u201d here, i.e. have more than one or two dimensions. This makes it a little hard to take anyone except Kirino seriously as a potential partner for Kyousuke, which takes away some of the suspense the \u2018who will start dating who?\u2019 question might otherwise have. \\n\r\nAnd then Kuroneko, or Gokou Ruri. I won\u2019t spoil exactly what her role was this season (although I have categorized her as a Meddler), but I will say that I found her impossible to take seriously as someone Kyousuke would even talk to. Kuroneko is such an appalling case of \u2018sixth grader syndrome\u2019 that it\u2019s just not funny anymore. She keeps dressing up as a Goth (and once as an angel), and it\u2019s clear that this aspect of her personality that is so crucial to her, is completely lost on Kyousuke. The fact that he keeps calling her by her internet handle Kuroneko instead of by her real name Gokou Ruri painfully illustrates that Kyousuke never really saw her as a real person. Her treatment of him as outlined in her \u2018Destiny Record\u2019 would have warranted him never speaking to her again, I felt. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe real predicament Kirino and Kyousuke are in is one I found to be deeply moving: can they escape from the Meddlers and start leading their own lives, untainted by the manipulations of others? Whether this is as a couple or separately is secondary, although I share most people\u2019s uneasiness at the idea of relationships between siblings. \\n\r\nI think that the true theme of this series could appeal to just about any viewer, provided that they go into this series without any preconceptions about \u2018little sister\u2019 shows. (I was completely new to this genre when I started watching this after seeing it recommended somewhere.) \\n\r\nI will definitely be re-watching this in order to further explore what the writers were trying to say with this story. In fact, I would very much like to own this on Blu-Ray with as much commentary and bonus material as possible. As long as it\u2019s at least subtitled in English, that is, since my Japanese is far too basic. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\n9/10. \\n",

            "content": "If you are coming from season 1 of this series and wondering should you continue this... the answer is yes you should the story will be half completed if you won't. But still I don't know how to explain this to you, a lot happen a lot happen, actually its double the drama compared to season 1. The anime was pretty predictable from season 1 and the predictions, well I leave it to you coz you might be having a mind set of this anime after you completed season 1. I din't actually hate it, I didn't like it either. It was boring at timesbut very interesting the other times it's like a roller coaster. I don't recommend this as an anime  to watch if you are looking for something that is not weird, if you are in to weird anime with weird plot and annoying tsundere sisters with a weird plot this is just the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nLets talk about story then...\\n\r\nF*** the story I was like WTF did I watch after this. and that's all I can say \\n\\n\r\nAbout art and graphics...\\n\r\nThey were good\\n\\n\r\nMusic...\\n\r\nThey had a different outro every ep in season 2 too so yeah thats something you should consider, the OP was also really nice. this doesn't have any scaring music like toradora or clannad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development, I rather not talk about it but....\\n\r\nIt's not that bad the characters had a bit of depth in to them, but they were some what unrealistic in few parts, discover it your self ain't going drop spoilers here..\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I think?\\n\r\nWell you will pause from time to time in the anime and will think about human existence. at times you will be like \"O.O huh? remind me why am I watching this?\" . Keeping all that aside, this is  not that fun to watch you will spam your friends inbox like a moron at times while watching this.",

She is absolutely so cute with her blushes and cosplay is total HUNNGGGGG~~~ unfortunately the anime does total injustice to her \r\nKousaka, Kirino~~~ total tsundere and i absolutely love great tsunderes' written the right way, they totally make her outto be a great sister and they 100% hit the nail on the head with how a sister would act (not including the incesty relationship) she has a super great written character and i love it\\n\\n\r\nThey had the story perfect and how the story was rolling it looked like it was going to end with Ruri ending but then they took a very sharp turn towards Kirino that continues into the last 3 episodes that really makes no sense on how the they finish the anime it leaves a really sour taste in your mouth.\\n\r\nThey really progressed the character alot in the second season and i really love how they grew the characters, they gave a lot of background insight on saori and i love how Kyousuke's parents tried to split them up and how all the heroines' came to help and celebrate with Kyousuke and oh goodness Ayase became waifu for a short amount of time and they wrapped her end really great.",

Unlike my other reviews I won't chop it up into paragraphs about the story line, characters, animation or music. Instead, this'll probably be a huge rant and trying not to spoil anything. \r\nSo, season 2 starts off with Kirino coming back from America and everyone is happy. We get the annoying little brat back, yay! Now season 2 isn't the number one thing that pissed me off, in fact this season wasn'tall that bad. But the specials that come afterwards are included in this season and that's what pissed me off. Now I won't talk about the specials because I'm going to do a separate review for that but, oh my god I want to scream!\\n\\n\r\nSo, I wasn't a huge fan of this season because of many things. The one true thing I liked about this series was Kuroneko aka Ruri because she is seriously awesome. Her and Kyousuke's relationship had me fangirling hard core. I loved them so much and then, the specials came in and ruined my life forever. \\n\\n\r\nWe finally figure out Saori and I loved that. We get more Asami and I loved that. There was a lot about this season we didn't get in season one which I loved.\\n\\n\r\nTruly I don't hate this anime, I really liked season one and I did like this season but the ending was just... no.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you have seen the first season watch this one, it won't be a waste. I give this season a 7/10 and 3 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "This series completely snuck up on me and grabbed my heartstrings. In the second season I was literally overcome with emotion in two different places.\r\nI first wrote a review after watching the first season, and gave it 9/10. But after watching the second season, I completely fell in love with the show and now offer my rarely given 10/10 rating with no regrets.\r\nI will also mention the season 2 OVAs, episodes 14 - 16. I like that the story was wrapped up with deeper explanations about why the characters felt and acted the way they did. I must say that the problem with all romancestories is that someone is going to get hurt in the end, and it really hits hard. It was truly hard to see this especially the way it was carried out with multiple girls in the story. But perhaps if a season 3 were to be contemplated, Kyosuke could attempt to repair his relationships with all the girls that loved him. I guess that's too much to ask though. Great fantasy story though, really leaves you wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I want to say that the animation itself was top notch, and all the characters were very well done. The voice acting was very emotive and the subtitles seemed well matched to the dialog. The girls were unbelievably cute, I can't think of another anime that had such deliciously adorable characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about the icy relationship between 17 year old brother Kyosuke and his younger sister 15 year old Kirino.  In the beginning, Kyosuke helps her to find a club to talk about her interests in the hopes of helping her develop healthy friendships.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line is surprising in that you think that Kirino is going to be a polite and appreciative little sister, but instead she's pretty short tempered and kind of abusive to her brother. We can't quite understand what makes her tick -- she is totally immersed in anime that revolves around \"little-sister\" eroge, yet her own relationship with her brother is very conflicted. She tests her brother, asking him for one outrageous favor after another, and struggles to show any gratitude at all. The plot becomes more complex and you are rewarded with a lot of humorous drama which leads to a surprising, if not completely satisfying end. The music in the shows was great, a different closing theme song for each episode!\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season, one of the girls becomes Kyosuke's official girlfriend. This sets up rivalries and lots of troubles which are worked through with a lot of drama to some pretty unsatisfying endings (unsatisfying to me anyway) -- ah yes, we cannot avoid the classic Japanese penchant for Train Wreck endings. I sure hope there will be another season.\\n\\n\r\nA little fan service here and there, but nothing too bold. Highly recommend if you enjoy anime depicting slice of life teenage drama and romance.\\n",

A superb anime that will have you laughing, crying and surprised.( Also note this is a ROMANCE and focuses heavily on it.)My opinion might be biased but i hold you could bear through this review.\r\nSTORY-10-This anime revolves around Kyousuke Kousaka your average high school guy, and his little sister Kirino (who happens to be an otaku),and friends. This is a continuation of the first season;(Watch the first season as it fleshes out the characters and sets up for some interesting events in the second season);and is about incest, a lot of different love confessions and ridiculous situations. (Everything in this anime has some type of meaning to it.) You would think it is your average harem but it is not, it changes up the formula for some interesting things to happen,and brings you along for a journey with a bunch of surprises. The story is fresh not your typical story, it is a story of a brother and sister who try to bond together and what they go through. It kept me captivated and ends in an unexpected way than i thought it would. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART-9- The art complements the anime,it has a colorful palate that fits right in with the story telling. It also brings the characters that you will love or hate to life. Some people might say it is average, and that may be true, but it stays true to what it is meant for and that is to complement the story; kind of like the legs to a table, and is not meant for people to praise it but to support what it needs to.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-9- I give the sound a 9 because this animes songs pertain to the story. Especially the ones sang in the episodes. Also the voices of all the characters were superb, fits the characters perfectly. Leaves nothing to be desired or wanted more of.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS-10- All of the characters where wonderful and complemented the story very well. Sure it has your tsundere, childhood friend, and all, but the creators throw in some nice, and refreshing twists. Also if it were not for the characters the way they are, i do not think the story would have went anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-10- I am a fan of Action comedies,but seeing this has made me rethink the romance genre. I wasn't expecting much of this anime but it completely surpassed my expectations. Also This anime has enough episodes (combined with first season) that i could really get into it and enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL-10- This anime took me on a fun journey that i will never forget. Also this anime leaves of on a good point and wraps up things pretty well in my opinion. It also leaves a bit of room for a possible third season, but is good where it ended. I highly recommend this anime, it is in my top 5, and thank you for reading.",

            "content": "Season 2, ep 1-16:\r\nAn emotional rollercoaster done right. Damn I love them! There are still a couple of situations that I frowned upon that I'll address in the spoilers section. \r\nDirection, art and animation, music and voice acting are all outstanding, and succeed in giving the show unique kind of charm and appeal. I heard people accusing this of shallowly pandering to unhealthy aspects of otaku culture. The second season, and especially last few episodes do an outstanding job at attacking and criticizing the said culture aspects, while still examining it from different viewpoints. However, the culture itself doesn't get presented in a way foroutsiders to it to really get it, granted this would be ridiculously hard to pull off. This is clearly targeted at the otaku culture itself. It goes without saying that the possibility of incest is a theme that gets most of attention, however it's infinitely less shallow than many other incest themed anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD: \\n\\n\r\nI did not expect it would be emotionally satisfying to see my favorite girl break down while being rejected. But the feels were so intense, and so well articulated via direction, art and dialogue, that it was easy to experience it with her, and for her. Overwhelming emotions in art are always a great experience, be they positive or negative. \\n\\n\r\nSituations that I frowned upon: The way Manami was unphased by the Ruri/Kyousuke relationship, just for it to later turn out she was in love with him all along, as hinted much earlier on. The negative way Kirino first reacted to a confession made little sense considering how she intended to do it herself. And then she suddenly completely changes her mind just because Kyosuke worded it differently? A bit of a stretch. The support that they got from Kuroneko with the car speakers incident was a bit unthinkable. Considering how great her breakdown was, seeing her moving on that easily and helping her rival was strange. Why is she not pissed off? She was quite pissed off with her breakdown, when her plan both sinked and backfired, what exactly calmed her down and made her cooperative? That should have been addressed. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the Manami showdown in the last episode. Her critical and clever mind, coupled with nice and pleasant exterior really make her an outstanding character. Instead of character development, we get to see and understand what's behind her facade, peeling back the layers and taking peeks inside her psyche, until it all comes down crashing and pouring down in the last episode. In adapting the novel, anime fails at the end of episode 8. Ruri's thoughts and intentions were misrepresented, and knowing this on time made a world of difference to me, and made the show deeper. Similar problem happens with the very ending. Taken on it's own, it's the worst ending in any show ever. Reading between the lines, with the help from the note by author, it starts making sense, c/p from a reddit comment:\\n\\n\r\n''No. Not just that. It's clear from what he says, that ''1. I couldn't just write full retard incest end because editors''.''2. But I did what I could so that you get it anyway'', and ''3. If you still don't get what I'm saying, Kirino WINS FULL SCALE wink THEY HAVE A SHARED SECRET wink'' \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I find it sad to see artistic expression limited by this kind of censorship. \\n\\n\r\nI loved that the anime tried to make a point. And that point was that we don't choose who we love. And that this very fact can have brutal consequences. It also criticizes both incest, and social norms surrounding it. It even goes as far as criticizing eroge in stimulating this kind of behaviour.",

They pulled something like it but it still wasn't good. The main character was so smart and great for almost the whole anime but the last bunch of episodes were, in my opinion, just plain stupid. I would have loved tosee what would have happened with many of the other girls. I also felt that in the end the two main characters weren't really acting like how they normal acted in the rest of the anime. To me it seemed like two entirely different people.

            "content": "Oreimo was the first anime to break my heart, but a little more than a year, all 12 novels and (some of) the PSP game later I've finished my rewatch of the series and wanted to talk about what's kept me returning to the series, and why I ultimately decided to keep the second season at a 6.\r\nOreimo is at its heart a sibling romantic comedy, one that's deeply colored by the author's very obvious wish-fulfillment as well as his putting his experiences and perceptions of otaku culture into literature, and then on screen. At its best and most accessible, the viewer, like Kyousuke, istreated to a whirlwind tour of eroge, cosplay, shopping in Akihabara, vending at Comiket, idols, fujoshi, figure collecting, and more. The way these desires are treated is almost loving in detail, shown in the great amount of detail put into everything from the changing OPs and Kirino's games to the R18 Meruru doujinshi being sold in some fantasy equivalent of Toranoana. The exploration of Kirino's interests mirrors the writer's (and many viewers') own wrestling with socially complicated desires, and her relationship with Kyousuke is one big imouto eroge fantasy, complete with route selections and chase scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this together provides what I think is some of the lasting charm of the series, and the second season compliments the first well in that respect. There's more eroge, more idol concerts, more comiket - all depicted in the show's decent-to-good art and sound quality. However, this comes with a greater focus on character relationships as the complications from the first season are developed in the second, with mixed results. Part of the strain comes from the general trouble of trying to adapt the books to screen - the relatively mild amount of cutting and rewriting they did in the first season is greatly upped here as they struggle to adapt the rest of the series to 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the character relationships tend to feel a bit more cramped and their actions and personalities a bit more exaggerated than in the novels. Large portions of the story related to Ayase, Kanako, and Kyousuke himself were cut, leaving a still-enjoyable but heavily edited story that feels a little less massaged than the first season. There's also a distinct harem-y flavor to the whole thing for which your mileage may vary. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the flattening of characters comes not only because of compromises in bringing this to screen but because, at the end of the day, the characters are written in part to illustrate various facets of otaku culture as stressed in season 1, and to compliment and complicate the relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke as stressed in season 2. They exist as it were as so many various routes in one of Kirino's eroge - the many tempting choices still revolving around the true sister route, and though who Kyousuke actually ends up with and how his relationship with Kirino and the rest works out is largely left up to the OVAs the work is faithful to one of the golden rules of sibling romances - there can be no sibling love story without suffering. \\n\\n\r\nOreimo season 2 is a decent sequel to the first season. It feels different and not always in a good way, but if you enjoyed the first season it's worth a watch.",

            "content": "-Project Zakuro Reviews: OreImo Season 2-\r\nThe second season of Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (or OreImo for short) has been a long awaited hyped-up sequel to the first season which had gained much notoriety through the theme of otaku acceptance. So does this season have the potential to match that of its predecessor? Well then, let's find out.\r\nAt the start of the season, I wasn't sure if the story was going to change much throughout the course of the anime after the first season but as I continued on, It turned out that I was wrong. There were major changes tothe whole story shortly after the beginning. The main theme of the first season was promoting otaku acceptance which it had did very well. But what I had surprisingly discovered is that the second season seems to stray away from that theme, especially halfway through to focus more on romantic relationships and the usual cliches of the slice-of-life genre. In other words, Kirino's anime and eroge obsession has been kept at a minimum to focus more on Kyousuke and his relationships with other girls. The whole change to the story was kind-of disappointing in my eyes because I was expecting much more from the success of the first season (much like anyone else). It felt like I was in a \"been there, done that\" territory of the entire genre. Although I do not think the story is terrible or a massive failure, I do feel that it has lost all of its potential due to the fact it was straying away from its original theme. To put it simply, the story itself had become one big cliche of slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and character designs hasn't changed much from the first season, only this time it has far more crisper quality. But that doesn't change the fact that the art still wasn't as appealing as other anime art designs. As I mentioned in my previous review of the first season, the artwork by Hiro Kanzaki is not bad but nothing too impressive either because it has been trying to stay as much realistic as possible. What I mean by this is that although the characters are good to look at, they're to put it simply just plain. Nothing special about them to be honest. This was fixed however with the inclusion of varied art styles in the first season but because the story strayed away from its original theme, those varied art styles were almost completely absent throughout the season. To sum this up, the art designs hasn't changed much but it is still decent for this anime's standards. The animation pretty much mimics that of the first season but everything still runs smoothly to the frame rate. There are some scenes where the frame rate was a little off but that is hardly a major problem so the overall animation is still good.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to say much for the background music as the second season reused a majority of soundtracks from the first season. The soundtracks are basic and average which is nothing too impressive but they do fit their scenarios quite well. The new opening theme by ClariS is very impressive and I can see the effort and potential put into it but in my honesty, it paled in comparison to the first season's opening theme which was done extremely well. It seems that ClariS was trying too hard to top their previous masterpiece but the theme is still good nonetheless. The wide variety of ending themes were also a nice touch but there were way too many of them for me to keep track and critique them properly. All I can say is that they are still nice ear-catching compositions. Now for the voice acting. Again, I'm not going to say much as the second season reused all of the previous voice actors from the first. So far the quality of the characters' voices hasn't slipped and they are still very decent and good to comprehend. Needless to say, the voice actors did a very good job with their characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters themselves. For the most part, some characters are likable but I've noticed some major changes with the characters along with the story and I'm not impressed with most of these changes. So now I'm going to list them specifically. I felt that the character Saori was losing her spotlight as she appeared less times in the second season and had less of an impact. Sure there was an entire episode dedicated to Saori's backstory but that didn't make much of a shift in her spotlight and to see one of the original key characters of the first season reduced to a mere background character was depressing. Speaking of spotlights, Kuroneko has gained a large leap from her original status to become part of Kyousuke's developing relationships. Since when did the producers decide to make her the leading major character of the show? That was quite of an unexpected move considering that Kuroneko is my personal favorite of the bunch. As I mentioned before in the story, Kyousuke and Kirino had swapped roles so now that Kyousuke is the main centerpiece in order to focus more on developing relationships. Kirino's otaku hobbies are still present but they have been kept to a minimum and Kirino is still the \"annoying imouto\" as ever. As for Kyousuke, it looked like the producers had tried way too hard to transform him into a harem king which was far beyond his original personality. I had mixed feelings about Kyousuke in the first season but now I feel sorry for Kyousuke because the producers were exploiting too many perverted opportunities with him, making him sound like a total jerk. Lastly were Manami and Ayase. Ayase was unfortunately a victim to the whole Kyousuke relationship thing and it looked like they were somewhat making her the yandere type. Again, this was an unexpected change far from her original personality. As for Manami, there were no changes but one particular episode made me thought that she was a hypocrite to Kirino. Now that my rant about the characters is done, all I can say is that the changes in their spotlights and personalities has made a major dent in their previous reputations that made them likable in the first season. I hope the producers will learn from their mistakes and make sure they don't commit the same mistake again for another anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, although I do not think OreImo season 2 is terrible, there are some flaws with it that unfortunately doesn't make it the same level as its predecessor. To me, I would call this anime a hit-and-miss. I wouldn't recommend this anime to everyone but if you're the type that can bare with flaws and/or are a fan of the first season, then I would definitely recommend this to you. From there on, only you can decide the outcome of OreImo season 2 from your own experience.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Evaluation: Flawed but still watchable.",

            "content": "I had great, great expectations for this second season of OreImo. \r\nI only watched the first season recently, last September (or October, well anyways, it wasn't much time ago) and I've been waiting for the second ever since. \r\nAt first, it looks a lot like the first season - random comedy-like situations about Kirino and Kyousuke. But something's different this time. Their relationship changed, it grew in some way. You'll probably find some spoilers in this, I guess.\r\nStory - 6\r\nI'm really sorry OreImo, why did you have to turn into a bland RomCom?\r\nI believe there were quite a few plot holes somewhere - why didall the girls at a certain point fell in love with Kyousuke while in the first season they barely talked to him? And well, they should've decided whether to focus the show's plot on romance or on more random situations, because doing it like this probably just ruined the whole thing.\\n\r\nThere were only a very few episodes I enjoyed, which were the first ones and the end, as well. I won't talk about the plot anyways because it'd just be me ranting over the fact I didn't like the KuronekoxKyousuke thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8 \\n\r\nThe art is the same from the first season. I liked that, I like this as well. It's simple, cute and colorful. Except for a few Merurus, there wasn't too much moeness either. Still, I thought Meruru was cute too (lol).\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe opening to this show was good. Not as good as irony, but I'm a bit biased when it comes to ClariS I guess. Even thought at first I thought it wasn't catchy, I found myself more than once with this opening theme stuck in my head. \\n\r\nI can't talk about the endings because I swear, this different-ending-for-each-episode thing made me forget them all and I don't really feel like wasting my time re-listening to 11 (because I believe they got \"reunion\" as ending theme in the Meruru show episode) tracks. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was really good too. But what else would you expect from a cast with seiyuus like Hanazawa Kana (KuroNeko) and Nakamura Yuuichi (Kyousuke) in it? But my favourite one has to be Nabatame Hitomi as Saori. I also liked Taketatsu Ayana voicing Kirino. She made me like that character even more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nI enjoyed the growth of Kirino and Kyousuke's sister-brother relationship, but they turned my poor KuroNeko into a doormat-like-all-lovey-dovey kind of person. Or maybe it was because in the first season she was more like a secondary character? I have no idea. To think she was my favourite character before... \\n\\n\r\nI understood just now that the character that makes this show unique is the very main character, Kirino - she's a bit different from before, she does care about her brother now, and this new attitude towards him is nice, but her lovely tsundere-ish attitude (because I'm weird and I find tsunders lovely) is still there. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character that I really loved - but I believe most people don't care too much about - is Ayase. I find her just too cute! She'd look good with Kyousuke too. (I believe she'd look good with Kirino too, but it wouldn't be an OreImo-type thing). And the yandere thing in one of the first episodes, was one of the best scenes of the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nThen on to Kyousuke. Kyousuke you damn SisCon. I still can't seem to decide whether I like him or not. Like, sometimes he's just your average high school boy. Some other times, he's funny, and shows some emotions. It's just that character you don't know what to say about, but except for some more SisCon attitude he hasn't changed much from the previous season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -6\\n\r\nA really, really hard decision - I loved a few episodes and was really bored by some others. I remember, during the very first weeks, I always couldn't wait until it was Sunday (my Japanese is quite good in reading, but not as much in listening, so I had to wait for it to be subbed) for the next episode to come out. It can't be helped, I guess? Many people probably enjoyed this turn of events more than me. Good thing there was less fanservice I'd imagined. Because I don't like fanservice at all. Any kind, I just find it really annoying. I know sometimes you need fanservice in comedies, to create ambiguous situations, but well, I'm glad there was just an average amount.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nEven thought I put some 8s, my final score is 6.\\n\r\nThe first season is one of my favourite anime comedies ever - Kirino always made me laugh so much. But this... I know now what people mean by saying sometimes a second seasons ruins a show. It's not like I hated this show, but it's just that it became average, while the original OreImo was truly unique, in my opinion. It's probably because, as I said in the beginning, my expectations for OreImo 2 were really, really high, that I found it so.. normal. It's the perfect thing to say about this season, \"normal\". Not good, nor bad. Lastly, I don't want you to think this review was written to dissuade you from watching it - you will probably like it if you like romantic stuff (or if you like any character from this show; if it wasn't for Kirino I probably would've dropped it a few episodes ago). But I like comedy more, so I guess this wasn't really the right thing for me. I'll be waiting for the next four episodes to come out anyway. Even after this a little disappointing second season, I'm looking forward to watching the very end to this (still good) anime.",

They only have Meaning when they developed the characters more, Episodes 7 onward did that\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment i felt was hanging on the development of the characters which for me was the core of the show, I enjoyed Episode 7 onward's, but before then it felt like it lacked a direction or focus and thus as explained in my introduction this season two is a mixed bag, but i have say it was worth my time and i felt it was going to be worse than it turned out to be, as i expected FAR more Fan-Service than what was shown. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.5)\\n\\n\r\nAs i cannot do .5, I will be pessimistic and round down to 7, It was a decent series and was enjoyable so if you have watched Season One this is worth your time to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnding (Slight Spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nOreImo leaves it open which i felt vindicates my points of their lack of direction, But they do resolve certain plots and gives the viewer a hint what could happen in the future, Will we see OreImo S3? Only time will tell.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The story itself for this anime is great. The protagonist and his tsundere-like little sister have a relationship that makes the viewers love them both and at other times feel so sorry for the MC for how he sometimes gets treated. I myself couldn't help myself at certain scenes of romance from tearing up and sobbing from how great the delivery was. \r\nThe ART work as well was quite special as each character really had their own unique kind of appearance. That goes for almost any anime, but this one, in particular, was really enjoyable to watch, as each character's facial expression and the animationwas truly pleasant at almost all times.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the Story, the SOUND is what I'll remember the most in this anime. The voice acting is great of course, but what really had me was the music. Occasionally, the sad themed music would play and it was so well timed that it's as if that music became a trigger for the waterworks! And when the MC would be with various girls, of course including his sister, very happy, fun music will play that I absolutely loved listening to. Whoever produced the sound for this anime, if they're not widely recognized already I definitely think they should be!!\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, I think I've said enough about that so far. However, one thing I need to point out is that I watched Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sakunai BEFORE watching this. And that anime left me with a void that I could NOT fill at all. However, Ore no Imouto filled that void with its loveable storyline, music, and characters. It was also great to find similar characters, which I'm sure you'll see what I mean once you've watched both series!\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read this whole review, I thank you very much! I rarely write reviews on MyAnimeList because it takes a fair bit of time due to MAL's post length demands. But... OreImo is worth writing a review for and I'm probably gonna rewatch it!",

            "content": "I originally got into Oreimo because of the otaku culture. I'm an otaku living outside of Japan so it was interesting to see some of the otaku stuff in Japan...how people react and such.\r\nThat being said...I knew this was also an anime about incest between a brother and sister...at least to a degree (they don't get past kissing ffs.). I'm not against incest in anime...I actually enjoy it (all be it in yaoi form), so I won't say I didn't enjoy it for that...\r\nThis review is for the whole show...both seasons and the specials.\r\nStory:\r\nIt was delightful. It took a spin on the typical \"gross\" otakustereotype and made it into a cute middle school girl. I love that. I also love how they depict the other otaku girls...showing off that just because your an otaku, doesn't mean your a gross 40 something year old man with a little girl fetish. And it's true. The news reports we hear about otaku killers are just slander against a very small community. It's disgusting the hate for otakus...but I don't see it changing any time soon. The major part of the story focuses on the two siblings and how they interact with each other...finally finding a somewhat happy medium.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the artwork...lots of attention to detail with the figures, manga and anime in the stores...and the cosplay costumes were also really detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe Stardust Witch Meruru song that Kanako Kurusu sang was catchy as hell lol.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where the anime messed up. I felt that the sister was...way to tsundere. At times it was even off putting. But the worst character by far was Ayase Aragaki. The most annoying girl in the damn anime. All of season one I hated her...season two I hated her less but I still wanted her to get hit by a truck...I also thought her \"confession\" was complete BS.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime, even if some the characters annoyed me to no end. But that ending was...it wasn't as bad as School Days but it was up there. They pushed the two siblings together through the whole damn anime, only for them to break it off after FINALLY kissing?! And yes I know that it's hinted at that they still have a relationship...I don't consider hints useful. The anime should have ended with them kissing. It would have been a great ending...but no they had to wuss out.",

            "content": "Honestly I would just say I hated this anime but I loved it so much at the same time. Oreimo is an anime that will probably never be forgotten to a person who watches it. If you watch the first season you should know the story is about a little sister and her big brother falling in love with each other. The story isn't the greatest ever but it brings so much fun and enjoyment to other perverts and lolicons such as myself LOL. Okay but honestly it's really funny and dumb. The art is at a very high level. The characters are so welldrawn also there is so much detail in the eroge and the anime shops. The music is pretty good as well I love the first opening of Oreimo S2. The characters you should know if you watched season one are Kousaka Kyousuke the big brother and the protagonist of the story. He is kinda plain but a very uhhh emotional person when it comes to his little sister.  Kyousuke's little sister is the female main of the story who is tsudere to hell Kirino Kousaka. She is pretty damn cute... uh she's really tsudere and she brings a lot of innocence to the show (also takes away a lot). People might find this anime trash and all I know it is too. What makes this anime special is what you feel when you watch it. It makes you want to laugh it makes you want to cry also it makes you want to straight up punch something some times but if you are looking for a fun time you should watch Oreimo.",

            "content": "(Spoiler) This anime was a roller-coaster of happy viewing and pure anger. The characters are well developed and I can understand all of their actions perfectly, except of course Kirino. The little sister repeatedly acts erratically, annoyingly and even when her actions are explained much later in the anime it still doesn't quite make sense. Tbh part of my anger stems from my opinion that he should choose Kuroneko. However, the ending left much to be desired, even after choosing Kirino and messing up his life one chunky bit at a time, he ends up not being in a relationship with his sister even thoughhe loves her and she loves him. In addition to this from the actions of Kirino's that i do understand the entire plot can easily (even after the last episode) a plot to destroy her brothers life out of severe spite and anger. As a side note, I also think Manami would have approached Kyousuke about Kirino's 'love', to deter him from falling in love with Kirino, at least after Kirino started talking to her brother again. To be fair I have just finished watching the anime, and so the anger is still fresh in my mind, but other than Kirino being one of my most despised characters of all time, I would advise watching this anime.",

(Even though she had this basic sad past that ive already forgotten about).\\n\\n\r\nKirino was very annoying but the anime (and manga) kept describing her as perfect which kind of annoyed me because she has all these strange fetishes and she's very bitchy but idk that's perfect somehow--\\n\\n\r\nPretty sure i just sounds salty rn so lets leave it at that.
