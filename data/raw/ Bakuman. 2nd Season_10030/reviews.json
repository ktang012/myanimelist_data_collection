Maybe I'm just biased, but to me it deserves it.\r\nIf you enjoyed Bakuman Season 1 then you MUST See Bakuman Season 2, anyone who enjoyed Bakuman Season 1 as much as I should agree with my rating of 10 for season 2.\r\nSome anime's are good, and their second seasons are just a drag, but with Bakuman, season 1 was great and season 2 is even better! The story continues from season 1, even after season 1 I wanted to see what happened next and I still feel the same now in season 2 at episode 6.\r\nStory: 10\r\nUnlikemany anime's Bakuman is realistic. It shows many hardships throughout the story that the characters go through, just when things get better a new tragedy occurs. It really says something about real life, the realistic plot is one of Bakuman's greatest traits and it helps as get into the story even more when we feel the hardships as the characters feel them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters in Bakuman are very well developed, we understand them enough to feel what they feel on screen. I find when things start going well for a particular character I'm smiling, and when things start going bad I get concerned and can't even stop watching to go to the bathroom because I want to see things get resolved!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWell the art is a little different from other anime's but by no means does that make it bad, but rather good. I especially like the art within the art-that is the art that the Mashiro (the protagonist) draws.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound is great, it really helps bring the audience into the story and characters though I don't notice as much as I notice other things in the anime, I'm sure that is because of my inartistic brain, I do however know that the sound is what controls the moods of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoy this anime a lot and I believe you will too, as long as your not a violence loving maniac. I would give it a try, and if your not hooked by the first episode I'll be quite surprised.\\n",

            "content": "They say you can measure how good a anime is by how fast time seems to fly by when watching it, if that's the case, Bakuman 2 is one amazing series.\r\nThe first season of Bakuman was great, the story, the characters, the atmosphere fitted perfectly, though It did suffer from pacing problems and could of been adapted better. This time however, J.C Staff has stepped up their game, managing to fix those problems and make Bakuman 2 one hell of a enjoyable anime and probably the best slice-of-life series I've seen yet.\r\n= Story [9] =\r\nBakuman starts exactly where it left off from the first seasonand gets right into the story. I won't say much to avoid spoiling it for people who happen to see this review before watching the first season but this season has a lot more drama and romance, which make for some very intense scenes and memorable moments.\\n\\n\r\nSomething, that is unique to the story of Bakuman is how realistic it is. The two main characters aren't always successful and positive like you find in most shonen series and there isn't any shock twists which would be impossible to find in a real life situation, well maybe one.\\n\\n\r\n= Art [9] =\\n\r\nI never get tired of the art in this series, It's amazing how J.C Staff can make  the manga illustrations look so realistic and the amount of detail and effort they put into the backgrounds.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are nothing special but they don't really need to be, If anything, the only character design I can fault is Shuujin's/Takagi's, It's just that he looked a lot different and a lot better in the manga, though I don't really mind the change.\\n\\n\r\n= Sound [8] =\\n\r\nI have to admit, I didn't like any of the first seasons OP and ED's that much, though Bakuman 2 has some great ones which really suit the story-lines in this season. The OST remains nearly entirely the same in this season, which is a good thing since it doesn't feel overused yet and suits the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the VA's do a great job reprising their roles and the newcomers fit their parts perfectly in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n= Character [8] =\\n\r\nThere's a lot more Character development this time around, which is welcomed especially for the minor characters such as Aoki and Nakai, who really annoyed me at first, but then actually became likeable. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance side of Bakuman shines through a lot more this time around, which also helped character development a lot, though some of the relationships became a bit boring and repetitive during the the second half of the story. \\n\\n\r\n=Enjoyment [9]=\\n\r\nBakuman 2 is one addicting ride, the story and the characters really draw you in and makes you want to finish the whole series in one go, which not just any anime can emulate.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of first season, you'll love this sequel, all the spirit and fun of the manga and prequel are maintained in Bakuman's second anime outing, which leaves us eagerly awaiting the third season. \\n\\n\r\n=Overall [9]=\\n\r\nOverall, Bakuman 2 outdoes it's predecessor in every aspect, with faster pacing, a more 'tighter' and entertaining story, great character development with art and sound to top it off. If it wasn't for a slow down during the the latter episodes with the story and characters, I would've considered Bakuman 2 a masterpiece.",

After watching the second episode I had so much I wanted to tell everyone it had to be done through a review.\r\nI'll skip right to the interesting part, this series has totally sucked me in. The first season was all fantastic and really something else the whole way. Luckily, this isn't something that's about to change. It's actually on the contrary, these two episodes have made their way and are actually starting to already top their predecessor.\r\nAlthough I can't judge the whole book by it's cover (it'sonly like 40 minutes of something to watch right now) but these minutes have made an huge impact on me. Both times I've been having a stomach-ache because I've actually started worrying about the characters so much, felt their joy and just enjoyed following their story. All have been done in such a wonderful compound I can't really describe it, and yet I try.\\n\\n\r\nMy only worry at the moment is that my expectations are rising through the roof and beyond which may damage the rest of the series. Most certainly I'll be able to keep my cool and enjoy the rest of it which hopefully  goes by the high standard that these two episodes have put up.",

            "content": "Bakuman is both entertaining and educational. It shows that it's not so simple to write or draw something that people will appreciate. If you want to make something truly good, you might have to revise and redo it several times as they do in this series. I like that Bakuman shows how difficult it is; it makes it more realistic. It's still entertaining at an anime level, though, since the characters passionately aim for the top. \r\n* * * S T O R Y * * * \r\nIt's rather original and is likely to draw in anyone with an interest in anime/manga. It has somepretty good drama and whatever in it. \\n\\n\r\n* * * A R T * * * \\n\r\nI'd say the \"typical anime faces\" (such as oAo) they sometimes have kinda lowers the quality of this series. I like that they have some more original types of gag faces, though. The art and animation looks quite nice overall. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the parts where they showed storyboards/\"names\" were poorly drawn and dull to look at. I think they should've at least had more panels/actions shown so we could see the story, not just hear a narration. Manga is all about the visuals, after all. There were some good moments with the more elaborate manuscripts, though. \\n\\n\r\n* * * S O U N D * * * \\n\r\nI think Mashiro sounds a little too wimpy. The music didn't stand out to me whatsoever. Their relaxed, \"everyday\" country-ish music is just pretty boring. They live in a city, so why the country bumpkin music? There's other music more appropriately fitting the anime, but none of it is memorable. \\n\\n\r\n* * * C H A R A C T E R S * * * \\n\r\nYes, yes, people hate Miura. I think Miura was another good display of what the world of manga can be like. He also developed into a decent editor after realizing his flaws. As an obstacle, he created more entertaining points in the series and made the end result all the more satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nMashiro and Takagi are always developing and learning to see manga from different perspectives. They change in other ways, too, making unexpected decisions as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters develop, other characters stay the same. That's the way life is, including when it comes to a manga artist's aspirations (or lack of). \\n\\n\r\n* * * E N J O Y M E N T * * *\\n\r\nCompared to the Bakuman manga, they cut out a lot of the more technical aspects of planning and writing manga. They kept the \"Tanto arc\" short and sweet, really. It also feels like they balanced things out so that Azuki would seem like she has more involvement in the series. I know people complained about how small her role was in the manga, so I think this is a good change. It was pretty easy to neglect and forget about her in the manga, but I think it's important to maintain this romantic aspect based on true love. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like is how they made it sound like panty shots are not only normal, but necessary in the world of manga. Honestly, things like that cause people to label all manga as bad. I think panty shots should've been treated as a cheap way to get votes from perverts, not something a female manga artist should strive to achieve. It's sad to think people would be unable to appreciate a good story unless it had softcore porn in every chapter. \\n\\n\r\n* * * O V E R A L L * * *\\n\r\nGood story, nothing really disappointing (other than the panty thing), satisfying ending. I didn't find this too addicting, but maybe that's just because I read the manga already. This is some quality anime.",

            "content": "First of all let me begin by saying this Anime is written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata who made Death Note and unlike some of the other works that have been produced since this anime has the special sauce too. MAYONNAIISEEE.\r\nTrying to find L?\r\nSorry you'll have to look somewhere else.\r\nThis is the sequel of the first Bakuman which continues the story of Takagi Akito and Mashiro Moritaka; two teenagers who aspire to be mangakas with a popular long running manga serialization that gets turned into an anime. Mashiro in particular wants their career to take off quickly because of a promise hemade with Azuki Miho, the girl he'd been in love with since elementary school, that the two of them would marry once they accomplished their dreams as they try to make a name for themselves in the intense business world of manga publishing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise with J.C. Staff at the helm of the much-anticipated anime adaptation, you\u2019d expect some pretty damn good animation. Luckily, the studio delivers fluid movement and great attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was once again really well done and high quality like its predecessor. The art was quite good throughout each episode. The anime\u2019s art shows a great amount of detail yet still maintaining that slice of life environment in the anime. Something which intrigued me the most, in terms of the art, was the displaying of the stories each manga artist made. By animating the storyline and having a narrator explaining the information in the manga, improved the anime. The character themselves were well illustrated and fluidly animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very good for the characters. I felt that the character's representations through their vocal expressions suited them perfectly and portrayed their attitudes and personalities nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's also the OPs and EDs. They're not terrible, but they are definitely boring and I skipped them nearly every time. Granted, it's not a big thing and has nothing to do with the actual story, but for a series that's all about creating stuff the public will like, they sure dropped the ball in this aspect.  Overall I didn't find anything too annoying throughout the anime series regarding the soundtrack. It was well presented.\\n\\n\r\nIt was nice to see the variety of characters, with their assortment of personalities. They definitely added depth to this anime. \\n\r\nAs with the story, this season of Bakuman only touches on its cast of characters and what we learn of them is only the tip of the metaphorical iceberg. That being said, the two central protagonists develop reasonably as they embark on their quest to become published mangaka. \\n\\n\r\nWhether it is Takigi's boldness,  Moritaka's determination. the surprising feminess of tomboy Miyoshi, The eccentricness of ingenious mangaka Eiji Nizuma, and some others. almost all characters were well written and had great chemistry with each other. The two main characters go through development as their bonds and determination are tested.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone with an interest in the behind-the-scenes workings of a large manga publication, and particularly when it comes to the shounen genre, I can\u2019t recommend Bakuman enough. \\n\\n\r\nBakuman season two delivered the same type of feelings and emotions that the first season did. Following Saiko and Shujin through their life as they pursue one of my dreams has been wonderful.",

To me, that makes it special, but other people might think the real value is elsewhere.\r\nStory (10/10):\r\nWhat makes the story one of the few 10's out there is that it combines romance, comedy, a tale of growing up, and mixes it with what may be the greatest motivational shounen I have come to know. If i had to find one flaw, it would be that I could never amount to Ashirogi's (the main mangaka duo) drive to succeed.\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nThe art's nothing special, except for themanga shown in the anime. It looked like it was drawn professionally and makes you want to read the fake series, even if you can't. One thing that always bothered me about Bakuman though, was random moments where the characters' faces would get a new design just to express an quick emotion with a comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nI can replay the openings and endings just to remember this anime masterpiece, which is a plus.  The ost though never really stood out, only puts in noise where it could have been awkwardly silent otherwise. This is only in Japanese, but they get so into the roles that you forget there are people speaking into a mic. It adds a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nWhy another 10? Bakuman 2 does the most out of the 3 series to bring out the purpose of each character. After one series, you can really start to bond.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) & Overall (9/10):\\n\r\nI loved it so much, that I started collecting the manga just to relive the story. It is one of those series that everyone must see if they are at all into motivational stories that go above and beyond what they think shounen is.",

There will not be spoilers to other series besides this (I wont do what I did on my BS Pirates [see what I did there?] review is what I'm trying to get at).\r\nNow I have heard from countless people who haven't watched this series that the only reason they won't watch it is because all it is is about writing manga and that there is no way something a brief description of the general premise they read once could possibly leave out details. By the way they will alsotell you that LOST is only about a bunch of people living on an island for 6 whole seasons without anything interesting happening. It's people like this who deserved to be slapped across the face (with the actual Bakuman manga for added irony), forced to sit down and watch this show as it is nothing like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues from the exact moment Bakuman left off where their awesome manager Hattori was switched around with Miua; a short, chubby man who thinks simply getting the job is all you need so they shouldn't have their sights aimed any higher afterwards. Because no one filled this guy in on the entire reason Mashiro decided to start writing manga this series starts to take a bad turn as his lack of skill leads them back to the drawing board. Eventually this turns around for them and he finally starts to learn a thing or two about inspiring people and they get back on track. Fortunately for them Hattori gets off his prideful ass and helps them like a pal which gets them to the top yet again.\\n\\n\r\nNow aside from the new pathetic manager of theirs (I really hate him) there are lots of other things interesting about the series. One of them being the character Hiramaru. Now we got a glimpse of his at the end of the first season as someone who randomly picked up a manga and thought it was a simple thing to do and proves his point. He came off as a really serious character who would prove yet another hurtle for our duo to leap. In this season, however, he is one of the biggest dumbasses who ever lived. He is a lazy bastard who thought that manga would take no effort at all and all he would have to do in life is eat and sleep because work is such a drag. This ultimately backfired on him as his manga was so good he got instantly serialized and now has to work on the weekends too. He is, however, absolutely hilarious and shows that this series can continue to make new and interesting characters who don't share the same personality as everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also the ever-increasing bond between Mashiro and his love to be. A particular scene that occurred when Mashiro wound up in the hospital because he forgot humans need to sleep every so often if they want to live was one of the most touching scenes I've seen in an anime (in the romance regard, and believable ones don't come very often for me I assure you) in a long while. Character development is one thing but the ability to make two characters develop together when they almost rarely see each other is a talent in itself. This was also written by the guy/gal who wrote Death Note, or so I have heard, so amazement is to be expected. \\n\\n\r\nNow there was one thing about this season I didn't like and it's the fact that by the end of it they're right back where they started only this time with the chief editor threatening to fire them if they don't continue to be better than the kid who yells at birds and turns paper into top-selling manga at the rate that Jesus turns water into wine. The difference is that I don't like wine, but I do like manga so if Jesus is having problems competing with the guy you know your in for a hard time. \\n\\n\r\nI also didn't like how it seemed the only real reason fatass was made their manager was so the story didn't progress too far and they can get other things done like marriage and almost dying before the whole point of the show concludes. \\n\\n\r\nNow another thing I find that I enjoy is the shows tendency to make fun of fat people. First there is the manager who fucks up t=everything they've accomplished and doesn't go to hell for it until after he makes up for it by becoming semi-decent at doing his job. Oh and the reason I said hell is because I would think being taken from two nice kids who inspired you to do more with your career and being put into a group consisting of a child who forgot to take his Ritalin and a complete bitch whose first words to you was a threat to sue, a group I might add that was founded by your replacement, is a pretty shitty way to go. The other fatass whose name eludes me did a complete opposite of our previous fatty by going from a guy we were able to respect to a complete and total douchebag . He claims to love Aoki more than anyone else yet when she comes and asks him for help he tries to force her into a relationship which leads to him leaving the show out of guilt. Personally I'd like to roll them down a hill and see who can climb up to get the victory bucket of fried chicken first.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I'd like to bitch about isn't the shows fault at all and it was an issue that had me left with teary-eyes several weeks in a row and that would be the fucking subs. Why the fuck does it take you 5 days to sub a god damn anime which can usually be done by subbers in an hour or two. I did my research and it turns out you bastards subbed everything elce on time so why this? Please don't sub Bakuman 3 and leave it to someone else unless you can learn to pick up the pace or give us an excuse as leaving us in the dark doesn't get you anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this show is an amazing show that deserves all the respect it has from fans. I give this show a 9 out of ten. I don't like giving hardcore calculations as numbers don't justify the value of ark, and THIS IS ART. Now someone edit the last moment of the series for me to have Mashiro's uncle's ghost standing next to ghost obi-wan and ghost yoda while that ewok victory music plays because tht would be badass!",

            "content": "Might as well mention this, I don't usually write reviews and this IS my first one on mal. As well as I absolutely LOVE the first season and yet absolutely HATE Miura for ruining the second.\r\nThe first season had made me a complete fan of not just Bakuman, but more of Ashirogi Muto. As a normal fan, meaning seeing the chars as not part of an anime but as real life humans, I felt joy and excitement as well as suspense, nervousnous, and disappointment along with the flow of the story.\r\nThe second season, simply put... it's Miura style. I bore with it until the 12episode, but I hate Miura. The second season is just like him. They make you angry, they keep you smiling dumbly, but does not surpass an above average hatable anime level. In other words, nothing TOO bad about it, but a big disappointment compared to the first season. I cannot feel the emotions alongside the characters anymore. But still, leaving all that aside and ignoring detestable Miura... leaving the fans personal opinions aside, it's a good anime. But that is LEAVING all that aside.\\n\\n\r\nArt I liked it overall. I don't usually like those puffed up lips and that hairstyle as well as I always hate FATNESS! But, somehow I bore with it. Of course, I didn't like those parts but, the rest made up. HOWEVER! Nothing compared to the previous season again. I mean, the art looks pretty much the same, but still the first season I could ignore all ugly guys cause they were not hated. They can be usefull, they know manners, they know how to keep themselves together without pulling hind legs. But... the second season I could bear with it but I can not ignore it. Unlike the first which I only noticed near the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound... well, it's find isn't it? Honestly I don't know. It sounds fine... but sound is the one thing I know nothing about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, well... I prefer the previous season again. Reason of course a large part is alot of hated characters are put in the second season, but that's just 90%. I don't like the fact that Saiko gives in so easily. Even though first ep in season one was VERY embarrassing, however the rest of the story made up or rather overpassed it. And besides... I didn't hate any char in that season = =\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Yea, it goes to the bottom. I mean, I hate it. But other then I hate it I found it enjoying too. It's not that it sucks but just that I detest it. Simply put, I enjoyed it when I hate it so I dropped it reluctantly and most likely picking it up reluctantly again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... well I thought of an 8 but considering how I hate it? A 7 was the most I can go for. However it def deserves a 7, and prob an 8 for those who don't take anime seriously. But comparing as always, it's not worth an 8 if you think how great the first season is.\\n\\n\r\nThose who want to know more despite anything else after watching the first, yea go ahead and watch this too.\\n\\n\r\nThose who want to leave a beautiful and perfect image and can bear with knowing there's a second season? Quit it, you'll find out soon the difference and get disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThose who want a beautiful image but can't help but want to know more... just like me, I'll wait for third season. Who knows? They might fire off Miura and get someone proper again. Ah and that fatty two timer too. I don't hate him but I absolutely don't like him.",

            "content": "Quote from Mashiro, slight spoiler from episode 25 but for a good reason.\r\n\"Parents use to say \"Manga will make you stupid.\" But manga gradually came to be recognized as having cultural value\r\nThat's why I think you should draw a manga with content and quality that you wouldn't be ashamed to say has cultural value\r\nBut since we don't have the ability to do that we have to draw it with popularity in mind.\r\nI think it's okay for anyone to draw manga like that in accordance with their abilities.\"\r\nWow! that single quote made me drop the score from a 7 to a 4. I was thinking aboutgiving it a 7 and giving it good reasons why. But after mashiro said this and with absolutely no protests from the other characters. I lost respect from him as a character and this series. I even lost respect for the manga author for writing something like that.. This could be a mis translation from the fansubbers so I don't know if its legit or not. I generally find nothing wrong with the main character doing commercial art, im fine with that. Its just the way he said it just reek of self-esteem issues. Why in the hell would I want to follow a story with a main lead not believing himself. In a way he is no different from another particular 30 something side character. Both just as equally pathetic. remember when that side character(Nakai I believe?) screamed \"Im comfortable being a assistant.\" Yea... same thing, and  yet he gets the most flak from everybody, while Mashiro gets ignored\\n\\n\r\nHe never changed since season 1/episode 1. He still have inferiority complexes about his work and his rivals. always doubting, always rewriting(which may do more harm then good.). And when we finally witness some growth from him he shoots himself in the foot with his insecurities. I'll tell you this much, If a manga author in the real world said something like the quote above. would you read his/her manga? If you would then I feel sorry for you.\\n\\n\r\nI did however enjoy the growth from the the other characters especially from Aoki and Muto Ashirogi's Editor(who I believe received the most out all the characters.) The show can have its funny moments. I thought the parts with Izuma and Hattori was funny. I liked the first season even though its completely over the top and unrealistic at times. Its just that after what Mashiro said and the nonchalant attitudes afterwards, You just get the feeling that you're just wasting your time. They are never going learn that racing towards rankings and popularity is a dead end. Even though they spent the WHOLE DAMN SEASON trying to write the manga they want. And when the fail they blame talent not their attitude and contradictions they keep making over and over again. I guess its sort of realistic, since there are alot of aspiring artist like this. But trying to make this into a shounen about manga is just going to cause more tragedies since its coming from a big time manga author.\\n\\n\r\nYou think that im going alittle to far from just one quote from a episode. But this quote is all you need if you want to watch/read this series or not. If dont mind this you will probably enjoy this. But Hattori was wrong, they are never going to surpass Nizuma.",

I absolutely loathed President Laura Roslin from Battlestar Galactica, but the show actually made something out of her even though she's a terrible human being. \r\nMiura however might be the worst character in Anime. He's the villain of the second season, but everyone acts like he's a perfectly nice guy. He's incredibly selfish, he's not in touch with his authors will or strengths at all and everything he touches turns toshit but he and everyone else just keeps saying that he should be trusted. He alone brings my score of this season down by like 2 points, which is quite a feat. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, now that I think about it, the characters in this season is a lot worse than in the first one. Azuki Miho and Kayo basically disappeared (not that I loved them before but they were alright). Nakai turned from somewhat pathetic but likeable, to absolutely wretched.

            "content": "And so, the daily lives and struggles of becoming the Number 1# Shounen Jack mangaka goes on...with harsher trials and tribulations for Ashirogi Muto!\r\nLA will say it here and now just to get this out of the way, Bakuman. 2nd Season had exceeded LA's expectations as well as raze LA's worries and problems that Bakuman had in it's first season and THEN SOME, it's amazing...and \"near masterpiece\" of anime about a duo trying to be the best in the mangaka industry.\r\nLA would at the very least start with their trials and tribulations that Ashirogi Muto goes through, from changing editors, tenser rivalry, getting sick, complacencyand honing their skills. Ashirogi Muto goes through A LOT of trials, but not just in the manga field, Mashiro and Takagi BOTH goes through some romantic high and lows as well. Let's begin with the first thing that occurs in this second season, mainly being Ashiorgi Muto changing editors from Hattori to Miura. This affects Ashirogi Muto in alot of ways, mainly for them to switch their preferred genre of making manga from their usual serious and tense manga to what Miura likes...as in gag manga. This however both works in their favour but also doesn't, it works in Ashirogi Muto's favour as it does provide the notion of that editors are right in some ways and allowing Ashirogi Muto to trust Miura in trying new fields of making broadening their range, however in doing so two things are not in Ashirogi Muto's favour, their competition with Eijii Niizuma is no longer a thing (due to the first season's rivalry as well as Ashirogi Muto's genre shift itself from serious to gag) and the second and most obvious one is that since Ashirogi Muto is stuck doing gag manga and them not really liking doing a genre their not used to but likes to hone anyways due to their editor as well as their serialization ranking wanting to be stable, it made them complacent in their work and their work not being Ashirogi Muto's typical great and interesting works. Now does LA blame the editor especially Miura, no...he had his reasonings as well...it was his job and he did build on Ashirogi Muto's repertoire of making different manga and Miura did try even with soo much resistance from Ashirogi Muto and even by then by the end of it all Ashiorgi Muto and Miura did evolve as characters by the end of it and what Miura did with Ashirogi Muto wasn't in vain at all.\\n\\n\r\n Now about getting sick, this happens ALOT with real life mangaka's as well so this is a true to life situation in anime that happens with Mashiro and really this incident really helped with one of the problems La had with the first season, for those who don't remember in LA's first season review, one of the biggest problems LA had with Mashiro and Azuki's long distance relationship and how they didn't interact as much thus LA didn't really see the appeal to their relationship, this incident as well as one more LA is gonna talk about really brought into light of their growing relationship to the point of FINALLY getting FULLY invested in their relationship. Really Mashiro and Azuki was just missing communicating with each other more as well as them opening up to each other more as well as encouraging them in their respective fields of mangaka and voice actress. The other incident involves Takagi and Miyoshi more however, with Takagi going off in his own and helping Yuriko Aoki with getting a new serialization going and this stirs up problems with Miyoshi thinking he's cheating on her with Iwase (don't ask) and then get Azuki and Mashiro into this and we get a huge misunderstanding which sole blame would go to Takagi all things considered and at the end of this debacle mending the argument between Azuki and Mashiro showing that at the worst of times they are strengthening their relationship even further by the end of it. Thankfully the Takagi incident becomes amended by something LA wasn't expecting them to do and they went with it and LA being a huge Takagi x Miyoshi pairing this was AMAZING for LA and heck even for an anime not entirely focused on a romance, it did the unthinkable and went through with it.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman has ALWAYS had a friendly rivalry with Ashirogi Muto but even their other rivalries outside of Eijii Niizuma had it's highs and lows, the highs being the aforementioned Yuriko Aoki defrosting her ice queen and showing that she has opened up from the first season as well as trying new avenues of manga like Ashirogi Muto did. Aoki also unintentionally causes Iwase from the first season to become a more prominent rival to Takagi specifically when she learns about Takagi doing manga and like the first season wanting to beat him and she becomes even more terrifying when she teams up with HATTORI AND EIJII NIIZUMA HOLY SHIT...that actually scared LA when this came up as a plot point effectively making Iwase an interesting yet unpredictable rival to Takagi and Ashirogi Muto as a whole. Fukuda being the supportive yet brash mangaka for this season was pretty much on supportive duty to the other mangaka's whether it be encouraging them or helping in other matters but especially with Nakai...ohh boy he's a different matter altogether. Nakai is the low in terms of rivalry with him entirely becoming complacent, self-narcissistic and going down the deep end especially with Aoki which LA believes HE is entirely to blame for his situation by the end of this season, he's divisive for sure but also he shot himself in the foot at the same time. Finally add in new friendly rivals like Hiramaru from the first season reduced down to a gag character and not wanting to even want to draw manga but gets conned into it by his scheming editor and Takahama once assistant mangaka to Ashirogi Muto but influenced by them to make manga and we have our roster of rivals, be it friendly or not. LA will say the obvious but with Bakuman's second season's character roster gotten bigger, they still did an amazing job in developing not only the core main cast and evolving them not only through being better mangaka's but also their romantic angle BUT also developing their growing minor cast into likable and memorable characters...LA just loves it about Bakuman!.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman's first season may have looked at how to get serialized into Shounen Ju- Jack but Bakuman. 2nd Season was more or less showing us in it's own way of how to get your serialization going and staying afloat with all the trials and tribulation one expect from mangaka's. Bakuman. 2nd Season tells us soo much about the manga industry and is more or less showing not only the minds of mangaka's and their constant brainstorming to think up new ideas for their mangas to keep going or make it interesting but also showing that editors are also the cogs in this too that makes the manga industry going. LA will say this since LA couldn't say it in the first season but.....Hattori is the best editor ever...Miura is......still great in his own way.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, once again typical great acting from the entire cast with LA liking the homage they did with Saori Hayami with SKET Dance and everything. For best voice actor, LA actually has several this time, Atsushi Abe and Satoshi Hino as Mashiro and Takagi of course but also Ayako Kawasumi as Aoki (seeing her more dere side of Aoki was great), Nobuhiko Okamoto for Eiji Niizuma because Eijii Niizuma seriously, Sayuri Yahagi and Saori Hayami as Miyoshi and Azuki respectively, Kentarou Tone as Hattori and Ayumi Fujiwara as Iwase. LA really saw no loose ends in terms of voice acting in Bakuman.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done once again by JC Staff was on point and pretty much unchanged from the first season though LA saw some pretty great \"in-universe manga details\" that were much crisper than usual making Ashirogi Muto's manga's shown itself to be honed and skilled by the end of the season than before in a much more effective way to the complete opposite when Ashirogi Muto were doing their gag manga. Character designs were eccentric and polished as ever with the backgrounding though not being a typical forefront, was still good nonetheless. The animation seemed to have no changes from it's first season but the devil is mostly in the manga and thus the animation was done well as expected.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt LA calls this second season of Bakuman a \"near masterpiece\" of anime, from dispelling LA's worries it had from it's first season, evolving nearly ALL it's characters minor or not as well as FINALLY growing the romance not only from Mashiro and Takagi but once again to it's minor cast members, actual terrifying rivals for Ashirogi Muto to be in equal or higher footing to compete with, allowing LA to not only root for these characters to be the best but LA saw these \"characters\" as ACTUAL people oddly enough (but that just goes to show how great the writing is for Bakuman!), having great tension and higher stakes that Bakuman pushed and pushed itself with unpredictable results coming from every corner of plot it had for LA to be invested all the way. Bakuman 2nd Season is a near masterpiece for LA.....but can it's third and FINAL season live up to and maybe even make Bakuman a perfect masterpiece of anime?\\n\\n\r\nLA cannot wait for what it's third and final season has in store for LA!",

            "content": "I first started the Bakuman series because it sounded interesting and because it was rated highly; I'm an on and off manga fan, so I didn't think that it would appeal to me, but I was wrong. This led me onto the second series, which I found to be pretty much just as good as the first.\r\nThe story is continued literally from the last minute of the first series, so there's no need to refresh your memory too much. A vast majority of the characters also appear again, with a few new characters that aren't too shabby, either.\r\nOkay, staring off with the story: The mainthing that I respect about this story is that it's realistic - it's not always predictable, the heroes will not always win, and when they do, it's after a lot of sleepless nights, constant working, and a strict refusal to give up no matter what. Takagi and Mashiro are very inspiring individuals, so it's not difficult to get sucked into the story and root for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another aspect of this series that I thoroughly enjoyed - the characters are all very distinct-looking (I'm sure a lot of you have seen series' where every character essentially has the same face with a different eye-colour...), and their facial expressions, bodies etc are pleasing to the eye. The humour comes across exceedingly well with the character design; there are several instances where characters display exaggerated reactions that will make you laugh out loud. It's pretty much the same as it was in the first series, so no quality is lost.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, the familiar soundtracks that would play behind some scenes made me feel comfortable. I'm not sure if it was because I like the anime so much, but the sound worked, and it fit really well with the general mood of the series. The opening and end themes didn't stand out to me, but I didn't dislike them either.\\n\\n\r\nThere were only a couple of characters that bored me, and I really didn't like one character, but at the same time, that character's role was essential to the duo's evolution as manga creators. Also, it's interesting to see how characters from the first series have grown up, it almost feels like you've known them personally forever; you can see the subtle differences between how they were in high school compared to when they age a few years.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really bring the show together.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the pair got bad news, I would exclaim, \"No!\" despairingly, and if they did really well, I'd smile and sometimes go, \"This anime...!!\" The series is amazing at drawing people in, even people like me who - as I mentioned - have no serious interest in manga. \\n\\n\r\nIt fired me up and I often couldn't wait to see the next episode, so I managed to finish it all in three days.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the second series, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "\"More of the same\" has never rung so true, and yet have been so fulfilling.\r\nThis season is very much alike the first season, both in content and quality. They are so alike that I think some people will complain that it's TOO alike. I am not one of those people.I loved the first season, and I loved the second season just as much. I marathoned it in two days and I never got sick of it. In fact, despite having a very satisfying conclusion, it left me wanting more.\r\nThe biggest minus is that it can at times be a bit childish and cheesy.

Now the story is a good story and I can see that is has gotta better since season 1 in the way that they added more to it and more characters but then again there was those embarrassing lovey dovey moments but since they also go with the main story plot it's ok. \r\nI give art a 8 because it isn't the best i have seen butI do like how in some part of the story when the characters get serious or excited the art will change.\\n\r\nI think the sound was good and even for the little laughing senses in the ending episodes were on point.\\n\r\nThe characters were very good my favorite new characters would have to be Kazuya Hiramaru and his editor. These two were very good since they both are pretty funny also Hiramaru is very lazy but jumps everywhere in the story so it's good to see  a new character move around in the story.\\n\r\nBut yes I really liked this anime and if you have seen the first season I would suggest you see this one.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note I liked how they finish this anime every season and leave it where you fell like its complete.\\n\r\nOn another side note I think it would be nice if they could also do the manga that they mention or that they were doing in the anime in real life because I feel myself wanting to see how some of these turnout but anyways hopefully this review wasn't too bad. \\n\\n\r\nhope you like this anime.\\n\\n\r\n     ^_^",

            "content": "Bakuman 2 has proven to be an excellent story demonstrating the Tsugumi/Takeshi pair capability to handle another genre of manga/anime. Someone who hasn't done there background look on the creators may not have even noticed it was the same team that brought us the masterpiece, Death Note. The art is very bright and while some mangaka's style can be evidently recognised in all of their work (eg. Mitsuru Adachi), this team's art in Bakuman is much different from the previously produced Death Note. \r\nThe story was adequately paced, not too fast or too slow and keeps the reader's interest. Sometimes, however, because it is notthe traditional type of shounen anime, there is this feeling like they wanted to still create the tension of a battle in the plot. The battle between mangkas. At times the line \"I am definitely not going to let you win\" felt like an overused line. I began to get fed up of hearing it. I was only concerned about the \"battle\" between the leading protagonist and their antagonist, but the story had all these \"side battles\" that just felt over bearing as everyone never wanted the other to win. \\n\\n\r\nSignificant character development can be seen in several of the main and supporting characters, which is always good. One particular value I appreciated that was resonated in season 2, was the conflict of wanting to share your own story as a mangaka but there was also the battle of producing what would sell, be popular and keep you serialised. As a designer I understand this struggle. I was disappointed at time as I felt that one of the supporting characters was insisting in the beginning that she would tell her story her way even if it meant loosing her contract but she seemed to change later on producing work that I did not expect her to. They claimed to want to \"change Jack\"...however I was not too sure if they indeed motivated change. What was the change that they wanted? However I continue to season 3 to see how the plot continues to unfold.",

The whole thing moved to high gear halfway through the second season and it was going up after that. TheRomance idea was extremely far fetched but was still great to watch as the lack of day to day interaction actually made it better and less clich\u00e9 imo\\n\r\n- Good comedy\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some stuff get a little repetitive\\n\r\n- It was kind of predictable, so there was no suspense factor for me.\\n\r\n- Although the show was trying to show how \"cutthroat\" the manga industry is. It was extremely lenient with the MC at some points which took away from the realism enjoyment and added to it's predictability I mentioned\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- A huge cast with many great characters that ranged from completely nuts to simple and lovable\\n\r\n- Kaya Miyoshi (Best Girl) :D\\n\r\n- Kouji Yoshida (Simply loved his scenes) :D\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Barely noticeable character main characters growth. The anime (in it's 3 seasons) supposedly spanned 10 years but even to it's last episodes i still felt like i was watching a high school drama\\n\r\n- Everyone is so fuckin understanding o_O I mean what thae actual fuck. I realize that this a Shounen anime but things need to have a limit\\n\r\n- Related to the point above, the show also lacked real assholes. one can have too much \"Friendly rivalry\" to last a lifetime in this show\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- For an anime about Manga it offer some really great and different types of art\\n\r\n- Environments and character design was good\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- It had some issues with size a depth perception\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Catchy and upbeat OPs and EDs\\n\r\n- Good voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- The soundtrack (during the actual anime) was repetitive. I believe it was the same during all three seasons\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (7/10):\\n\r\nIt was a good and entertaining show with a good amount of drama and comedy and sweet (Although super imaginary) romance but it was \"Too Shounen\" if this was an actual term\\n\r\nif that aspect was toned down a bit i would have enjoyed a lot more\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.4/10)",

Things seem more possible and its amazing how they try and sometimes succeed and sometimes don't. The 2nd season brings more of the good stuff that the first season set up. I will admit I was bored at some parts but thereare other parts that easily make up for it. New characters, new challenges, and new adventures await. Whats next for the amazing manga duo?

Maybe I'm just biased, but to me it deserves it.\r\nIf you enjoyed Bakuman Season 1 then you MUST See Bakuman Season 2, anyone who enjoyed Bakuman Season 1 as much as I should agree with my rating of 10 for season 2.\r\nSome anime's are good, and their second seasons are just a drag, but with Bakuman, season 1 was great and season 2 is even better! The story continues from season 1, even after season 1 I wanted to see what happened next and I still feel the same now in season 2 at episode 6.\r\nStory: 10\r\nUnlikemany anime's Bakuman is realistic. It shows many hardships throughout the story that the characters go through, just when things get better a new tragedy occurs. It really says something about real life, the realistic plot is one of Bakuman's greatest traits and it helps as get into the story even more when we feel the hardships as the characters feel them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters in Bakuman are very well developed, we understand them enough to feel what they feel on screen. I find when things start going well for a particular character I'm smiling, and when things start going bad I get concerned and can't even stop watching to go to the bathroom because I want to see things get resolved!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWell the art is a little different from other anime's but by no means does that make it bad, but rather good. I especially like the art within the art-that is the art that the Mashiro (the protagonist) draws.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound is great, it really helps bring the audience into the story and characters though I don't notice as much as I notice other things in the anime, I'm sure that is because of my inartistic brain, I do however know that the sound is what controls the moods of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoy this anime a lot and I believe you will too, as long as your not a violence loving maniac. I would give it a try, and if your not hooked by the first episode I'll be quite surprised.\\n",

            "content": "They say you can measure how good a anime is by how fast time seems to fly by when watching it, if that's the case, Bakuman 2 is one amazing series.\r\nThe first season of Bakuman was great, the story, the characters, the atmosphere fitted perfectly, though It did suffer from pacing problems and could of been adapted better. This time however, J.C Staff has stepped up their game, managing to fix those problems and make Bakuman 2 one hell of a enjoyable anime and probably the best slice-of-life series I've seen yet.\r\n= Story [9] =\r\nBakuman starts exactly where it left off from the first seasonand gets right into the story. I won't say much to avoid spoiling it for people who happen to see this review before watching the first season but this season has a lot more drama and romance, which make for some very intense scenes and memorable moments.\\n\\n\r\nSomething, that is unique to the story of Bakuman is how realistic it is. The two main characters aren't always successful and positive like you find in most shonen series and there isn't any shock twists which would be impossible to find in a real life situation, well maybe one.\\n\\n\r\n= Art [9] =\\n\r\nI never get tired of the art in this series, It's amazing how J.C Staff can make  the manga illustrations look so realistic and the amount of detail and effort they put into the backgrounds.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are nothing special but they don't really need to be, If anything, the only character design I can fault is Shuujin's/Takagi's, It's just that he looked a lot different and a lot better in the manga, though I don't really mind the change.\\n\\n\r\n= Sound [8] =\\n\r\nI have to admit, I didn't like any of the first seasons OP and ED's that much, though Bakuman 2 has some great ones which really suit the story-lines in this season. The OST remains nearly entirely the same in this season, which is a good thing since it doesn't feel overused yet and suits the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the VA's do a great job reprising their roles and the newcomers fit their parts perfectly in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n= Character [8] =\\n\r\nThere's a lot more Character development this time around, which is welcomed especially for the minor characters such as Aoki and Nakai, who really annoyed me at first, but then actually became likeable. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance side of Bakuman shines through a lot more this time around, which also helped character development a lot, though some of the relationships became a bit boring and repetitive during the the second half of the story. \\n\\n\r\n=Enjoyment [9]=\\n\r\nBakuman 2 is one addicting ride, the story and the characters really draw you in and makes you want to finish the whole series in one go, which not just any anime can emulate.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of first season, you'll love this sequel, all the spirit and fun of the manga and prequel are maintained in Bakuman's second anime outing, which leaves us eagerly awaiting the third season. \\n\\n\r\n=Overall [9]=\\n\r\nOverall, Bakuman 2 outdoes it's predecessor in every aspect, with faster pacing, a more 'tighter' and entertaining story, great character development with art and sound to top it off. If it wasn't for a slow down during the the latter episodes with the story and characters, I would've considered Bakuman 2 a masterpiece.",

After watching the second episode I had so much I wanted to tell everyone it had to be done through a review.\r\nI'll skip right to the interesting part, this series has totally sucked me in. The first season was all fantastic and really something else the whole way. Luckily, this isn't something that's about to change. It's actually on the contrary, these two episodes have made their way and are actually starting to already top their predecessor.\r\nAlthough I can't judge the whole book by it's cover (it'sonly like 40 minutes of something to watch right now) but these minutes have made an huge impact on me. Both times I've been having a stomach-ache because I've actually started worrying about the characters so much, felt their joy and just enjoyed following their story. All have been done in such a wonderful compound I can't really describe it, and yet I try.\\n\\n\r\nMy only worry at the moment is that my expectations are rising through the roof and beyond which may damage the rest of the series. Most certainly I'll be able to keep my cool and enjoy the rest of it which hopefully  goes by the high standard that these two episodes have put up.",

            "content": "Bakuman is both entertaining and educational. It shows that it's not so simple to write or draw something that people will appreciate. If you want to make something truly good, you might have to revise and redo it several times as they do in this series. I like that Bakuman shows how difficult it is; it makes it more realistic. It's still entertaining at an anime level, though, since the characters passionately aim for the top. \r\n* * * S T O R Y * * * \r\nIt's rather original and is likely to draw in anyone with an interest in anime/manga. It has somepretty good drama and whatever in it. \\n\\n\r\n* * * A R T * * * \\n\r\nI'd say the \"typical anime faces\" (such as oAo) they sometimes have kinda lowers the quality of this series. I like that they have some more original types of gag faces, though. The art and animation looks quite nice overall. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the parts where they showed storyboards/\"names\" were poorly drawn and dull to look at. I think they should've at least had more panels/actions shown so we could see the story, not just hear a narration. Manga is all about the visuals, after all. There were some good moments with the more elaborate manuscripts, though. \\n\\n\r\n* * * S O U N D * * * \\n\r\nI think Mashiro sounds a little too wimpy. The music didn't stand out to me whatsoever. Their relaxed, \"everyday\" country-ish music is just pretty boring. They live in a city, so why the country bumpkin music? There's other music more appropriately fitting the anime, but none of it is memorable. \\n\\n\r\n* * * C H A R A C T E R S * * * \\n\r\nYes, yes, people hate Miura. I think Miura was another good display of what the world of manga can be like. He also developed into a decent editor after realizing his flaws. As an obstacle, he created more entertaining points in the series and made the end result all the more satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nMashiro and Takagi are always developing and learning to see manga from different perspectives. They change in other ways, too, making unexpected decisions as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters develop, other characters stay the same. That's the way life is, including when it comes to a manga artist's aspirations (or lack of). \\n\\n\r\n* * * E N J O Y M E N T * * *\\n\r\nCompared to the Bakuman manga, they cut out a lot of the more technical aspects of planning and writing manga. They kept the \"Tanto arc\" short and sweet, really. It also feels like they balanced things out so that Azuki would seem like she has more involvement in the series. I know people complained about how small her role was in the manga, so I think this is a good change. It was pretty easy to neglect and forget about her in the manga, but I think it's important to maintain this romantic aspect based on true love. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like is how they made it sound like panty shots are not only normal, but necessary in the world of manga. Honestly, things like that cause people to label all manga as bad. I think panty shots should've been treated as a cheap way to get votes from perverts, not something a female manga artist should strive to achieve. It's sad to think people would be unable to appreciate a good story unless it had softcore porn in every chapter. \\n\\n\r\n* * * O V E R A L L * * *\\n\r\nGood story, nothing really disappointing (other than the panty thing), satisfying ending. I didn't find this too addicting, but maybe that's just because I read the manga already. This is some quality anime.",

            "content": "First of all let me begin by saying this Anime is written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata who made Death Note and unlike some of the other works that have been produced since this anime has the special sauce too. MAYONNAIISEEE.\r\nTrying to find L?\r\nSorry you'll have to look somewhere else.\r\nThis is the sequel of the first Bakuman which continues the story of Takagi Akito and Mashiro Moritaka; two teenagers who aspire to be mangakas with a popular long running manga serialization that gets turned into an anime. Mashiro in particular wants their career to take off quickly because of a promise hemade with Azuki Miho, the girl he'd been in love with since elementary school, that the two of them would marry once they accomplished their dreams as they try to make a name for themselves in the intense business world of manga publishing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise with J.C. Staff at the helm of the much-anticipated anime adaptation, you\u2019d expect some pretty damn good animation. Luckily, the studio delivers fluid movement and great attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was once again really well done and high quality like its predecessor. The art was quite good throughout each episode. The anime\u2019s art shows a great amount of detail yet still maintaining that slice of life environment in the anime. Something which intrigued me the most, in terms of the art, was the displaying of the stories each manga artist made. By animating the storyline and having a narrator explaining the information in the manga, improved the anime. The character themselves were well illustrated and fluidly animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very good for the characters. I felt that the character's representations through their vocal expressions suited them perfectly and portrayed their attitudes and personalities nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's also the OPs and EDs. They're not terrible, but they are definitely boring and I skipped them nearly every time. Granted, it's not a big thing and has nothing to do with the actual story, but for a series that's all about creating stuff the public will like, they sure dropped the ball in this aspect.  Overall I didn't find anything too annoying throughout the anime series regarding the soundtrack. It was well presented.\\n\\n\r\nIt was nice to see the variety of characters, with their assortment of personalities. They definitely added depth to this anime. \\n\r\nAs with the story, this season of Bakuman only touches on its cast of characters and what we learn of them is only the tip of the metaphorical iceberg. That being said, the two central protagonists develop reasonably as they embark on their quest to become published mangaka. \\n\\n\r\nWhether it is Takigi's boldness,  Moritaka's determination. the surprising feminess of tomboy Miyoshi, The eccentricness of ingenious mangaka Eiji Nizuma, and some others. almost all characters were well written and had great chemistry with each other. The two main characters go through development as their bonds and determination are tested.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone with an interest in the behind-the-scenes workings of a large manga publication, and particularly when it comes to the shounen genre, I can\u2019t recommend Bakuman enough. \\n\\n\r\nBakuman season two delivered the same type of feelings and emotions that the first season did. Following Saiko and Shujin through their life as they pursue one of my dreams has been wonderful.",

To me, that makes it special, but other people might think the real value is elsewhere.\r\nStory (10/10):\r\nWhat makes the story one of the few 10's out there is that it combines romance, comedy, a tale of growing up, and mixes it with what may be the greatest motivational shounen I have come to know. If i had to find one flaw, it would be that I could never amount to Ashirogi's (the main mangaka duo) drive to succeed.\r\nArt (7/10):\r\nThe art's nothing special, except for themanga shown in the anime. It looked like it was drawn professionally and makes you want to read the fake series, even if you can't. One thing that always bothered me about Bakuman though, was random moments where the characters' faces would get a new design just to express an quick emotion with a comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nI can replay the openings and endings just to remember this anime masterpiece, which is a plus.  The ost though never really stood out, only puts in noise where it could have been awkwardly silent otherwise. This is only in Japanese, but they get so into the roles that you forget there are people speaking into a mic. It adds a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nWhy another 10? Bakuman 2 does the most out of the 3 series to bring out the purpose of each character. After one series, you can really start to bond.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) & Overall (9/10):\\n\r\nI loved it so much, that I started collecting the manga just to relive the story.

            "content": "Note that there most likely will be spoilers to the series Bakuman and Bakuman 2 ahead. There will not be spoilers to other series besides this (I wont do what I did on my BS Pirates [see what I did there?] review is what I'm trying to get at).\r\nNow I have heard from countless people who haven't watched this series that the only reason they won't watch it is because all it is is about writing manga and that there is no way something a brief description of the general premise they read once could possibly leave out details. By the way they will alsotell you that LOST is only about a bunch of people living on an island for 6 whole seasons without anything interesting happening. It's people like this who deserved to be slapped across the face (with the actual Bakuman manga for added irony), forced to sit down and watch this show as it is nothing like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues from the exact moment Bakuman left off where their awesome manager Hattori was switched around with Miua; a short, chubby man who thinks simply getting the job is all you need so they shouldn't have their sights aimed any higher afterwards. Because no one filled this guy in on the entire reason Mashiro decided to start writing manga this series starts to take a bad turn as his lack of skill leads them back to the drawing board. Eventually this turns around for them and he finally starts to learn a thing or two about inspiring people and they get back on track. Fortunately for them Hattori gets off his prideful ass and helps them like a pal which gets them to the top yet again.\\n\\n\r\nNow aside from the new pathetic manager of theirs (I really hate him) there are lots of other things interesting about the series. One of them being the character Hiramaru. Now we got a glimpse of his at the end of the first season as someone who randomly picked up a manga and thought it was a simple thing to do and proves his point. He came off as a really serious character who would prove yet another hurtle for our duo to leap. In this season, however, he is one of the biggest dumbasses who ever lived. He is a lazy bastard who thought that manga would take no effort at all and all he would have to do in life is eat and sleep because work is such a drag. This ultimately backfired on him as his manga was so good he got instantly serialized and now has to work on the weekends too. He is, however, absolutely hilarious and shows that this series can continue to make new and interesting characters who don't share the same personality as everyone else. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also the ever-increasing bond between Mashiro and his love to be. A particular scene that occurred when Mashiro wound up in the hospital because he forgot humans need to sleep every so often if they want to live was one of the most touching scenes I've seen in an anime (in the romance regard, and believable ones don't come very often for me I assure you) in a long while. Character development is one thing but the ability to make two characters develop together when they almost rarely see each other is a talent in itself. This was also written by the guy/gal who wrote Death Note, or so I have heard, so amazement is to be expected. \\n\\n\r\nNow there was one thing about this season I didn't like and it's the fact that by the end of it they're right back where they started only this time with the chief editor threatening to fire them if they don't continue to be better than the kid who yells at birds and turns paper into top-selling manga at the rate that Jesus turns water into wine. The difference is that I don't like wine, but I do like manga so if Jesus is having problems competing with the guy you know your in for a hard time. \\n\\n\r\nI also didn't like how it seemed the only real reason fatass was made their manager was so the story didn't progress too far and they can get other things done like marriage and almost dying before the whole point of the show concludes. \\n\\n\r\nNow another thing I find that I enjoy is the shows tendency to make fun of fat people. First there is the manager who fucks up t=everything they've accomplished and doesn't go to hell for it until after he makes up for it by becoming semi-decent at doing his job. Oh and the reason I said hell is because I would think being taken from two nice kids who inspired you to do more with your career and being put into a group consisting of a child who forgot to take his Ritalin and a complete bitch whose first words to you was a threat to sue, a group I might add that was founded by your replacement, is a pretty shitty way to go. The other fatass whose name eludes me did a complete opposite of our previous fatty by going from a guy we were able to respect to a complete and total douchebag . He claims to love Aoki more than anyone else yet when she comes and asks him for help he tries to force her into a relationship which leads to him leaving the show out of guilt. Personally I'd like to roll them down a hill and see who can climb up to get the victory bucket of fried chicken first.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I'd like to bitch about isn't the shows fault at all and it was an issue that had me left with teary-eyes several weeks in a row and that would be the fucking subs. Why the fuck does it take you 5 days to sub a god damn anime which can usually be done by subbers in an hour or two. I did my research and it turns out you bastards subbed everything elce on time so why this? Please don't sub Bakuman 3 and leave it to someone else unless you can learn to pick up the pace or give us an excuse as leaving us in the dark doesn't get you anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this show is an amazing show that deserves all the respect it has from fans. I give this show a 9 out of ten. I don't like giving hardcore calculations as numbers don't justify the value of ark, and THIS IS ART. Now someone edit the last moment of the series for me to have Mashiro's uncle's ghost standing next to ghost obi-wan and ghost yoda while that ewok victory music plays because tht would be badass!",

            "content": "Might as well mention this, I don't usually write reviews and this IS my first one on mal. As well as I absolutely LOVE the first season and yet absolutely HATE Miura for ruining the second.\r\nThe first season had made me a complete fan of not just Bakuman, but more of Ashirogi Muto. As a normal fan, meaning seeing the chars as not part of an anime but as real life humans, I felt joy and excitement as well as suspense, nervousnous, and disappointment along with the flow of the story.\r\nThe second season, simply put... it's Miura style. I bore with it until the 12episode, but I hate Miura. The second season is just like him. They make you angry, they keep you smiling dumbly, but does not surpass an above average hatable anime level. In other words, nothing TOO bad about it, but a big disappointment compared to the first season. I cannot feel the emotions alongside the characters anymore. But still, leaving all that aside and ignoring detestable Miura... leaving the fans personal opinions aside, it's a good anime. But that is LEAVING all that aside.\\n\\n\r\nArt I liked it overall. I don't usually like those puffed up lips and that hairstyle as well as I always hate FATNESS! But, somehow I bore with it. Of course, I didn't like those parts but, the rest made up. HOWEVER! Nothing compared to the previous season again. I mean, the art looks pretty much the same, but still the first season I could ignore all ugly guys cause they were not hated. They can be usefull, they know manners, they know how to keep themselves together without pulling hind legs. But... the second season I could bear with it but I can not ignore it. Unlike the first which I only noticed near the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound... well, it's find isn't it? Honestly I don't know. It sounds fine... but sound is the one thing I know nothing about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, well... I prefer the previous season again. Reason of course a large part is alot of hated characters are put in the second season, but that's just 90%. I don't like the fact that Saiko gives in so easily. Even though first ep in season one was VERY embarrassing, however the rest of the story made up or rather overpassed it. And besides... I didn't hate any char in that season = =\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Yea, it goes to the bottom. I mean, I hate it. But other then I hate it I found it enjoying too. It's not that it sucks but just that I detest it. Simply put, I enjoyed it when I hate it so I dropped it reluctantly and most likely picking it up reluctantly again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... well I thought of an 8 but considering how I hate it? A 7 was the most I can go for. However it def deserves a 7, and prob an 8 for those who don't take anime seriously. But comparing as always, it's not worth an 8 if you think how great the first season is.\\n\\n\r\nThose who want to know more despite anything else after watching the first, yea go ahead and watch this too.\\n\\n\r\nThose who want to leave a beautiful and perfect image and can bear with knowing there's a second season? Quit it, you'll find out soon the difference and get disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThose who want a beautiful image but can't help but want to know more... just like me, I'll wait for third season. Who knows? They might fire off Miura and get someone proper again. Ah and that fatty two timer too. I don't hate him but I absolutely don't like him.",

            "content": "Quote from Mashiro, slight spoiler from episode 25 but for a good reason.\r\n\"Parents use to say \"Manga will make you stupid.\" But manga gradually came to be recognized as having cultural value\r\nThat's why I think you should draw a manga with content and quality that you wouldn't be ashamed to say has cultural value\r\nBut since we don't have the ability to do that we have to draw it with popularity in mind.\r\nI think it's okay for anyone to draw manga like that in accordance with their abilities.\"\r\nWow! that single quote made me drop the score from a 7 to a 4. I was thinking aboutgiving it a 7 and giving it good reasons why. But after mashiro said this and with absolutely no protests from the other characters. I lost respect from him as a character and this series. I even lost respect for the manga author for writing something like that.. This could be a mis translation from the fansubbers so I don't know if its legit or not. I generally find nothing wrong with the main character doing commercial art, im fine with that. Its just the way he said it just reek of self-esteem issues. Why in the hell would I want to follow a story with a main lead not believing himself. In a way he is no different from another particular 30 something side character. Both just as equally pathetic. remember when that side character(Nakai I believe?) screamed \"Im comfortable being a assistant.\" Yea... same thing, and  yet he gets the most flak from everybody, while Mashiro gets ignored\\n\\n\r\nHe never changed since season 1/episode 1. He still have inferiority complexes about his work and his rivals. always doubting, always rewriting(which may do more harm then good.). And when we finally witness some growth from him he shoots himself in the foot with his insecurities. I'll tell you this much, If a manga author in the real world said something like the quote above. would you read his/her manga? If you would then I feel sorry for you.\\n\\n\r\nI did however enjoy the growth from the the other characters especially from Aoki and Muto Ashirogi's Editor(who I believe received the most out all the characters.) The show can have its funny moments. I thought the parts with Izuma and Hattori was funny. I liked the first season even though its completely over the top and unrealistic at times. Its just that after what Mashiro said and the nonchalant attitudes afterwards, You just get the feeling that you're just wasting your time. They are never going learn that racing towards rankings and popularity is a dead end. Even though they spent the WHOLE DAMN SEASON trying to write the manga they want. And when the fail they blame talent not their attitude and contradictions they keep making over and over again. I guess its sort of realistic, since there are alot of aspiring artist like this. But trying to make this into a shounen about manga is just going to cause more tragedies since its coming from a big time manga author.\\n\\n\r\nYou think that im going alittle to far from just one quote from a episode. But this quote is all you need if you want to watch/read this series or not. If dont mind this you will probably enjoy this. But Hattori was wrong, they are never going to surpass Nizuma.",

I absolutely loathed President Laura Roslin from Battlestar Galactica, but the show actually made something out of her even though she's a terrible human being. \r\nMiura however might be the worst character in Anime. He's the villain of the second season, but everyone acts like he's a perfectly nice guy. He's incredibly selfish, he's not in touch with his authors will or strengths at all and everything he touches turns toshit but he and everyone else just keeps saying that he should be trusted. He alone brings my score of this season down by like 2 points, which is quite a feat. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, now that I think about it, the characters in this season is a lot worse than in the first one. Azuki Miho and Kayo basically disappeared (not that I loved them before but they were alright). Nakai turned from somewhat pathetic but likeable, to absolutely wretched. Hattori is only there a few times and when he is he absolutely brightens the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art continues to be great and the soundtrack is pumping at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is so-so because of the forementioned character.",

            "content": "And so, the daily lives and struggles of becoming the Number 1# Shounen Jack mangaka goes on...with harsher trials and tribulations for Ashirogi Muto!\r\nLA will say it here and now just to get this out of the way, Bakuman. 2nd Season had exceeded LA's expectations as well as raze LA's worries and problems that Bakuman had in it's first season and THEN SOME, it's amazing...and \"near masterpiece\" of anime about a duo trying to be the best in the mangaka industry.\r\nLA would at the very least start with their trials and tribulations that Ashirogi Muto goes through, from changing editors, tenser rivalry, getting sick, complacencyand honing their skills. Ashirogi Muto goes through A LOT of trials, but not just in the manga field, Mashiro and Takagi BOTH goes through some romantic high and lows as well. Let's begin with the first thing that occurs in this second season, mainly being Ashiorgi Muto changing editors from Hattori to Miura. This affects Ashirogi Muto in alot of ways, mainly for them to switch their preferred genre of making manga from their usual serious and tense manga to what Miura likes...as in gag manga. This however both works in their favour but also doesn't, it works in Ashirogi Muto's favour as it does provide the notion of that editors are right in some ways and allowing Ashirogi Muto to trust Miura in trying new fields of making broadening their range, however in doing so two things are not in Ashirogi Muto's favour, their competition with Eijii Niizuma is no longer a thing (due to the first season's rivalry as well as Ashirogi Muto's genre shift itself from serious to gag) and the second and most obvious one is that since Ashirogi Muto is stuck doing gag manga and them not really liking doing a genre their not used to but likes to hone anyways due to their editor as well as their serialization ranking wanting to be stable, it made them complacent in their work and their work not being Ashirogi Muto's typical great and interesting works. Now does LA blame the editor especially Miura, no...he had his reasonings as well...it was his job and he did build on Ashirogi Muto's repertoire of making different manga and Miura did try even with soo much resistance from Ashirogi Muto and even by then by the end of it all Ashiorgi Muto and Miura did evolve as characters by the end of it and what Miura did with Ashirogi Muto wasn't in vain at all.\\n\\n\r\n Now about getting sick, this happens ALOT with real life mangaka's as well so this is a true to life situation in anime that happens with Mashiro and really this incident really helped with one of the problems La had with the first season, for those who don't remember in LA's first season review, one of the biggest problems LA had with Mashiro and Azuki's long distance relationship and how they didn't interact as much thus LA didn't really see the appeal to their relationship, this incident as well as one more LA is gonna talk about really brought into light of their growing relationship to the point of FINALLY getting FULLY invested in their relationship. Really Mashiro and Azuki was just missing communicating with each other more as well as them opening up to each other more as well as encouraging them in their respective fields of mangaka and voice actress. The other incident involves Takagi and Miyoshi more however, with Takagi going off in his own and helping Yuriko Aoki with getting a new serialization going and this stirs up problems with Miyoshi thinking he's cheating on her with Iwase (don't ask) and then get Azuki and Mashiro into this and we get a huge misunderstanding which sole blame would go to Takagi all things considered and at the end of this debacle mending the argument between Azuki and Mashiro showing that at the worst of times they are strengthening their relationship even further by the end of it. Thankfully the Takagi incident becomes amended by something LA wasn't expecting them to do and they went with it and LA being a huge Takagi x Miyoshi pairing this was AMAZING for LA and heck even for an anime not entirely focused on a romance, it did the unthinkable and went through with it.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman has ALWAYS had a friendly rivalry with Ashirogi Muto but even their other rivalries outside of Eijii Niizuma had it's highs and lows, the highs being the aforementioned Yuriko Aoki defrosting her ice queen and showing that she has opened up from the first season as well as trying new avenues of manga like Ashirogi Muto did. Aoki also unintentionally causes Iwase from the first season to become a more prominent rival to Takagi specifically when she learns about Takagi doing manga and like the first season wanting to beat him and she becomes even more terrifying when she teams up with HATTORI AND EIJII NIIZUMA HOLY SHIT...that actually scared LA when this came up as a plot point effectively making Iwase an interesting yet unpredictable rival to Takagi and Ashirogi Muto as a whole. Fukuda being the supportive yet brash mangaka for this season was pretty much on supportive duty to the other mangaka's whether it be encouraging them or helping in other matters but especially with Nakai...ohh boy he's a different matter altogether. Nakai is the low in terms of rivalry with him entirely becoming complacent, self-narcissistic and going down the deep end especially with Aoki which LA believes HE is entirely to blame for his situation by the end of this season, he's divisive for sure but also he shot himself in the foot at the same time. Finally add in new friendly rivals like Hiramaru from the first season reduced down to a gag character and not wanting to even want to draw manga but gets conned into it by his scheming editor and Takahama once assistant mangaka to Ashirogi Muto but influenced by them to make manga and we have our roster of rivals, be it friendly or not. LA will say the obvious but with Bakuman's second season's character roster gotten bigger, they still did an amazing job in developing not only the core main cast and evolving them not only through being better mangaka's but also their romantic angle BUT also developing their growing minor cast into likable and memorable characters...LA just loves it about Bakuman!.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman's first season may have looked at how to get serialized into Shounen Ju- Jack but Bakuman. 2nd Season was more or less showing us in it's own way of how to get your serialization going and staying afloat with all the trials and tribulation one expect from mangaka's. Bakuman. 2nd Season tells us soo much about the manga industry and is more or less showing not only the minds of mangaka's and their constant brainstorming to think up new ideas for their mangas to keep going or make it interesting but also showing that editors are also the cogs in this too that makes the manga industry going. LA will say this since LA couldn't say it in the first season but.....Hattori is the best editor ever...Miura is......still great in his own way.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, once again typical great acting from the entire cast with LA liking the homage they did with Saori Hayami with SKET Dance and everything. For best voice actor, LA actually has several this time, Atsushi Abe and Satoshi Hino as Mashiro and Takagi of course but also Ayako Kawasumi as Aoki (seeing her more dere side of Aoki was great), Nobuhiko Okamoto for Eiji Niizuma because Eijii Niizuma seriously, Sayuri Yahagi and Saori Hayami as Miyoshi and Azuki respectively, Kentarou Tone as Hattori and Ayumi Fujiwara as Iwase. LA really saw no loose ends in terms of voice acting in Bakuman.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done once again by JC Staff was on point and pretty much unchanged from the first season though LA saw some pretty great \"in-universe manga details\" that were much crisper than usual making Ashirogi Muto's manga's shown itself to be honed and skilled by the end of the season than before in a much more effective way to the complete opposite when Ashirogi Muto were doing their gag manga. Character designs were eccentric and polished as ever with the backgrounding though not being a typical forefront, was still good nonetheless. The animation seemed to have no changes from it's first season but the devil is mostly in the manga and thus the animation was done well as expected.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt LA calls this second season of Bakuman a \"near masterpiece\" of anime, from dispelling LA's worries it had from it's first season, evolving nearly ALL it's characters minor or not as well as FINALLY growing the romance not only from Mashiro and Takagi but once again to it's minor cast members, actual terrifying rivals for Ashirogi Muto to be in equal or higher footing to compete with, allowing LA to not only root for these characters to be the best but LA saw these \"characters\" as ACTUAL people oddly enough (but that just goes to show how great the writing is for Bakuman!), having great tension and higher stakes that Bakuman pushed and pushed itself with unpredictable results coming from every corner of plot it had for LA to be invested all the way. Bakuman 2nd Season is a near masterpiece for LA.....but can it's third and FINAL season live up to and maybe even make Bakuman a perfect masterpiece of anime?\\n\\n\r\nLA cannot wait for what it's third and final season has in store for LA!",

            "content": "I first started the Bakuman series because it sounded interesting and because it was rated highly; I'm an on and off manga fan, so I didn't think that it would appeal to me, but I was wrong. This led me onto the second series, which I found to be pretty much just as good as the first.\r\nThe story is continued literally from the last minute of the first series, so there's no need to refresh your memory too much. A vast majority of the characters also appear again, with a few new characters that aren't too shabby, either.\r\nOkay, staring off with the story: The mainthing that I respect about this story is that it's realistic - it's not always predictable, the heroes will not always win, and when they do, it's after a lot of sleepless nights, constant working, and a strict refusal to give up no matter what. Takagi and Mashiro are very inspiring individuals, so it's not difficult to get sucked into the story and root for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another aspect of this series that I thoroughly enjoyed - the characters are all very distinct-looking (I'm sure a lot of you have seen series' where every character essentially has the same face with a different eye-colour...), and their facial expressions, bodies etc are pleasing to the eye. The humour comes across exceedingly well with the character design; there are several instances where characters display exaggerated reactions that will make you laugh out loud. It's pretty much the same as it was in the first series, so no quality is lost.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, the familiar soundtracks that would play behind some scenes made me feel comfortable. I'm not sure if it was because I like the anime so much, but the sound worked, and it fit really well with the general mood of the series. The opening and end themes didn't stand out to me, but I didn't dislike them either.\\n\\n\r\nThere were only a couple of characters that bored me, and I really didn't like one character, but at the same time, that character's role was essential to the duo's evolution as manga creators. Also, it's interesting to see how characters from the first series have grown up, it almost feels like you've known them personally forever; you can see the subtle differences between how they were in high school compared to when they age a few years.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really bring the show together.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the pair got bad news, I would exclaim, \"No!\" despairingly, and if they did really well, I'd smile and sometimes go, \"This anime...!!\" The series is amazing at drawing people in, even people like me who - as I mentioned - have no serious interest in manga. \\n\\n\r\nIt fired me up and I often couldn't wait to see the next episode, so I managed to finish it all in three days.\\n\\n\r\nWatch the second series, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "\"More of the same\" has never rung so true, and yet have been so fulfilling.\r\nThis season is very much alike the first season, both in content and quality. They are so alike that I think some people will complain that it's TOO alike. I am not one of those people.I loved the first season, and I loved the second season just as much. I marathoned it in two days and I never got sick of it. In fact, despite having a very satisfying conclusion, it left me wanting more.\r\nThe biggest minus is that it can at times be a bit childish and cheesy. Mainly howsome \"inspirational\" speeches are handled. It's because of those sort of scenes and sequences that make me unable to recommend this to anyone who isn't already an anime fan.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFull review here:\\n\r\nhttp://kenikkiscorner.blogspot.se/2012/10/bakuman-2.html",

Yaass! it truly deserves a 10/10 because it was perfect! I can honestly say I enjoyed every episode. You can ask my sister how much I laughed (and chocked T_T) but seriously! I can't believe a single person disagreeing with me. \r\nThroughout the wholestory, the goal is the same. If you watched the first season you'll know what I mean. It made me even want to watch/read the manga they created e.e \\n\\n\r\nThat's all. Shortest review ever! .-. it's so good. Its got that perfect balance I always enjoy in anime. Comedy, romance, seriousness, suspense, etc. It doesn't get you like \"ughhh tired of the same thing over and over\". I gotta admit it, I hated how they kept bringing up the surprises out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nLooking forward with HIGH expectations for season 3~\\n\\n\r\n>:) It just leaves you wanting more...",

Now the story is a good story and I can see that is has gotta better since season 1 in the way that they added more to it and more characters but then again there was those embarrassing lovey dovey moments but since they also go with the main story plot it's ok. \r\nI give art a 8 because it isn't the best i have seen butI do like how in some part of the story when the characters get serious or excited the art will change.\\n\r\nI think the sound was good and even for the little laughing senses in the ending episodes were on point.\\n\r\nThe characters were very good my favorite new characters would have to be Kazuya Hiramaru and his editor. These two were very good since they both are pretty funny also Hiramaru is very lazy but jumps everywhere in the story so it's good to see  a new character move around in the story.\\n\r\nBut yes I really liked this anime and if you have seen the first season I would suggest you see this one.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note I liked how they finish this anime every season and leave it where you fell like its complete.\\n\r\nOn another side note I think it would be nice if they could also do the manga that they mention or that they were doing in the anime in real life because I feel myself wanting to see how some of these turnout but anyways hopefully this review wasn't too bad. \\n\\n\r\nhope you like this anime.\\n\\n\r\n     ^_^",

            "content": "Bakuman 2 has proven to be an excellent story demonstrating the Tsugumi/Takeshi pair capability to handle another genre of manga/anime. Someone who hasn't done there background look on the creators may not have even noticed it was the same team that brought us the masterpiece, Death Note. The art is very bright and while some mangaka's style can be evidently recognised in all of their work (eg. Mitsuru Adachi), this team's art in Bakuman is much different from the previously produced Death Note. \r\nThe story was adequately paced, not too fast or too slow and keeps the reader's interest. Sometimes, however, because it is notthe traditional type of shounen anime, there is this feeling like they wanted to still create the tension of a battle in the plot. The battle between mangkas. At times the line \"I am definitely not going to let you win\" felt like an overused line. I began to get fed up of hearing it. I was only concerned about the \"battle\" between the leading protagonist and their antagonist, but the story had all these \"side battles\" that just felt over bearing as everyone never wanted the other to win. \\n\\n\r\nSignificant character development can be seen in several of the main and supporting characters, which is always good. One particular value I appreciated that was resonated in season 2, was the conflict of wanting to share your own story as a mangaka but there was also the battle of producing what would sell, be popular and keep you serialised. As a designer I understand this struggle. I was disappointed at time as I felt that one of the supporting characters was insisting in the beginning that she would tell her story her way even if it meant loosing her contract but she seemed to change later on producing work that I did not expect her to. They claimed to want to \"change Jack\"...however I was not too sure if they indeed motivated change. What was the change that they wanted? However I continue to season 3 to see how the plot continues to unfold.",

The whole thing moved to high gear halfway through the second season and it was going up after that. TheRomance idea was extremely far fetched but was still great to watch as the lack of day to day interaction actually made it better and less clich\u00e9 imo\\n\r\n- Good comedy\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some stuff get a little repetitive\\n\r\n- It was kind of predictable, so there was no suspense factor for me.\\n\r\n- Although the show was trying to show how \"cutthroat\" the manga industry is. It was extremely lenient with the MC at some points which took away from the realism enjoyment and added to it's predictability I mentioned\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- A huge cast with many great characters that ranged from completely nuts to simple and lovable\\n\r\n- Kaya Miyoshi (Best Girl) :D\\n\r\n- Kouji Yoshida (Simply loved his scenes) :D\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Barely noticeable character main characters growth. The anime (in it's 3 seasons) supposedly spanned 10 years but even to it's last episodes i still felt like i was watching a high school drama\\n\r\n- Everyone is so fuckin understanding o_O I mean what thae actual fuck. I realize that this a Shounen anime but things need to have a limit\\n\r\n- Related to the point above, the show also lacked real assholes. one can have too much \"Friendly rivalry\" to last a lifetime in this show\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- For an anime about Manga it offer some really great and different types of art\\n\r\n- Environments and character design was good\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- It had some issues with size a depth perception\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Catchy and upbeat OPs and EDs\\n\r\n- Good voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- The soundtrack (during the actual anime) was repetitive. I believe it was the same during all three seasons\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (7/10):\\n\r\nIt was a good and entertaining show with a good amount of drama and comedy and sweet (Although super imaginary) romance but it was \"Too Shounen\" if this was an actual term\\n\r\nif that aspect was toned down a bit i would have enjoyed a lot more\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.4/10)",

Now a season 2? Why not take all my monies? This show is amazing. Don't ignore it lightly. Think of it as a good show to help motivate you in life. Things seem more possible and its amazing how they try and sometimes succeed and sometimes don't. The 2nd season brings more of the good stuff that the first season set up. I will admit I was bored at some parts but thereare other parts that easily make up for it. New characters, new challenges, and new adventures await. Whats next for the amazing manga duo? Well watch and find out. Trust me, if you liked the first season then you wont be disappointed. Enjoy it now and then join me in the wait for season 3! =]",
