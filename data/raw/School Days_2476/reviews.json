            "content": "School Days is a psychological anime, number one, so do not think it is about cute children playing in school and having happy days. School Days is an anime about how cheating on someone can really end up messing with their head and lives and how the human heart and mind are very fragile and how friendship is very precious and when destroyed in the worst way, it can have the worst consequences.\r\nThe main character is your seemingly typical anime guy in high school that listens to music and has a bunch of perverted thoughts about girls all the time, but who turns out tobe quite different than your usual main character guy and he has a crush on this girl that he sees on the train all the time and he ends up taking a picture of her and putting it in his phone. In class, another girl who he happens to sit next to, named Sekai, sees the picture in his phone and tells him her name and then, from there goes about getting him and the girl on the train to know each other so that they can try and start a relationship, all the while falling for him herself.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very much a psychological anime and deals with relationships and what happens when someone cheats on someone, but not only one person, many people. The main character is one of the most despicable characters I have ever seen, if not my MOST HATED character and cares nothing for the people around him, it seems, but to be able to hate him that much and to have so much passion for his pain and wishing something bad would happen to him was an exciting feeling because I really felt he would have to get what was coming to him. He hurts basically every single person he meets and cares nothing about how they feel when he is done with them, only to use them again in the future. He walks all over every girl in the anime, save one or two, and they all basically sit around begging for more mainly because they want to know what it's like and why the others are doing it, so they do it, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the anime the main character is, in my opinion, a sociopath, as well as a sex-addict, but there are moments here and there where you see that his actions actually do bother him and these are very important in this particular anime because if they did not have them, he would truly seem to be a monster. It is sometimes scary that the most evil people are not demons or supernatural at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is something that is perfect, though, in my opinion and it is something I ABSOLUTELY saw coming, but the way that it was done was really something creepy and gave me chills - I really enjoyed it! It was an awesome turn, but something I saw coming the entire time and something I kept repeating throughout the entire thing, over and over again and when it finally happened, I was extremely happy and satisfied. It has a very twisted ending, as well, so do not be fooled by the innocence of the title because this anime is anything but innocent, but make sure you watch until the end because there is more than just one awesome, sick twist at the end that will leave you satisfied with the feeling you get watching the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone basically gets what they deserve because this anime shows that the human mind and heart is an extremely fragile thing and that you can't just push someone aside like they are trash the second you are done with them because they may not be done with you or ready to let you leave.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nThis anime is great, great for one thing which I truly believe is its sole purpose of existence - opening pickle jars. This anime will help you with the opening of jars and various other tasks requiring brute strength. You'll feel like the Hulk after you've watched half the series. And the very reason for all of this is this anime's amazing ability to piss the viewer off like no other series I have ever seen. If you want to be angered, please, please watch this series. \r\nStory:\r\nJokes aside, this anime might be considered a decent series to other people, but Iseriously hated it. It started off fine, a few laughs, a somewhat interesting love triangle between Makoto, Katsura and Saionji, resulting in the typical 'idiot girl helps guy she loves to get another girl' thing. ... and hey, although the whole love triangle story wasn't very unique or anything, it entertained... It was fun at first to see this clueless pervert fail at getting a girl. The problem was when it became more of a love hexagon - And things went downhill from there.  The story became predictable and difficult to watch due to the idiotic and retarded main character who must have been the luckiest  sped to walk the earth. The only good thing I can say about this series was the theme it presented to its viewers: to cherish what you have. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in this anime are seriously some of the dumbest people I have ever seen. Makoto especially - after watching about 5 episodes I wanted to smash his face in. His idiotic expressions, his whiny sped voice, everything about him. I hated it all. I hated the way he looked, the way he talked, and everything he did. My hatred for this character is unparalleled to any other characters I might have ever hated in my life. The only props I can give to the people who dream t up this character was that we got to see him go from a selfish idiot to a selfish asshole by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThat rant out of the way, I don't have much to say bout the other characters which was mainly composed of idiotic girls that for some reason or another couldn't get enough of this whiny faced idiot. The characters in general, didn't have much of a background. We didn't learn much about them or their past, and they just kind of came and went. Again, my only props here is the character development.  1/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening sounded great, but it didn't really suit the series considering how dark and idiotic it became. The opening was way too happy in contrast to the story. Otherwise, bgm was decent, even good at times. No big comments here: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Character Design: I thought the animation and character design was pretty good, one of the series stronger points. All of the character designs although not unique, were nice, and the colors brought out the mood fairly well. The only character design I grew to hate was Makoto's. His round clueless face pissed me off to no end. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWhy this is even an anime series? I have no idea. Just turn this damn thing into a hentai or something. Honestly. The main character in this series has sex with pretty much every girl you'll see in this series, for no apparent reason. The girls are just lining up to be with him by the end. The characters are the most idiotic people I have ever seen, and the main character couldn't possibly be fathomed by a normal human being. 4/10",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nSchool Days Creator (SDC)- Hey man, I have a terrific idea for an anime series, based on this dirty animated game I've played!\r\nJapanese Executive (JE)-Okay, I love hentai!  Let's hear it.  \r\nSDC- Well, it's going to be about a guy who is a complete failure at life, an idiot loser who is intensely selfish.  He gets uncontrollably nervous talking to girls, and does nothing with his life. However, the twist is that every girl who meets him falls madly in love.  And he has sex with all of them.\r\nJE-What's his driving motivation?\r\nSDC-To fuck as many girls as possible,regardless of how many lies and betrayals necessary to get there.  \\n\r\nJE-Okay, but wouldn't the girls eventually catch on?  Even if at first they love him, wouldn't they dump him at some point?  I mean, realizing your girl or boyfriend sucks is and is a cheater is something MILLIONS of people in the real world go through.\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Well, that's true.  But I have just the plan to fix it; we'll make the girls equally odious and retarded.  They'll have some degree of human compassion, but along with that, a large dose of crazy and whore to them, as they gladly cheat with the boyfriend of one of their female friends!    \\n\r\nJE-  Oh!  You mean like my second ex-wife cheated on me with my former best friend?\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Yes, exactly!  One will be the reserved, kind-hearted girl named Katsura who, upon realizing her boyfriend is a cheater too cowardly to break up with her, becomes a catatonic, deranged puppet of a human being.  \\n\r\nJE-  Isn't that extreme?  I mean, if Katsura were a guy whose girlfriend was a cheating piece of shit, wouldn't going insane make the viewer hate such a character for an unnecessary, psychotic reaction, not sympathize with them?\\n\\n\r\nSDC- True, true.  We need the viewer to side with her, as no one else will be the least bit worthy of compassion.  That's why she'll be drawn very cute and sexy.  That's why we'll have every other girl in the series utterly despise her, even if there's no actual reason for them doing so.  That's why the other main character, Sekai, will betray and sleep with the main character Mokoto behind Katsura's back. \\n\\n\r\nSekai will at first seem sympathetic and even kind, helping Katsura and Mokoto to be together, but eventually, she'll turn selfish, soulless, and moronic, as she initiates make-out sessions with Mokoto while he's still dating Katsura.   \\n\\n\r\nThen, she'll be surprised that someone who cheated WITH her then starts cheating ON her.  Haha.  \\n\\n\r\nJE- Uh, okay....but what kind of a series is this?  You mention lots of moronic, pitiful girls sleeping with a moronic, pitiful guy, and betrayal and insanity.  What's the hook here, exactly?\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Ah, that's my master stroke!  School Days will, for most of its 12 episodes, be a straightforward romance series, but then, in the last episode or two, will turn gruesome and bloody.  \\n\r\nJE- But wait...isn't that just a cheap plot device to make up for how bankrupt the characters and the rest of the story are?  Isn't that just a shock tool to distract the viewer from the fact that they just watched a brainless romance series based on a hentai game?\\n\\n\r\nSDC- That's right!  But what we'll do is try to make it SEEM as deep as possible!  You know, like foreshadowing, great music random flashbacks, all that jazz.  Then, if people still criticize it, we can just say that they don't get the deep \"story\" and moral of the series.  \\n\r\nJE-  You mean it will be like a Dostoevsky novel, except with none of the actual logic, depth, or basically anything else redeemable about it?\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Exactly!  And one last brilliant idea!\\n\r\nJE-  Well, right now I'm still not convinced about the show, but go ahead.  \\n\\n\r\nSDC-  The series will double as a cell phone advertisement!  Everything will happen via cellphone, it will be a huge part of numerous plot devices and episodes, and we'll even have an ending theme prominently featuring one!  \\n\\n\r\nIf we can't get any more blatant, let's have one of the girls excitedly want to buy the latest brand of cellphone for herself and Makoto, for no apparent fucking reason. Hell, let's also have Chibi versions of the characters hawking oversized cellphones during the parts reserved for commercial breaks!\\n\r\nJE-....\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Well...\\n\r\nJE-Hmmm...\\n\\n\r\nSDC-....\\n\r\nJE- IT'S BRILLIANT!!!! UTTER GENIUS!!!!  LET'S GET IT DONE!!!!",

            "content": "\"I have touched the flower that everyone wants. The feelings for that flower, I have put into words. To hurt this world was not my intention. If there was no one there to question you, would that mean you could do anything?\"\r\nPreface: \r\nWell, today is Valentine's Day, so what better series to review than one of the most controversial love stories ever to be put in animated form? That's right, I'm talking School Days, one of the biggest cases of subverted expectations I've seen in recent days.\r\nOverview:\r\nOur story begins with two star crossed lovers, Makoto and Kotonoha (Katsura). Young love is so fragile, and sofleeting, and none know this better than our dear characters. Enter Sekai, third party, and friend to both.. What happens next is a rollercoaster of emotion (mostly fury), detachment, lies, betrayal, and sociopathy, right up to the very end, where the story of our Lovers comes full circle. When the truth comes out, Makoto, Kotonoha, and Sekai learn the full ramifications of the consequences they wrought. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3 (two points for eps 11, 12, one point for the rest of it)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are animated poorly, barring the last two episodes. Inconsistently drawn, poor facial and body animation, TONS of stillframe, key frames are few and far between. While there's not a lot of action, even the mundane slice of life is animated roughly. Uneven drawn edges, lack of faces or animation of faces during speaking, and generally repetitive environments (including a shot of the front of the school that\u2019s used about 352 times an episode). The attention to detail is decent, however. Some of the art is useful in the symbolism, (more on that below) such as the trains and certain details in houses, and the school. \\n\r\nOne recurring, and annoying, tendency of the art is when there's a pan and the image is rotated about 80 degrees to one side- rather irritating to have to turn your head to look at it.  \\n\r\nThe last two episodes are animated extremely well by comparison. Faces show real emotion, character movement and framing are much more purpose driven and subtle (something it was heretofore lacking a lot of, subtlety). \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4 \\n\\n\r\nOP and ED are fine, nothing to report. I started skipping the OP after about episode 4.\\n\r\nVoice acting is decent- not Trinity Seven, but also not absolute garbage. The main character\u2019s voices aren\u2019t particularly grating, but some of the supporting casts\u2019 are.\\n\r\nSoft piano music sets the tone in some dramatic and playful moments, nothing distracting, and nothing really enhancing. \\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Spoilers from here on---\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to give a point to this category for every character Makoto has meaningless, detached, sociopathic sex with, but decided against it.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto is our MC- selfish, uncaring, and a borderline sociopath- he exists only to indulge his own narcissism, regardless of who he affects or hurts. He seems absolutely callous to the feelings of the girls he comes into contact with, and the effect on their psyche. Incorrigible pervert, pushy, and clueless, he's a self gratifying user, and pure slime of a guy. He has no qualms about cheating on his girlfriend, or the irreversible effects that has on one's relationships, or even those of the future.\\n\\n\r\nThough there are some times where it appears his decisions have some measurable effect on his mental state, he always manages to follow up with something self serving and detestable, but, he's still human, and it shows in his times of weakness. He goes from being the object of many a lady's desire, to being an absolute pariah, and being hated by essentially everyone that he knows.\\n\\n\r\nKotonoha, the first girlfriend, is a repressed, timid girl who really gets mixed up in all of this. She's honestly the only character in the show I found sympathetic, because she didn't ask for any of what happens to her- to be lied to, betrayed, and repeatedly torn down, despite her headstrong (and later delusional) belief that Makoto is in love with her. She gets absolutely ragged on by every other female character in the show, even though she's the only one ever in the right by claiming to be Makoto's girlfriend. We see this poor girl experience an immense amount of emotional trauma- abuse from her 'friends', mistreatment at the hands of her so called lover, that it's no surprise that by the end of the show, her psychological state is significantly altered. What was once a kind, shy girl was rendered into a soulless husk, devoid of any life aside from her dissociative, misguided obsession over Makoto. The real love that she once felt became nothing but an empty shell. Symbolic, I think.\\n\\n\r\nSekai, our third 60 degree angle of this love triangle, sets herself up as a jealous and manipulative friend who only acts \"in the interest of helping Makoto get what he wants\". She uses his perverted nature to get close to him under the guise of helping him with \"special practice\" to understand girls so that he's able to finally hook up with the girl he's been crushing on. She is driven, and shrewd, and actually seems to genuinely care for Makoto, and ironically is the person who really sets things into motion with the infidelity, and is the origination of the problem though she never sees it that way herself. She, through her own machinations, sets Makoto up with herself, but at the same time plays him off on Kotonoha and triggers the boundary-less relationships that form the crux of the conflict within. The way that she turns on him later, with a classless and utterly selfish attempt to keep Makoto with her smacks of hypocrisy, juxtaposed to her earlier efforts, and reminded me of Makoto himself with the self seeking and ugly way it was presented.\\n\r\nIs she his girlfriend? Are they just friends with benefits? She has a clear answer, but Makoto seems to have different ideas about it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some other girls who make appearances, but side chicks and booty calls weren't important to the character, so I'll ignore them too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory and Overall: 6, 6\\n\\n\r\nHad I solely gone on word of mouth, reviews, and the score, I'd have never watched School Days, as I've heard nothing but terrible things about it, aside from the uniquely shocking conclusion, but I feel that \"School Days\" is a much more complex commentary on relationships and life than many other reviewers on this site, and elsewhere on the internet believe (OOO wow, dissenting opinions on the internet, who'da thunk?) \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, School Days is a deconstructivist take on the Harem genre. It shows a realist take on the idea of having multiple girlfriends and them all being okay with it, because no-one truly \"possesses\" the desired person. The idea that jealousy would never take over when someone has something that you long for is a novel one, but one that's ultimately flawed. School Days exhibits that we all possess jealousy and covetousness in some way, and that suspicion, deceit, and betrayal all play into it, RARELY with a favorable outcome.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show makes a STRONG case for monogamy and reinforces the ideas that fidelity and trust in relationships are necessary for them to be healthy and functional, I think it also examines the inner being of Makoto. Makoto is a character who doesn't know what he wants out of a relationship. It starts off innocent enough, the hugging and kissing, and quickly falls down a path to more and more pushiness, and an insatiable lust for what seems to just be dispassionate sex addiction. It delves into the psychological aspects of cheating in a relationship, and the every growing mountain of lies and deceit that one has to maintain to keep up the facade; and while Makoto is unable to do so, he sees his web of deception unravel before his eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAn ironic note: the name \"Makoto\" is explained in the beginning of the show to mean Faith. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSymbolism, Foreshadowing and Callbacks:\\n\\n\r\nI thought that School Days did an excellent job with the foreshadowing and symbolism. Having known the ending going into the show (but not who actually commits the act, and the Boat Scene was also unknown to me), I was on the lookout for subtlety, and was pleasantly surprised to find it. \\n\\n\r\n1. The movie theater and stage play scenes were particularly interesting. Within the first 3 episodes, we had the plot play out before our eyes in about 30 seconds, but in a meta way- the two girls in love with the guy, who then fight amongst each other, and decide that neither can have him. \\n\r\na) Setsuna goes to a stage production, and the dialogue is referential to the conflict at hand. (see opening quote)\\n\\n\r\n2. In episode 6, Kotonoha sees Makoto and Sekai together on a train passing by the station she's standing on. She believes it to be a mistake, and thinks nothing of it. Later, it's Sekai who's at the train station, who believes Makoto to be home, and sees Kotonoha with him on the train. \\n\\n\r\n3. Also in 6, at the moment Kotonoha reaches the rooftop, she drops her roll of blood-red yarn thread, which unravels as it rolls down the stairs. Symbolic, and important.\\n\\n\r\n4. Kotonoha is cooking in her kitchen, and her gaze lingers on the knives for a second.\\n\\n\r\n5. At the end, Makoto is making tea, which, as it comes to a boil (symbolizing his choices and the impending, extreme consequences they bring upon him) burns him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, and Conclusion: 6\\n\\n\r\nHigh school is just brutal guys, and the outcome is not always pretty- this is the heart of School Days. What we think is right is sometimes wrong, and even when we know it's wrong, sometimes we don't want to be right. An absolutely shocking and brutal conclusion to an otherwise wretched slice of life/ harem show left me speechless. It was a struggle to get through the first 7 episodes, but from 8 to the conclusion were a dark, tragic, and ultimately deserving series of events. Even as I write this, I have no words for the ending of this show, other than that I will not forget it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the question that's so hotly contested: is School Days the worst anime ever? \\n\r\nNo, but it depends on the viewer. There's a lot to hate about School Days, but if you have a taste for the psychological, and can stomach the first half, which is pretty painful and rage inducing to watch, it sets up a second half that gets deep into interpersonal relationship conflicts, and what extremes people can go to when they're irrational, because love... is irrational. The conclusion to this show was one that was remarkable at the time, and will be discussed from now on. A pioneer in the genre (yandere) as well- so it has some value in that.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: \\n\r\n+ justice is served in a twisted way\\n\r\n+ gets better past the halfway mark\\n\r\n+ dark, surprising conclusion\\n\\n\r\n- detestable characters\\n\r\n- side characters fall in love with main character for no reason\\n\r\n- garbage SOL plot *up through episode 7\\n\r\n- terrible dialogue at times\\n\r\n- bad animation\\n\\n\\n\r\nNothing says love like a journey with a beautiful girl on a yacht, floating off into the sunset--\\n\\n\r\nand then they were finally alone, \"just the two of them\".\\n\\n\r\nHappy Valentine's Day.\\n",

            "content": "A character that is not likable is not the same as a bad character. You wouldn't complain about the characters \"doing stupid things\" in Othello, would you? That's the point of a tragedy. Othello believed the lies about Desdemona because he was a flawed human being as Makoto cheated because he was a flawed human being. Things are not as simple as detractors make them seem and you can\u2019t expect a cast of deeply flawed characters to make smart decisions, like the detractors of the series supposedly would. \r\nWhere did we get this idea that a character must be likable and flawless to be agood character? Raskalnikov from Crime and Punishment is one of the greatest characters ever written and most people who read the book simply despise him. Any of you guys read the Flashman Papers? It was some of the best historical fiction ever written, but Flashman a worthless douche and was the epitome of an immoral picaresque protagonist. People don\u2019t hate the School Days characters because they are bad characters; they hate them because they are bad people and that simply makes no sense to me. They are fictional characters, you don't evaluate the quality of a fictional character the same way you would evaluate the moral quality of a human being.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMakoto was guilty of lust, but he was not entirely guilty of ignorance. He knew he was being an awful person, but he simply could not help himself. He was weak and eventually he stopped trying to fight his urges. He may be an awful person, he may be the \"worst,\" as he calls himself on several occasions, but his reactions to his situation were anything but unrealistic. When examining his character it should be kept in mind that all of the women who were awful manipulative people and were responsible for making him a female-impregnating manwhore, turned their collective back on him when he abandoned a pregnant girl. And hell, he's the father, is it that ridiculous for him to want her to have an abortion? Should a high schooler be expected to take that kind of news well? It is possible to have some amount of empathy for him as well, as it should be for any three dimensional and well-written character.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is somewhat dependent on its ending, but most series (particularly tragedies) are. To say that it was just a clich\u00e9 romance before the last episode, as I have oft heard claimed, is simply absurd. You should have realized that this anime wasn\u2019t a typical rom-com in the first episode where Makoto almost gets violent with Sekai over nothing. The infamous ending was the culmination of the rest of the series that was meticulously built up to, and while it was surprising, it certainly did not come out of nowhere in an otherwise normal anime. \\n\\n\r\nRather than being drawn out and ending with the couple getting together, like most harems, the relationships are established in episode 1. Most harems have an assumed happy-ever-after ending, but in School Days, just like in real life, things aren't always sunshines and rainbows. School Days deconstructs this idea and other tropes such as the \"matchmaker crush.\" There is also a fuckton of fanservice, like there is in most \"innocent\" romance anime. It's very impressive and entertaining how School Days gives you a set of things to expect (largely through more subtle means than typically thought) and then proves those expectations to be false, one by one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is not entirely realistic (which I\u2019ll discuss in a bit), but Makoto\u2019s character is actually relatively believable. If all the girls in school suddenly started coming on to a high school guy, he might just act the way Makoto did. Many other harem protagonists, such as Manaka from Ichigo 100%, are also selfish and generally bad people, but most harems attempt to paint the main character as the good guy. School days harbors no such delusions. Makoto is the protagonist, but we are certainly not rooting for him. In this sense it\u2019s a clever and scathing attack on the (mostly atrocious) harem genre.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it\u2019s not true that Makoto was completely worthless or a blank character. It\u2019s also not true that the girls fell in love with him out of nowhere. One girl fell in love with him because he was the first boy to ever stick up for her against bullies. One girl started sleeping with him because he accepted her when she felt unloved. One girl fell in love with him because he didn\u2019t make her feel self conscious and he wasn\u2019t just after her body like all other men. Three girls slept with him due to his impressive sexual reputation. These things all happen, they are explainable and believable. Every character has their own motives and is three-dimensional. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn most anime having/being a shy and pure girl is a good thing. In School Days, just like in real life, it is not that simple. Kotonoha\u2019s shyness makes her difficult to interact with and her prudishness is largely the reason why Makoto cheats. It\u2019s also the reason that she was too weak to just dump Makoto or confront him, which is why the whole debacle got as far as it did. School days makes it clear that her behavior is not normal or healthy and that it\u2019s a result of bullying and isolation. The fact that Kotonoha is an extreme version of an overused character archetype would normally be a flaw, but in \"School Days\" it\u2019s used to deconstruct said archetype and darkly explore what would make a character this way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother archetype that \u201cSchool Days\u201d deconstructs is the \"bromantic foil.\" You know, the perverted best friend who\u2019s just there for comic relief, has no development, and despite being a huge pervert, can never ever get laid. Well in school days the bromantic foil commits an unforgivable and undeniably realistic act against another character, in a fit of sexual frustration. \u201cSchool Days\u201d treats that archetype like a character that actually matters and has feelings, you know, like a real person. You might not like him, but he is a well written character who has a clear purpose and significance beyond comic relief. The alpha bitch bully is also deconstructed and is given clear motivations for her actions. She hooked up with the protagonist, which defeats the usual purpose of the trope, where the bully only exists to get fucked by karma. It's also interesting how she is overthrown as alpha bitch and her posse fucks Makoto behind her back; this could be considered karma for her bitchiness, but they ended up being even bitchier than her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile \u201cSchool Days\u201d is intentionally exaggerated and satirical in some aspects, it\u2019s actually darkly realistic in others. People do avoid ending relationships because it\u2019s too painful for them. People do refuse to take responsibility for getting a girl pregnant. People do fake pregnancy. These are things that happen all the time and to label them as \u201cmelodramatic\u201d or \u201cunrealistic\u201d is ridiculous. There are no incurable diseases in school days, no ridiculous coincidences, and no melodrama. Believability is stretched intentionally in several elements (a certain someone sleeping with Makoto to get him to stop cheating) of the story for satirical and deconstructive purposes, but the work remains realistic at its core. It balances satire and realism in the same way that great works like Candide do. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cSchool Days\u201d is a mixture between a clever deconstruction, a stunning tragedy, a realistic harem, and a somewhat comedic work of satire. The change in tone, foreshadowing, and build up to the incredible resolution were simply masterful. Watching all of the characters relations entropically crumble was a spectacle to behold. The characters and plot may not evoke positive emotions, but they do evoke emotion, as was their purpose, all the same. School Days was ultimately a shocking and memorable multifaceted experience that I enjoyed immensely and appreciated on multiple levels. The mediocre audiovisuals keep me from giving this anime a 9, but 8 is still a very good score. If you go in with an open mind I think you\u2019ll like it or, at the very least, appreciate it for what it is.\\n",

The sort that  that can view the suffering of fictional characters like a curious (or evil)  scientist who conducts social experiments on a bunch of unknowing test subjects (victims) with intense academic interest (while cackling madly).\r\nThe entire anime is essentially a social experiment taken to extremes. What happens if you take a horny teenage guy with little self-restraint, and give him the temptation of almost unlimited sex? What if you add into the mix a group of fangirls, who tend to always regard sleeping with the guy who sleeps with themost girls as a sign of social prestige?\\n\\n\r\nSchool days takes this scenero to its shocking conclusion... and in doing so, has created some of the most despised anime characters ever known. In this goal, School days succeeds brilliantly. The insert songs, ending themes are some of the best in any anime, the story's dark twists will eat at you, and the characters are capable of invoking the most primal emotions of hate and disgust.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not say that school days achieves that goal flawlessly. Animations were medicore, relying on more stills that it should. Meanwhile, the second to last episode that portrayed the protogonist final descent to oblivion was rushed. Had the director cut out the 5 wasted minutes devoted to blatant upskirt fanservice per episode and fleshed out the story development, I would have scored the story a 10. Nevertheless, despite the shortcomings, School days achieves what it aimed to do.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're the sort of person who wants to throw your notebook off the balcony whenever some guy on TV does something dumb or evil, this ain't the anime for you. However, if you're more the sort that want to watch the downfall of a community with morbid curiosity... then there's really no better anime for you.",

            "content": "Characters - The characters are ALL, ALL devoid of ANY logic. It is VERY clear that this anime started out as a visual novel. The characters are absolutely ridiculous. Almost nothing that they do makes sense. There is one character that you will feel empathy for, but only for a couple episodes. Very quickly this character turn into complete trash like the rest. Apparently every single girl in this show is insanely stupid. Girls in this show are portrayed to be walking sex dolls with JUST enough brain power to give consent to sex. The ONE THING that I will give to this show aboutthe characters is that the girl cliques seemed pretty accurate, barring the random \"herp derp, you know our best friend who we've been helping to get that guy that we've never talked to or met before? Let's all 3 of us go have a foursome and bang him\". Cheating is as common as breathing air in this story. Doesn't matter that you've went through half of the girls in your school, your only consequence will be hearing the phrase, \"Are you cheating on me? Promise me you won't do it again!\" x 100. Here's my favorite bits of \"logic\" from this show:\\n\\n\nI want you to stop cheating on my best friend! If you promise me you will, I'll let you cheat on her with me!\\n\\n\nI came here to talk you into talking to your girlfriend, but hey, let's bang.\\n\\n\nStory - \"Love triangle\" is putting it lightly. It's a love pyramid, with one guy at the top and his harem of women at the bottom. If I was reviewing some hentai visual novel, it'd make sense, but it doesn't fit well at all in this format. The story is literally a joke, and the person laughing is the writer, thinking to himself, \"I can't believe people actually liked this\". The ending of this show is so obvious, you'll see it coming way before it happens. What happens to the characters at the end would give you slight satisfaction if watched immediately after the first few episodes. However, by the time you actually see the end, it's too late to derive any enjoyment and wash away the horrible taste that this show has left in your mouth.\\n\\n\nComedy - You'll get a couple chuckles during the series. Although not enough to warrant watching it all. Most of the episodes in the second half are almost completely devoid of it. Sadly, the few laughs I had convinced me to continue watching the series. Big mistake.\\n\\n\nMusic - Can't really complain about the music. Nothing great, but nothing bad either.\\n\\n\\n\n1/10. Of all the manga I've read, anime I've seen, and visual novels I've played, I've NEVER thought of one so bad as to rate it 1/10, so you can imagine how it must be for me to rate it that. Save your time. You've been in non-existence for nearly 14 billion years. This is your once chance to fucking LIVE. Don't waste 4 hours on this pile of nonsense.",

If you drop this before watching the last episode, you'll be wasting your time watching this series.\r\nStory : It doesn't seem like the story was very well thought out at first (horny teenager in high school trying to get as much girls as he can).  The main character, Ito Makoto, is guaranteed to be the worst anime character you'll ever meet.  He's popular among the girls at his school because he seems/they think he's a nice guy (I have no idea what basis they havefor thinking this), but he's pretty much the devil in disguise.  He'll do everything to make the viewer hate him, from his perverted acts to his childish-like tendency to avoid responsibility.  Most of the people that come in contact with him will get screwed up emotionally/psychologically/physically, and the episodes will end with the viewer thinking, &quot;what's that guy going to do to screw up society now&quot; or maybe even &quot;I hope a lightning bolt comes down and strikes him&quot;.\\n\r\nThose that hate Makoto and are dropping the series because of him, don't.  The desired effect is to have you hate him, because divine retribution will eventually come.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Consistant animation and the artwork is exactly like that of the computer game.\\n\\n\r\nSound : The bgm's fit very well.  This show uses a different ending song every episode, some good some bad.  The opening song is mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : Everyone has issues (won't go into it in detail because of the no spoilers rule).  You wouldn't expect real high school students to act the way they do...though you wouldn't expect real high school students to be ensnared in a story this twisted.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : There are some scenes that are very hard to watch.  Most of them consists of Makoto doing something that's just horribly horribly wrong with the other characters unaware of it.  Also there are scenes where they show the effects of Makoto's actions on the female characters with Makoto, again, not taking any responsibility.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : To be frank, you will probably hate this show because of Makoto, since he is the biggest tool I've ever seen.  For those who like twisted dramas, this is the show for you.  I personally chose to finish this series because I really liked how they set up the cliffhangers, and I felt it was challenging me to continue (again, yes, Makoto's actions do make the show very very hard to watch).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the 95% of the people that watched this show that absolutely hates Makoto, you have to watch the last episode because it's incredibly well done (not for screamish people, parental discretion is advised, blah blah).  Depending on the type of person you are, you will either enjoy it (I know I did) or say it's absolutely twisted.",

            "content": "School Days the game was released a few years ago and it drew quite a bit of attention because of the fact that it was completely animated eroge.  In addition, a 30 minute non-interactive &lsquo;demo&rsquo; (it was basically the same thing as the first episode of the anime) was also subtitled when it came out.  Watching this &lsquo;demo&rsquo; gave me the impression that School Days had a very typical romance narrative.  Well a few weeks later I saw several gifs of the 3 infamous endings.  Like many, I when WTF!? and became excited when the anime was announced so I couldsee how such an ending would be possible.  Although, I though that they would animate one of the more normal endings.  Well thank goodness they didn&rsquo;t because the ending was the only thing that made this train wreck worth watching.  \\n\\n\r\nAt first School Days started off as a normal romance anime with your typical love triangle.  However, a few episodes in the reason why I kept watching was not normal.  I kept watching because I wanted to see what kind of messed up thing would happen next.  It was pure morbid curiosity the kept me going.  Sure there times I paused and started screaming at the idiocy but my morbid curiosity was too strong.  School Days transformed into a stereotypical soap opera...wait scratch that.  School Days transformed into a parody of a bad stereotypical soap opera.  The actions of the characters were so over-the-top, sexually driven that one cannot help but laugh (or scream) at the idiocy.  It was at this moment that I felt confident they would animate one of the bad endings.  Interestingly enough they didn&rsquo;t, instead the anime ending is on a level higher than the 3 bad endings combined in the game.  \\n\\n\r\nOnce again the only reason why anyone should watch School Days is for the awesome train wreck that it is School Days as well as the &lsquo;Nice Boat&rsquo; ending.  The animation was almost identical to the game, but for anime standards it was quite poor.  Art wise I guess it was ok, its saving grace was the fact that the school uniform mandates zettai ryouki.  This is something that all school uniforms should have!...ahem anyway...  Characters as mentioned above are complete idiots and the most mature/sensible ones are Kokoro (Kotonoha&rsquo;s little sister) and her friend.  They did do a good job with Makoto&rsquo;s character, by this I mean he was designed to be hated and you will be hard pressed to find anyone that likes Makoto.  In addition, this hatred is important in setting up the most important thing in School Days, the ending.  \\n\\n\r\nSo why should anyone watch this?  Well there are a few reasons.  First, just to see first hand what &lsquo;Nice Boat&rsquo; is all about.  If you watch 2 episodes and drop it, that&rsquo;s ok but if you watch more than 3 you must watch it all, else you will have wasted your time.  I believe that the primary purpose to animating this was to show/set up an ending far worst than that of the game.  In a way School Days can be considered one of the biggest fanservice anime titles out there.   Second, out of pure morbid curiosity, admittedly this was the reason why I started/kept watching.  That is until I was confident about a bad/bloody ending.",

            "content": "We are used to tragedies happening on the grand scale. Famous Shakespeare plays like Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth,  the accounts of Joan of Arc , and Oedipus Rex display this very well. Many times great tragedies are set in the past or fantasy worlds. But what would a tragedy that happens in our modern world be like? One that isn't on a grand scale. A tragedy grounded in reality, set in motion by everyday events, in which the worst crime that sparks it all involves cheating on others and not paying attention to people's feelings. This is what School Days attempts to showus. What we get in School Days is not sword play, epic battles, political intrigue, or anything of that sort. But we do have a sequence of events that ends up ruining the lives of all who are involved. We have love, romance, betrayal, and battles over the heart. This isn't much of a spoiler however, as only a few episodes into the series you can easily tell your heading down a dark and terrible path that cannot end happily for all. School Days is most definitely a contemporary school life tragedy if there ever was one.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days starts innocently enough, with Makoto Ito interesting in a girl who takes the same train to school every mourning that he does, Kotonoha Katsura. Makoto is a regular high school freshman, to shy to approach the girl he likes, and content enough just secretly admiring her. But when he hears the urban legend that if you take a picture of the girl you like, use it as the wallpaper of your cell phone, and no one notices for three weeks you will be able to go out with that person. He figures he has nothing to lose, so sneaks a picture of the girl and uses it as his wallpaper. But when a female classmate, Sekai Saionji who sits next to him, notices his phone's wallpaper, she realizes he has a crush on Kotonoha, so she plans to become their \"matchmaker\" and get the two together. Surpringly enough Kotonoha had also has noticed Makoto and developed a bit of a crush on him. So Sekai succeeds in getting the two lovebirds together. But later, when Makoto asks Sekai what he can do to thank her, she steals a kiss from him and says that's payment enough. It seems Sekai may have developed a bit of a crush on Makoto as well. It makes sense since the two were hanging out a lot lately. The real problem here, is perhaps Makoto also has feelings for her. The three become friends, and in due time a love triangle develops. The series involves lots of kissing, making out, and eventually lots of people having lots of sex. In fact I can't remember the last show that displayed this much sex, especially considering the age of these characters (what are they all 15?). Although none of the sex is graphically displayed, this does help give the show a bit of an edge. Top that off with themes of betrayal, revenge, loss of innocence, using others, ignoring others feelings, the meaning of friendship, and love vs lust, and you can see this isn't exactly a show for the kiddies. Actually it's quite a mature show that's much deeper then you would think. Besides brining up the issues of teenage sexuality (and everything that goes along with it), the show shows us exactly what happens when you ignore others feelings, play with people, and use people. It shows us what effects our actions have on others, and what that causes others to eventually do. And it does all this without once letting us hear the inner thoughts of any of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is a depiction of what would really happen if the type of romance often shown in harem anime series were to be brought to the real world. This is the real life verson of a harem, because you can sure bet if a harem were real it would not be all sunshines and rainbows, probally something more like this. In real life the girls would not be happy about their man being interested in another women. And the guy could not be shown in good light, if he's basically cheating on his girlfriend back and forth. He could not be a good person, if he's in a relationship like this. And the series is not afraid to show that. As the story goes on many other girls get involved, and many are practiclly throwing themselves at Makoto. This leaves me wondering where these girls were when I was in high school. And as contrived as it is, it does work. And you will have to be a little forgiving, as this series is attempting to dissect the harem genre. The anime is also a deconstruction piece, attempting to brake down the romance/slice of life/h-game adaptation genres. This is quite a goal, and on the large it does succeed. There are some small contrivances of course that will have to be over looked (a \"rest room/lounge\" for couples to mess around in during the school festival is pushing it a little), but over all it does not come off as too unrealistic and it is successful on turning the harem genre on it's head, inside out, and corrupting it to hell. This is quite a feat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters of this anime, I can imagine there will be many out there who won't be able to stomach them. And for good reason, most of the cast is either annoying, terrible people, or a combination of the two. So why watch it? Well for one the story is really good. It's well written and decently paced, and has more then enough twists for most viewers. It's a really addictive show from start to finish. It's something new that you probably haven't seen before, and fans of the genre of drama will eat this up. It offers a great twist on stories we've all seen, and it's cynical nature is more then fascinating. But this series is truly for those who can appreciate realistic characters. And I for one loved the way this series handled it's characters. None of them are heroes, or unrealistic teenagers always happy go lucky, or something. Instead they are life like characters, many who may hit far to close to home to some. They are all very flawed, and have real life problems, goals, anxieties, feelings, self-doubts, and fears. And a lot of them make some really terrible mistakes. If you don't like watching people make a lot of mistakes the show might not be for you. And over the course of the show a few of the characters will do what seem like truly despicable and stupid things. However we must not judge them too harshly. For they do not have the birds eye view of events that we do. They are caught up in the moment, and unable to see what those around them are thinking and feeling. And the most important reason we should not be to tough on them, is because their mistakes are our mistakes. Sure it's easy to point out when these characters are being jerks, or selfish or stupid when your watching the show. But will you be able to tell when your doing similar things? While many will become aggravated by many of the characters, and truly learn to despise them, by the end of all this I mostly feel sorry for all of them. I'm sure the part of the intent of the series was to make you dislike some characters, and get bothered by them, and it does seem to succede. But when all is said and done, I can't help but feel sorry for everyone involved, even the characters many seem to really hate. Sure I am bothered by them, but in the end they were all truly human. They all have some redeeming qualities, and none are truly monsters. However the same goes for the other side of the equation. Very few if any of the characters are truly innocent, or entirely good people. And that's very interesting. This series is brilliant in it's abilities to evoke such emotions as hate, anger, and disgust. And it will really surprise you at times. Rather then being apathetic about these characters, we care. At least we care one way, or the other. We may not love them, but we have a feeling about them. And that is very important for me while watching a series. If I have no feeling toward any of the characters then I ask what is the point in the end?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very well written, and uses drama and suspense perfectly. The story starts off like any other light hearted romance, but by the end your left just staring at the screen, freaked out by what you have just witnessed. By the end you will be asking the same question Sekai poses in one of the last scenes, \"Why?! How did this happen?\". How indeed. Because looking back at the first few episodes, it's impossible to see this type of conclusion. Even with the noise about the ending, even with the signs it's taking a dark turn, one could not foresee this ending. And what an ending it is. Perfect in every way. The last few episodes are thrilling, and involve a few twists you will not see coming. And while the ending is very sad, and very screwed up on all levels, it is more then satisfying, and that's good enough for me. This series will have you hooked from the more lighthearted and more innocent beginnings, to the bone chilling conclusion. The series also has some of the best use of comedy relief I've seen in an anime in a long time. Many anime series seem to get this wrong, at least for my tastes anyway. But School Days knows when to have the class president hit a character in the head while sliding down a water slide, or have a funny \"class fight\" during the school festival that will have you cracking up. While largely a dark drama, the slight use of comedy relief at the right times really helps prevent the series from becoming too bleak.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things we have a mixed bag. On one hand the animation is not up to par with current anime TV series. While not outright terrible, it is mediocre at best. The series uses a lot of stills, pannings, and shortcuts in order to tell it's story. While not exactly distracting, it won't be winning any awards either. Some scenes do not at all flow well, and others have characters all moving at the same time in the same way, giving off a very robot like feeling. This easiest to see when a character enters a room, and all the others turn and face them. They all turn at the same time, and it's all very stiff. There are times when the animation is good, especially in the beginning and the episodes toward the ending. But seeing how this series is mostly talking, walking, making out, and having sex (lots of sex), I think they could have done much better. As far as the art goes however, I thought it was great. The character designs are what drew me to the series in the first place. they have this \"rounded\" feeling to them, that really makes them look a little different then your regular characters, but not too different as to take away from the main point of dissecting common anime genres. One small problem was how a few of the characters looked a little too much like each other, and in the begining it was a little hard to tell who was who. But after an episode or two I quickly got used to it. The color palette used is another strong point of the series. Lots of blues, pales, greys, and blacks are used, and it all looks quite nice. The series has this distinct look about it that I just love. The backgrounds are all good, but nothing to write home about. Although I did really enjoyed the many of the characters' rooms, the location right outside Makoto's house, and of course the \"nice boat\" scenery. The music however is in a word, perfect. I wouldn't change a damn thing about it. The opening theme may be a little too happy for some, but just like the opening theme to Shadow Star Narutaru , another deconstruction piece, it works to it's advantage. The multiple ending themes are all really great songs, although if I must pick a favorite it would be the endings of episodes three and eleven which use the song \"Waltz\", by Kanako Ito. This series also has a handful of excellent insert songs, all which add the mood perfectly. The right song is used to enhance this scene or that one, and some of them really help to add to the drama, or the suspense (towards the end of the series). Perhaps the best insert song is \"To the Other Side of Sadness\" by Kanako Ito, which I just can't stop listening to. It's used during one of the most important scenes in the series, and it really makes that scene. I have not heard any other series were Kaoru Okubo was in charge of the music, but I sure hope to in the future. Okubo really impressed me with the soundtrack in this, from great background themes, to amazing insert songs, and great openings and endings, nothing is off. I must have more!\\n\\n\r\nThere will be many out there who hate this series. And that is perfectly all right. This is not a show for everyone. They will find it's soup-opera-ish plot ridiculous and it's characters despicable, and will be bothered greatly by this show. But for those who can enjoy a good drama, one were the characters are realistic and flawed, this is the show for them. If you can deal with characters that you may dislike or even grow to hate, this is the show for you. Because the plot is so well written, and the show is so good, I think most will enjoy this. I normally would not review a series not licensed, since I usually only watch DVD's anyway. But once in awhile I check out a legal streaming show or two, and this was one of them. I watched the shows entire 12 episodes in two sittings, something I've never done before. I usually take weeks to watch even the shortest of series, so that speaks volumes for how much I enjoyed this series. I am not big on watching a show subtitled, but this show managed to entertain me the entire time. It impressed me so much I just had to review it. So if you think it may make such an impression on you, be sure to check it out. It's currently streaming on Crunchyroll, legally and for free. Now let's hope this great show gets licensed so I can watch it on my big screen TV with a great dub.\\n\\n\r\n- Review copyed from my personal blog\\n\r\n- Original review posted at: http://predeanimereview.blogspot.com/2009/11/school-days.html\\n\\n",

            "content": "A pitfall for many shows that attempt to be dark and mature is that they often mistaken edginess for depth. They present dark world views, display acts of immorality and cruelty, all under the misconception that they are laying bare some dark truth of the world. For an example, look no further than this infamous 12 episode anime series. School Days is the perfect picture of a show that confuses sadism for pessimistic insight. This is a show that is thoroughly patience testing in its sheer unpleasantness; saved from the bottom of the barrel only by the karmic bite of its conclusion. While its ambition(to put a dark twist on teenage romance) is quite an interesting one, the show sacrifices human dignity and decency in its attempt to shock us, and becomes too mean-spirited to stand with any sort of validity.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days starts simply enough, like all high school romance shows, with a crush. High school student Makoto Itou has a crush on Kotonoha Katsura, a pretty but quite girl from another class. He's had his eye on her for some time, but is unsure of how to approach her. That is until the girl that sits next to him in class, Sekai Saonji, finds out about his crush and decides to help him. After some effort, they succeed, and Makoto and Kotonoha start a timid relationship; while Sekai hides the feelings she has developed for Makoto. Problems begin to emerge when Makoto wants to take the next big step in their relationship, namely having sex, but Kotonoha is less comfortable with rushing things. Makoto looks to Sekai for help, and after some convincing by Makoto the two begin to participate in \"practice sessions\". Thus, School Days simple romance turns into a profoundly screwed up tale of infidelity, which might have been compelling if it was handled with the maturity and delicacy such a story requires. Alas, this isn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest and most apparent problem is the characters. The thoroughly unlikeable, usually flat-out despicable characters. Makoto is simply a terrible protagonist. At first he seems like a completely generic rom-com male lead, then as the story continues, he turns into an irredeemable sex-crazed sleaze. His development is essentially like watching plain yogurt become moldy spoiled yogurt. As the series progresses, Makoto spouts lie after lie while completely disregarding the feelings of everyone around him, especially his supposed love interests. When he gets tired of Kotonoha, he avoids and ignores her while starting a sexual relation with Sekai. When he gets tired of Sekai, he moves on to having sex with every girl he comes into contact with, including Sekai's BFF, Setsuna. Any momentary kindness he displays feels like a forced attempt to make him sympathetic, which fails because he is a loathsome little worm. Makoto is such a profound scuzzbad, and his actions so despicable and far removed from what a feeling human being would do; it becomes impossible to empathize with him. It becomes impossible to feel anything other than boiling rage toward him. This might have been the show's intent, but it hardly excuses the mean-spirited lengths the show goes to, and it certainly isn't good characterization. Makoto is one-dimensional scum, and for the show to try to pass him off as an average teenage boy who is misguided because of sexual desires is outright insulting.\\n\\n\r\nSekai, for her part, is just as despicable in her own two-faced way. She's often shown feeling guilty about having sex with Makoto while he is in a relationship, yet she continues to do so because she's in \"love\" with him. She even lets people incorrectly think that she's his girlfriend at one point, and lets Setsuna harass Kotonoha about being around Makoto. This is a character that the show expects us to sympathize for. Kotonoha is easily the most sympathetic of the three leads, but doesn't make her likeable, nor does it make her a well written character. She's just the nice, timid girl... until she loses her mind. The stress and paranoia from her strained relationship drives Kotonoha insane in almost comedic fashion; by mid-series she's walking around dead-eyed and delusional, having imaginary phone conversations. Both girls are very unflattering depictions of their gender, each in their own way. However, both share the most undignified of characteristics: their obsessive and unhealthy love for Makoto.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this might have not happened if every other girl in the show wasn't a bitch to Kotonoha. Majority of the supporting cast, which mainly consists of girls, are there to be horrible to Kotonoha or have sex with Makoto... or (most likely ) both. Even the only guy in the show besides Makoto is a horn-dog who only makes things worse. Herein lies the reason School Days twisted drama doesn't work, none of these characters feel like people, let alone high school students. They are nothing more than mean-spirited caricatures; driven only by an obsession with sex and shallow feelings they take for love, and devoid of any of the other passions or anxieties that people would have at that age. This robs the show of any potential poignancy; since all these characters are lacking humanity, there isn't anything to relate with or sympathize for. All that is left is a mess of unpleasantness.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that isn't to say there is no reward for those who have the patience to sit through this unpleasantness. School Days concludes with a violent flash of karma. I'll restrain myself from giving away any details (though I'm sure most already know what happens), but suffice to say that it is satisfying to watch characters get some well deserved comeuppance. It isn't really enough to forgive all the anger inducing smut that came before, but does enough to qualify it as a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy watching miserable excuses for people learn that karma is a bitch... the hard way. (i.e. me)\\n\\n\r\nVisually, School Days looks like most visual novel adaptations. Character designs with big eyes and cute faces, wearing neat school uniforms. Backgrounds that comprise of the usual class rooms, apartments, rooftops and cityscapes. This isn't of any surprise as the show is adapted from a visual novel, and attempts to be a deconstruction of sorts for the genre. The music is also reminiscent of most visual novel adaptations, though some tracks are a bit more focused on evoking shock or dread. Unfortunately, it isn't all that effective nor well composed; it almost feels just tacked on to some scenes. Sometimes it is unnoticeable, other times distracting. The inset song that plays at the climactic scene in the final episode is oddly fitting and certainly memorable, though the latter might just be because the scene it is featured in.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is a failed attempt at a dark subversion of school romance dramas. Sure, it took dark shocking twists that turn some tropes of the genre on their heads, but ultimately it was all for naught. In all its effort to shock and offend us, the show throws out any notions of human decency and consequently gives us almost nothing to connect to. As a result, it comes across as extremely juvenile; something a disgruntled teenager who has no idea what he is talking about would write and claim as a deconstruction of the romance genre. It is a vile, horribly convinced, poorly written monstrosity. It must be said, however, that School Days isn't something easily forgotten. It's the kind of bad that will linger in your head long after you finish it. At the very least, the ending will most certainly be burned into your mind.",

            "content": "Welcome to the world where you have a nice little harem with you in it, what would you do? Would you preserve the status quo to maintain it? Or rather choose one girl out of the rest? Or screw it up completely? Unfortunately for little Itou here, he chose the latter one, and hell did he screw up, big time.\r\nNow, notice the lack of the \"Comedy\" genre that you should be expecting in a school harem.\r\nLet me tell you a few things too, the description here is way too optimistic for this anime. The genre bar is also lacking too. If you're here expecting aHappy-Land ending, I am happy to tell you that you're in for a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nDon't mess with emotions, kids.\\n\\n\r\nI stumbled upon in this anime after a friend recommended this to me. He told me it is one of those animes that will end in a pleasing boat ride. I took it in as a metaphor and I could not have been more wrong. The boat ride part was right, but I'm not so sure about the \"pleasing\" part.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the description and the genres, I thought it was your average run-in-the-mill harem anime where the Happy-Happy land forms and where the skies of rainbows and sunshine hit the ground.\\n\\n\r\nBut as I continued to watch this anime, there was something a bit off. Usually there is the problem-resolve stuff in regular harems where a problem would pop up and the Protagonist will fix it and so forth, but problems here seemed like it wasn't solved\u2014to be exact, it became a much bigger problem instead.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this guy was pouring gasoline to a stack of wood on which he already threw a lit matchstick to.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know if you should call this guy a Protagonist, an Anarchist seems to be a better definition of this guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Protagonist is a brute, I found that word very fitting for his character. If you expected clean relationships in this anime like in any other harems, you are not going to like where this one goes. This guy is a polygynic freak and very unsympathetic. Beside him are girls that would do everything after some pathetic smooth-talking from him. This really pissed me off.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I continued watching this anime is because I had the intuition that this guy was going to meet his demise. I was not disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that truly displays what happens if you bring the human emotions to a very unstable variable. \\n\\n\r\nIf you stopped watching this anime mid-way, you don't know what you're missing on.\\n\\n\r\n//Spoiler Alert \\n\\n\r\nThe last 10 minutes of the last episode had to be the only thing I found amusing so far in the series. A cold-blooded murder from a person he once knew. As a person that likes watching Crime Investigation and such, I felt kind of awkwardly content to what happened. Murder may be illegal and such, but this guy should be an exemption because he the personification of insanity at its essence.\\n\\n\r\n//Spoiler End\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it up. This is an anime horror disguised as a seemingly innocent show. For those sick of Good Endings. I don't know where else you could find a jewel as shiny as this. If you like animes where things take an unexpected (in this case, VERY unexpected) turn. I would presume that you will like this one.\\n\\n\r\nThis was absolutely one of the most astonishing animes I have ever watched. I encourage you to watch this not because of the hyped ending, but to show how emotions and bad decisions can have a disastrous effect not only in the 2D world, but also in real life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I can already see the creator of School Days trying to portray an image to the viewers that this is typically a normal life of a teenager would lead, but forgetting that not every teenager leads this type of life. Getting deeper into this, I would say the moral of this story goes beyond your ordinary imagination of ecchi and romance. All I can say is, prepare yourself for a story like no other, a story that even sometimes exist in reality and thatthings like this can happen. From emotions to physical pain, happiness, WTF moments and moments where not even a word can express what this anime is about. It's all for the.. you know what? I'm just going too 'cheat' my way through this review. Haha.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm not one to judge on the art, but sometimes I have a hard time picking out who's who. That is if you are looking specifically at the eyes! The art is on a level that isn't medium, neither low. It's something good enough to get you through the dreading 12 episodes. Aside from the ecchi, the art is well drawn for a kid who's taking anime art class!\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say about sound, but there is a few songs that were thrown into the anime that caught my attention. I believe because of that, I actually didn't move my hand to the mouse to skip some of the parts that made me angry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Okay! Aside from all the whores, sluts and the main character. I gave this score a two for ONE good reason. If you are reading this review before you start watching it, I suggest you keep your focus on Kotonoha Katsura. She is sweet, innocent, shy, new to relationships and very what's that word. Hm, figure it out yourself when you watch it. Katsura, deserve a +1 in my case, else wise I would of gave each and every character a 1 (too bad they don't have 0's). The characters each played a special role and possibly at one point, I felt the same way one of them felt. Trying to relate was something I did with each and every one of the character, sadly. It did not work out. They are all emotional and selfish! Like really now. From what I believe the creator of School Days, took love and just tossed it around like it was a volleyball thus creating a crazy atmosphere of insanely robotic girls wanting to kill and sex the next guy. Haha, do you believe me?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: PATHETIC. IF YOU WANT TO BE ANGRY THEN THIS IS THE ANIME YOU WANT TO WATCH! Don't miss out on a chance to call each and every character, BAKA!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I want my 12 x 30 = ?? time back. Thank you, no extra charge.",

            "content": "You ever cut your eyes out with a butter knife? Well, you will know the experience once you watch School Days. I was on the verge of just staying in my room for a couple days and not even feeding myself. Yes, this anime was THAT bad. Now by bad, I mean something other than the traditional \"shitty\" or \"garbage\" most people are familiar with. I mean, it's just so god awful that it left a sour taste in my mouth. I will expand more on this feeling and provide you with a somewhat accurate portaryal of this steaming piece of doodoo.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is verysimple to begin with, but then become very \"unwatchable\". It follows the school life of some guy (I don't give a flying ass about his name) and his relationship with two girls. There is a loudmouthed overspoken girl, Sekai, and the shy, quiet girl, Kotonoha. The guy originally liked Kotonoha but then like most guys, he becomes sex deprived from this shy girl and decides to screw the other girl for \"practice\". Blah blah blah, a few boring sex scenes later, a problem arises. This loser guy is now a horndog with no consideration for women's feelings. I'm not gonna ruin this marvelous (bullshit) ending for you, but it is very, um, intriguing. (You ever hear of the famous boat scene? Yeah, there's a reason why it's so popular.)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was ok to look at. It wasn't outstanding or new, it had the art most animes follow nowadays. There wasn't much physical action or movement in this anime, save the ending, so it was near impossible for the animation to fail. The art was probably the only thing I didn't puke at in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe BGM felt very monotonous and I skipped the ending and opening so I don't have a deep opinion here. However, I must say the music during the final scenes were quite nice. It really let the series climax. (haha climax. Get it? I used a sexual joke for a sexual anime!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFuck you. No, not you. Fuck the characters. If I could meet the characters in real life, I would murder each one for the sake of my own sanity. Well, the guy's friend was kind of funny. He was horny too, but he didn't go overboard and he provided some comic relief. Anyway, back to my thoughts for the main characters. I would chop off the main guy's weiner for his overhorniness and complete disregard for women's emotions. I would stab Sekai with a trench knife for her overall attitude and lies. Then for Kotonoha, I would give her a cookie filled with cyanide and my dog's diarhhea dump. I will NOT describe these characters any further. Let me warn you. You will hate these characters so much, that you will end up hating yourself. Oooh philosophical. School Days suck sweaty asshole, Confucius say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n*Snicker*\\n\\n\r\nContrary to my review, go ahead and watch this series. Cmon, you know you want to. I ended up watching this anime through peer pressure, and even though I wanted to cut myself, it did teach me some valuable lessons about womanizers and pimps. It's worth a watch, even though you will hate me and yourself for it. I don't think you can really say you watched \"everything\" until you watched an amazing frustrating anime like School Days. Go watch it please.\\n\\n\r\nCheers, you poor bastards.\\n\\n",

However, at the beginning of his second term, he falls in love with a beautiful girl that also rides the train. Unfortunately, she barely knows of his existence. Her name is Kotonoha Katsura, and though they attend the same school, they are not in the same class. In an attempt to catch her eye, Makoto enlists the aid of a close female friend of his: Sekai Saionji.She helps him, despite the fact that she--unbeknownst to Makoto--is in love with him. Thus the three are bound in a love triangle of life changing proportions.\\n\r\n(Source: ANN)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nWhen everything was done after the 12th episode.... I stared at my computer screen for a good minute. COMPLETLY speechless.\\n\r\nWhen they said that the ending was messed up.. they weren't joking... This is as messed up as you can get. So what'd I think on the whole?\\n\r\nWatching episode 1 through 6, is much like trying to swallow a box of nails.  It's filled with fan-service shots that made me want to puke, characters whom i wanted throw bricks at, and a story that seemed to be written by a middle school girl.  But if you can stomach those episodes... you're home free.\\n\r\nEpisodes 7 to 11 are a lot more engaging.  While not a whole lot better, there was definitely enough in there in which I could keep watching because I felt like it.  The character interactions are what shines in this part of the series and some of the previous characters that you learn to hate... come back w/ sympathetic qualities.\\n\\n\r\nBut if we're talking about School Days here... It's ALL about the ending.  INCREDIBLY controversial... and something more suited for Higurashi.  That being said... I loved it.  The music created incredible tension and when hell broke lose... my heart was racing.  Did it fit this anime? I don't know... but it sure as hell was memorable. That was a NICE BOAT...\\n\\n\r\nSo overall...\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-6 = 3.5/10\\n\r\nEpisodes 7-11 = 7/10\\n\r\nEpisode 12 = 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLeaving the final rating of\\n\r\n7/10 (though more 6.5)\\n\\n\r\nSimilar To...\\n\r\n- Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni\\n\r\nOnly the ending is comparable to Higurashi",

            "content": "This review WILL contain spoilers.\r\nWhen I first got into School Days, I didn' know what I was getting myself into. I had heard about it, by people who either loved it or hated it. So I didn't know what to expect from it.\r\n2 years later, I still don't know exactly what I watched.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe premise of School Days is simple; boy falls in love with girl but he doesn't exactly know how to approache her, so he gets help from another girl to get them together. Pretty innocent, right? Sure, I thought the same thing, a cute couple with a change of love blooming. Thingis, this is where things start to get out of control. He soon starts fooling around with other women, sleeping around with any girl who seems interested enough, basically saying \"f*ck you\" to everyone and the viewer. So I'm supposed to support this guy...? It's this out of the blue BS that gets thrown to your face, attepting to surprise to viewer.\\n\\n\r\nI know it's regarded as  \"psychological\", and that \"it's not supposed to be perfect because love's not perfect\" blah, blah. I didn't see it. I only saw sh*tty decisions made by sh*tty characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reedeming thing about it, if I'd had to say, it's probably it's infamous endind that, if you haven't seen or even heard about, I won't spoil it for you. It's almost majestic. Just gonna say \"nice boat.\" Yup.\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nIt's a hit or miss. It's neither good or bad. I've seen worse. Some scenes look nice and others look dreadful. Okay-ish animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nAgain, hit or miss. Some of the voice actors sound horrible, i.e Sekai. Soundtrack is eh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, the characters are the main reason I have such hatred towards this anime. Makoto f*cking Ito is probably the most pathetic, disgusting character I've ever had the misfortune of laying my eyes in. He has absolutely no godamn respect towards ANY of the characters he interacts (aka f*cks around with), is a selfish individual, and plays the victim when blamed for something. He has absolutely no personality whatsoever, he's basically a cardboardbox. Except not, because even cardboardboxes are more useful than him.\\n\\n\r\n \"Oh, no, yeah he's a unlikeable character, but that doesn't make him a bad character!\" Yes, it does. He's a disgusting character, he's not \"deeply messed up, such emo, much need for the v\" no, he's simply disgusting. Get over it.\\n\\n\r\nAny other characters (which is 99% females, seriously, there's only two guys counting Makoto is this school, what the flying f*ck happened to the male population) are bland, maybe with the exception of Kotonoha, because seriously, I felt bad most of the time for her. The others were either sluts he slept with or unimportant characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nNo. No, no, no. Most of the time I was facepalming at the stupidity of the whole situation and how low life Makoto was. I was enraged, just hoping for the episodes to end so I could just get it over with. The only thing that brought me joy was the ending. I burst out laughing. It was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nI hear that the visual novels are better. Can't confirm, since I never played them nor do I plan to. But this is by far the worst thing I ever had to sit through, and I would not recommend to anyone. Really. It's a waste of time.",

            "content": "AUTHORS NOTE (23/1/14): Near the end of the review, there is a spoiler regarding the final episode. I urge you to watch the series before reading the review or -- if you aren't interested in the series/have dropped it -- read it if you so desire.\r\nDon\u2019t be fooled this anime\u2019s poster: it\u2019s not all happy girls and good times. School Days is the adaption of a visual novel with the same name, infamous for its brutal bad endings. A notably absent genre this should be categorised is psychological \u2013 it shows the worst of human desire in a twelve episode, slow-paced fashion which is eithera make or break depending on taste and overall dedication to observe when the plot actually moves forward. School Days is a satirical take on the harem genre as a whole, taking on the realistic approach when it comes to the genre deciding that the main character will inevitably get every woman he\u2019s ever interacted with. In reality, this is not the case and School Days explicitly shows the consequences of wanting too much and giving next to nothing in return.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s why everyone should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m serious \u2013 no other anime can replicate the emotions that School Days is capable of, one of which is mainly pure anger. It\u2019s possible to feel emotionally attached to a number of the characters, though in the end it\u2019s realised that their actions have been brought upon due to lust, a factor that would\u2019ve cementing School Days into pornographic territory if not of the actual plot and character development. It starts off cheerfully and as it goes on, the temper of the audience will rise to the point of smashing their television or computer in disgust due to the characters\u2019 actions. They say school is one of the most beneficially periods in a person\u2019s life: School Days shows the exact opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot follows token male harem protagonist Itou Makoto who develops a crush on a girl \u2013 Kotonoha \u2013 whom he observes on the bus every day with lustful eyes or at least, eyes of affection. It\u2019s Makato\u2019s first year at High School and he\u2019s seated next to Sekai, another girl in which e feels no affection for yet is as outgoing as a celebrity. Sekai finds out that our token protagonist is in love with Kotonoha and decides to become her friend in order to obtain information about her so Makato will actually know something about her and not stare at her body endlessly. Sekai and Kotonoha do legitimately become friends, with Makato later confessing to Kotonoha ending the first episode with them being a couple. Makoto tries to thank Sekai for her effort and there\u2019s only one thing Sekai will take for a reward: a kiss.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all in the first episode \u2013 a fast pace never seen again.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps \u2018protagonist\u2019 isn\u2019t a word well-suited for Makoto as his main objective is to bang anything that shows the slightest sense of movement. The main factor that attributes to the anger School Days supplies is the main character. Itou Makoto is not a role model. He\u2019s not someone to aspire to and he\u2019s not someone you\u2019d like to know unless you\u2019d want to have a fleeting orgasm with. He\u2019s a relentless hormonal machine similar to the Terminator \u2013 he\u2019d bang everyone until he has a nice glass of brandy before banging the actual target. Itou Makoto is perhaps the perfect definition of \u201cthe worse\u201d, a complete knob of a ridiculously high caliber and yet is the basis for any viewer of the male gender who would like nothing else to be the Terminator of sex.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the side-characters aren\u2019t much better. Sekai is everything that Makoto desires that Kotonoha isn\u2019t or in better terms, won\u2019t perform. Being as horny as a rabbit, Makoto\u2019s quest for seemingly endless sex doesn\u2019t start at Kotonoha, but at Sekai after a couple of episodes in that cement Makoto\u2019s douchebaggery. By the end of the third episode, he finally decides that he\u2019s sick of her due to not being entitled to sex after a period of time. Not taking it steady is Makoto\u2019s bread and butter, as in he just wants to spread his butter all over his seemingly endless bread \u2013 wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Perhaps it\u2019s because every other side character has a vagina and the only other character that has a knob doesn\u2019t supply any moral support and would be just horny as our main character. We don\u2019t really get to know the other side characters that the Sexinator bangs very well, which is a shame because they\u2019re all part of an indecisive wanker\u2019s sexual quest of glory. They actually have motives, unlike our lovable cyborg sex maniac so that\u2019s a big plus in their court.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps something else that brings School Days down is the rather unappealing art style. The characters don\u2019t seem very attractive, especially the female characters. This is an oddity considering the harem genre that School Days deconstructs over the course of the series, however this has lead me to believe that it was entirely on purpose \u2013 what does Makoto see in all of the girls over the course of the series? He decides to pound every woman he comes in contact with and even falls in love several times, yet there is seemingly nothing that contributes to his sudden attraction or at least his hormones being set a full throttle. Being based off a visual novel, it\u2019s not really unexpected for School Days\u2019 lacklustre art as it\u2019s practically ripped from the game itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother gripe to be had with the anime is its slow pace.  The finale felt like an eternity to reach, as nothing much happens \u2013 or at least, that\u2019s what it seems to be with Makoto going back and forth as he\u2019s just as indecisive as any other harem protagonist. It emulates what it\u2019s actually like to be in school: nothing happens for a while and any drama that occurs may pace itself out to the point of wanting to reach the end as fast as possible. However, when it gets to the finale, everyone will scream for joy and it remains as one of the greatest endings in the history of anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it deserves a paragraph of its own. So, spoilers ahead!\\n\\n\r\nIn the final episode of School Days, everything goes down \u2013 Makoto and Kotonoha reconcile after he\u2019s realised that being a robot only made for having sex with everything in a one centimetre radius isn\u2019t has glorified as it should be, after Sekai reveals that she\u2019s pregnant with his child and every girl he has had sex with in his school \u2013 which is nearly all of them \u2013 begins to fear him due to this sudden revelation. However, seeing them reconcile in front of her, Sekai murders Makoto when he suggests that she should get an abortion. Kotonoha visits Makoto\u2019s\u2026 corpse, in his room and takes matters into her own hand: by killing Sekai on the school rooftop in an admittedly badass fashion. Beforehand, she cut off Makoto\u2019s head and put it in a duffel bag. After she killed Sekai, Kotonoha invalidates her previous claims of pregnancy, which means all of this tragedy has been caused by a lie and most likely cementing everyone\u2019s hate for her as a character and a work of fiction. The final scene depicts Kotonoha and Makoto\u2019s head stranded on a nice boat, thus ending the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, after all of the negative things about it, why did I give it a high score?\\n\r\nSchool Days \u2013 for this viewer \u2013 had something that is nearly indescribable that kept me hooked the entire time. I hated the characters, I didn\u2019t particularly like the art style or the music; yet I wanted to see how it ends, I wanted to see how exactly the tragedy plays out. I had heard about people discuss this absolutely hating and even liking it, I can see why it\u2019s hated amongst many people. It absolutely ensnared me the whole time and even if you hate everything about it, you still want to see how it ends. If a series can keep a viewer hooked the whole time even if it\u2019s being despicable and absolutely loathsome, it has achieved something great. That\u2019s why I believe that anyone and everyone should watch School Days. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to, however, my spoiler saved you some time. You\u2019re welcome.",

            "content": "School Days is a Slice of Life, Romantic, Drama about a sordid love triangle between friends Makoto (guy), Kotonoha (girl) and Sekai (girl). This is anime is an adaptation of a visual novel, notorious for its tragic endings and this anime retains that reputation.\r\nAs the story begins it seems very average, with the typical storyline that this type of anime tends to follow however both of the girl's questionable behaviour and feelings do make this romance drama very interesting. Even though it is very short, the story flows well at a satisfying pace, with some major unexpected developments that will keep most unable to stop.\r\nYetthis interesting anime was hugely let down by its characters, the male protagonist in particular. It's a common thing to have a unlucky and average guy as a protagonist however School Days goes overboard by making Makoto a useless, worthless, perverted, the list goes on&hellip; To have someone like him act like he's the &quot;top man&quot; gets so annoying that anyone can easily just drop this anime and look for a better one. The supporting characters don't add much to the story either it's really just the two main girls that bring this anime's story to life, which makes it worth watching to the end and also makes you feel sorry for the girls affected by Makoto.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of this anime is decent with great character designs, where the girl's body shapes are paid close attention to for fanservice. The animation could have been the great point to this anime but the animators are so lazy that issues with the background characters and static characters become so noticeable that it degrades the quality of the show. At least the music helps at points to bring a certain tone to any situation, nonetheless this anime overall is full of too many silent moments.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, School Days turned out to be an interesting and somewhat different anime romance drama (based on a visual novel) to watch. Even with the most hated and irritating male protagonist, the girls managed to bring something to the story, including a lot of heartfelt and ecchi moments ($ex). As it began to reach its climax the story became really disturbing and then came the shockingly unexpected ending.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to those who enjoy watching romance anime however the male protagonist is the biggest issue in this series, so this isn't one to watch if you're easily irritated. ^_^",

If you think that this show is about love, you are misguided.

            "content": "School Days.\r\nPersonally, both one of the best and worst anime I've ever seen.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI thought the story was technically excellent. Very interesting and completely not what you expect at first impression.\r\nWhile I was watching it, I didn't like it, because it made me angry...but then when I stopped to think, I realized, wow, that means it's actually really skillfully done. It makes you feel everything.\r\nAlso, the way that they wrapped it up in the end left me speechless. I'm still not even exactly sure how I feel about it, but I think that's how it's supposed to make you feel, and they pull it offin a really amazing way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art was well done and fitting, and complimented the series well. I'll just say it did its job, since I didn't really think about it while I was watching it. Though something that I did notice was done nicely is the facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe music, to me, was simply okay. Like the art, it fit and did its job. (I must say, the opening song grew on me a little bit, but I don't really even remember anything else.)\\n\r\nBut Kanashimi no Mukou he, the song that plays at the ending, gave it such a haunting and melodramatic feel. I thought it was a really nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nI gave this portion a 10, merely because...this is human nature. Everyone has a little bit of good and wickedness in them, and everyone affects each other. And I think they portrayed that beautifully through the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like any of the characters, but yet they were so well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll three of the leads, I believe, started out pretty innocent and average. Makoto, pretty much a normal guy, who was just too shy to approach the girl he had been seeking out.\\n\r\nSekai, outgoing and sometimes even a bit boisterous, just trying to help out the guy sitting next to her with his love life.\\n\r\nAnd then Kotonoha, who had that touch of naivety, and was a little on the awkward side.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like they all had good intent at first.\\n\\n\r\nThen when they met each other...Kotonoha's insecurity, Sekai's jealousy and guilt, Makoto's confusion and twisted desires...they affected each other, more so bringing out the bitter evil inside each other due to their conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it's hard to side with any of them once you've reached the end of the series, because you realize that all three of them are pretty messed up.\\n\\n\r\nEven though you'll hate them so much, you'll still sort of have an understanding of what brings about their serious flaws.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why the characters are so much like people, and wonderfully developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of funny, actually, because I enjoyed thinking about how good the story was more than I actually enjoyed watching it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I also felt dirty after watching it because of how disgusting Makoto becomes, and that took away from my enjoyment of it as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut throughout the whole thing, it's not really so much a matter of enjoying it...it's more that you just get hooked and feel the need to see what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me feel so much hatred and anger...but it's really just meant to do that, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nJust watching the ending would probably determine how you'd feel about it. It could make you feel disturbed, happy, depressed, confused, indifferent, or just mixed feelings.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, if you watched the ending, that'd kind of give you no reason to watch the series...but I don't know if I really recommend it or not. I guess it really just depends on the person.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone seems to have a different opinion about this one.\\n\\n\r\nBut me, personally...I think it deserves an 8.",

            "content": "School Days is a psychological anime, number one, so do not think it is about cute children playing in school and having happy days. School Days is an anime about how cheating on someone can really end up messing with their head and lives and how the human heart and mind are very fragile and how friendship is very precious and when destroyed in the worst way, it can have the worst consequences.\r\nThe main character is your seemingly typical anime guy in high school that listens to music and has a bunch of perverted thoughts about girls all the time, but who turns out tobe quite different than your usual main character guy and he has a crush on this girl that he sees on the train all the time and he ends up taking a picture of her and putting it in his phone. In class, another girl who he happens to sit next to, named Sekai, sees the picture in his phone and tells him her name and then, from there goes about getting him and the girl on the train to know each other so that they can try and start a relationship, all the while falling for him herself.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very much a psychological anime and deals with relationships and what happens when someone cheats on someone, but not only one person, many people. The main character is one of the most despicable characters I have ever seen, if not my MOST HATED character and cares nothing for the people around him, it seems, but to be able to hate him that much and to have so much passion for his pain and wishing something bad would happen to him was an exciting feeling because I really felt he would have to get what was coming to him. He hurts basically every single person he meets and cares nothing about how they feel when he is done with them, only to use them again in the future. He walks all over every girl in the anime, save one or two, and they all basically sit around begging for more mainly because they want to know what it's like and why the others are doing it, so they do it, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the anime the main character is, in my opinion, a sociopath, as well as a sex-addict, but there are moments here and there where you see that his actions actually do bother him and these are very important in this particular anime because if they did not have them, he would truly seem to be a monster. It is sometimes scary that the most evil people are not demons or supernatural at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is something that is perfect, though, in my opinion and it is something I ABSOLUTELY saw coming, but the way that it was done was really something creepy and gave me chills - I really enjoyed it! It was an awesome turn, but something I saw coming the entire time and something I kept repeating throughout the entire thing, over and over again and when it finally happened, I was extremely happy and satisfied. It has a very twisted ending, as well, so do not be fooled by the innocence of the title because this anime is anything but innocent, but make sure you watch until the end because there is more than just one awesome, sick twist at the end that will leave you satisfied with the feeling you get watching the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone basically gets what they deserve because this anime shows that the human mind and heart is an extremely fragile thing and that you can't just push someone aside like they are trash the second you are done with them because they may not be done with you or ready to let you leave.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nThis anime is great, great for one thing which I truly believe is its sole purpose of existence - opening pickle jars. This anime will help you with the opening of jars and various other tasks requiring brute strength. You'll feel like the Hulk after you've watched half the series. And the very reason for all of this is this anime's amazing ability to piss the viewer off like no other series I have ever seen. If you want to be angered, please, please watch this series. \r\nStory:\r\nJokes aside, this anime might be considered a decent series to other people, but Iseriously hated it. It started off fine, a few laughs, a somewhat interesting love triangle between Makoto, Katsura and Saionji, resulting in the typical 'idiot girl helps guy she loves to get another girl' thing. ... and hey, although the whole love triangle story wasn't very unique or anything, it entertained... It was fun at first to see this clueless pervert fail at getting a girl. The problem was when it became more of a love hexagon - And things went downhill from there.  The story became predictable and difficult to watch due to the idiotic and retarded main character who must have been the luckiest  sped to walk the earth. The only good thing I can say about this series was the theme it presented to its viewers: to cherish what you have. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in this anime are seriously some of the dumbest people I have ever seen. Makoto especially - after watching about 5 episodes I wanted to smash his face in. His idiotic expressions, his whiny sped voice, everything about him. I hated it all. I hated the way he looked, the way he talked, and everything he did. My hatred for this character is unparalleled to any other characters I might have ever hated in my life. The only props I can give to the people who dream t up this character was that we got to see him go from a selfish idiot to a selfish asshole by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThat rant out of the way, I don't have much to say bout the other characters which was mainly composed of idiotic girls that for some reason or another couldn't get enough of this whiny faced idiot. The characters in general, didn't have much of a background. We didn't learn much about them or their past, and they just kind of came and went. Again, my only props here is the character development.  1/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening sounded great, but it didn't really suit the series considering how dark and idiotic it became. The opening was way too happy in contrast to the story. Otherwise, bgm was decent, even good at times. No big comments here: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Character Design: I thought the animation and character design was pretty good, one of the series stronger points. All of the character designs although not unique, were nice, and the colors brought out the mood fairly well. The only character design I grew to hate was Makoto's. His round clueless face pissed me off to no end. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWhy this is even an anime series? I have no idea. Just turn this damn thing into a hentai or something. Honestly. The main character in this series has sex with pretty much every girl you'll see in this series, for no apparent reason. The girls are just lining up to be with him by the end. The characters are the most idiotic people I have ever seen, and the main character couldn't possibly be fathomed by a normal human being. 4/10",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nSchool Days Creator (SDC)- Hey man, I have a terrific idea for an anime series, based on this dirty animated game I've played!\r\nJapanese Executive (JE)-Okay, I love hentai!  Let's hear it.  \r\nSDC- Well, it's going to be about a guy who is a complete failure at life, an idiot loser who is intensely selfish.  He gets uncontrollably nervous talking to girls, and does nothing with his life. However, the twist is that every girl who meets him falls madly in love.  And he has sex with all of them.\r\nJE-What's his driving motivation?\r\nSDC-To fuck as many girls as possible,regardless of how many lies and betrayals necessary to get there.  \\n\r\nJE-Okay, but wouldn't the girls eventually catch on?  Even if at first they love him, wouldn't they dump him at some point?  I mean, realizing your girl or boyfriend sucks is and is a cheater is something MILLIONS of people in the real world go through.\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Well, that's true.  But I have just the plan to fix it; we'll make the girls equally odious and retarded.  They'll have some degree of human compassion, but along with that, a large dose of crazy and whore to them, as they gladly cheat with the boyfriend of one of their female friends!    \\n\r\nJE-  Oh!  You mean like my second ex-wife cheated on me with my former best friend?\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Yes, exactly!  One will be the reserved, kind-hearted girl named Katsura who, upon realizing her boyfriend is a cheater too cowardly to break up with her, becomes a catatonic, deranged puppet of a human being.  \\n\r\nJE-  Isn't that extreme?  I mean, if Katsura were a guy whose girlfriend was a cheating piece of shit, wouldn't going insane make the viewer hate such a character for an unnecessary, psychotic reaction, not sympathize with them?\\n\\n\r\nSDC- True, true.  We need the viewer to side with her, as no one else will be the least bit worthy of compassion.  That's why she'll be drawn very cute and sexy.  That's why we'll have every other girl in the series utterly despise her, even if there's no actual reason for them doing so.  That's why the other main character, Sekai, will betray and sleep with the main character Mokoto behind Katsura's back. \\n\\n\r\nSekai will at first seem sympathetic and even kind, helping Katsura and Mokoto to be together, but eventually, she'll turn selfish, soulless, and moronic, as she initiates make-out sessions with Mokoto while he's still dating Katsura.   \\n\\n\r\nThen, she'll be surprised that someone who cheated WITH her then starts cheating ON her.  Haha.  \\n\\n\r\nJE- Uh, okay....but what kind of a series is this?  You mention lots of moronic, pitiful girls sleeping with a moronic, pitiful guy, and betrayal and insanity.  What's the hook here, exactly?\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Ah, that's my master stroke!  School Days will, for most of its 12 episodes, be a straightforward romance series, but then, in the last episode or two, will turn gruesome and bloody.  \\n\r\nJE- But wait...isn't that just a cheap plot device to make up for how bankrupt the characters and the rest of the story are?  Isn't that just a shock tool to distract the viewer from the fact that they just watched a brainless romance series based on a hentai game?\\n\\n\r\nSDC- That's right!  But what we'll do is try to make it SEEM as deep as possible!  You know, like foreshadowing, great music random flashbacks, all that jazz.  Then, if people still criticize it, we can just say that they don't get the deep \"story\" and moral of the series.  \\n\r\nJE-  You mean it will be like a Dostoevsky novel, except with none of the actual logic, depth, or basically anything else redeemable about it?\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Exactly!  And one last brilliant idea!\\n\r\nJE-  Well, right now I'm still not convinced about the show, but go ahead.  \\n\\n\r\nSDC-  The series will double as a cell phone advertisement!  Everything will happen via cellphone, it will be a huge part of numerous plot devices and episodes, and we'll even have an ending theme prominently featuring one!  \\n\\n\r\nIf we can't get any more blatant, let's have one of the girls excitedly want to buy the latest brand of cellphone for herself and Makoto, for no apparent fucking reason. Hell, let's also have Chibi versions of the characters hawking oversized cellphones during the parts reserved for commercial breaks!\\n\r\nJE-....\\n\\n\r\nSDC-Well...\\n\r\nJE-Hmmm...\\n\\n\r\nSDC-....\\n\r\nJE- IT'S BRILLIANT!!!! UTTER GENIUS!!!!  LET'S GET IT DONE!!!!",

            "content": "\"I have touched the flower that everyone wants. The feelings for that flower, I have put into words. To hurt this world was not my intention. If there was no one there to question you, would that mean you could do anything?\"\r\nPreface: \r\nWell, today is Valentine's Day, so what better series to review than one of the most controversial love stories ever to be put in animated form? That's right, I'm talking School Days, one of the biggest cases of subverted expectations I've seen in recent days.\r\nOverview:\r\nOur story begins with two star crossed lovers, Makoto and Kotonoha (Katsura). Young love is so fragile, and sofleeting, and none know this better than our dear characters. Enter Sekai, third party, and friend to both.. What happens next is a rollercoaster of emotion (mostly fury), detachment, lies, betrayal, and sociopathy, right up to the very end, where the story of our Lovers comes full circle. When the truth comes out, Makoto, Kotonoha, and Sekai learn the full ramifications of the consequences they wrought. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3 (two points for eps 11, 12, one point for the rest of it)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are animated poorly, barring the last two episodes. Inconsistently drawn, poor facial and body animation, TONS of stillframe, key frames are few and far between. While there's not a lot of action, even the mundane slice of life is animated roughly. Uneven drawn edges, lack of faces or animation of faces during speaking, and generally repetitive environments (including a shot of the front of the school that\u2019s used about 352 times an episode). The attention to detail is decent, however. Some of the art is useful in the symbolism, (more on that below) such as the trains and certain details in houses, and the school. \\n\r\nOne recurring, and annoying, tendency of the art is when there's a pan and the image is rotated about 80 degrees to one side- rather irritating to have to turn your head to look at it.  \\n\r\nThe last two episodes are animated extremely well by comparison. Faces show real emotion, character movement and framing are much more purpose driven and subtle (something it was heretofore lacking a lot of, subtlety). \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4 \\n\\n\r\nOP and ED are fine, nothing to report. I started skipping the OP after about episode 4.\\n\r\nVoice acting is decent- not Trinity Seven, but also not absolute garbage. The main character\u2019s voices aren\u2019t particularly grating, but some of the supporting casts\u2019 are.\\n\r\nSoft piano music sets the tone in some dramatic and playful moments, nothing distracting, and nothing really enhancing. \\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Spoilers from here on---\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to give a point to this category for every character Makoto has meaningless, detached, sociopathic sex with, but decided against it.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto is our MC- selfish, uncaring, and a borderline sociopath- he exists only to indulge his own narcissism, regardless of who he affects or hurts. He seems absolutely callous to the feelings of the girls he comes into contact with, and the effect on their psyche. Incorrigible pervert, pushy, and clueless, he's a self gratifying user, and pure slime of a guy. He has no qualms about cheating on his girlfriend, or the irreversible effects that has on one's relationships, or even those of the future.\\n\\n\r\nThough there are some times where it appears his decisions have some measurable effect on his mental state, he always manages to follow up with something self serving and detestable, but, he's still human, and it shows in his times of weakness. He goes from being the object of many a lady's desire, to being an absolute pariah, and being hated by essentially everyone that he knows.\\n\\n\r\nKotonoha, the first girlfriend, is a repressed, timid girl who really gets mixed up in all of this. She's honestly the only character in the show I found sympathetic, because she didn't ask for any of what happens to her- to be lied to, betrayed, and repeatedly torn down, despite her headstrong (and later delusional) belief that Makoto is in love with her. She gets absolutely ragged on by every other female character in the show, even though she's the only one ever in the right by claiming to be Makoto's girlfriend. We see this poor girl experience an immense amount of emotional trauma- abuse from her 'friends', mistreatment at the hands of her so called lover, that it's no surprise that by the end of the show, her psychological state is significantly altered. What was once a kind, shy girl was rendered into a soulless husk, devoid of any life aside from her dissociative, misguided obsession over Makoto. The real love that she once felt became nothing but an empty shell. Symbolic, I think.\\n\\n\r\nSekai, our third 60 degree angle of this love triangle, sets herself up as a jealous and manipulative friend who only acts \"in the interest of helping Makoto get what he wants\". She uses his perverted nature to get close to him under the guise of helping him with \"special practice\" to understand girls so that he's able to finally hook up with the girl he's been crushing on. She is driven, and shrewd, and actually seems to genuinely care for Makoto, and ironically is the person who really sets things into motion with the infidelity, and is the origination of the problem though she never sees it that way herself. She, through her own machinations, sets Makoto up with herself, but at the same time plays him off on Kotonoha and triggers the boundary-less relationships that form the crux of the conflict within. The way that she turns on him later, with a classless and utterly selfish attempt to keep Makoto with her smacks of hypocrisy, juxtaposed to her earlier efforts, and reminded me of Makoto himself with the self seeking and ugly way it was presented.\\n\r\nIs she his girlfriend? Are they just friends with benefits? She has a clear answer, but Makoto seems to have different ideas about it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some other girls who make appearances, but side chicks and booty calls weren't important to the character, so I'll ignore them too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory and Overall: 6, 6\\n\\n\r\nHad I solely gone on word of mouth, reviews, and the score, I'd have never watched School Days, as I've heard nothing but terrible things about it, aside from the uniquely shocking conclusion, but I feel that \"School Days\" is a much more complex commentary on relationships and life than many other reviewers on this site, and elsewhere on the internet believe (OOO wow, dissenting opinions on the internet, who'da thunk?) \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, School Days is a deconstructivist take on the Harem genre. It shows a realist take on the idea of having multiple girlfriends and them all being okay with it, because no-one truly \"possesses\" the desired person. The idea that jealousy would never take over when someone has something that you long for is a novel one, but one that's ultimately flawed. School Days exhibits that we all possess jealousy and covetousness in some way, and that suspicion, deceit, and betrayal all play into it, RARELY with a favorable outcome.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show makes a STRONG case for monogamy and reinforces the ideas that fidelity and trust in relationships are necessary for them to be healthy and functional, I think it also examines the inner being of Makoto. Makoto is a character who doesn't know what he wants out of a relationship. It starts off innocent enough, the hugging and kissing, and quickly falls down a path to more and more pushiness, and an insatiable lust for what seems to just be dispassionate sex addiction. It delves into the psychological aspects of cheating in a relationship, and the every growing mountain of lies and deceit that one has to maintain to keep up the facade; and while Makoto is unable to do so, he sees his web of deception unravel before his eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAn ironic note: the name \"Makoto\" is explained in the beginning of the show to mean Faith. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSymbolism, Foreshadowing and Callbacks:\\n\\n\r\nI thought that School Days did an excellent job with the foreshadowing and symbolism. Having known the ending going into the show (but not who actually commits the act, and the Boat Scene was also unknown to me), I was on the lookout for subtlety, and was pleasantly surprised to find it. \\n\\n\r\n1. The movie theater and stage play scenes were particularly interesting. Within the first 3 episodes, we had the plot play out before our eyes in about 30 seconds, but in a meta way- the two girls in love with the guy, who then fight amongst each other, and decide that neither can have him. \\n\r\na) Setsuna goes to a stage production, and the dialogue is referential to the conflict at hand. (see opening quote)\\n\\n\r\n2. In episode 6, Kotonoha sees Makoto and Sekai together on a train passing by the station she's standing on. She believes it to be a mistake, and thinks nothing of it. Later, it's Sekai who's at the train station, who believes Makoto to be home, and sees Kotonoha with him on the train. \\n\\n\r\n3. Also in 6, at the moment Kotonoha reaches the rooftop, she drops her roll of blood-red yarn thread, which unravels as it rolls down the stairs. Symbolic, and important.\\n\\n\r\n4. Kotonoha is cooking in her kitchen, and her gaze lingers on the knives for a second.\\n\\n\r\n5. At the end, Makoto is making tea, which, as it comes to a boil (symbolizing his choices and the impending, extreme consequences they bring upon him) burns him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, and Conclusion: 6\\n\\n\r\nHigh school is just brutal guys, and the outcome is not always pretty- this is the heart of School Days. What we think is right is sometimes wrong, and even when we know it's wrong, sometimes we don't want to be right. An absolutely shocking and brutal conclusion to an otherwise wretched slice of life/ harem show left me speechless. It was a struggle to get through the first 7 episodes, but from 8 to the conclusion were a dark, tragic, and ultimately deserving series of events. Even as I write this, I have no words for the ending of this show, other than that I will not forget it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the question that's so hotly contested: is School Days the worst anime ever? \\n\r\nNo, but it depends on the viewer. There's a lot to hate about School Days, but if you have a taste for the psychological, and can stomach the first half, which is pretty painful and rage inducing to watch, it sets up a second half that gets deep into interpersonal relationship conflicts, and what extremes people can go to when they're irrational, because love... is irrational. The conclusion to this show was one that was remarkable at the time, and will be discussed from now on. A pioneer in the genre (yandere) as well- so it has some value in that.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: \\n\r\n+ justice is served in a twisted way\\n\r\n+ gets better past the halfway mark\\n\r\n+ dark, surprising conclusion\\n\\n\r\n- detestable characters\\n\r\n- side characters fall in love with main character for no reason\\n\r\n- garbage SOL plot *up through episode 7\\n\r\n- terrible dialogue at times\\n\r\n- bad animation\\n\\n\\n\r\nNothing says love like a journey with a beautiful girl on a yacht, floating off into the sunset--\\n\\n\r\nand then they were finally alone, \"just the two of them\".\\n\\n\r\nHappy Valentine's Day.\\n",

            "content": "A character that is not likable is not the same as a bad character. You wouldn't complain about the characters \"doing stupid things\" in Othello, would you? That's the point of a tragedy. Othello believed the lies about Desdemona because he was a flawed human being as Makoto cheated because he was a flawed human being. Things are not as simple as detractors make them seem and you can\u2019t expect a cast of deeply flawed characters to make smart decisions, like the detractors of the series supposedly would. \r\nWhere did we get this idea that a character must be likable and flawless to be agood character? Raskalnikov from Crime and Punishment is one of the greatest characters ever written and most people who read the book simply despise him. Any of you guys read the Flashman Papers? It was some of the best historical fiction ever written, but Flashman a worthless douche and was the epitome of an immoral picaresque protagonist. People don\u2019t hate the School Days characters because they are bad characters; they hate them because they are bad people and that simply makes no sense to me. They are fictional characters, you don't evaluate the quality of a fictional character the same way you would evaluate the moral quality of a human being.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMakoto was guilty of lust, but he was not entirely guilty of ignorance. He knew he was being an awful person, but he simply could not help himself. He was weak and eventually he stopped trying to fight his urges. He may be an awful person, he may be the \"worst,\" as he calls himself on several occasions, but his reactions to his situation were anything but unrealistic. When examining his character it should be kept in mind that all of the women who were awful manipulative people and were responsible for making him a female-impregnating manwhore, turned their collective back on him when he abandoned a pregnant girl. And hell, he's the father, is it that ridiculous for him to want her to have an abortion? Should a high schooler be expected to take that kind of news well? It is possible to have some amount of empathy for him as well, as it should be for any three dimensional and well-written character.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is somewhat dependent on its ending, but most series (particularly tragedies) are. To say that it was just a clich\u00e9 romance before the last episode, as I have oft heard claimed, is simply absurd. You should have realized that this anime wasn\u2019t a typical rom-com in the first episode where Makoto almost gets violent with Sekai over nothing. The infamous ending was the culmination of the rest of the series that was meticulously built up to, and while it was surprising, it certainly did not come out of nowhere in an otherwise normal anime. \\n\\n\r\nRather than being drawn out and ending with the couple getting together, like most harems, the relationships are established in episode 1. Most harems have an assumed happy-ever-after ending, but in School Days, just like in real life, things aren't always sunshines and rainbows. School Days deconstructs this idea and other tropes such as the \"matchmaker crush.\" There is also a fuckton of fanservice, like there is in most \"innocent\" romance anime. It's very impressive and entertaining how School Days gives you a set of things to expect (largely through more subtle means than typically thought) and then proves those expectations to be false, one by one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is not entirely realistic (which I\u2019ll discuss in a bit), but Makoto\u2019s character is actually relatively believable. If all the girls in school suddenly started coming on to a high school guy, he might just act the way Makoto did. Many other harem protagonists, such as Manaka from Ichigo 100%, are also selfish and generally bad people, but most harems attempt to paint the main character as the good guy. School days harbors no such delusions. Makoto is the protagonist, but we are certainly not rooting for him. In this sense it\u2019s a clever and scathing attack on the (mostly atrocious) harem genre.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it\u2019s not true that Makoto was completely worthless or a blank character. It\u2019s also not true that the girls fell in love with him out of nowhere. One girl fell in love with him because he was the first boy to ever stick up for her against bullies. One girl started sleeping with him because he accepted her when she felt unloved. One girl fell in love with him because he didn\u2019t make her feel self conscious and he wasn\u2019t just after her body like all other men. Three girls slept with him due to his impressive sexual reputation. These things all happen, they are explainable and believable. Every character has their own motives and is three-dimensional. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn most anime having/being a shy and pure girl is a good thing. In School Days, just like in real life, it is not that simple. Kotonoha\u2019s shyness makes her difficult to interact with and her prudishness is largely the reason why Makoto cheats. It\u2019s also the reason that she was too weak to just dump Makoto or confront him, which is why the whole debacle got as far as it did. School days makes it clear that her behavior is not normal or healthy and that it\u2019s a result of bullying and isolation. The fact that Kotonoha is an extreme version of an overused character archetype would normally be a flaw, but in \"School Days\" it\u2019s used to deconstruct said archetype and darkly explore what would make a character this way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother archetype that \u201cSchool Days\u201d deconstructs is the \"bromantic foil.\" You know, the perverted best friend who\u2019s just there for comic relief, has no development, and despite being a huge pervert, can never ever get laid. Well in school days the bromantic foil commits an unforgivable and undeniably realistic act against another character, in a fit of sexual frustration. \u201cSchool Days\u201d treats that archetype like a character that actually matters and has feelings, you know, like a real person. You might not like him, but he is a well written character who has a clear purpose and significance beyond comic relief. The alpha bitch bully is also deconstructed and is given clear motivations for her actions. She hooked up with the protagonist, which defeats the usual purpose of the trope, where the bully only exists to get fucked by karma. It's also interesting how she is overthrown as alpha bitch and her posse fucks Makoto behind her back; this could be considered karma for her bitchiness, but they ended up being even bitchier than her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile \u201cSchool Days\u201d is intentionally exaggerated and satirical in some aspects, it\u2019s actually darkly realistic in others. People do avoid ending relationships because it\u2019s too painful for them. People do refuse to take responsibility for getting a girl pregnant. People do fake pregnancy. These are things that happen all the time and to label them as \u201cmelodramatic\u201d or \u201cunrealistic\u201d is ridiculous. There are no incurable diseases in school days, no ridiculous coincidences, and no melodrama. Believability is stretched intentionally in several elements (a certain someone sleeping with Makoto to get him to stop cheating) of the story for satirical and deconstructive purposes, but the work remains realistic at its core. It balances satire and realism in the same way that great works like Candide do. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cSchool Days\u201d is a mixture between a clever deconstruction, a stunning tragedy, a realistic harem, and a somewhat comedic work of satire. The change in tone, foreshadowing, and build up to the incredible resolution were simply masterful. Watching all of the characters relations entropically crumble was a spectacle to behold. The characters and plot may not evoke positive emotions, but they do evoke emotion, as was their purpose, all the same. School Days was ultimately a shocking and memorable multifaceted experience that I enjoyed immensely and appreciated on multiple levels. The mediocre audiovisuals keep me from giving this anime a 9, but 8 is still a very good score. If you go in with an open mind I think you\u2019ll like it or, at the very least, appreciate it for what it is.\\n",

The sort that  that can view the suffering of fictional characters like a curious (or evil)  scientist who conducts social experiments on a bunch of unknowing test subjects (victims) with intense academic interest (while cackling madly).\r\nThe entire anime is essentially a social experiment taken to extremes. What happens if you take a horny teenage guy with little self-restraint, and give him the temptation of almost unlimited sex? What if you add into the mix a group of fangirls, who tend to always regard sleeping with the guy who sleeps with themost girls as a sign of social prestige?\\n\\n\r\nSchool days takes this scenero to its shocking conclusion... and in doing so, has created some of the most despised anime characters ever known. In this goal, School days succeeds brilliantly. The insert songs, ending themes are some of the best in any anime, the story's dark twists will eat at you, and the characters are capable of invoking the most primal emotions of hate and disgust.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not say that school days achieves that goal flawlessly. Animations were medicore, relying on more stills that it should. Meanwhile, the second to last episode that portrayed the protogonist final descent to oblivion was rushed. Had the director cut out the 5 wasted minutes devoted to blatant upskirt fanservice per episode and fleshed out the story development, I would have scored the story a 10. Nevertheless, despite the shortcomings, School days achieves what it aimed to do.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're the sort of person who wants to throw your notebook off the balcony whenever some guy on TV does something dumb or evil, this ain't the anime for you. However, if you're more the sort that want to watch the downfall of a community with morbid curiosity... then there's really no better anime for you.",

            "content": "Characters - The characters are ALL, ALL devoid of ANY logic. It is VERY clear that this anime started out as a visual novel. The characters are absolutely ridiculous. Almost nothing that they do makes sense. There is one character that you will feel empathy for, but only for a couple episodes. Very quickly this character turn into complete trash like the rest. Apparently every single girl in this show is insanely stupid. Girls in this show are portrayed to be walking sex dolls with JUST enough brain power to give consent to sex. The ONE THING that I will give to this show aboutthe characters is that the girl cliques seemed pretty accurate, barring the random \"herp derp, you know our best friend who we've been helping to get that guy that we've never talked to or met before? Let's all 3 of us go have a foursome and bang him\". Cheating is as common as breathing air in this story. Doesn't matter that you've went through half of the girls in your school, your only consequence will be hearing the phrase, \"Are you cheating on me? Promise me you won't do it again!\" x 100. Here's my favorite bits of \"logic\" from this show:\\n\\n\nI want you to stop cheating on my best friend! If you promise me you will, I'll let you cheat on her with me!\\n\\n\nI came here to talk you into talking to your girlfriend, but hey, let's bang.\\n\\n\nStory - \"Love triangle\" is putting it lightly. It's a love pyramid, with one guy at the top and his harem of women at the bottom. If I was reviewing some hentai visual novel, it'd make sense, but it doesn't fit well at all in this format. The story is literally a joke, and the person laughing is the writer, thinking to himself, \"I can't believe people actually liked this\". The ending of this show is so obvious, you'll see it coming way before it happens. What happens to the characters at the end would give you slight satisfaction if watched immediately after the first few episodes. However, by the time you actually see the end, it's too late to derive any enjoyment and wash away the horrible taste that this show has left in your mouth.\\n\\n\nComedy - You'll get a couple chuckles during the series. Although not enough to warrant watching it all. Most of the episodes in the second half are almost completely devoid of it. Sadly, the few laughs I had convinced me to continue watching the series. Big mistake.\\n\\n\nMusic - Can't really complain about the music. Nothing great, but nothing bad either.\\n\\n\\n\n1/10. Of all the manga I've read, anime I've seen, and visual novels I've played, I've NEVER thought of one so bad as to rate it 1/10, so you can imagine how it must be for me to rate it that. Save your time. You've been in non-existence for nearly 14 billion years. This is your once chance to fucking LIVE. Don't waste 4 hours on this pile of nonsense.",

If you drop this before watching the last episode, you'll be wasting your time watching this series.\r\nStory : It doesn't seem like the story was very well thought out at first (horny teenager in high school trying to get as much girls as he can).  The main character, Ito Makoto, is guaranteed to be the worst anime character you'll ever meet.  He's popular among the girls at his school because he seems/they think he's a nice guy (I have no idea what basis they havefor thinking this), but he's pretty much the devil in disguise.  He'll do everything to make the viewer hate him, from his perverted acts to his childish-like tendency to avoid responsibility.  Most of the people that come in contact with him will get screwed up emotionally/psychologically/physically, and the episodes will end with the viewer thinking, &quot;what's that guy going to do to screw up society now&quot; or maybe even &quot;I hope a lightning bolt comes down and strikes him&quot;.\\n\r\nThose that hate Makoto and are dropping the series because of him, don't.  The desired effect is to have you hate him, because divine retribution will eventually come.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Consistant animation and the artwork is exactly like that of the computer game.\\n\\n\r\nSound : The bgm's fit very well.  This show uses a different ending song every episode, some good some bad.  The opening song is mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : Everyone has issues (won't go into it in detail because of the no spoilers rule).  You wouldn't expect real high school students to act the way they do...though you wouldn't expect real high school students to be ensnared in a story this twisted.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : There are some scenes that are very hard to watch.  Most of them consists of Makoto doing something that's just horribly horribly wrong with the other characters unaware of it.  Also there are scenes where they show the effects of Makoto's actions on the female characters with Makoto, again, not taking any responsibility.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : To be frank, you will probably hate this show because of Makoto, since he is the biggest tool I've ever seen.  For those who like twisted dramas, this is the show for you.  I personally chose to finish this series because I really liked how they set up the cliffhangers, and I felt it was challenging me to continue (again, yes, Makoto's actions do make the show very very hard to watch).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the 95% of the people that watched this show that absolutely hates Makoto, you have to watch the last episode because it's incredibly well done (not for screamish people, parental discretion is advised, blah blah).  Depending on the type of person you are, you will either enjoy it (I know I did) or say it's absolutely twisted.",

            "content": "School Days the game was released a few years ago and it drew quite a bit of attention because of the fact that it was completely animated eroge.  In addition, a 30 minute non-interactive &lsquo;demo&rsquo; (it was basically the same thing as the first episode of the anime) was also subtitled when it came out.  Watching this &lsquo;demo&rsquo; gave me the impression that School Days had a very typical romance narrative.  Well a few weeks later I saw several gifs of the 3 infamous endings.  Like many, I when WTF!? and became excited when the anime was announced so I couldsee how such an ending would be possible.  Although, I though that they would animate one of the more normal endings.  Well thank goodness they didn&rsquo;t because the ending was the only thing that made this train wreck worth watching.  \\n\\n\r\nAt first School Days started off as a normal romance anime with your typical love triangle.  However, a few episodes in the reason why I kept watching was not normal.  I kept watching because I wanted to see what kind of messed up thing would happen next.  It was pure morbid curiosity the kept me going.  Sure there times I paused and started screaming at the idiocy but my morbid curiosity was too strong.  School Days transformed into a stereotypical soap opera...wait scratch that.  School Days transformed into a parody of a bad stereotypical soap opera.  The actions of the characters were so over-the-top, sexually driven that one cannot help but laugh (or scream) at the idiocy.  It was at this moment that I felt confident they would animate one of the bad endings.  Interestingly enough they didn&rsquo;t, instead the anime ending is on a level higher than the 3 bad endings combined in the game.  \\n\\n\r\nOnce again the only reason why anyone should watch School Days is for the awesome train wreck that it is School Days as well as the &lsquo;Nice Boat&rsquo; ending.  The animation was almost identical to the game, but for anime standards it was quite poor.  Art wise I guess it was ok, its saving grace was the fact that the school uniform mandates zettai ryouki.  This is something that all school uniforms should have!...ahem anyway...  Characters as mentioned above are complete idiots and the most mature/sensible ones are Kokoro (Kotonoha&rsquo;s little sister) and her friend.  They did do a good job with Makoto&rsquo;s character, by this I mean he was designed to be hated and you will be hard pressed to find anyone that likes Makoto.  In addition, this hatred is important in setting up the most important thing in School Days, the ending.  \\n\\n\r\nSo why should anyone watch this?  Well there are a few reasons.  First, just to see first hand what &lsquo;Nice Boat&rsquo; is all about.  If you watch 2 episodes and drop it, that&rsquo;s ok but if you watch more than 3 you must watch it all, else you will have wasted your time.  I believe that the primary purpose to animating this was to show/set up an ending far worst than that of the game.  In a way School Days can be considered one of the biggest fanservice anime titles out there.   Second, out of pure morbid curiosity, admittedly this was the reason why I started/kept watching.  That is until I was confident about a bad/bloody ending.",

            "content": "We are used to tragedies happening on the grand scale. Famous Shakespeare plays like Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth,  the accounts of Joan of Arc , and Oedipus Rex display this very well. Many times great tragedies are set in the past or fantasy worlds. But what would a tragedy that happens in our modern world be like? One that isn't on a grand scale. A tragedy grounded in reality, set in motion by everyday events, in which the worst crime that sparks it all involves cheating on others and not paying attention to people's feelings. This is what School Days attempts to showus. What we get in School Days is not sword play, epic battles, political intrigue, or anything of that sort. But we do have a sequence of events that ends up ruining the lives of all who are involved. We have love, romance, betrayal, and battles over the heart. This isn't much of a spoiler however, as only a few episodes into the series you can easily tell your heading down a dark and terrible path that cannot end happily for all. School Days is most definitely a contemporary school life tragedy if there ever was one.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days starts innocently enough, with Makoto Ito interesting in a girl who takes the same train to school every mourning that he does, Kotonoha Katsura. Makoto is a regular high school freshman, to shy to approach the girl he likes, and content enough just secretly admiring her. But when he hears the urban legend that if you take a picture of the girl you like, use it as the wallpaper of your cell phone, and no one notices for three weeks you will be able to go out with that person. He figures he has nothing to lose, so sneaks a picture of the girl and uses it as his wallpaper. But when a female classmate, Sekai Saionji who sits next to him, notices his phone's wallpaper, she realizes he has a crush on Kotonoha, so she plans to become their \"matchmaker\" and get the two together. Surpringly enough Kotonoha had also has noticed Makoto and developed a bit of a crush on him. So Sekai succeeds in getting the two lovebirds together. But later, when Makoto asks Sekai what he can do to thank her, she steals a kiss from him and says that's payment enough. It seems Sekai may have developed a bit of a crush on Makoto as well. It makes sense since the two were hanging out a lot lately. The real problem here, is perhaps Makoto also has feelings for her. The three become friends, and in due time a love triangle develops. The series involves lots of kissing, making out, and eventually lots of people having lots of sex. In fact I can't remember the last show that displayed this much sex, especially considering the age of these characters (what are they all 15?). Although none of the sex is graphically displayed, this does help give the show a bit of an edge. Top that off with themes of betrayal, revenge, loss of innocence, using others, ignoring others feelings, the meaning of friendship, and love vs lust, and you can see this isn't exactly a show for the kiddies. Actually it's quite a mature show that's much deeper then you would think. Besides brining up the issues of teenage sexuality (and everything that goes along with it), the show shows us exactly what happens when you ignore others feelings, play with people, and use people. It shows us what effects our actions have on others, and what that causes others to eventually do. And it does all this without once letting us hear the inner thoughts of any of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is a depiction of what would really happen if the type of romance often shown in harem anime series were to be brought to the real world. This is the real life verson of a harem, because you can sure bet if a harem were real it would not be all sunshines and rainbows, probally something more like this. In real life the girls would not be happy about their man being interested in another women. And the guy could not be shown in good light, if he's basically cheating on his girlfriend back and forth. He could not be a good person, if he's in a relationship like this. And the series is not afraid to show that. As the story goes on many other girls get involved, and many are practiclly throwing themselves at Makoto. This leaves me wondering where these girls were when I was in high school. And as contrived as it is, it does work. And you will have to be a little forgiving, as this series is attempting to dissect the harem genre. The anime is also a deconstruction piece, attempting to brake down the romance/slice of life/h-game adaptation genres. This is quite a goal, and on the large it does succeed. There are some small contrivances of course that will have to be over looked (a \"rest room/lounge\" for couples to mess around in during the school festival is pushing it a little), but over all it does not come off as too unrealistic and it is successful on turning the harem genre on it's head, inside out, and corrupting it to hell. This is quite a feat.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters of this anime, I can imagine there will be many out there who won't be able to stomach them. And for good reason, most of the cast is either annoying, terrible people, or a combination of the two. So why watch it? Well for one the story is really good. It's well written and decently paced, and has more then enough twists for most viewers. It's a really addictive show from start to finish. It's something new that you probably haven't seen before, and fans of the genre of drama will eat this up. It offers a great twist on stories we've all seen, and it's cynical nature is more then fascinating. But this series is truly for those who can appreciate realistic characters. And I for one loved the way this series handled it's characters. None of them are heroes, or unrealistic teenagers always happy go lucky, or something. Instead they are life like characters, many who may hit far to close to home to some. They are all very flawed, and have real life problems, goals, anxieties, feelings, self-doubts, and fears. And a lot of them make some really terrible mistakes. If you don't like watching people make a lot of mistakes the show might not be for you. And over the course of the show a few of the characters will do what seem like truly despicable and stupid things. However we must not judge them too harshly. For they do not have the birds eye view of events that we do. They are caught up in the moment, and unable to see what those around them are thinking and feeling. And the most important reason we should not be to tough on them, is because their mistakes are our mistakes. Sure it's easy to point out when these characters are being jerks, or selfish or stupid when your watching the show. But will you be able to tell when your doing similar things? While many will become aggravated by many of the characters, and truly learn to despise them, by the end of all this I mostly feel sorry for all of them. I'm sure the part of the intent of the series was to make you dislike some characters, and get bothered by them, and it does seem to succede. But when all is said and done, I can't help but feel sorry for everyone involved, even the characters many seem to really hate. Sure I am bothered by them, but in the end they were all truly human. They all have some redeeming qualities, and none are truly monsters. However the same goes for the other side of the equation. Very few if any of the characters are truly innocent, or entirely good people. And that's very interesting. This series is brilliant in it's abilities to evoke such emotions as hate, anger, and disgust. And it will really surprise you at times. Rather then being apathetic about these characters, we care. At least we care one way, or the other. We may not love them, but we have a feeling about them. And that is very important for me while watching a series. If I have no feeling toward any of the characters then I ask what is the point in the end?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very well written, and uses drama and suspense perfectly. The story starts off like any other light hearted romance, but by the end your left just staring at the screen, freaked out by what you have just witnessed. By the end you will be asking the same question Sekai poses in one of the last scenes, \"Why?! How did this happen?\". How indeed. Because looking back at the first few episodes, it's impossible to see this type of conclusion. Even with the noise about the ending, even with the signs it's taking a dark turn, one could not foresee this ending. And what an ending it is. Perfect in every way. The last few episodes are thrilling, and involve a few twists you will not see coming. And while the ending is very sad, and very screwed up on all levels, it is more then satisfying, and that's good enough for me. This series will have you hooked from the more lighthearted and more innocent beginnings, to the bone chilling conclusion. The series also has some of the best use of comedy relief I've seen in an anime in a long time. Many anime series seem to get this wrong, at least for my tastes anyway. But School Days knows when to have the class president hit a character in the head while sliding down a water slide, or have a funny \"class fight\" during the school festival that will have you cracking up. While largely a dark drama, the slight use of comedy relief at the right times really helps prevent the series from becoming too bleak.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things we have a mixed bag. On one hand the animation is not up to par with current anime TV series. While not outright terrible, it is mediocre at best. The series uses a lot of stills, pannings, and shortcuts in order to tell it's story. While not exactly distracting, it won't be winning any awards either. Some scenes do not at all flow well, and others have characters all moving at the same time in the same way, giving off a very robot like feeling. This easiest to see when a character enters a room, and all the others turn and face them. They all turn at the same time, and it's all very stiff. There are times when the animation is good, especially in the beginning and the episodes toward the ending. But seeing how this series is mostly talking, walking, making out, and having sex (lots of sex), I think they could have done much better. As far as the art goes however, I thought it was great. The character designs are what drew me to the series in the first place. they have this \"rounded\" feeling to them, that really makes them look a little different then your regular characters, but not too different as to take away from the main point of dissecting common anime genres. One small problem was how a few of the characters looked a little too much like each other, and in the begining it was a little hard to tell who was who. But after an episode or two I quickly got used to it. The color palette used is another strong point of the series. Lots of blues, pales, greys, and blacks are used, and it all looks quite nice. The series has this distinct look about it that I just love. The backgrounds are all good, but nothing to write home about. Although I did really enjoyed the many of the characters' rooms, the location right outside Makoto's house, and of course the \"nice boat\" scenery. The music however is in a word, perfect. I wouldn't change a damn thing about it. The opening theme may be a little too happy for some, but just like the opening theme to Shadow Star Narutaru , another deconstruction piece, it works to it's advantage. The multiple ending themes are all really great songs, although if I must pick a favorite it would be the endings of episodes three and eleven which use the song \"Waltz\", by Kanako Ito. This series also has a handful of excellent insert songs, all which add the mood perfectly. The right song is used to enhance this scene or that one, and some of them really help to add to the drama, or the suspense (towards the end of the series). Perhaps the best insert song is \"To the Other Side of Sadness\" by Kanako Ito, which I just can't stop listening to. It's used during one of the most important scenes in the series, and it really makes that scene. I have not heard any other series were Kaoru Okubo was in charge of the music, but I sure hope to in the future. Okubo really impressed me with the soundtrack in this, from great background themes, to amazing insert songs, and great openings and endings, nothing is off. I must have more!\\n\\n\r\nThere will be many out there who hate this series. And that is perfectly all right. This is not a show for everyone. They will find it's soup-opera-ish plot ridiculous and it's characters despicable, and will be bothered greatly by this show. But for those who can enjoy a good drama, one were the characters are realistic and flawed, this is the show for them. If you can deal with characters that you may dislike or even grow to hate, this is the show for you. Because the plot is so well written, and the show is so good, I think most will enjoy this. I normally would not review a series not licensed, since I usually only watch DVD's anyway. But once in awhile I check out a legal streaming show or two, and this was one of them. I watched the shows entire 12 episodes in two sittings, something I've never done before. I usually take weeks to watch even the shortest of series, so that speaks volumes for how much I enjoyed this series. I am not big on watching a show subtitled, but this show managed to entertain me the entire time. It impressed me so much I just had to review it. So if you think it may make such an impression on you, be sure to check it out. It's currently streaming on Crunchyroll, legally and for free. Now let's hope this great show gets licensed so I can watch it on my big screen TV with a great dub.\\n\\n\r\n- Review copyed from my personal blog\\n\r\n- Original review posted at: http://predeanimereview.blogspot.com/2009/11/school-days.html\\n\\n",

            "content": "A pitfall for many shows that attempt to be dark and mature is that they often mistaken edginess for depth. They present dark world views, display acts of immorality and cruelty, all under the misconception that they are laying bare some dark truth of the world. For an example, look no further than this infamous 12 episode anime series. School Days is the perfect picture of a show that confuses sadism for pessimistic insight. This is a show that is thoroughly patience testing in its sheer unpleasantness; saved from the bottom of the barrel only by the karmic bite of its conclusion. While its ambition(to put a dark twist on teenage romance) is quite an interesting one, the show sacrifices human dignity and decency in its attempt to shock us, and becomes too mean-spirited to stand with any sort of validity.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days starts simply enough, like all high school romance shows, with a crush. High school student Makoto Itou has a crush on Kotonoha Katsura, a pretty but quite girl from another class. He's had his eye on her for some time, but is unsure of how to approach her. That is until the girl that sits next to him in class, Sekai Saonji, finds out about his crush and decides to help him. After some effort, they succeed, and Makoto and Kotonoha start a timid relationship; while Sekai hides the feelings she has developed for Makoto. Problems begin to emerge when Makoto wants to take the next big step in their relationship, namely having sex, but Kotonoha is less comfortable with rushing things. Makoto looks to Sekai for help, and after some convincing by Makoto the two begin to participate in \"practice sessions\". Thus, School Days simple romance turns into a profoundly screwed up tale of infidelity, which might have been compelling if it was handled with the maturity and delicacy such a story requires. Alas, this isn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest and most apparent problem is the characters. The thoroughly unlikeable, usually flat-out despicable characters. Makoto is simply a terrible protagonist. At first he seems like a completely generic rom-com male lead, then as the story continues, he turns into an irredeemable sex-crazed sleaze. His development is essentially like watching plain yogurt become moldy spoiled yogurt. As the series progresses, Makoto spouts lie after lie while completely disregarding the feelings of everyone around him, especially his supposed love interests. When he gets tired of Kotonoha, he avoids and ignores her while starting a sexual relation with Sekai. When he gets tired of Sekai, he moves on to having sex with every girl he comes into contact with, including Sekai's BFF, Setsuna. Any momentary kindness he displays feels like a forced attempt to make him sympathetic, which fails because he is a loathsome little worm. Makoto is such a profound scuzzbad, and his actions so despicable and far removed from what a feeling human being would do; it becomes impossible to empathize with him. It becomes impossible to feel anything other than boiling rage toward him. This might have been the show's intent, but it hardly excuses the mean-spirited lengths the show goes to, and it certainly isn't good characterization. Makoto is one-dimensional scum, and for the show to try to pass him off as an average teenage boy who is misguided because of sexual desires is outright insulting.\\n\\n\r\nSekai, for her part, is just as despicable in her own two-faced way. She's often shown feeling guilty about having sex with Makoto while he is in a relationship, yet she continues to do so because she's in \"love\" with him. She even lets people incorrectly think that she's his girlfriend at one point, and lets Setsuna harass Kotonoha about being around Makoto. This is a character that the show expects us to sympathize for. Kotonoha is easily the most sympathetic of the three leads, but doesn't make her likeable, nor does it make her a well written character. She's just the nice, timid girl... until she loses her mind. The stress and paranoia from her strained relationship drives Kotonoha insane in almost comedic fashion; by mid-series she's walking around dead-eyed and delusional, having imaginary phone conversations. Both girls are very unflattering depictions of their gender, each in their own way. However, both share the most undignified of characteristics: their obsessive and unhealthy love for Makoto.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this might have not happened if every other girl in the show wasn't a bitch to Kotonoha. Majority of the supporting cast, which mainly consists of girls, are there to be horrible to Kotonoha or have sex with Makoto... or (most likely ) both. Even the only guy in the show besides Makoto is a horn-dog who only makes things worse. Herein lies the reason School Days twisted drama doesn't work, none of these characters feel like people, let alone high school students. They are nothing more than mean-spirited caricatures; driven only by an obsession with sex and shallow feelings they take for love, and devoid of any of the other passions or anxieties that people would have at that age. This robs the show of any potential poignancy; since all these characters are lacking humanity, there isn't anything to relate with or sympathize for. All that is left is a mess of unpleasantness.\\n\\n\r\nStill, that isn't to say there is no reward for those who have the patience to sit through this unpleasantness. School Days concludes with a violent flash of karma. I'll restrain myself from giving away any details (though I'm sure most already know what happens), but suffice to say that it is satisfying to watch characters get some well deserved comeuppance. It isn't really enough to forgive all the anger inducing smut that came before, but does enough to qualify it as a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy watching miserable excuses for people learn that karma is a bitch... the hard way. (i.e. me)\\n\\n\r\nVisually, School Days looks like most visual novel adaptations. Character designs with big eyes and cute faces, wearing neat school uniforms. Backgrounds that comprise of the usual class rooms, apartments, rooftops and cityscapes. This isn't of any surprise as the show is adapted from a visual novel, and attempts to be a deconstruction of sorts for the genre. The music is also reminiscent of most visual novel adaptations, though some tracks are a bit more focused on evoking shock or dread. Unfortunately, it isn't all that effective nor well composed; it almost feels just tacked on to some scenes. Sometimes it is unnoticeable, other times distracting. The inset song that plays at the climactic scene in the final episode is oddly fitting and certainly memorable, though the latter might just be because the scene it is featured in.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is a failed attempt at a dark subversion of school romance dramas. Sure, it took dark shocking twists that turn some tropes of the genre on their heads, but ultimately it was all for naught. In all its effort to shock and offend us, the show throws out any notions of human decency and consequently gives us almost nothing to connect to. As a result, it comes across as extremely juvenile; something a disgruntled teenager who has no idea what he is talking about would write and claim as a deconstruction of the romance genre. It is a vile, horribly convinced, poorly written monstrosity. It must be said, however, that School Days isn't something easily forgotten. It's the kind of bad that will linger in your head long after you finish it. At the very least, the ending will most certainly be burned into your mind.",

            "content": "Welcome to the world where you have a nice little harem with you in it, what would you do? Would you preserve the status quo to maintain it? Or rather choose one girl out of the rest? Or screw it up completely? Unfortunately for little Itou here, he chose the latter one, and hell did he screw up, big time.\r\nNow, notice the lack of the \"Comedy\" genre that you should be expecting in a school harem.\r\nLet me tell you a few things too, the description here is way too optimistic for this anime. The genre bar is also lacking too. If you're here expecting aHappy-Land ending, I am happy to tell you that you're in for a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nDon't mess with emotions, kids.\\n\\n\r\nI stumbled upon in this anime after a friend recommended this to me. He told me it is one of those animes that will end in a pleasing boat ride. I took it in as a metaphor and I could not have been more wrong. The boat ride part was right, but I'm not so sure about the \"pleasing\" part.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the description and the genres, I thought it was your average run-in-the-mill harem anime where the Happy-Happy land forms and where the skies of rainbows and sunshine hit the ground.\\n\\n\r\nBut as I continued to watch this anime, there was something a bit off. Usually there is the problem-resolve stuff in regular harems where a problem would pop up and the Protagonist will fix it and so forth, but problems here seemed like it wasn't solved\u2014to be exact, it became a much bigger problem instead.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this guy was pouring gasoline to a stack of wood on which he already threw a lit matchstick to.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know if you should call this guy a Protagonist, an Anarchist seems to be a better definition of this guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Protagonist is a brute, I found that word very fitting for his character. If you expected clean relationships in this anime like in any other harems, you are not going to like where this one goes. This guy is a polygynic freak and very unsympathetic. Beside him are girls that would do everything after some pathetic smooth-talking from him. This really pissed me off.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I continued watching this anime is because I had the intuition that this guy was going to meet his demise. I was not disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that truly displays what happens if you bring the human emotions to a very unstable variable. \\n\\n\r\nIf you stopped watching this anime mid-way, you don't know what you're missing on.\\n\\n\r\n//Spoiler Alert \\n\\n\r\nThe last 10 minutes of the last episode had to be the only thing I found amusing so far in the series. A cold-blooded murder from a person he once knew. As a person that likes watching Crime Investigation and such, I felt kind of awkwardly content to what happened. Murder may be illegal and such, but this guy should be an exemption because he the personification of insanity at its essence.\\n\\n\r\n//Spoiler End\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it up. This is an anime horror disguised as a seemingly innocent show. For those sick of Good Endings. I don't know where else you could find a jewel as shiny as this. If you like animes where things take an unexpected (in this case, VERY unexpected) turn. I would presume that you will like this one.\\n\\n\r\nThis was absolutely one of the most astonishing animes I have ever watched. I encourage you to watch this not because of the hyped ending, but to show how emotions and bad decisions can have a disastrous effect not only in the 2D world, but also in real life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: What can I say about the storyline? It has its up's and downs as well as its \"WTF\" and \"...\". I can already see the creator of School Days trying to portray an image to the viewers that this is typically a normal life of a teenager would lead, but forgetting that not every teenager leads this type of life. Getting deeper into this, I would say the moral of this story goes beyond your ordinary imagination of ecchi and romance. All I can say is, prepare yourself for a story like no other, a story that even sometimes exist in reality and thatthings like this can happen. From emotions to physical pain, happiness, WTF moments and moments where not even a word can express what this anime is about. It's all for the.. you know what? I'm just going too 'cheat' my way through this review. Haha.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm not one to judge on the art, but sometimes I have a hard time picking out who's who. That is if you are looking specifically at the eyes! The art is on a level that isn't medium, neither low. It's something good enough to get you through the dreading 12 episodes. Aside from the ecchi, the art is well drawn for a kid who's taking anime art class!\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say about sound, but there is a few songs that were thrown into the anime that caught my attention. I believe because of that, I actually didn't move my hand to the mouse to skip some of the parts that made me angry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Okay! Aside from all the whores, sluts and the main character. I gave this score a two for ONE good reason. If you are reading this review before you start watching it, I suggest you keep your focus on Kotonoha Katsura. She is sweet, innocent, shy, new to relationships and very what's that word. Hm, figure it out yourself when you watch it. Katsura, deserve a +1 in my case, else wise I would of gave each and every character a 1 (too bad they don't have 0's). The characters each played a special role and possibly at one point, I felt the same way one of them felt. Trying to relate was something I did with each and every one of the character, sadly. It did not work out. They are all emotional and selfish! Like really now. From what I believe the creator of School Days, took love and just tossed it around like it was a volleyball thus creating a crazy atmosphere of insanely robotic girls wanting to kill and sex the next guy. Haha, do you believe me?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: PATHETIC. IF YOU WANT TO BE ANGRY THEN THIS IS THE ANIME YOU WANT TO WATCH! Don't miss out on a chance to call each and every character, BAKA!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I want my 12 x 30 = ?? time back. Thank you, no extra charge.",

            "content": "You ever cut your eyes out with a butter knife? Well, you will know the experience once you watch School Days. I was on the verge of just staying in my room for a couple days and not even feeding myself. Yes, this anime was THAT bad. Now by bad, I mean something other than the traditional \"shitty\" or \"garbage\" most people are familiar with. I mean, it's just so god awful that it left a sour taste in my mouth. I will expand more on this feeling and provide you with a somewhat accurate portaryal of this steaming piece of doodoo.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is verysimple to begin with, but then become very \"unwatchable\". It follows the school life of some guy (I don't give a flying ass about his name) and his relationship with two girls. There is a loudmouthed overspoken girl, Sekai, and the shy, quiet girl, Kotonoha. The guy originally liked Kotonoha but then like most guys, he becomes sex deprived from this shy girl and decides to screw the other girl for \"practice\". Blah blah blah, a few boring sex scenes later, a problem arises. This loser guy is now a horndog with no consideration for women's feelings. I'm not gonna ruin this marvelous (bullshit) ending for you, but it is very, um, intriguing. (You ever hear of the famous boat scene? Yeah, there's a reason why it's so popular.)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was ok to look at. It wasn't outstanding or new, it had the art most animes follow nowadays. There wasn't much physical action or movement in this anime, save the ending, so it was near impossible for the animation to fail. The art was probably the only thing I didn't puke at in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe BGM felt very monotonous and I skipped the ending and opening so I don't have a deep opinion here. However, I must say the music during the final scenes were quite nice. It really let the series climax. (haha climax. Get it? I used a sexual joke for a sexual anime!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFuck you. No, not you. Fuck the characters. If I could meet the characters in real life, I would murder each one for the sake of my own sanity. Well, the guy's friend was kind of funny. He was horny too, but he didn't go overboard and he provided some comic relief. Anyway, back to my thoughts for the main characters. I would chop off the main guy's weiner for his overhorniness and complete disregard for women's emotions. I would stab Sekai with a trench knife for her overall attitude and lies. Then for Kotonoha, I would give her a cookie filled with cyanide and my dog's diarhhea dump. I will NOT describe these characters any further. Let me warn you. You will hate these characters so much, that you will end up hating yourself. Oooh philosophical. School Days suck sweaty asshole, Confucius say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n*Snicker*\\n\\n\r\nContrary to my review, go ahead and watch this series. Cmon, you know you want to. I ended up watching this anime through peer pressure, and even though I wanted to cut myself, it did teach me some valuable lessons about womanizers and pimps. It's worth a watch, even though you will hate me and yourself for it. I don't think you can really say you watched \"everything\" until you watched an amazing frustrating anime like School Days. Go watch it please.\\n\\n\r\nCheers, you poor bastards.\\n\\n",

However, at the beginning of his second term, he falls in love with a beautiful girl that also rides the train. Unfortunately, she barely knows of his existence. Her name is Kotonoha Katsura, and though they attend the same school, they are not in the same class. In an attempt to catch her eye, Makoto enlists the aid of a close female friend of his: Sekai Saionji.She helps him, despite the fact that she--unbeknownst to Makoto--is in love with him. Thus the three are bound in a love triangle of life changing proportions.\\n\r\n(Source: ANN)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nWhen everything was done after the 12th episode.... I stared at my computer screen for a good minute. COMPLETLY speechless.\\n\r\nWhen they said that the ending was messed up.. they weren't joking... This is as messed up as you can get. So what'd I think on the whole?\\n\r\nWatching episode 1 through 6, is much like trying to swallow a box of nails.  It's filled with fan-service shots that made me want to puke, characters whom i wanted throw bricks at, and a story that seemed to be written by a middle school girl.  But if you can stomach those episodes... you're home free.\\n\r\nEpisodes 7 to 11 are a lot more engaging.  While not a whole lot better, there was definitely enough in there in which I could keep watching because I felt like it.  The character interactions are what shines in this part of the series and some of the previous characters that you learn to hate... come back w/ sympathetic qualities.\\n\\n\r\nBut if we're talking about School Days here... It's ALL about the ending.  INCREDIBLY controversial... and something more suited for Higurashi.  That being said... I loved it.  The music created incredible tension and when hell broke lose... my heart was racing.  Did it fit this anime? I don't know... but it sure as hell was memorable. That was a NICE BOAT...\\n\\n\r\nSo overall...\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-6 = 3.5/10\\n\r\nEpisodes 7-11 = 7/10\\n\r\nEpisode 12 = 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLeaving the final rating of\\n\r\n7/10 (though more 6.5)\\n\\n\r\nSimilar To...\\n\r\n- Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni\\n\r\nOnly the ending is comparable to Higurashi",

            "content": "This review WILL contain spoilers.\r\nWhen I first got into School Days, I didn' know what I was getting myself into. I had heard about it, by people who either loved it or hated it. So I didn't know what to expect from it.\r\n2 years later, I still don't know exactly what I watched.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe premise of School Days is simple; boy falls in love with girl but he doesn't exactly know how to approache her, so he gets help from another girl to get them together. Pretty innocent, right? Sure, I thought the same thing, a cute couple with a change of love blooming. Thingis, this is where things start to get out of control. He soon starts fooling around with other women, sleeping around with any girl who seems interested enough, basically saying \"f*ck you\" to everyone and the viewer. So I'm supposed to support this guy...? It's this out of the blue BS that gets thrown to your face, attepting to surprise to viewer.\\n\\n\r\nI know it's regarded as  \"psychological\", and that \"it's not supposed to be perfect because love's not perfect\" blah, blah. I didn't see it. I only saw sh*tty decisions made by sh*tty characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reedeming thing about it, if I'd had to say, it's probably it's infamous endind that, if you haven't seen or even heard about, I won't spoil it for you. It's almost majestic. Just gonna say \"nice boat.\" Yup.\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nIt's a hit or miss. It's neither good or bad. I've seen worse. Some scenes look nice and others look dreadful. Okay-ish animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nAgain, hit or miss. Some of the voice actors sound horrible, i.e Sekai. Soundtrack is eh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, the characters are the main reason I have such hatred towards this anime. Makoto f*cking Ito is probably the most pathetic, disgusting character I've ever had the misfortune of laying my eyes in. He has absolutely no godamn respect towards ANY of the characters he interacts (aka f*cks around with), is a selfish individual, and plays the victim when blamed for something. He has absolutely no personality whatsoever, he's basically a cardboardbox. Except not, because even cardboardboxes are more useful than him.\\n\\n\r\n \"Oh, no, yeah he's a unlikeable character, but that doesn't make him a bad character!\" Yes, it does. He's a disgusting character, he's not \"deeply messed up, such emo, much need for the v\" no, he's simply disgusting. Get over it.\\n\\n\r\nAny other characters (which is 99% females, seriously, there's only two guys counting Makoto is this school, what the flying f*ck happened to the male population) are bland, maybe with the exception of Kotonoha, because seriously, I felt bad most of the time for her. The others were either sluts he slept with or unimportant characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nNo. No, no, no. Most of the time I was facepalming at the stupidity of the whole situation and how low life Makoto was. I was enraged, just hoping for the episodes to end so I could just get it over with. The only thing that brought me joy was the ending. I burst out laughing. It was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nI hear that the visual novels are better. Can't confirm, since I never played them nor do I plan to. But this is by far the worst thing I ever had to sit through, and I would not recommend to anyone. Really. It's a waste of time.",

            "content": "AUTHORS NOTE (23/1/14): Near the end of the review, there is a spoiler regarding the final episode. I urge you to watch the series before reading the review or -- if you aren't interested in the series/have dropped it -- read it if you so desire.\r\nDon\u2019t be fooled this anime\u2019s poster: it\u2019s not all happy girls and good times. School Days is the adaption of a visual novel with the same name, infamous for its brutal bad endings. A notably absent genre this should be categorised is psychological \u2013 it shows the worst of human desire in a twelve episode, slow-paced fashion which is eithera make or break depending on taste and overall dedication to observe when the plot actually moves forward. School Days is a satirical take on the harem genre as a whole, taking on the realistic approach when it comes to the genre deciding that the main character will inevitably get every woman he\u2019s ever interacted with. In reality, this is not the case and School Days explicitly shows the consequences of wanting too much and giving next to nothing in return.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s why everyone should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m serious \u2013 no other anime can replicate the emotions that School Days is capable of, one of which is mainly pure anger. It\u2019s possible to feel emotionally attached to a number of the characters, though in the end it\u2019s realised that their actions have been brought upon due to lust, a factor that would\u2019ve cementing School Days into pornographic territory if not of the actual plot and character development. It starts off cheerfully and as it goes on, the temper of the audience will rise to the point of smashing their television or computer in disgust due to the characters\u2019 actions. They say school is one of the most beneficially periods in a person\u2019s life: School Days shows the exact opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot follows token male harem protagonist Itou Makoto who develops a crush on a girl \u2013 Kotonoha \u2013 whom he observes on the bus every day with lustful eyes or at least, eyes of affection. It\u2019s Makato\u2019s first year at High School and he\u2019s seated next to Sekai, another girl in which e feels no affection for yet is as outgoing as a celebrity. Sekai finds out that our token protagonist is in love with Kotonoha and decides to become her friend in order to obtain information about her so Makato will actually know something about her and not stare at her body endlessly. Sekai and Kotonoha do legitimately become friends, with Makato later confessing to Kotonoha ending the first episode with them being a couple. Makoto tries to thank Sekai for her effort and there\u2019s only one thing Sekai will take for a reward: a kiss.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all in the first episode \u2013 a fast pace never seen again.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps \u2018protagonist\u2019 isn\u2019t a word well-suited for Makoto as his main objective is to bang anything that shows the slightest sense of movement. The main factor that attributes to the anger School Days supplies is the main character. Itou Makoto is not a role model. He\u2019s not someone to aspire to and he\u2019s not someone you\u2019d like to know unless you\u2019d want to have a fleeting orgasm with. He\u2019s a relentless hormonal machine similar to the Terminator \u2013 he\u2019d bang everyone until he has a nice glass of brandy before banging the actual target. Itou Makoto is perhaps the perfect definition of \u201cthe worse\u201d, a complete knob of a ridiculously high caliber and yet is the basis for any viewer of the male gender who would like nothing else to be the Terminator of sex.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the side-characters aren\u2019t much better. Sekai is everything that Makoto desires that Kotonoha isn\u2019t or in better terms, won\u2019t perform. Being as horny as a rabbit, Makoto\u2019s quest for seemingly endless sex doesn\u2019t start at Kotonoha, but at Sekai after a couple of episodes in that cement Makoto\u2019s douchebaggery. By the end of the third episode, he finally decides that he\u2019s sick of her due to not being entitled to sex after a period of time. Not taking it steady is Makoto\u2019s bread and butter, as in he just wants to spread his butter all over his seemingly endless bread \u2013 wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Perhaps it\u2019s because every other side character has a vagina and the only other character that has a knob doesn\u2019t supply any moral support and would be just horny as our main character. We don\u2019t really get to know the other side characters that the Sexinator bangs very well, which is a shame because they\u2019re all part of an indecisive wanker\u2019s sexual quest of glory. They actually have motives, unlike our lovable cyborg sex maniac so that\u2019s a big plus in their court.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps something else that brings School Days down is the rather unappealing art style. The characters don\u2019t seem very attractive, especially the female characters. This is an oddity considering the harem genre that School Days deconstructs over the course of the series, however this has lead me to believe that it was entirely on purpose \u2013 what does Makoto see in all of the girls over the course of the series? He decides to pound every woman he comes in contact with and even falls in love several times, yet there is seemingly nothing that contributes to his sudden attraction or at least his hormones being set a full throttle. Being based off a visual novel, it\u2019s not really unexpected for School Days\u2019 lacklustre art as it\u2019s practically ripped from the game itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother gripe to be had with the anime is its slow pace.  The finale felt like an eternity to reach, as nothing much happens \u2013 or at least, that\u2019s what it seems to be with Makoto going back and forth as he\u2019s just as indecisive as any other harem protagonist. It emulates what it\u2019s actually like to be in school: nothing happens for a while and any drama that occurs may pace itself out to the point of wanting to reach the end as fast as possible. However, when it gets to the finale, everyone will scream for joy and it remains as one of the greatest endings in the history of anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it deserves a paragraph of its own. So, spoilers ahead!\\n\\n\r\nIn the final episode of School Days, everything goes down \u2013 Makoto and Kotonoha reconcile after he\u2019s realised that being a robot only made for having sex with everything in a one centimetre radius isn\u2019t has glorified as it should be, after Sekai reveals that she\u2019s pregnant with his child and every girl he has had sex with in his school \u2013 which is nearly all of them \u2013 begins to fear him due to this sudden revelation. However, seeing them reconcile in front of her, Sekai murders Makoto when he suggests that she should get an abortion. Kotonoha visits Makoto\u2019s\u2026 corpse, in his room and takes matters into her own hand: by killing Sekai on the school rooftop in an admittedly badass fashion. Beforehand, she cut off Makoto\u2019s head and put it in a duffel bag. After she killed Sekai, Kotonoha invalidates her previous claims of pregnancy, which means all of this tragedy has been caused by a lie and most likely cementing everyone\u2019s hate for her as a character and a work of fiction. The final scene depicts Kotonoha and Makoto\u2019s head stranded on a nice boat, thus ending the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, after all of the negative things about it, why did I give it a high score?\\n\r\nSchool Days \u2013 for this viewer \u2013 had something that is nearly indescribable that kept me hooked the entire time. I hated the characters, I didn\u2019t particularly like the art style or the music; yet I wanted to see how it ends, I wanted to see how exactly the tragedy plays out. I had heard about people discuss this absolutely hating and even liking it, I can see why it\u2019s hated amongst many people. It absolutely ensnared me the whole time and even if you hate everything about it, you still want to see how it ends. If a series can keep a viewer hooked the whole time even if it\u2019s being despicable and absolutely loathsome, it has achieved something great. That\u2019s why I believe that anyone and everyone should watch School Days. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want to, however, my spoiler saved you some time. You\u2019re welcome.",

            "content": "School Days is a Slice of Life, Romantic, Drama about a sordid love triangle between friends Makoto (guy), Kotonoha (girl) and Sekai (girl). This is anime is an adaptation of a visual novel, notorious for its tragic endings and this anime retains that reputation.\r\nAs the story begins it seems very average, with the typical storyline that this type of anime tends to follow however both of the girl's questionable behaviour and feelings do make this romance drama very interesting. Even though it is very short, the story flows well at a satisfying pace, with some major unexpected developments that will keep most unable to stop.\r\nYetthis interesting anime was hugely let down by its characters, the male protagonist in particular. It's a common thing to have a unlucky and average guy as a protagonist however School Days goes overboard by making Makoto a useless, worthless, perverted, the list goes on&hellip; To have someone like him act like he's the &quot;top man&quot; gets so annoying that anyone can easily just drop this anime and look for a better one. The supporting characters don't add much to the story either it's really just the two main girls that bring this anime's story to life, which makes it worth watching to the end and also makes you feel sorry for the girls affected by Makoto.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of this anime is decent with great character designs, where the girl's body shapes are paid close attention to for fanservice. The animation could have been the great point to this anime but the animators are so lazy that issues with the background characters and static characters become so noticeable that it degrades the quality of the show. At least the music helps at points to bring a certain tone to any situation, nonetheless this anime overall is full of too many silent moments.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, School Days turned out to be an interesting and somewhat different anime romance drama (based on a visual novel) to watch. Even with the most hated and irritating male protagonist, the girls managed to bring something to the story, including a lot of heartfelt and ecchi moments ($ex). As it began to reach its climax the story became really disturbing and then came the shockingly unexpected ending.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to those who enjoy watching romance anime however the male protagonist is the biggest issue in this series, so this isn't one to watch if you're easily irritated. ^_^",

Otherwise, it wouldn't even be relevant to us.\r\nThink about it, remove that \"moment\" from this show and what do we get? A poorly animated, poorly written story that needs a big kick at the end to leave somewhat of an impression.\r\nNone of the characters in this show are likable, and all of them are simply nonsensical. There's nothing special about the male MC, and yet all the girls are flaunting their bodies to him. Sekai is a braindead character. Just watching her made me lose some brain cells. Why did she introducea girl to the guy that she likes? Is love a game to her? (clearly it's not) Also, associating the word \"love\" to this show is blasphemy. If you think that this show is about love, you are misguided. This show sucks so bad that even the author realized it.\\n\\n\r\nSo instead of ending it normally, he decided to make an unforgettable ending to make up for the disgrace of a story he came up with. And it was still terrible.",

            "content": "School Days.\r\nPersonally, both one of the best and worst anime I've ever seen.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI thought the story was technically excellent. Very interesting and completely not what you expect at first impression.\r\nWhile I was watching it, I didn't like it, because it made me angry...but then when I stopped to think, I realized, wow, that means it's actually really skillfully done. It makes you feel everything.\r\nAlso, the way that they wrapped it up in the end left me speechless. I'm still not even exactly sure how I feel about it, but I think that's how it's supposed to make you feel, and they pull it offin a really amazing way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art was well done and fitting, and complimented the series well. I'll just say it did its job, since I didn't really think about it while I was watching it. Though something that I did notice was done nicely is the facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe music, to me, was simply okay. Like the art, it fit and did its job. (I must say, the opening song grew on me a little bit, but I don't really even remember anything else.)\\n\r\nBut Kanashimi no Mukou he, the song that plays at the ending, gave it such a haunting and melodramatic feel. I thought it was a really nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nI gave this portion a 10, merely because...this is human nature. Everyone has a little bit of good and wickedness in them, and everyone affects each other. And I think they portrayed that beautifully through the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like any of the characters, but yet they were so well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll three of the leads, I believe, started out pretty innocent and average. Makoto, pretty much a normal guy, who was just too shy to approach the girl he had been seeking out.\\n\r\nSekai, outgoing and sometimes even a bit boisterous, just trying to help out the guy sitting next to her with his love life.\\n\r\nAnd then Kotonoha, who had that touch of naivety, and was a little on the awkward side.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like they all had good intent at first.\\n\\n\r\nThen when they met each other...Kotonoha's insecurity, Sekai's jealousy and guilt, Makoto's confusion and twisted desires...they affected each other, more so bringing out the bitter evil inside each other due to their conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it's hard to side with any of them once you've reached the end of the series, because you realize that all three of them are pretty messed up.\\n\\n\r\nEven though you'll hate them so much, you'll still sort of have an understanding of what brings about their serious flaws.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why the characters are so much like people, and wonderfully developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of funny, actually, because I enjoyed thinking about how good the story was more than I actually enjoyed watching it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I also felt dirty after watching it because of how disgusting Makoto becomes, and that took away from my enjoyment of it as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut throughout the whole thing, it's not really so much a matter of enjoying it...it's more that you just get hooked and feel the need to see what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me feel so much hatred and anger...but it's really just meant to do that, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nJust watching the ending would probably determine how you'd feel about it. It could make you feel disturbed, happy, depressed, confused, indifferent, or just mixed feelings.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, if you watched the ending, that'd kind of give you no reason to watch the series...but I don't know if I really recommend it or not. I guess it really just depends on the person.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone seems to have a different opinion about this one.\\n\\n\r\nBut me, personally...I think it deserves an 8.",

            "content": "To begin with,School days is best to be watched without having any background information of it being a H-game adaptation that is infamous for many things if you want to enjoy this anime to the fullest. With that said,there was so much hype going around School days when it was broadcasted that one had to give it a watch. I did and then realised why all the buzz. Never have I saw an anime coming out from this genre so well-executed,so emotionally-draining. \r\nSchool days seems like your usual teenage romance drama. Not only does the sypnosis suggests that,it even starts like one. But what youdon't know is School days is in fact an absolute train-wreck in disguise,and a very sly one at that. By making you believe that school days is your typical cliche,the producers could then proceed to 'surprise' you with some nasty stuffs which will most likely catch you off guard. Before you begin realising the anime's true colours,you are already in the roller-coaster ride that is about to depart ( 2nd half of series ). Now that is where the anime starts getting uncomfortable and disturbing. No longer can kissing or touching satisfy the overwhelming lust of our main lead anime. He wants to experience things at the next level and he'll go for any girl who's willing to offer that. All hell breaks loose. Watch how he bangs and lie his way to the point of no return,hurting one girl after another during the process. How will it end? I'm not going to spoil the last 2 episode in case you have not watched.   \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that characters in School days do suffer real consequences of their actions is a refreshing sight. If you touch a girl's butt,chances are you'll get slapped and end up in the police station. No,she isn't going to like it or yadda yadda. Actions in school days don't go unpunished. This is what makes this anime so distinct from its peers and deserving of all the hype because very few anime actually relates to the reality so harshly. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to a bunch who branded this anime as sh!t,I have nothing but glowing praises for school days. The execution of the story was to perfection and the flow of events was basically that of an ephemeral incurable disease. To put it simply,it was a slow,grueling process to watch. It never gets better and gradually,it drags you to your last gasp. Animation was decent and with obvious intent to create a sombre atmosphere using dark colours. I didn't like how the character look though. Soundtracks were great and some of the background music really amplify those dramatic moments. Kotonoha's and Makoto's voice were memorable. Character are mostly bastards and bitches meant for all of us to hate(bar a few) so we can have a show. All in all,it was a solid well-done work. And of course every anime has its fair share of flaws,school days isn't any special exception. However,the pros of this anime outweigh the cons by a big big margin that in my opinion,had made the flaws negligible and not matter that much. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely not for everyone especially to the more sensitive but regardless,I encourage you to give it a try. While I don't believe the exaggerated events in school days happening in our daily life,the anime does teach us some moral values. Episode 12 should serves as a pretty good warning for us viewers to not follow his footsteps. Though not that we really need it but meh,it's something. Had the anime not started so innocently fooling everyone,I'm sure School days would just be passed off as an obscure groundbreaking anime that went on a totally different path from what most harem anime would have taken. But luckily or not,it wasn't the case.    \\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure there are more hate than love in the School days community. While I firmly believe that the anime is receiving too much unwanted injustice from viewers,I do find myself agreeing some key points that was mentioned. The pace of story is slow but it picks up at the latter half. The premise is misleading but it was of a good cause. The characters are detestable but they have to be. At one point,I did loathe it as well since I'd prefer happy stuffs but that doesn't mean the anime is bad. \\n\\n\r\nTake School days with a grain of salt and you'll be rewarded with a story that offers a great deal of engaging drama and an epic ending that will leave you a lasting impression. No,there won't be a sequel,pretty sure about that. \\n\\n\r\nMiscellaneous \\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nBest soundtrack : Usotsuki by Coo-rie.\\n\r\nBest character : Setsuna. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by a H-game that is fully animated,you'd thought why sex have become so random and common in high-school. Now you know why.",

            "content": "(Note: this review contains minor spoilers)\r\nSchool Days seems to offer something that is different from the typical romance, harem, and high school anime; at the very least, it has an unusual protagonist in that he is selfish, takes any opportunity for sex, and doesn't have any concern for the feelings of others or take any responsibility for his own actions. However, the originality mostly stops there. The girls are mostly archetypes of this genre: the energetic friend, the sweet and quiet girl, the seemingly emotionless, distant observer (who also happens to look half her age), and the childhood friend. Where they differ from these clich\u00e9sis that none of them are particularly admirable or innocent, and all of them will for the most part do whatever they can to get what they want, albeit sometimes in self-deception. This also goes for the protagonist\u2019s best friend, who would, in most other anime of this genre, remain innocuously comical in any childishly underhanded ploys he might attempt.\\n\\n\r\nThe settings are also the same as those in most anime of this genre: a train, the classroom, a swimming pool, a school festival. However, the backdrop of this story is arguably more boring than any other high school anime in that there are practically no events in the series other than the tedious romantic interactions that are almost solely comprised of moments in which a girl character hesitates to kiss or have sex and moments when she doesn\u2019t. There is no occasion or character goal to provide any kind of diverting relief from these scenes, and only just enough information about what is going on at school is given to set the stage for each \u201cromantic\u201d moment.\\n\\n\r\nWhile keeping the ending in mind is beneficial in practically any series, usually providing more focus and purpose for each event and leading to a more satisfying conclusion, School Days seems to have been created solely for the ending and each episode leading up to it is an agony of compulsory delays until the final event. No life or passion seems to have been breathed into any of the happenings leading up to it and so it is difficult for the viewer to find any passion for them either.\\n\\n\r\nNot only this, but such despicable characters were incredibly frustrating to watch. While there is some satisfaction to be had in some parts near and at the end, the loathsome choices of the protagonist and even some of the other characters were a torment to witness. Even what gratification might come from seeing the conclusion is tinged with nausea because of the way in which in comes about.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show lacks almost anything that might provide enjoyment and entertainment, one might wonder if it holds any value in themes or meaning. However, whatever moral or \u201cdeeper meaning\u201d this story might have seems to be in the admonishment not to cheat, a piece of advice that even the most rampant cheaters have surely heard and understood before seeing this anime. I find it hard to believe that watching this show would play any part in whether or not someone decided to cheat on their significant other. The dire consequences of cheating are surely already blatantly obvious to anyone without seeing a grossly exaggerated demonstration of it.\\n\\n\r\nFor not only is this demonstration pointless, but it is done in a way that is far removed from almost any resemblance to reality. That this many girls would not only be interested in Itou, but also be willing to do whatever it takes for him and to each other in order to be the woman in his life is insulting to the viewer\u2019s intelligence. Almost every girl character is willing to hop in the sack with hardly a moment's notice, some with the hope of thus securing his affections, others simply for the momentary satisfaction of it regardless of what they know about him or of their relationship to his other partners. \\n\\n\r\nNot only this, but the perhaps pivotal reaction of one of these girls to what the protagonist has done is also incredibly far-fetched. That a girl with her kinds of innocent dreams and family ties would go into shock at the end of an, at best, rocky relationship with a crush she was never fully attached to seems unlikely. \\n\\n\r\nItou is for the most part the only saving grace for the show\u2019s lack of realism, which isn\u2019t saying much. Despicable though he is, it is not implausible to believe that a person this shallow exists or that he would react the way he does to the unrealistic number of girls that throw themselves at him. Infuriating though it is, his apathy toward the way they feel when they ask something of him in return and his boredom over time with each one is also plausible in the case of a person with such contemptible character and no desire or incentive to take responsibility for what he has done.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone can relate to the moment when, if only because he is faced for the first time with actual consequences to his actions, he wakes up and realizes that he has made the biggest mistake of his life. Whether or not this sudden horrible realization would have a lasting affect on his character or simply drive a brief guilt-ridden gap in-between transgressions is difficult to say, though either path is plausible.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, there is some measure of relatability in the flawed character of Saionji in that she really manages to deceive herself about her own goals and motivations throughout the show. Regardless of her sometimes reprehensible decisions, her desperate effort to justify herself in her weakness is somehow heart wrenching and reminiscent of times when many of us have made mistakes while deceiving ourselves in the attempt to retain the mental image of the kind of person we believe and hope ourselves to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe three main female leads are all designed in such a way that they have a bit of a creepy look, with sharp contrast in coloring between complexion and hair and eye color, eyes too large and expressionless, and hair that juts out angularly before falling around their faces. This works well in foreshadowing the ultimately dark nature of the series, but each one is practically indistinguishable from the other except for their hair length. Along with this laziness in character design, the scenery is also given the bare minimum of detail. There is just enough for the viewer to comprehend the setting, and nothing else. What is there is also not particularly pleasing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this, the lighting looks as though it all comes from a weak bulb in bad need of replacement and filtered through a filthy shade. It doesn\u2019t clarify the picture, but rather dulls the lines, especially near the top of the image, reflecting off skin in such a way that it makes everything seem a bit difficult to make out and dulls the colors. Overall, School Days is painful to watch in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nThe actors\u2019 voices do not sound professionally recorded at all. When one of them raises their voice, it has a sort of empty sound as though they are yelling in a vacant garage, and there is a bit of distortion as though they are using a bad microphone. So the sound of their voices is in general rendered unpleasant, on top of which their acting itself is a bit unnatural and far-fetched in tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is completely unremarkable, so much so that it\u2019s almost impossible to find anything to say about it otherwise. The opening sequence has a nice rhythm and mood, though the ecchi makes its entrance a bit too suddenly and awkwardly in the second half, much as the fanservice does throughout the series itself. The ending song for each episode is different and every one of them has a suitable atmosphere for the episode that just ended and lyrics that convey some of the characters\u2019 unspoken feelings, which manages to make an otherwise mind-numbingly dull show slightly more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI went into this anime with a very open and hopeful mind. After all, there is a great amount of vocal hatred for the anime Elfen Lied, Rumbling Hearts, and Mirai Nikki, but I managed to enjoy them all. So I thought that maybe there was some value that I would find in School Days that many did not and I didn\u2019t want to judge it by someone else\u2019s standards. However, even going into it with an open mind, I came to the conclusion that I should have stayed far away.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to try School Days in the hopes that it will be completely different from the norm, be mindful that this comes at the expense of quality in every other area. There are no lessons to be learned, no pretty pictures to look at, no plot to hold your attention, and no characters to get attached to. The only recommendation I can give it is a suggestion to watch it simply because it is so bad. There is something morbidly fascinating in seeing something this abhorrent, and it can only help strengthen your appreciation for the good shows in this medium.",

            "content": "I loved this anime in most aspects, it is refreshingly different from the normal cliche school romance, the characters are very interesting and I might say quite realistic, Ill explain why bellow, for now staying in the anime viewer perspective  this show is technically decent although nothing special, the development is twisted delicious with incredible cliffhangers at the end of each episode, becoming rather normal at the start but you always feel like watching the next one quickly. The characters develop interestingly and in an original way, far from your usual innocent kids, I can understand why some people must hate the main character,specially for girls, but thats part of males personality. This is one of those shows where things can go wrong and will go wrong portraying very well how you can screw up if you don't do whats right and how you can get into hellish situations if communication between the individuals fails.\\n\r\nIn my opinion if its controversial then it did something right, and making a character be so hated (although I suspect only by womens) is definitely an ingenious piece of art.  I recommend this anime greatly to the mature audience out there, i'm afraid the younger will just hate it or dont find any meaning. Watch it and don't judge the characters like their real persons, its a show! \\n\\n\r\nAs a side note explanation I must say the characters are slightly exagerated but its actually a fairly accurate portrait of the modern reality in Japan high schools, if you ever had the chance to travel there and spend some time other than touring around you should understand what I mean, the Japanese society is disturbingly diferent but its not like the lovey dovey animes you see around full of tradition and values, it may be like that in the older populations but the younger Japanese are rotting, values are falling apart and the school system is outdated and inadequate to deal with the present situation. I took my time to explain this because knowing of it you might look at this anime from a different point of view. It may be shocking or hateful for someone who is looking for a fairy tale or a pretty romantic story but humans aren't really like that. All this gives a  different dimension to this show and taking into account there are exagerations for entertainment purposes, overall it can be seen as a critic to Japanese modern society so if your interested in this topic, its a must watch.",

In fact, its a shame to Kimi ga Nozomu Eien to to be included in the same post with School Days.\r\nThe story, at first, was fine. Like I've said before, a love triangle with a pathetic male, shy girl and a hyper girl. But the more I saw, the less it could be called >triangle<. The creators wanted to make it complicated, but in the end it turned outto be pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is the only good thing about this anime. the animation and the sound. In fact, I like the art-style here. ;;XD\\n\r\nThere were some little problems sometimes, but overall it was good. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another thing that was good. In fact, I cant stop listening to one of the ending songs. ^^&quot; \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. The characters, all of them, are just the worst. Every single one of them is so pathetic that I cant bear it. In they're place, if was in the same situation, I would die rather than being so pathetic. ._.\\n\r\nAnd if they are pathetic, Makoto is the most pathetic, annoying and disgusting character that I've ever seen. He's just a sex machine, and thats all he cares about - sex. If someone will kill him, I will add himher in my fav list. '-' \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~ hmm. Well, a least its not boring and you'll never expect what is coming next. BUT, the Characters are more annoying in every episode, so every time I watching an episode, I'm in a bad mood for a couple of hours after that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - well, its not recommended for someone like me. like I said before, it started fine, there was even a time when I actually  liked it. If Makoto was less sex addicted and pathetic, and the love triangle was just a &gt;triangle&lt;, It could have been a lot better.",

            "content": "I've never had a show, or book make me detest itself so much yet still keep me from putting it down.\r\nAlthough nearly every event portrayed made me cringe, I cannot deny this show provokes you. With its absurdity. Its overly innocent title.  Its demented psychotic cast. That feeling of total helplessness(and admittedly mild amusement) as complete idiocy unfolds before you. I have never before wanted to line up a group of fictional people and bitch slap them all so fucking hard. Especially that piece of shit protagonist.\r\nThat said, this is what the creators probably wanted. In the end, THATs what made it memorable. Itmade me goddamn confused and sick and audibly WTF and cheer for blood multiple times... BUT  it was memorable. Especially the ending.\\n\\n\r\nFor the story, I would say watching \"school days\" is a rollercoaster of disbelief at oddly plausible stupidity. I'm not going to outright join the people calling it realistic (harem or otherwise) but in such a big world, something this(or more) crazy has has to have happened somewhere, right? With \"reality is stranger than fiction\" in mind and a healthy suspension of disbelief, School Days was my very entertaining peek into a bizarro universe where an unbelievably lucky imp manages to turn off his brain and wake up covered in bitches. Some of whom are insane and [SPOILER REDACTED].\\n\\n\r\nI can't deny the creators took a rather unique take on the cliche high school romance genre, twisting it rather well by combining lots of real-world complications(emotionally vulnerable women, young naivety and inexperience, a senseless and nonchalantly callous lead, teenage angst, jealousy, infidelity and copious amounts of horniness and psychosis) in a simmering mix. I give the story a 6.5(Fair) because despite the enterprising premise, the writing was weak at crucial places, often giving away too easily that the show is intentionally trying to rile you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are I think done rather well. The lot of them are retarded, true. But they're consistent and believably so. Their actions, judgement, personal disposition and motivations are actually well built up and foreshadowed. At the end, despite my inclination to demur, I could not seriously answer in a way unfavourable to school days these questions: \"could an asshat like Makoto actually exist?\", \"Emotionally co-dependant women like Kotonoha have gotta be a myth, right?\", \"meangirl sluts like Otome and company? C'mon...\", \"Could a girl like Sekai really be stupid enough to pull that wingman scheme of hers?\". \\n\\n\r\nThis is where School Days impresses you, I think. Despite the stretches of imagination at places, it would be unfair not to call it a psychological anime. Its cast is uniquely idiosyncratic, unbalanced and uniformly contemptible... but still so very... interesting. The mind-boggling series of events involving interactions between these anomalous-yet-still-not-quite-unbelievable characters leave so many who watched it affected in some way or another. I think that's a commendable feat and could not have been accomplished had there /not/ been any depth, or could it have been summarily dismissed as beyond the imagination. Despite the heavy misleading fanservice(which I'm convinced was shoehorned to drive home the shock value), these aren't your average porno characters. IMO, They deserve at least a 7(good) but I'll up it to 8 for being memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSound is actually an area where School Days excels. Whether it was muting the world for some sense of foreboding, or quiet piano pieces in the background, it was used very well. Each of the fade-in songs and the EDs were brilliant and an effective and evocative exit to the trauma you inevitably suffered in each episode. A sort of soothing exit after being mentally raped. Also, at the moments in the episodes themselves where these songs played, I think they were superbly effective at creating atmosphere and really did enhance the impact of whatever was happening at the time. I also noticed that the lyrics of some of the songs were quite poignant and seemed well-written too(something I'm sorry, few songs are after being translated). I did not like the OP nearly as much, but I suppose at some level it too played into the euphemistic way they were trying to present the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, I believe was also done rather nicely. Makoto's voice makes me want to punch him, but thats all well and good and perfectly in line with everything else about him. The dramatic and emotional parts of the script were delivered satisfactorily and believably and all of the characters had convincing emotion in their voices at the appropriate places. For sound I give SD an 8.5 that I'll round up to 9(Great).\\n\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about art. It didn't stand out particularly or had a distinguished style and I never had my attention drawn(heheh, drawn) to anything in particular. The character designs were good overall but somewhat inconsistent(where did Setsuna's boobs suddenly come from in her lewd scene? I could've sworn she was flat-chested everywhere else) for the sake of tasteless sexualization. At the same time, I can't say it was *bad* in any place either so I'll give it a 7(Good).\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can't say I ENJOYED this anime, I will say that it was interesting and worth watching. School Days wasn't really made to make you ENJOY it(and if you did, well... my sympathies to you...). It was made to make you squirm in your seat. I give it a 8 for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 7(good).",

            "content": "School Days is just one giant piece of fanservice, and that is it. If you are looking for your typical high school romance, this is not it. This anime takes the \"perverted harem\" genre to a whole new level-with some surprising and extremely unneccessary twists. The anime starts out average enough- you have your unexperienced, yet cute main boy, the shy girl he has a crush on, and the tsunedere who secretly likes him, but is in denial. The first half of the series revolves around their love triangle. Interesting enough.Throw in some uneccessary boob, crotch, and panty shots while you're at it.\r\nThen all ofa sudden, Makoto (the guy) becomes a manwhore. All of a sudden, every female cast member has a crush on him, despite prior interactions, and he has sex with them all. You really grow to feel bad for the two original girls-Sekai and Katsura- who still love Makoto, despite him being a horny bastard. Katsura, especially, is bullied for unneccessary reasons. The later half of the series is just random, pointless sex- which makes sense, considering School Days is also a hentai game.\\n\r\nThe climax of the series is what this anime is best known for. I will not write any spoilers, but it is unexpected and VERY creepy.\\n\r\nSome may say this anime takes a &quot;psychological&quot; look at high school relationships. If you want a psychological view on high school relationships, please watch Kare Kano. This is mindless fodder. In one of the episodes, some of the girls place a video camera in a room at the school festival where kids have sex and then show the tape to everyone, for crying out loud!\\n\r\nDon't waste your time on this unless you're really perverted, or you're curious to why the fuck it ends the way it does.",

            "content": "Ah, School Days. What an experience. It's become such a phenomenon in the anime community (Nice Boat!) that most people have probably already seen it. If you haven't for whatever reason - and especially if you haven't had the ending spoiled - you're missing a diverse little head trip. \r\nFirst off, you're going to need a good bit of patience. SD likes to tease it's audience, to the point that you could really consider the first 11 episodes as painfully slow buildup to the (admittedly awesome) finale. That tension encompasses a veritable roller-coaster of  emotions, styles and themes. You'll see cute awkwardness give wayto genuine affection, best friends turn on each other and just about every girl in this school find the main character to inexplicably be a sex God. Oh Japan, so silly. \\n\\n\r\nThat would be the easiest way to categorize School Days, as a harem anime. It doesn't really come out until about halfway through, but once it does, it doesn't shy away from the taboo. The show shifts genres parallel to a shift in tone from the witty, cheesy cliches that japanimation is famous for into a bleak social commentary so smoothly and naturally that disbelief is never broken. \\n\\n\r\nThis is really School Days' biggest strength; being able to contrast perverted grade school humor with stark images of heartbreak. You can easily go into the show just looking for a lighthearted diversion and be satisfied. Similarly, if you're willing to sit through the shtick humor and (at first) angst-ridden melodrama, you'll end up with surprisingly well-developed characters and an extremely gratifying ending. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically, the show isn't perfect. The animation isn't bad, in fact several scenes were quite evocative, if a bit trope-heavy. The voice acting really shines, especially later on, once the characters round out, at least in the Japanese dub. The soundtrack is straight J-pop for better or worse. One nice little facet is that they use a rotating selection of songs for the end credits, keeping the experience fresh. They only add music to a handful of scenes within the show, and while I really liked them all, more music overall would've helped. \\n\\n\r\nSchool Days ultimately suffers from an unfortunate medium transition. Originally appearing as a harem simulation game with multiple unique endings, the anime directors had the difficult task of picking one ending to a story meant to be dynamic and fluid. Many elements of this carry over; prepare for innuendo more overused than some (perhaps not all) may care for, and anyone who can sit through the first 11 episodes and not want to become a staunch feminist should probably seek a psychiatrist. That said, I was surprised to find the care to storytelling present in what I wrongly assumed would be a shallow perversion. It's no classic, but I enjoyed taking the time to absorb the experience. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I sure as hell am going to think twice before I go out with two girls at once.",

            "content": "I never actually thought I'd enjoy a harem anime so much until I watched School days. There were so many things I liked and enjoyed so let me get right into it.\r\nThe thing that I liked, no loved the most in School days was the story. School days has a very dark and mature story-line, meaning, if you're not an adult or at least in your late teens, or if you haven't at least seen anime similar to this than you probably won't understand most of the story. That aside, the story was an amazing blend of all things drama. Tragedy, love & hate, bondsformed and broken, heartbreak, friendship etc. The staff did a very good job writing the story. Something that I noticed, too is that the show has a really slow pacing, so don't expect things to happen right then and there. Although most of the times certain things like sex, or betrayal do happen before the end of an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were not the best or well let me be honest Makoto wasn't. I do strongly believe that this was done on purpose of course because you know, how else are we going to get a good story. It was interesting to see Makoto go from nice guy that every one respected and liked to sex craved idiot & jerk.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, during the point in which Makoto started to betray someone who was close to him, his lover, was the moment that I immedialey lost respect for him, in fact it gets a lot worst however I'd much rather not spoil anything. In my opinion, the writers did a good job on making such a detestable main character.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the main male, the majority of the women in the cast were like your common female harem archetype. So things you'd normally expect to see, the big boobs, the jealous one with tiny boobs, the mature girl who looks like a loli etc.\\n\r\nYou'll read it from me, and you'll most likely see it from the rest, however school days doesn't have the best cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork done in this show is terrible, it looks like very little was done in terms of background, crowd settings etc. If you look at things in either Makoto's room or just anywhere really, you'll noticed that they look horribly painted, and a majority of the time the chracters just look like they were just inserted into a some sort of watercolor paint texture.. the character designs are pretty awful too, especially for the anime's release. Overall it's bad, nothing really special.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, was okay, it didn't leave a big impact on how certain events went down in the anime. However I did like opening and ending songs, and some of the songs played before the ending of an episode. Overall the soundtrack was okay not too bad and not too good.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I didn't like and yet admired about School days was the character relationships, like I previously said before, I hated Makoto. I sure by now everyone does, in both the VN and the anime he is just detestable. His relationships with the other characters seemed really forced. It seemed like the staff either got really lazy towards the end of the anime and just said \"we don't feel like writing anything else, let's just add lots of sex between the MC and others.\" Or maybe they were just trying to stick with the shows roots and have him try to get with every other female character that he can. That way it feels like the VN. Either way it was acceptable to me only up until the point where he's banging chicks left and right without even knowing them. Even towards the end of the series things just got a bit ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, \"there's no one inside.\"  School days had one of the most infamously well known endings in anime history. There are so many parody's, homage's etc of one of the most shocking finishes to an anime and it's just such a... \"joy\" or \"pleasure\" to see. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, although it wouldn't be my first choice, I would recommend it to anyone who loves shocking moments or huge twist in anime. If you're okay with mature dialogues, settings, in a school situation then go for School days.. 9/10 overall for exciting drama and great tragedies.",

            "content": "This anime is very psychological and manipulative, so if you\u2019re not into consistent plot twists and an exuberant array of drama then I highly suggest you don\u2019t watch this anime. To add to my suggestion of choice\u2026If you like stories with happy endings, or nice characters, then you\u2019re going to be horrified. This story has an unexpected ending that may not please everyone, as well as characters who are a truthfully jerks. \r\nStory: The story was magnificent, it was pure genius. I have to admit, happy endings are nice, but they aren\u2019t in line with the truth of reality. People usually don\u2019t get to livehappily ever with their lover. Not only is half of America\u2019s married people divorced, the other half could be cheating or treating their spouse horribly. Now granted, the story isn\u2019t something that usually happens, or really happens at all, but it still shows the depression, anger, and jealousy that can build in humans. The story is a perfect example of a miserable set of emotions too chained and too reluctant to realize it\u2019s abhorrence. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The stories art was quite magnificent. The quality immediately drew me into the story to an even higher level. For me to watch an anime, no matter how magnificent the story and character may be, the anime has to have good art. And I must say, this anime\u2019s art was beyond my expectations. The characters eyes were beautifully woven and the facial expressions were perfectly intact. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was good enough for me to comfortably enjoy the show. The reason sound doesn\u2019t have a score quite as high as the other specifics are because I simply can\u2019t remember anything special with it, or bad with it. In fact, I don\u2019t really remember the sound at all. But that states that I didn\u2019t dislike the sound\u2026nor like it. So I give sound an \u201c8\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were nicely made, and fit the criteria of the story perfectly. If Makoto wasn\u2019t such a jerk then the story couldn\u2019t be done correctly. But even so, some of the characters bugged me to no end. Even though some characters were vexating a lot of the nice ones made up for that, and I know the annoyance of the characters was needed for the amelioration completion of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this story a lot, and as you can tell by my anime list, not every anime or even a quarter of the anime I\u2019ve seen received a 10. I couldn\u2019t stop watching the series, and all day I would just surmise over the series. I have to say this story exceeded all of my expectations. I never expected for an anime with this kind of presentation to be this good!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall I loved this anime, loved it enough to put it on my favorites of anime. I would definitely recommend this story to anyone that wants to view a creation of truth. \\n",

            "content": "First and foremost, I did not give School Days a 9 because it was a \"good\" anime. I gave it a nine because this anime has been able to make me feel very strong emotions that no other anime has been able to make me feel - frustration, anger, exasperation, and literally, sick. For an anime to make me feel that way, well, they must be doing something special.\r\nIt starts off as a fairly amusing anime. It seems so simple and lighthearted, but you can tell that there's probably going to be some love triangle business. Then about episode 5 or 6, shit starts toget real. I won't spoil it, but it starts to get very upsetting. \\n\\n\r\nAs most other people have agreed, the main character is simply awful, personality wise. However, he's good at his role (being an asshole). I felt very bad for Katsura, because she has to deal with it through the whole time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were fine. Nothing amazing, nothing awful. I'm pretty sure this anime is only subbed.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that it's much better to watch School Days with friends. We were able to share our frustrations and for the first half, we had a lot of fun. We made fun of the awkward overuse of sideways angles (there are a ton...). \\n\\n\r\nSorry if my review is kind of choppy and short, but I really think that if you choose to watch it (please don't...I'm definitely not letting my boyfriend watch it), at some point, you have to stand back and be able to appreciate how much this anime can piss you off.\\n\\n\r\nBecause seriously, fuck this anime.",

            "content": "this review is based on:\r\n11 episodes of the anime seen\r\nEpisodes 1-11 of Japanese w/ English Subtitles\r\nThis review contains mucho spoilers in the 'story' section. But other then that, everything should be mild-spoilers.\r\nPlease keep in mind this review is meant for people who have seen the anime.\r\nMy notes & Opinion on this anime \r\n[This portion is meant for people who don't want to read the whole review.] \r\nI was going to write this review when I finished the series, but honest to god, I don't think one episode is going to change my opinion about this anime. \r\nIf you're looking for a deep, love love, romantic,tear-jerker anime, then please cancel that batch download of School Days immediately and take this anime off your plan-to- watch list. You won't be impressed by School Days. It wasn't very well thought out, it seemed like the creators were trying a little too hard to make this a complex love story. Even if you're an ecchi, h-game fan you will find this anime to be pretty pathetic.  That's all I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is something I don't recommend, but it's all your choice whether you'd like to watch it or not.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nOk. So I thought this would be just a regular cliche high school love story. It seemed a little immature of Makoto to fall in love with Kotonoha at first sight, but you know, that's how most relationships in anime start. Didn't impress me, I was hoping it'd get better. That's when Sekai came in and a little love-triangle started. I actually thought Sekai and Makoto would end up together in the first place, and some how live happily ever after. Think it'd stop there? Ahaha. I wish it did. \\n\\n\r\nThen the anime just gets pretty irritating. I thought it'd stop at Sekai, but it doesn't. Setsuna kicks in and decides to have sex with him, kinda almost outta nowhere. I wouldn't let a guy violate me for the sake of my friend. Setsuna's interest in Makoto was hinted, but going so far as to sexual relationships is not what I was thinking. Think it'd stop there? Apparently not. Otome comes out of the blue and decides to go at it with Makoto. Think it ends there? Nope. He decides to have a little fun with Hikari as well. This is just high school people. Very unrealistic. Most anime is unrealistic, but come on people. It was a really poor attempt at some kind of sex in the city anime, but worse. In the end, you just find all the characters really annoying, even the ones you liked from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nActually, the reason I decided to watch this anime was purely the art style. I had some pictures from the game back in 2005 and thought it looked so pretty. 2 years later, I find the anime and thought it'd be nice to watch because of the art style. I think the only good part of this anime is that you'll want to go out and save pictures and scans from this anime because the style is so pretty. But I think it's another one of those Anime where they put so much detail into the girls, and the guy doesn't look the least bit attractive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAah. Where do I start with the characters? I think the good points. The creators did a good job as far as characters and their reactions. All the characters reacted to such situations as any other human would, so that's a plus. It wasn't too over done where you see the characters wanting to commit suicide, and it wasn't too little of emotions shown.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad part is that you think all the characters are idiots. \\n\r\nFor the most part, it seems that all the characters fall in love with each other at first sight. Even with Sekai. She knew how much of an idiot Makoto is, the way he treated Kotonoha, yet she still is blinded by love and wants to be with him. Some how, I just don't get that. It makes her look dumb when she loses her innocence to him, and that's not what an audience wants to see. \\n\r\nYou also find Kotonoha to be annoying because she's trying a little to hard to be with Makoto. She's pretty damn persistent. \\n\r\nAnd oh. my. god. Makoto. I don't know. Doesn't he have ANY sense of moral values what-so-ever? I mean, I love dense characters in most anime, but this guy is just terrible. Absolutly terrible. He disregards all feelings of other girls and just wants some. Reading a book for girl advice? Come on. Asking another girl for girl advice? Now that's going too far. Dumping your girlfriend to go for the girl who gives you the girl advice? I don't even know where to begin with how idiotic that is. Most guys in high school are a bit more mature than that. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters... I feel like they're just there for the sake of being there. Even though Setsuna claims to have a close relationship with Sekai, you just don't see it. Even though Otome claims to have liked Makoto back in the day, you just don't see it. And I don't know about Hikari, but it was kind of all just out of the blue for me...  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnding Statements\\n\r\nI obviously did not enjoy this anime. But hey, there's only one episode left and I never have to see anything from this anime again. Hey. This anime is ok if you honest to god have NOTHING else to do and no other anime to watch, but believe me, you won't really get much from this anime. Nothing deep, but a little TOO serious for something in high school. None of the relationships, nor the characters, have realistic feelings, especially on Makoto. This anime is something I don't recommend, but it's your choice whether you'd like to watch it or not.\\n",

I only went into this out of pure curiosity about how terrible School Days actually is and to give out a personal opinion for the sake of reviewing it. Is it as bad as the anime community says it is?\r\nStory (5/10)\r\nSchool Days had a mediocre through the first episodes. Nothing really meaningful at the least and some morally idiotic decisions by none other by Makoto himself. It was boring to watch, but first half was overall 50/50. The second half? I'll get to that later intothe review. Now we get to the last two episodes. At the end of episode 11, I was actually surprised that such a scene existed in this dreadful anime. I 'd say it was the best part of School Days. The only good part of it anyways. However, I didn't feel anything that made me feel the scene. In fact, I was still frustrated at certain characters during the scene that it interferes with with the emotion. And we get to the last episode. It's just the three main characters making some of the idiotic decisions ever. The stuff that made the twists are very illogical. This was without a doubt the worst part of School Days\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days doesn't seem too appealing with the art & sound. The Art just seems bland all the way through and there were no soundtracks that stood out to me. The arts overall are just flat out mediocre. However, the arts are the least of problems.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (1/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is by far the worst cast of anime characters I've ever seen. I found none of them to be likeable at all. the cast is so terrible that it drags the story into piss poor condition. I'm only going to mention the three main characters. First we got Makoto Itou. This guy is just the worst and he knows it, but doesn't seem to have a care in the world. Makoto just makes all his decisions without thinking about certain people without a damn given. His decisions at the first half were not done near as frequently as the second half. He make me yell at the screen every time he showed up in the second half. Sekai Saionji. This character didn't make sense from the beginning. she caused Makoto to go follow his instints, but Makoto had a choice. Sekai just sometimes makes some horribly illogical decisions like in the last episode. Now Kotonoha Katsura. From the beginning, she was the only character that I could tolerate, but her direction of being overly attached to someone like Makoto just makes an unlikable path for Kotonoha. The others? No! everyone just go to hell. I'm done!\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days does deserve the reputation it gets. If your going to watch it to review it? Your funeral. If you are just looking for enjoyment? This will piss you the hell off. One of the worst anime I've seen thus far. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10)",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nToday we review School Days. A tale set in Victorian London that serves as an example to children  of how to become an ideal British gentlemen. Wait...that's Tom Brown's School Days by Thomas Hughes! What are we reviewing? Oh GOD NO! Unfortunately, we will be looking at that OTHER School Days. (sighs heavily).\r\nPlot: 3/10\r\nThe plot is that there is an obnoxious little shit named Makoto that is filled with angst that he is in high school and is still a virgin. So this is going to be an anime American Pie right? Right? No, instead we have to see this guy plow every girlin the grade and have zero remorse when he breaks their hearts. Why the girls keep falling for this creep is never really established other than the tired stereotype of \"girls like bastards\". Although this almost seems like it could be interesting or some kind of thought provoking critique of teen sex comedies, this series wallows in poorly written melodrama and the first half is SLOW as a 3 toed sloth moving through jello. Will Makoto eventually get his comeuppance? Honestly, who cares!? After about episode 5 you will just want to quit. Only continue if you are a true masochist!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a few extra points by having the balls to have such a complete scum bag as the main character. At least School Days had some guts, even if it is just based on the concept of making all the bad choices in an ero dating sim. The main girls are Sekai and Kotonoha, and I honestly hated both of them! A lot! There isn't a single character in this cesspool that makes you feel attached to them or cheer for them! Other than maybe one of Kotonoha's actions in episode 13. I cheered for that at least!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is average. It isn't great, but it isn't horrendous either.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty good. If I had to pick a \"highlight\" in this piece of shit, it would be the character art. Makoto does have one of those faces that you just want to punch again and again ala Ladd Russo from Baccano! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHsUfuFVRSQ\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series is about as fun as getting an arrow shot through your neck, and then finding a gas bill attached.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure why I rated this as high as I did. I guess the art is actually decent, it has some production value, and it took a chance being ballsy. At times it almost seemed like it could have worked. Perhaps as a black comedy that critiques and skewers teen sex comedies. Unfortunately, this series lacked direction and any kind of proper execution.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now on to the review of what I should call \"an extremly overhyped series.\" Though it is somehow a popular series for its genre, it just didn't appeal to me.\r\nStory: Is it really an outstanding story? Well I can say that it is outstanding for being a mediocre romance story. Even if romance is not the key for this anime, I have a need to critic what is bad, and this is no exception. The so called romance in school days lacked in its true value of what romance should really mean. What starts as a simple boy loves girls actually turns out to bea big fat pool of sexualisation and lust. I'm not actually surprised, since it is actually based on a eroge game. The REAL story actually starts on the second half of the show. Yes indeed, the first half was literally bullshit in the development. For the second half, the big pool I talked about is still there, but instead going for the better, the story debut its journey into a downward spiral which lead to the so called \"Amazing ending\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All I have to say is that Makoto is probably the dumbest character ever made in anime histories. Am I over the board with my statement? I am not and I'm sure a lots of you would agree with me. I just couldn't find any values for him. As for the defaults that he has, he's selfish, stupid, have no heart and he's a big fat asshole. He's not the only asshole of the story, in fact most of the characters are, but he's still the biggest of them all. As for the female characters, which represents 95% of the population in this show, all have one similar point. They can't control their lust. Every girls in this show(no exception) are portrait as easy girls and sluts. Which is rather disapointing. The psychology made no sense either. You can't just stop loving a girl just like that to love another one. It's actually nonsense, but for Makoto, it happens on a daily basis. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say about it. Character art was fairly generic, as for the backgrounds nothing outstanding, but nothing mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nSound:Didn't really like the opening and ending, though they smartly use a suspense feeling to some of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Though the first episodes were not so good, the last ones are what actually makes the show \"enjoyable\". Emotionally disturbed, Kotonoha is probably the character which made the show enjoyable. I would compare her to Carrie(Stephen King Novel). As for the ending, you would probably expect that since it's the only reason to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'm giving it a 5/10. It was enjoyable at some points, but the series still lacked in many aspects(characters for example). As for the moral, I'll just quote something from the song Billie Jean:\\n\\n\r\n\"People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do\\n\r\nAnd Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!\\n\\n",

            "content": "After finishing this anime, you're going to be asking yourself one thing, and one thing only. \"What did I just see?\" Whether it's \"What kind of s**t did I just see?\" or \"What amazing twist did I just experience?\", chances are, your jaw will be touching the floor. \r\nNow, a lot of people rate this anime harshly. I feel that this is due to the build up of already harsh reviews. I don't know about you guys, but when I have bad expectations for an anime and start watching it, 9/10 times I won't like the anime. Which is really just a pity. Thankfully, Istarted watching School Days not knowing what to expect, only knowing that there was a huge twist. Really, that's all you need to know. If you start watching schooldays with your mind set in stone that you won't like it, chances are, you won't. Just like almost anything in life, having a bad attitude or already believing you lost, will only decide it for you. This is even more so true in the anime world. If you start watching school days with the expectations that most of the reviews will give you, you're gonna have a bad time.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I loved School Days. It's really a hit or miss. Either you're going to admire it for it's courage to sway from normal slice o' life/romance anime, or despise it for being a train-wreck. Usually, it's the latter of the two. I mainly think the reason for this is solely because of the expectations for it. The synopsis really does attract the wrong audience. What a pity. That's all I can say for School Days. If it had been advertised better and put into a different genre, it could have done good. Thankfully, I like romance, thrillers, horror, slice of life, comedy and almost everything else. Really, School days is a great way to ease the boredom felt by watching countless mainstream romance anime. If you haven't already watched School Days, you're either new to the anime crowd or have been put off by the influx of harsh reviews. Either way, give it a try. Hey, even if you have already watched it and didn't like it, you might want to give it another try with a different mind set. I know I'm going to get hated on for writing a good School Days review, but oh well. I hope some of you try School Days due to this review; and maybe even fall in love with it.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "School Days is based off an eroge of the same name released some time ago.  Already a problem arises: the producers intended to translate this type of game into an airing tv series.  Seriously now...\r\nThe game is basically a series of animations cued depending on whichever branching paths the player inputs.  There are 3 possible endings for the game, which we'll look into a little further into this review.\r\nThere's the male protagonist, Makoto, his female friend Sekai (oshit, no wai!), and some other girl the guy's interested in Katsura.  Words cannot even begin to describe how ridiculously predictable this seems. Basically,its a love triangle, guy gets new girl, other girl gets jealous, BOOM! congradulations a bloody fricken original plot is born....again...for the 407th time.  You'd think that this is your standard romance story, but oh hoh no. it get worse. Worse beyond belief. Again, we'll look into it a little further down.  What's tragic is that there are some decent themes that could have been emphasized like destroying friendships for your own selfish desires.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. The elements that either captivate viewers with their performances enchanting them into progressing further and further along the story OR f*ck it up.  School days...does both.  No I'm not a pothead.  These children have the sexual instincts of sewer rats, emotional habits of blueberries and personalities that almost shine brighter than sandpaper.  Seriously, the actions each character exhibits causes one to cry oneself to sleep shortly after the ending theme starts every episode.  At least, that's how i reacted.  Others may howl in terror or laugh in disbelief.  These stereotypes cannot seem to grasp common sense and strictly rely on their sexual urges and...even more sexual urges.  I couldnt believe this was actually happening.  Do japanese highschoolers really get into this sh*t? What really drove me to keep watching until the end was to see how much sh*t these kids got into. In a way, it was worth it to finally see them drown in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction gets the job done (whatever sick job it is) and delivers recognizeable backgrounds and characters. However, I've seen stick figure with more life than these characters exhibit.  Although easily recognizeable the models are boring as hell and are terribly bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is easily School Days' highest point.  Unbelieveably, the songs are impressive and the voice acting, while lacking personality and passion, delivers enough to give whatever life it can to the characters. But seeing as all this seems to go to waste being used in a failed abortion such as this, the bubbling sound of ripping ass at least seems more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n*WARNING SPOILERS IN NEXT 2 PARAGRAPH*\\n\r\nIt's truly amazing how the these kids would willingly let themselves be fondled by douchebags just to practice for another girl.  wtf. Sekai, who secretly loves Makoto says she lets him go for Katsura because she loves him and wants to support him.  seriously what the fucking shit. The parents of these kids seem to not notice or give a shit when they hear the bed springs in their daughter's room bending and the sound of moaning ang groaning seeps through the walls.  Oyea and realizing \"Oh noes, vat hav i done!\" after you stab a guy to death requires no comment...\\n\\n\r\nThe real element that makes this series legendary is the \"nice boat\" ending.  It is an original ending which differed from the three endings of the game. in the game: (1) Sekai + makoto walk along bridge, Katsura shows up, slices Sekai's neck, blood shoots out her neck like a garden hose, and Katsura laughs like a Joker. (2) Sekai stabs Makoto at beach...thats it. and (3) the two bitches get along and are just about to have a threesome.\\n\r\nThe anime ending: Sekai stabs Makoto in room and Katsura takes head, kills sekai and checks her womb for bebez, then drifts off on her nice boat grasping makoto's decapitated head into her tits and she lived happily ever after. the fuckin end.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to see how f*cked some animes can be, how cliched they can be, how an overused love triangle theme is f*cked with to the lowest degree, or how many times this series spells ass.  You'll despise the characters for their utter stupidity and you will enjoy their plummet into hell.  Also, if you want to know why the fuck people are talking about the \"nice boat\" either in public or 4chan, watch it and love to hate it as i have.\\n\\n\r\nOyea one more thing. I'm not entirely sure but i think in the game, every other girl in the anime gets fucked........as in...by makoto........in the vagina",

            "content": "When an anime has a high level of drama like School Days, it is best to keep it serious. This mixture of intense drama and comedy is not compatible. The forced humor is obvious, especially in the first 2-3 episodes. It is mostly due to the sorry excuse for a harem male character. Some scenes may be so ridiculous that they're laughable anyway. Indeed, School Days delivered the brutality of high school life well, and the scenes are likely to draw anger or sympathy from the viewer. Creators had the right idea for a love triangle, but it was not executed properly.\r\nStory (5)\r\nHigh school involvesyour typical drama (betrayal, bullying, heartbreak, psychological trauma, etc.). School Days does a good job at focusing on these themes. It is thanks to the characters\u2019 heartfelt emotions that is likely to spark certain reactions from the viewer. It began on a good level with the introduction of a love triangle. It was more easygoing just following the three MCs, but later came the downfalls and the quickened pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes, along with the anime\u2019s OP, spoils the anime beforehand by revealing nearly the entirety of what\u2019s to come. Some characters\u2019 connected pasts were not revealed, leaving only the viewer\u2019s imagination with dialogue. Everything is rushed in the final three episodes with complex subplots that are left slightly unfinished. Well, the ending destroyed all hope of furthering those subplots anyway. The way the show ended was completely unnecessary and quickly turns away from the anime\u2019s theme. It seems like the creators ran out of ideas and picked the most shocking, frightening way to say \u201cThe End.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters contributed to the dramatic theme, even if they highly lacked in character development. Mature high school harems are likely to involve a selfish playboy who cares only about fulfilling his sexual desires, but School Days has the most emasculate harem male character. From the start, Makoto was always clumsy and embarrassing himself at every turn. He is constantly indecisive with either someone always speaking for him or being hesitant and irresponsible for his actions. Therefore, none of the events resulted from his own actions, and he only changed later when he reached a dead end. \\n\\n\r\nSekai and Kotonoha both remain clueless and hopelessly in love with Makoto. They never develop on a positive note by moving on or anything comparable. Despite having feelings for Makoto, Sekai spent the beginning of the series playing Cupid and a love counselor for Makoto and Kotonoha. Then she basically spends the remainder of the series confusing Makoto\u2019s lust for love. Kotonoha is a shy girl who sadly catches hell from nearly everyone, and it begins to take a toll on her psychologically. Her emotions triggered darkness and despair. Since the anime revolves around a love triangle, I didn't expect much from Sekai and Kotonoha. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the supporting characters were there to intensify the drama, especially Kotonoha\u2019s bullies. I disliked how those characters are given decent airtime at the last minute. The rushed ending immediately takes away all hope of learning more about them or their connections with the three MCs.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) / Sound (8)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is the basic big and bright-eyed characters with slim bodies, but it draws attention to one or two characters with smaller eyes and different facial structures. Also, Makoto\u2019s face is noticeably chubby compared to the others. The camera continually concentrated on femininity, stressing the perverted thoughts of Makoto. The colors are dark and kind of bland, giving off a depressing feeling. The backgrounds were well-designed.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects were superb, and the OP and EDs suited the anime\u2019s atmosphere. I see the OP (\u201cInnocent Blue\u201d by DeviceHigh) as displaying the hopeful feelings for Sekai and Kotonoha\u2019s chances with Makoto. Sample of the lyrics: \u201cEven if it takes a detour, I want these feelings to go straight to you.\u201d Because of OP\u2019s tune, it\u2019s easy to tell that School Days is based off a game. There are 8 EDs in all, and I didn\u2019t like the constant changes for every episode, but they admittedly suited the mood shifts of the anime. Apart from that, the background music matched the moods perfectly within the anime. The seiyuu portrayed the voices of the characters very well, while ensuring that the display of personalities are genuine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6) / Overall (5)\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is definitely unforgettable, because it\u2019s rare to see a shockingly unforeseen ending like that one. There are other drama anime like Rumbling Hearts and White Album 2 that easily surpass School Days, and I definitely don\u2019t plan to re-watch School Days again. It\u2019s entertaining with the drama and the characters\u2019 genuine emotions, but Makoto can be unbearably annoying. As a result, I laughed most of the time, but I sympathized with Kotonoha the most. It\u2019s likely that none of these characters are likeable, because there is no development. They all remain the same and became worse as the series continues. Overall, School Days had a good motive, but it was far from reaching its goal.",

            "content": "'School Days\u2019 is often mistakenly categorized under different genres that it does not really belong to. While the series contains some elements of certain genres such as harem and romance, it doesn\u2019t really belong to either one. It is a harem in the sense that more than one girl likes the male lead and it is a romance because there are romantic encounters and confessions throughout the series. However, in my view, \u2018School Days\u2019 can only be categorized as a psychological drama.\r\nThe story revolves around the male lead character Itou, Makoto. In the beginning of the series, Itou is living the typical harem malelead lifestyle. He is a somewhat perverted, single, high school student who has his eye on Katsura, Kotonoha who attends the same school as he does and often rides the same train as him to and from school where he often watches her from a distance. One day, through mere coincidence, the girl that sits next to Itou in class, Saionji, Sekai, learns about his feelings for Katsura and although it appears that Saionji also has some feelings for Itou, she decides to help Itou get together with Katsura. Just a short time into the story, Itou asks Katsura out and they begin dating. However, everything changes when Itou realizes he now has feelings for Saionji, the very matchmaker that brought him together with his girlfriend. This marks the beginning of disastrous psychological typhoon that wrecks everyone and everything in its path leaving plenty of tears and blood along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThis show being a psychological drama makes the characters, their desires, and thought patterns of exceptionally great importance. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character of the story, Itou, Makoto is an absolutely detestable pathetic excuse for a human being that I guarantee you will hate with utmost passion. He is a sociopath with absolutely no regard for anything but his own desires and walks all over anyone and everyone to satisfy his own wants and needs. He cheats, lies, and changes his mind often. With the exception of one or two instances in his past, he does not seem to possess any kind of redeeming qualities. Of course, for unknown reasons the girls can\u2019t seem to get enough of him and even those who originally have no interest in him join the party to see what all of the fuss is about.\\n\\n\r\nThe two lead female characters, Katsura, Kotonoha and Saionji, Sekai form the other two corners of the original love triangle that the story revolves around. Katsura is beautiful and yet very reserved and has had no experience with boys before Itou. Saionji is also beautiful but very outgoing and energetic. Each girl has her own charms and enough of it to confuse Itou quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters of the series, there is plenty to hold the viewer\u2019s interest. Itou\u2019s former middle-school classmate Kato, Otome who goes out of her way to bully Katsura any chance she gets out of jealousy and Saionji\u2019s best friend Kiyoura, Setsuna who may have a secret crush on Itou, along with several other fantastic characters make this great story into an excellent Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animations are beautiful. I love the way the characters and sceneries are drawn and the animations are smooth and consistent. There is also a healthy level of fan service throughout the series that goes well with the story and feel of the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fantastic for each and every character. The voices match the characters\u2019 looks and personalities and as always, that greatly helps the viewer become much more absorbed in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is well done but nothing special enough to talk too much about. I am not usually one for opening and ending songs in anime series and I mostly skip them; However, I did enjoy the ending song of this show quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nATTENTION: The next paragraph talks about the ending. While I will not include any specifics about what happens at the end of the series, I will talk about the style and quality of the ending. If you feel this might spoil things for you, skip over the next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nIt is kind of difficult to talk about the ending of this particular show without giving away the specifics so I will keep this short and sweet. The ending is very intense and although I somewhat foresaw what was coming, the ending still blew me away. Also, you are likely to experience a great deal of satisfaction with at least one part of the conclusion to this series.\\n\\n\r\nIn sum, do not mistake \u2018School Days\u2019 for a lighthearted romance or harem Anime series. It is nothing of the sort. The story is intense, and it unfolds with the same level of intensity. This show is most definitely meant for an adult or young adult audience. If you generally enjoy psychological Anime, you will probably love this show, and if you don\u2019t this series might just be what it takes to get you interested in the genre.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: \u2018School Days\u2019 is a twelve-episode series, but there are also two OVAs titled \u2018School Days - Magical Heart Kokoro-chan\u2019 and \u2018School Days - Valentine Days\u2019. These two OVAs are not in the least bit related to the plot of the \u2018School Days\u2019 TV series and frankly they are horrible. If you are planning on watching the \u2018School Days\u2019 series along with the OVAs, or if perhaps you have already watched the series and plan to watch the OVAs next, I recommend that you hold off and not watch the OVAs. Watching them will serve no purpose other than to waste your time and annoy you.",

I've watched plenty of romance anime and have enjoyed them, but from the first episode I was already bored and only continued watching for the ending, which once I saw I was indifferent about it. So this anime get's such a low rating because it's boring. If you're looking for drama go look somewhere else because if you're like me you'll only be disappointed and bored.\r\nThe entire story sucks and takes forever to get going and once it does it ends pretty quickly. I also thought the characters are all rather unlikeable. Ican't seem to find anything to counterblance that. When you have a story that can be done in about two or three episodes you should do it in two or three episodes to avoid boring people who actually expect something well done. So for a crappy prolonged story that's rather who cares to begin with I can't give it a higher score.",

            "content": "~ Makoto: I'm the worst ~\r\nThe most accurate quote in the entire show\r\n[TL;DR Below]\r\nAn example of great artistic intent - that isn't fully supported by technical merit.\r\nIt's probably the most infuriating show I've come across. But this aspect in itself does NOT rub off negatively on the quality. To summarize: It is a dark and powerful production oriented about deception, desperation, love and betrayal. Make no mistake: it seems to hide behind an uninspiring \"Slice of Life/Romance\" facade to begin with; but soon you'll start to see its true colours (about at the halfway mark).\r\nSchool days is a frighteningly effective and manipulative anime that willdestroy everything you've come to know of conventional \"protagonists\". Now there are reasons as i'll come to discuss why School Days isn't the best in some areas, but it GENUINELY BAFFLES ME why so many people DO NOT UNDERSTAND that passionate feelings of \"hatred\" and \"I can't comprehend X character's stupidity\" are not demerits. Is it not obvious that If a show can invoke such feelings in the viewer and cause such a stir, that it has SUCCEEDED at being a psychological anime?!\\n\\n\r\nIf you're still unsure of what a \"Psycho-Manipulative\" production entails, It basically means that it breaks the \"4th Wall\". An example could be an extremely emotional anime that makes you cry.\\n\\n\r\nNow that's out of the way, onto the analysis...\\n\\n\r\nSchool days plunges you into a highly unoriginal and predictable school setting. There's no unique selling point to the premise alone, so i'll keep it brief. It's an appropriately \"ordinary\" setting that enhances the realism of\\n\r\nthe real-world drama to come - But is difficult to credit in this area. \\n\r\nWait! Don't Go! There's more...\\n\\n\r\nWhile slow to begin with, School Days is an impactful story of lust and deception; a crescendo of unforeseen misery. Its fraught with passion on one end, and ignorance on the other. To begin with, it may deceivingly appear to be a \"boy sees girl\" tale of bland romance, but it is FAR from that. \\n\r\n\"Okay\", \"How nice\" are words I came into the anime saying. \"Wow\", \"Jesus...\", are the words I left with.\\n\r\nSchool Days is a show that makes great use of dramatic irony; empowering the viewer with an all-seeing eye that even foreshadows some of the controversies to come. FAR from a romance story, or even more accurately: a story of infatuation... School Days is incredibly dramatic, and at the same time: very frustrating to watch. It plays off the general concept of \"love and loss\" through a seemingly unending string of bad decisions on the main character's part. Starting off as lust, and then a lust-triangle, followed by a lust-hexagon: School Days' plot escalates in complexity exponentially, and a great deal of uneasiness and weight is added with every expansion to our polygon.\\n\\n\r\nAs is mostly evident from the female characters, as opposed to our \"protagonist\" who appears to retain the same naivety throughout... emotional struggle becomes an overriding theme; from many directions. The decisions of the characters surrounding Makoto become increasingly unpredictable, and all of the drama just stacks and stacks relentlessly; culminating in a brilliant explosion of action at the show's conclusion. The event-driven plot, and the way that everything initially goes in favour of Makoto's stupidity, exists to annoy. The story itself is certainly more complex than you likely think it may be, and its great at enhancing the sheer awkwardness, and frustration of the developingly \"taboo\" situations that continually arise throughout.\\n\r\nThere's not really much else to say about a story revolving so closely to the rather commonly documented themes of romance and greed, but its a bleak and disturbingly plausible chain of events that leave you with an appreciable message: \"Cherish what you have, and do not be a slave to temptation\". Therefore, while far from innovative or unique, the story compliments the characters and realistic setting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is a significant area generally for any show that can't rely on relentless action sequences, so lets get straight to the good stuff... Makoto, also known as our main character... \\n\\n\r\nSimply put, School Days doesn't have a protagonist... Makoto is the antagonistic, parasitic, narcissistic, manipulative, borderline sociopathic, and infinitely detestable face of the show. He is to an extent the POV character, and this gives the viewer a very intimate insight into his never-ending, selfish, naive, and uncaring personality. During these 12 episodes, you will watch as while he is undeservedly presented with ample opportunity for a meaningful relationship; he simply ruins everything he touches. I mean this quite literally.\\n\\n\r\nMy hate for this character is completely off the scale, as his naivety: selfish, and inconsiderate personality couldn't possibly be more prominent or blatent. Yet as much as I uphold my desire to see him suffer as a result of his purely callous acts, the show wouldn't be the same without him. \"Makoto\" brings to light a disturbingly plausible and selfish, sexually-driven male attitude that makes you more aware of the barbaric implications and effects of harems, because at the end of the day: we have to fight our most primitive of desires. School Days certainly reflects this often barbaric behavior in an deceivingly \"mature\" and \"civilized\" society. Or as you may prefer to see it: there are simply a lot of dick-ish men out there, who don't really care for anything beyond lust, or themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days utilities a range of colorful personalities, who for some reason, can't get enough of our ridiculously stupid MC. Its a deliberately convenient setup of hidden feelings, clinginess, and fantasy up taken by the range of surprisingly illogical female characters. From the rather air-headed and naive (for the most part) Kotonoha, to the awkward and suppressed feelings of Sekai... It wouldn't be wrong to say that they're all practically slaves to Makoto's unexplained influence. This obviously works in favour for presenting such a frustrating story consisting of so much ruined opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the setup is appropriate, if not a little \"too appropriate\" to a cringy and shallow extent. There is an interesting degree of development on top of these thoroughly incomprehensible female thought processes. I've got to give credit to the way in which School Days very vividly conveys the emotional struggle and plights of the developing, fragile female personalities - which gradually become thoroughly battered as a result of Makoto's interactions. They bring with them, complex feelings of sympathy and \"maybe THEY'RE the real victim\" here to the mix. The evolving and damaged female characters continually posing the question: who is in the wrong?\\n\\n\r\nIn hindsight, I can honestly say that NOBODY in this show has a moral high-ground. With the exception of the overly accepting Sawanaga (who's basically just a novelty supporting fall-guy), none of the characters can really be described as \"reasonable people\". Undeniably then, School Days is a dark show indeed...\\n\\n\r\nArt?\\n\r\nThings are a little sub-par here. With the exception of the last 2 episodes, School Days has a tendency to overuse still frames. The detail is pretty low, and so it could have been greatly improved.\\n\r\nA notably lazy animation style.\\n\\n\r\nSound?\\n\r\nDelicate, beautiful, and worthwhile. The music is phenomenal, which conflicts a lot with the expanse of flaws in many other departments, as i'll get to right now...\\n\\n\r\nFLAWS\\n\r\nWhile the psychological aspect of the show, the drama, and topics are striking. It is on the other hand quite cheap: the way in which such devices: foreshadowing and flashbacks included, are used in an attempt to cover up a significant amount of flaws. While I could argue that impact on the viewer can scale with quality, School Days is as said initially - an example of great artistic merit and abstract approach (ie: the psychological aspect), that isn't executed to its best ability.\\n\\n\r\nSetting Makoto aside, the female characters are all undeniable completely irrational. Perhaps the biggest flaw with the anime is that... it never really explained WHY all these girls are falling \"in love\" so easily. They're all complete tools: some of which are barely elaborated upon atall. When you pair this with the painfully unimaginative, SoL styled love story to begin with - one can see why the technical merit, is just not on par with the artistic intent.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days looks polished as a package, and as a whole: the story is quite dramatic, breaks the fourth wall, develops the characters, and even comes with a message. With everything together, I can accept it as a successful psychological, unpredictable show; with a genuinely hard-hitting aspect of emotional struggle.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the ending, and want to be able to give a mark that scales with the passion I felt while watching. Its just that I can't deny the very noticeable gaps in logic when you start to deconstruct things...\\n\\n\r\n~ Am I not good enough? ~\\n\\n\r\n[TL;DR]\\n\r\n[+] Hard-hitting reflection of adultery in the modern world\\n\r\n[+] Good message of cherishing what you have, and the destructive potential of infatuation\\n\r\n[+] Main female characters develop quite well, as a lot of \"struggle\" is conveyed\\n\r\n[+] Story gets heavy and interesting beyond episode 6, and takes some unpredictable twists\\n\r\n[+] Good ending\\n\\n\r\n[-] Lazy animation quality\\n\r\n[-] Boring and slow story prior episode 6\\n\r\n[-] The females are all completely devoid of logic\\n\r\n[-] Generally un-innovative\\n\\n\r\nHad the technical aspect better supported my liking for the edginess of this show: 9/10\\n\r\nReality, as a reviewer: 5.5/10\\n\r\nReality as myself, with a liking for the psychological power, and dark twists: 7/10",

            "content": "Back when I was younger, I believed that if a movie or a television series or a game didn't end happily, then it wasn't worth getting involved with. However, as I matured, I realized that there are titles that can be just as fulfilling to watch as the feel-good ones that choose to end in a cheery manner. This may be due to a \"change of pace,\" or something that intrigues me or others simply because it is different from what I or they are originally accustomed to. If one is to truly appreciate what they've come to enjoy, would they rather bask in thattopic forever? Or perhaps explore other topics in order to see what would meet their interests the most? While opinions will always differ, one thing is certain: human beings aren't play things. Emotions are what make a person who they are and constitute to what they believe in. But in some cases, these emotions can turn on oneself, if manipulated by an outside source.\\n\\n\r\nReferring back to my opening statement, the decision to remain faithful is an important part of what School Days means to convey. School Days is an anime about high school, which is nothing short of truly original. However, School Days doesn't follow the typical make up of what school-oriented romantic comedies tend to abide by. Instead, it decides to turn the best possible scenario into the worst possible scenario through the enflamed emotions of students in heat. A single action can have major implications for events to come.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days takes place in an unnamed rural town and is normally shown from typical settings in school themed anime. The train station, the classroom, the characters' homes; places of that nature. It begins with our hero, Makoto, as he narrates about how he's \"taken an interest\" in a quiet girl who rides the train with him everyday on his way to school. This quiet girl turns out to be Kotonoha, a fellow student of his school and an all-around gentle person. He proceeds to take a picture of this girl, while never speaking a word to her, because of an in-school rumor stating that if you take a picture of a someone you like on your cell phone and keep it a secret from everyone you know for a pre-determined time, you'll eventually get together. It's this action alone that shows that School Days began with what many would assume to be another typical high school romance. Unfortunately for Makoto, his myth is ruined when a female classmate named Sekai barges over and catches him gazing over the picture of Kotonoha on his phone. His luck turns when Sekai offers to help him get together with Kotonoha for absolutely no reason. Her efforts are successful and the two eventually get together, but at a cost.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the unprecedented attention towards this anime comes from the decisions Makoto makes throughout the entirety of the anime. After getting together with Kotonoha, he begins to behave differently from the all-too-familiar submissive main male lead that the anime industry has turned into a cultural norm. To this, I would suggest is because of experimentation. As any experienced anime viewer would know, not many anime titles feature a main male lead who has enough bravado to chase after his physical desires. While they may fantasize about it, fantasy and reality are two completely different experiences. The trouble with this is that Makoto becomes unlikable and unrelatable to those who choose to watch the anime. And because of this, the overall enjoyment of viewing this anime is likely to turn for the worst. One can only applaud the decision to take the road less traveled.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Makoto is seen in a negative light, Kotonoha has a similarly opposite effect. The viewer genuinely feels bad for her, knowing that she doesn't have the will to stand up for herself while at the same time she's kind (or naive) enough to forgive Makoto for his actions. Not only this, but she's later bullied by virtually everybody in the series through strings and misunderstandings about her relationship with Makoto that even she makes decisions she regrets. Kotonoha is the perfect sob story, while Makoto is the perfect villain. Everyone's roles are established and they perform them well, if only for an instant.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the minor characters, they take part in the story by either making Kotonoha look better or Makoto look worse. It's almost pitiful to see some characters disappear for a few episodes, only to have them return for a couple minutes in order to relegate themselves for the sake of the plot. What's more disappointing is that some of the minor characters had potential to become something more than background space, but are usually disregarded halfway through the series for the sake of the main characters' reputations.  School Days also likes to give off the impression that gossip travels fast around a student body. Whether this be true or not, it served the plot well, both realistically and half-heartedly. The absence of adults in this series is also a subject of this series' lack of realism, but it's minor compared to others aspects of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for School Days actually impressed me. For an anime airing in 2007, I could have sworn it was made by the turn of the new decade. The character designs are nice to look at, while at the same time standing out from the dull background. What this could imply is that the importance of the series is based on the characters and not their surroundings. As long as nothing slips outside the realm of School Days' logic, nothing is at risk of being criticized. Nothing looked out of place and the expressions were as gut-wrenching as the drama within. Other than the unnecessary fan service outside of the hot and heavy scenes, I have no complaints about the style of animation. Just a nice looking moving picture.\\n\\n\r\nTo say I didn't enjoy watching this series would be less of an understatement and more like a joke. Words like horrifying, disgusting, revolting, vile, gross or repulsive don't even compare to the feeling deep within the pit of my stomach as I watched the second half of this series. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, it did. Just when I thought the characters wouldn't act any more irrational, they did. This title takes the expectations of a light-hearted, romantic drama and beats it into the ground. The characters' actions are worthy of controversy. Their mindsets could be compared to an unstable dam, withering away at the amount of sheer force with which the waves of reality strike them. The ending sums up the worst possible scenario and makes it a reality, taking any likability away from each character in the series, whether it be because they weren't developed enough or their final decisions proved disappointing. This is not a happy anime. But then again, it's not supposed to be.",

The  soundtrack wasn't horrible by any means.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nI give this a 10 because the creators did a bang up job of creating the worst examples of human beings possible. I'll sum it up, pretty simply.\\n\r\nThe Main : Innocent enough until he gets some action between the sheets. Then all his morals fly out the window. He becomes the biggest arsehole in history. You might agree, you might not but to me he is the worst possible case of a teenage guy. If you think your boyfriend is being a dick, watch this. Seriously.\\n\r\nThe Shy one: Can't say I blame her, her personality doesn't hold up well to the emotional and psychological battering she receives throughout the course of this anime. In the end........ well demented doesn't quite cover it.\\n\r\nThe Lively one: On the face of it, she'd be the faraway lover of the main who sacrifices everything for his happiness. Not here. She becomes the unbelievably selfish attention whore who gets her heart repeatedly stamped on but still doesn't get the message.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\r\nYou can't enjoy this anime unless you're the sick and twisted individual who get their kicks from watching torture, for want of a better word. However the anime is definitely an interesting watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nThe characters carry this anime for me. I'm not sure any set of characters will ever be hated more than these but they make for an entertaining watch, for all the wrong reasons.

Hell, if i were an MTV executive who wants to make an anime in Japan, School Days would be it. \r\nBefore i go further, let me tell you abut one man named Tucker Max. He was an Ivy League graduate of DukeUniversity and around 2007 (The same year School Days was aired), he published a book called \"I Hope They Served Beer in Hell\" which tells of Tucker's harem tales of all the chicks he fucked.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you adapt \"I Hope They Served Beer in Hell\" into a harem anime with a twist ending, then you basically got an entire series of School Days.

And then, a love triangle occurs which turns into a hexagonal bullshit harem between Makoto and almost every female character in this series which ends up as a display of really nice boats.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the story. Once you finished this series you'll start thinking \"WTF did i just watch?\" It's simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of WTF, let's talk about the characters. Seriously, this anime has the worst characters ever. The guys are douchebags and the girls are sluts. Makoto starts off as a clueless generic harem lead, but by the end of the series he becomes a dick-waving asshole that he even makes The Situation from Jersey Shore look good. And every character in this series wants Makoto's dick. Hell, they even turn the only sane character Nanami into a slut despite not wanting Makoto. And i fucking despise Sekai. Seriously, it's her fault for making moves on Makoto in the first place. Hell, she's the reason why Makoto became a douche and why everyone (including herself and Katsura) ended up being shit. She's a horrible woman and she is as bad as Makoto. Hell, Makoto and Sekai deserve each other instead of Katsura. \\n\\n\r\nBut the one thing that kept me from dropping this anime is the visuals, the direction and the sound. I mean, this was disturbingly well-directed and animated. Hell, this was directed by the guy who went on to make Katanagatari. But again, shock value must be well-presented. I mean, A Serbian Film was horrifying but it was still well-directed. And this was well animated for a studio that does primarily low-rate anime and hentai OVAs. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, there's the sound. The seiyuus are pretty good and Daisuke Hirakawa does a great job with Makoto. You also get side-character roles by the likes of A-listers like Chiaki Takahashi and Minami Kuribayashi, but the rest are mostly rookies and c-list seiyuus. And the music is very good. You get OPs and EDs sung by really famous singers like Kanako Itu, Haruko Momoi and others. It's a strong point for this series and the songs done by them fits well with the episodes of this series.\\n\\n\r\nBut sadly good visuals, direction and sound does not justify the douchiness of this anime. In the end of the day, you feel like you're gonna need a drink just to forget that you saw this. \\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch this? Well, i suggest you should try and watch it on a date. Have a 6-hour marathon of this pissfest with your girlfriend with lots of beer and pretzels. See how that goes\\n\\n\r\nBut the only other good thing is that this anime has a really nice depiction of boats. They're so nice, that i even signed up for a membership at a prestigious boat club in Monaco, and now i'm hanging out with ousted dictators, Victoria's Secret models, arms dealers, Republican congressmen and billionaires. So thank you School Days for getting me into boating. You get a credit for that.",

I thought that I could compare to Makoto, because I had gone through similar things. right up until episode 4 when everything changes, from there he just becomes more of a pig just lusting after any woman that talks to him. by the end he just does whatever can get his jollies. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- two thumbs down. so far down that I had to cut off my thumbs and bury them six feet under ground.",

So if you like your characters/plot sadistic, perverted, masochistic, insane, psycho and overly dramatic, you should watch this show.\r\nHowever, if youlike your characters with a modicum of sanity, reasonable pervertedness, a tad of humor, and generally all their braincells... don't watch this.

            "content": "Ok... I'll begin by saying this. School Days Starts of as a regular harem type of  anime . In the beginning, you expect it to be a typical happy-happy sort of show with lots of girls and a lot of higly suggestive scenes but that ends there. Eventually the show develops into something darker and more sinister. The show eventually focuses on the darker side of love. The show eventually centers around a lot of taboo topics such as casual sex, school bullying, underage pregnancies, insanity and even death.\r\nThe story itself is unoriginal. It has the typical love triangle pattern you see in mostharem shows. What saves the story from getting a lower score is that it suddenly takes a highly unexpected turn and catches the viewers off guard.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. The art really stays true to the eroge* its based on. The characters are drawn great and they are pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days should be given credit because of its spectacular array of ending themes. For a short 12 episode anime, it has a hell of a lot of ending themes. From the soothing sounds of &quot;Usotsuki&quot; to the bewildering ballade of &quot;Waltz&quot;, the series has songs to suit anyone's tastes and liking.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is really good. The main protagonist and everyone else are presented well. You can easily see how each one one them changes as the story progresses. For instance, from a shy introverted boy, the main protaganist turns into a playboy. For an anime with only 12 episodes, the character development deserves praise.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I liked School Days. Some people might not agree with me but I myself enjoyed it. I found it very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nHow does it end? Watch and find out.\\n\\n\r\n*eroge- short for erotic game\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nOn the surface, School Days appears to exist simply so it can torture fans of the harem genre. But in actuality, it is a deconstruction/satire with morals (\u201cbe faithful to your significant other\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t treat Women like objects\u201d). However, what lies underneath is not the only thing that matters. The journey from event to event moves at a grueling pace, padded with dialogue, fan service (which operates against the \u201cdon\u2019t treat Women like objects\u201d moral), and gags that fall flat. The events themselves are melodramatic, and supported by illogical actions and cruelty. We are given no prior indication that the characters are capable of whatthey do at the end, so while the ending is shocking and memorable, it seems to come from nowhere. Personally, I felt that there was not enough content to properly fill 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nWhen scenes take place in a populated area, background characters rarely move. This may be true to the original game, but as an anime it comes off as lazy. The female characters have pointy chins, pointy noses, and the same type of animesque eyes. Without the distinct hairstyles, I wouldn\u2019t know the difference between girls. The animation mostly focuses on close-ups, while long shots are almost always a still frame. The color and shading is nothing spectacular, but it is fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\u2018Kanashimi no Mukou e\u2019  is a very memorable song. Other than that, I cannot recall a single note. The theme is forgettable, and the sound-effect gags used in the first couple episodes did nothing for me. The voice acting is good, but in all fairness I\u2019ve never seen a sub anime where the voice actors were terrible. Overall, I\u2019d say there isn\u2019t much to notice in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMakoto starts off as a goofy, likable guy. Personally, I can understand why he started doing what he did, but as the show progressed he became cruel to near sociopathic levels. Sekai was vapid; her oblivious nature is taken to comically stupid levels at times. Kotonoha is meant to be the innocent, naive character but I found her to be rather boring. Come to think of it, there was not a character in this show who was not either boring, vapid, cruel, or naive. There is nobody to relate to, and as the show progressed, it became harder to empathize with anyone. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI thought this show was a boring waste of time. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed the OVA\u2019s way more than I did this anime. The characters do not act like people, intended messages become blurred through hypocrisy, the plot moves slowly and covers very little, and at the end we are left with an ending that amounts to shock value.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend School Days to anyone who hates harems and has the patience of a saint.",

Well, you're not wrong if you thought that, but there was something that intrigued me. \nFor starters, I came across this anime by accident.  Just browsing through romance anime ( like a normal guy (not really) ).  And the brief introduction about this show caught my attention.\nSo as I watched the first episode, I knew that this isn't your regular romance anime.  It was rather different from the ones I've watched.  Just your classmate kissing you after school when she hooked you up with somegirl in another class.  As you do on a regular basis. \\n\\n\nAs I went on, the protagonist changes.  His personality, his desire, his conscience  and his reputation of himself.  In the beginning, he was just a shy, caring person looking for a miracle.  In the end, he lost everything, including his virginity. ( and his life I know)\\n\\n\nThe plot was fair, which could happen to some people in reality, which is completely fine, but what I dislike is the unnecessary H scenes involved.  (never thought a guy would dislike this?) \\n\\n\nWhat I despised most was the characters, mainly the protagonist.  He was so insanely eccentric from reality and is completely nuts.  I mean seriously, reading porn on a date, has he no shame?  Also, getting your classmate to be your \"practice sex partner\" though.  COME ON, that's just sick.\\n\\n\nIn my opinion, for an anime, go for full slice of life, or full insane non realistic plot.  This anime was kind of a bit of both, which makes me hate this.  There is not proper decision made whether this show is either or.  \\n\\n\nThe ending of this show was awful.  I mean, sure he may have cheated on his girlfriend.  Sure he (didn't) knock up his classmate. slept with other women in this school, ignored his best friend, drove his ex mentally insane, and did nothing to improve himself to be a better person.  But seriously, killing people is not right, especially at his house as well.  Whose gonna clean up the mess as well?\\n\\n\nAll jokes aside though, that rooftop ending how the ex sliced up the knocked up girl's stomach, that's just uncalled for.  It's gruesome.  How can anyone enjoy this show in the first place.  Please, if you actually enjoyed this horror, tell me why.\\n\\n\nOverall, this is an awful anime and will definitely not recommend this to anyone ( unless they like horror).",

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for animes that surprise you and turn out to be slightly more disturbing than one may expect, so it was'nt the element of surprise that put me off this anime...\r\nNEVER have i come across such pathetic excuse for characters in my anime life-span. The girls are weak,stupid as fuck, annoying, and disgraceful. And as  for the one main male character (known as Makoto) .. ... Well where the fuck do I even begin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's unbelievably complex to describe why i hate Makoto so much without any spoilers, so instead enjoy this list of British swear words that perfectly describe him:\\n\\n\r\n- Dickhead\\n\r\n-Twat\\n\r\n-Cunt\\n\r\n-Bellend\\n\r\n-Wanker\\n\r\n- Bastard\\n\r\n-Plonker\\n\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, there are moments in the anime that are quite funny and show tremendous potential.

            "content": "all i can say is WOW. This anime started off with your standard shy high school guy who has a crush on a girl. They ride the same train and he sneaks glances at her everyday. He takes a picture of her one day and tries out the phone charm. Its where you keep a picture of the person you like on your phone and if nobody sees it you will fall in love or something like that. Anyways this girl named Saionji sits next to him and class and decides she will help him get the girl he wants. That's the main story lineof this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory- This anime definitely has one of the most interesting story lines. After watching just the first episode you feel like you have to watch more of it. The ending by far is one of the most unexpected and just intense out of any anime I've ever seen and I've seen a bunch of animes with intense endings such as elfen lied and clannad.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I'm not 100% sure but i believe this anime isn't all that new so the art isn't going to be wonderful on it but the characters and story line definitely make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound- I really love the music in this anime. The opening theme really fits in well with the rest of the anime and the right tone of music is played at the right time and really sets the mood of things.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters in here are just amazing. Most animes have your kind of stereotypical archetypes but in this anime the characters are dynamic and changing which doesn't seem to happen in most animes like it should be. All in all you get attached to them and get a real connection to them which is hard to accomplish in a short anime like this but can be pulled off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This anime was really enjoying for me. Every episode leaves you wanting more so you feel like you have to keep watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall this anime was just amazing. It starts off with this guy which i felt like was alot like me, stayed to himself, had a few friends and wasnt good with girls. But he changes alot and that was shocking to me but it made me really like this anime. If you like romances/ physcological animes then this is definitely something you should consider watching.",

            "content": "Welcome to School Days. School Days is an anime where Douche-kun goes around screwing with girls any chance he gets.\r\n(Note: This is my first review, so please don't judge on what I think about this cancer anime.) \r\nStory: 1 \r\nHonestly, what the hell was this story? Douche-kun gets Girl A to help him get together with Girl B. Nothing could've gone wrong with just that right? You're wrong. They get together and for some retarded reason, Douche-kun decides: \"Man, I'm not getting enough HOTNESS. Fuck Girl B, I'm going with Girl A behind her back.\" which is the most retarded thing I've ever heard. Thenqueue 9 more episodes of Douche-kun going back and forth between any girl that throws her panties at him, and you got yourself a \"successful\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nThe art just looks horrible. Of course I can't say that since this an anime from 2007, but damn it looks hella ugly. Just doesn't meet my standards at all. The only thing I found good about the art is at the end where a certain thing happens. Also Boat Ending.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2\\n\r\nThe sounds were bad AND unmemorable. I can't remember anything I heard from the anime, besides Douche-kun's bitch ass voice when porking someone. Again as before, the only sound that was memorable was the ending of the anime. Also Boat Ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1 \\n\r\nThis is the most CANCER part of the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nDouche-kun: Douche-kun is your normal boy going to a normal school who has a crush on a girl. But what we didn't know, is that he was a douche (Surprise right?). Later on we found out he's even more of a douche due to certain things happening with the heroines of the anime. Probably the worst anime character I've ever seen in my life. Like just watch the anime, and you don't even need me to explain what kinda douchebag Douche-kun is.\\n\\n\r\nGirl A: Girl A is your typical \"Hey, I see you like this girl. Let me help you, even tho I actually like you but wanna be a good friend by helping you, even though it clearly blocks my emotions toward you (which she shouldn't even have emotions towards Douche-kun)\" type character. Although she is the best character in the entire anime just because of the ending. You may have noticed I've mentioned the ending A LOT in this review, and that's because the ending is so perfect, that it made me want to hate the anime EVEN MORE.\\n\\n\r\nGirl B: Girl B is your typical \"quiet girl but actually likes you but can also go crazy\" character. She's what starts the anime's plot by using the \"I like this girl but I want her to like me back\" tactic. Girl B is the second best character in the entire anime, because you guessed it: The Ending. The ending in the anime with her in it was just great. She's also the main part of the \"Boat Ending\" (Note: I'll say it now, but this anime doesn't have multiple endings. By boat ending, I mean something that involves a boat in the ending.) \\n\\n\r\nEveryone Else: Taisuke is a \"comedy relief\" character, which just fails at his job in the anime, and makes it EVEN WORSE when you play the School Days Visual Novel. (Since you: Spoiler Alert! Find out he's actually a rapist who doesn't even know the concept of the word \"rape\" which is just retarded). \\n\r\nAll the other females besides Girl A and Girl B are just tools to progress the plot in stupid ways. Honestly how they act near the end of the anime is kinda like they're being sluts which cost a fee for sex.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThe only thing I enjoyed about this anime is the ending, don't need to say more. Period.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1 \\n\r\nThis anime is the WORST anime I've ever watched. The plot is stupid, the characters are just retarded (besides Girl A), the art is ugly (again, it just doesn't fit my standards 2007 or not), the music/sound was unmemorable and just sounded bad (besides the ending), and overall: It's just a bad anime. It doesn't even deserve to be classified as an anime, it should be classified as \"bad fan fiction for sluts and yandere's 101\". People who like this anime, I'm sorry but really? This anime is just horrible. Case Closed.",

            "content": "I keep trying to understand why the School Days grade on MAL is so low. I'm going to give some possible explanations, which obviously does not diminish it as a masterpiece and then tell me whether you agree or not.\r\n1- Perhaps because of the genre School with Slice of Life is not the most popular, and usually most works of these genres do not get good grades, however good some may be. For in general the otakus belong to a specific demography, and the baton shonen are consolidated not leaving much space for the others. Another thing is that a lot of people watched becausethe work was very talked about, however as it was not the genre they would watch, so they did not like it. What makes this anime even more badly rated than most because it has fled its niche.\\n\\n\r\n2 - Perhaps because of the \"bad end\", there are other cases of very good animes that because the finals are not those good cliches have suffered scorn, and to this day many point out as being the reason why School Days is \"bad.\" Already in my assessment, the \"bad end\" is often better than a happily ever after, by daring, by innovation, by realism, by scoring, by passing a stronger message, etc. But that does not mean I do not also like happy endings, just that I will not hate an anime because the ending was harder.\\n\\n\r\n3 - Maybe and this is what really made the difference is the defamation campaign, this wave was made by both specific sites, by influential youtubers, and by the word of mouth itself. It seems that it has become a kind of hobby to speak ill of this anime, and if a person speaks well it will fall on the weight of being against common sense, soon will be censored.\\n\\n\r\n4 - It may be alienation, since defamation only has greater effect through alienation. I see people copying the opinions of each other a lot without making critical evaluations. So often they have works sows that are well-quoted and have masterpieces that are barely seen. People in general are very easily shaped and influenced, including the so-called opinion makers, many times they are just copying one another. This is a pity, it's a disgrace, but it's the truth, because Sicrano or so-and-so said the note goes up, or if he says it's bad.\\n\\n\r\n5 - Maybe he's the protagonist and yes I hated Makoto, but he's a great character. I hate the personality created for him, to her lack of empathy, but I loved the great construction for the anime. Very difficult and daring is to work with a character of this type, but unlike other animes his unpleasant personality has a significant plot function, proof of this is that they could put a more pleasant personality and completely change the story. Unfortunately some people begin to hate the personality of the character, but they do not know to distinguish of the work and by that they evaluate negatively.\\n\\n\r\n6 - Perhaps it is the intellectual limitation of most of the people who attended, not being prepared for all the load of moral content, of real and common situations that the anime passes. Being exactly for all this load that the plot is rich and is wonderful, but not very accepted by those who want only the fanciful, the playful.\\n\\n\r\n7- It may be an emotional issue, the fact is that anime leaves many people feeling bad for days. Unfortunately, many people do not know how to differentiate between an emotion from a good script that touched them, from a feeling that the work is bad. Why does the work make you cry or reflect it is bad? I do not think so. When the work is bad it is not what has affected her emotionally, but it is precisely because she has not passed emotion that makes her bad. Soon is the intensity and regardless if it was joy, sadness, confidence, fear, or surprise that should be punctuated.",

            "content": "Now onto the very controversial School Days. School Days isn't your average slice of life romance where the character never chooses a girl. In fact, Makoto, the main protagonist, makes the choice of getting all of them.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nSchool Days has the advantage of having no plot holes whatsover. Moreover, its story manages to piss off the viewer in less than 4 episodes making it a torture to watch.  After seeing it, you'll even find Guilty Crown good. Its pure awesomeness resides in the fact that once the story is settled you cannot feel anything but hatred towards this anime if you haven't dropped ityet that is. I love how the story has no incoherent developpement (except for the characters but I'll talk about it later) and even manages to please the viewer with its awesome ending. Personnally, I couldn't do anything but love the way School Days ended; it was a burst of freedom.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/8\\n\r\nThe art is just bad. I mean, even for a 2007 anime, the girls aren't even cute and the backgrounds look sooooo freaking rushed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 1/8\\n\r\nBad OST, bad OP, bad ED (did it even have one?). I mean, since the story wasn't great, I didn't expect much in the artistic domain and guess what\u00a0? I didn't get much\u00a0!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nWhy can't I rate it 0! The characters in School Days are beyond illogical. It isn't the sort of \"illogical\" humans can be, it's beyond that. They act in random ways. The character developpement is present within the first few episodes and then it becomes a senseless massacre. The way the chararacters interacted with Makoto was incoherent. Girls went to bed too easily. The script was written in such a bad way, and it is easy to see that it crumbles 3 episodes into the anime. There is still a sub-plot which stays good until it ends but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI've never harbored such feelings of hatred towards an anime. I have to praise School Days for making me feel something while watching it. I quite 'liked' how it pictured the vile human nature but it wasn't  realistic enough for me to buy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1.6/10\\n\r\nA lot of anime come of as average and are easily forgetten but that isn't the case with School Days. This rollercoaster of nothingness manages to make you hate the main protagonist so much and pity all the girls. Kenji was right, it's a conspiracy.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's about it for School Days. Also, no offense but people who say School Days is good because it is a psychological anime are just fucking with you or are trying to play smart. There may be some people who genuinely appreciated this anime but I don't think they are numerous.\\n\\n\r\nHave a nice time watching it, that is if you ever want to watch it.",

            "content": "I feel it's time to lay down some truths about School Days. This delightful little anomaly has managed to become infamous, a universally-reviled attempt at adapting a visual novel that is always either condemned as the worst shit ever to grace the screens of viewers or ironically upheld as a cult classic, mockingly praised for being utterly unique.\r\nIn some ways, I'd agree. In others... Not so much.\r\nThe truth of the matter is, School Days is actually a fairly inspired, creative and even necessary show. It's also pretty intelligent. It's also horrendously terrible. This review is going to have two halves: first, I'm going to explainthe constantly overlooked importance of School Days, and then I'm going to describe my reaction to actually watching the damn thing. Let's go.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, I'd like to take a moment to talk about harems. Before I got into anime, the concept of a harem was about as outlandish as something like anarchy or cannibalism. A pack of women attached to a single man sounded like something reserved for old-world tyrants or a Spinal Tap album cover. Its almost certainly going to be a toxic, manipulative, dehumanizing experience and anyone who stands in the center and pulls the strings in such a situation is pretty much a textbook villain. Right? Well, turns out, anime found a different way to portray this vile concept, over and over again: a single, heightened immaculate male protagonist who is 1. totally oblivious, and 2. too goddamn nice for his own good, who therefore ends up in a situation where large numbers of females constantly fawn over him and attempt to seduce him while he manages to remain in a perpetual state of ignorance and inaction. Apparently, people like this. It makes them feel important or powerful or magnificent as they step into the shoes of this completely unrealistic dude and get a taste of what it feels like to be simultaneously morally righteous and universally adored. The formula sometimes gets shaken up a bit, sure, like in Steins;Gate, and there are even times where even though its textbook harem I can survive it because it's not the focus of the show, like Bakemonogatari. But the fact of the matter is, I can't think of a single instance where the presence of a harem has ever done anything to improve the investment, creativity, or values of a show. The fact of the matter is, it's a pretty twisted scenario. It's a result of a selfish and manipulative person messing with the insecurities and emotions of a number of other people. Every once in a while we get a show like \"The World God Only Knows\" which jabs at the lucrative nature of this far-too common story element, but only once did we get something that truly attacked it with all of its might.\\n\\n\r\nOnly once did we get School Days.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the hate he gets, Makoto Itou is in many ways a more believable character than many of his far more popular counterparts, like Kirito or the beloved Onii-sama. He's a high-school boy who finds himself in a position where a bunch of girls want him at once and he starts fucking as many as he can because he's a sick, borderline-sociopathic spawn of satan. His harem is believable: he leads all of the girls on by showing them attention and compassion whilst simultaneously destroying them because they all know that they aren't anything special to him. He's just a horny womanizer who has no understanding of his emotions and wants to get with people. But YEAH, see, THAT'S HOW HAREMS WORK IN THE REAL WORLD. Unless you live on a commune, if you want to remain the ever-present center of sexual attention in a group of competing girls, you have to be a pretty selfish fucked-up bastard! And if you take part in said circle, it's probably either because you're extremely emotionally insecure and crave compassion of any kind, or because you see this as a good opportunity to get some (for several of the characters in School Days, this is indeed the case.) School Days absolutely despises harems, it hates the genre, it hates the people who feed and support the genre, and it wants to tear back the veil and show people just what it is that they're laughing and blushing over: a disgusting sack of shit. It is the front-runner in the line of attack and an absolutely necessary approach to take if there is to be any hope in ending this idiotic fad.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as I mentioned, this review has two parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe positive terms I have so far used to describe School Days are things like 'inspired' 'innovative' and 'necessary'. Notice how I have not once referred to it as 'good'. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has some of the worst execution I have ever seen on anything, ever. \\n\r\nIt can't hope to ever possibly get its point across. No one is ever going to have the slightest desire to listen to anything that this show has to say, because goddamn Mars of Destruction was directed better than this. I absolutely hated watching this show. It wasn't because I thought that the ideas were bad, it's because how they were presented made it feel like the people behind it had gotten all their knowledge of film from infomercials. I'm pretty sure the artists for this show had about two colors in their palette: grey, and more grey. The character designs are utterly uninspired, to the point where it's difficult to even tell them apart. The animation could be aptly described as \"there is none\", the soundtrack at its best sounds like it's from a bad sitcom, and those aren't even the biggest issues, not by far. The writing is offensively bad: it reminded me of watching \"Maisy\" when I was six years old, except those voice actors seemed to grasp the concept of basic emotions like happy and sad rather than sounding like the pre-recorded features of voicemail. I can't even recall a single goddamn line from the show: it's like what happened was beamed directly into my brain so that my mind could forget the terror of the experience of actually watching it. The characters themselves exist for only one of three purposes: 1. to fuck, 2. to be fucked... Wait, did I say three? Whoops. They don't exist as people whatsoever outside of that, which is simply awful character writing as it is difficult for me to empathize with a character whose entire existence can be summarized with the phrase \"pork bucket\". The pacing reminded me of when I used to play with slinkies and they would get all tangled up and I would just say 'fuck it' and hide them under the bed. This, if anything, did the most damage to the show: watching 11 episodes of pointless womanizing is going to make anyone irrevocably hate what they're watching before they even finish the damn thing, making the point moot. It falls on deaf ears. In the end, that's really the show's undoing: it falls on deaf ears because it's so utterly incompetent at what it does.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I detested each and every moment of watching this show, I still find myself pleading that we get more shows like it. Sure, it probably couldn't been a worse version of itself, but at least it was A version of itself, as opposed to being another fucking Clannad or Sword Art Online. The harem genre is idiotic, it exists only to appease a shallow and lifeless fan-base, and it needs to go. I don't want to see any more of it. If what that takes is a few more shows like School Days to come in and absolutely brutalize it, then I will accept them with opens arms. The fact of the matter is this, though: if the show isn't executed well, no one's going to care. So please, let's have this concept not be produced by the same people next time?",

            "content": "School Days is one of those anime that I was asked to review because one of my lovely fans wants to see me chastise it in the name of intellectualism. Of course, that doesn't mean I'm going to. I haven't watched it yet, so I could find that I actually enjoy it. After all, there have been anime I've been asked to review on the grounds that \"they're amazing\" that were incapable of standing up to scrutiny. The reverse is liable to happen eventually. What I'm getting at is that I'm not going to go into this expecting it to be bad. It might verywell be, but there's also the possibility that it will be good. The anime is based off of a visual novel. It was handled by TNK, the studio behind Kannazuki no Miko, Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora, Hand Maid May and some stuff I've never seen. Let's take a look and see if it's as bad or better than I've been told.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot... I'm not sure how deeply I can get into details without giving spoilers for this one, honestly. There's a student in secondary school named Makoto who has a crush on a quiet girl, Kotonoha, he always sees reading. A girl who sits next to him, Sekai, offers to help him start a relationship with Kotonoha. At first it seems like it's going to be a typical and kind of boring teenage romance, but it rapidly spirals downwards, becoming progressively stupider and more soap operaesque as the series continues. On the plus side, it has a brilliantly tragic ending that legitimately makes you feel for the characters. Wait... I was thinking of Wolf's Rain. School Days has an unintentionally hilarious ending that's supposed to be tragic. Let's just say that bad things happen to terrible people and the execution is absurdly over the top. The writers apparently didn't know that the characters have to be at least somewhat sympathetic or interesting in order for the audience to care what befalls them.\\n\\n\r\nYou can probably guess where I'm going to go with the character discussion based on the preceding paragraph. The characters in this are awful. Makoto is one of the most despicable characters you'll ever see in the lead role of a harem anime. On the plus side, the dynamic between the main two female characters is brilliantly written and develops very organically, culminating in a very adorable scene. Wait, I was thinking of El Cazador de la Bruja. The female characters in School Days represent one-note misogynistic stereotypes. I probably don't even have to say this, but they're all dumber than your average origami crane. Most of them serve little purpose aside from being objectified by the narrative. I'm not exaggerating when I say that every character in this is horrible and/or stupid. The dynamics are just ridiculous. With the female characters blaming each other whenever Makoto does something terrible. Right up until the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is pretty meh. It looks like a kind of standard school life anime. Nothing really stands out in it except for the amazingly drawn tanks. And those fight scenes are just... Wait, that's Girls und Panzer. Yeah, there's nothing special about the art in School Days. The biggest problem it has is the excessive fan-service. Which is frequently used to pad out scenes or in pointless still shots. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this doesn't really stand out. Kawagari Shiho's performance stood out more in Koihime Musou, and she played a character whose shtick was being thoroughly unremarkable. The voice acting isn't bad, but it's not good either. The music is just largely forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor in this is pretty high. The pink haired android and the girl with the glasses are an excellent couple with... Wait, that's Steel Angel Kurumi 2. School Days doesn't have any yuri. The yuri factor is a 1/10. \\n\\n\r\nBefore we move on to the final rating, I'm going to take a moment to discuss what School Days might have been about. From least to most likely, here are four things that could have been the point of the series. 1. Men are terrible and women should go forth and be lesbians. This is a possible theme for the series, but it's not very likely since it doesn't have any les-yay and the female characters are almost as bad as the male ones. 2. People are just terrible and stupid as a group and they should be exterminated. This one's also pretty unlikely, unless School Days is a Dalek propaganda piece, but it could be the point. I certainly found myself thinking about the worst aspects of humanity while watching it. 3. The whole thing is a PSA against teenage sex. It certainly is possible given the Japanese cultural stigma attached to teenage sex and the content. 4. It's just a bad soap opera and has no point. That's most probable. One of these days someone is going to want me to chastise something in the name of intellectualism and I'm not going to, because it'll actually be something good, but this is not that day. This day I grab my red pen, adjust my spectacles and chastise away. School Days is awful. The main character is horrible and the secondary characters are all obnoxious morons. the story wouldn't be out of place in a bad soap opera and it was so uninteresting overall that I kept thinking about other, better anime. Even while just talking about it. My final rating is a 2/10 for excessive stupidity. I can really only suggest watching it if you like soap operas about exceedingly dumb people.",

            "content": "Two lovers agreed to make their tryst in a seedy motel where they proceed to fall into the lakes of one another. Passion, pain, pleasure envelop the room creating a mist hinted with romance. You see, one of them has sworn their heart to another yet she remains unaware. This is the essence of School Days.\r\nSchool Days is an anime that can undoubtedly evoke a plethora of different feelings: disgust, anger, sadness and emptiness. It is not a pleasant viewing, nor is it an enjoyable one but in the end it will linger in your mind like a guilty memory. Are School Days worthy ofall this hate? Or perhaps something more substantial lingers underneath the surface?\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days starts off a typical high school romance show; a young man, Makoto Itou, has a crush on a girl who isn\u2019t aware of his existence named Kotonoha. He wants to approach her but lacks the courage to do so. One day, one of Makoto\u2019s female classmate, Sekai, notices Makoto gazing at a picture of Kotonoha and makes it her business to help him in pursuit of his romance, but things quickly begin to unravel.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days avoids the typical romance formula and gets to the confession during the second episode. It doesn\u2019t waste time and gets to the romance head on. What lies beyond is a torrent of lust, betrayal, lies and unbridled passion.  We quickly begin to see characters fall to their lesser, more selfish desires at the cost of others. They don\u2019t act out of ignorance but with malicious intent. They understand the reprecussions of their actions but they don\u2019t care.  That is what makes school days so unique. It isn\u2019t afraid to break its characters down to the point where they are nothing but primal human instincts. Essentially, School Days transcends its genre and becomes a character study. Characters change throughout the story, most of the times for the worst.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several twists and turns in School Days, but almost none of them are the result of contrivance. Every action makes sense in the context of the character. Characters never act like assholes just because the plot demands it; they do it because in it is in line with their pre-established character. Take the male protagonist, Makoto Itou for example. The reason he cheats on Kotonoha is because their relationship lacks physical and emotional intimacy, which causes him great unhappiness. His descent into a lothario is slow and gradual.  He realizes he gets no satisfaction from his current relationship, and begins to pursue Sekai, who is more than willing to appease him.\\n\\n\r\nThe love triangle continues to become more intense as the show progresses. Although there are several sex scenes, they are all laced with feelings of guilt and remorse. You can see Makoto and Sekai struggle with their guilt and all the while Kotonoha is unaware. The moments are handled with care and don\u2019t rely on screams and tears to convey the sadness. All the feelings are expressed minimally and with great restraint. This only serves to add to its atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe female characters are also not merely sex dolls. They all have their reasons for wanting to have sex with Makoto. Some of them had crushes on him since they were children. Others because Makoto stood up for them or protected them. Some just heard he has good dick. Even the most superficial reasons have a realistic element to them because that superficiality exists in the real world. You don\u2019t need a grand reason to be attracted to someone.\\n\r\nThe primary love interests are not merely there to appease Makoto; they also have their personalities and back stories. Kotonoha was bullied as a child by both boys and girls. Thus, she has a hard time connecting both physically and emotionally with others. Sekai struggles with depression and loneliness and will do anything to feel wanted. Her mother is constantly working and she rarely ever sees her. All of these details affect the dynamic of the love triangle. This adds delicate shading to the romance and makes it all the more compelling. \\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is not perfect, however. There are moments that are too extreme that break the immersion. The ending is one of those moments. School Days maintained a level of believability by balancing action and consequence.  Also, at points it becomes too depressing to enjoy even. That isn\u2019t a technical flaw, but for the viewer you will easily become emotionally drained after several episodes. There are also, the occasional instances of boredom where nothing seems to occur. However, these flaws don\u2019t affect the overall package.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is many different things to different people: trash, disgusting, disturbing, and brilliant, genius, a work of satire, a work targeted towards perverts. When leaving School Days, I can honestly say I was left in awe. What it bad? Was it good? It left me with a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. But now, I can see that school days is something I don\u2019t regret watching. If you have the high fortitude, I recommend you give school days a try. \\n\\n",

            "content": "School Days. It's like Nickelback. You either love it or you hate it. I'm going to be honest here. I really liked this anime. Why? I have no idea. I even went through the trouble of playing the visuel novel and reading the mangas (I'm not 5, I'm mature enough to not freak out over visuel novels. It was similar to a very sexual dating sim.. And I wanted to get an ending where Makoto dies.) But I'm going to review this anime from an unbiased professional perspective. So, here we go.\r\nThe story gets a mediocre score of 5. The beginning was a tad slowwith Sekai trying to get Makoto and Kotonoha together. You would like it if you were interested in dramas or something like that. The middle was just filled with Makoto being an ASSHOLE. It wasn't too interesting. But there isn't much to expect from an anime based off a hentai visuel novel. I didn't rate this any lower because of the ending. It made me so happy to see the \"brutal\" ending. I feel as though the ending was the only thing setting the anime to be a good as it is to anyone. And I'm not saying that the anime is good in general. I mean it would be worse to people if the ending wasn't there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art wins a fair rating of 6. I didn't think the art was outstanding. Simple cell shading. Something that a amateur anime artist could do. It's stylized, I guess, so I can't hate on the it too much. I was upset with Makoto's character design. He seems too plain looking to attract all those damn girls. But, again, hentai visuel novel.\\n\\n\r\nSounds, also, wins a fair 6. The ending of the last episode really suited the atmosphere. Also, I really liked the song where Sekai and Makoto were dancing at the bonfire and Kotonoha got raped. The song seemed sweet yet sad at the same time. It represented those three character in that moment really well. Opening and ending were pretty generic. Not much to say about them. The sound was decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter gets a staggering score of.. 4 (decent). They did a great job of Makoto being such a hated character! If that was their intention, at least. Makoto is just a douche who can die in a hole. He didn't learn any lesson and is just a selfish prick throughout the whole anime. Sekai's development is alright. She's also really hated for certain reasons but I can understand why she's doing it. It's not right that she was doing it but she did. She's a teenager for crying out loud; a time where a lot of people makes mistakes. She realized it when she was willing to confess and come clean about everything. Kotonoha's character is quite ridiculous. She goes crazy over Makoto within a week???? The fact that she's yandere is odd. There was no reason for her to be. It's not as if she's suffered from any previous relationships because Makoto was her first and only boyfriend. I didn't really like Kotonoha. Clearly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment takes the cake with a very good score of 8. I really did enjoy this anime. I don't know why. I just did. Maybe it was because of all the build up frustration from Makoto was just appealed at the ending. A very satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rate it a 7. Like I said in the beginning, you either love it or you hate it. I actually suggest you watch it. Not because I like it but because it's an interesting experience to watch School Days. Whatever decision you make, have fun, you visuel-novel-lovers.",

            "content": "When I first decided to watch this anime, it was simply because I thought the two main girls looked cute and the name 'School Days' sounded like a typical slice of life/high school anime. If you're thinking what I thought, think again. School Days is a very psychological anime that shows how relationships/romance isn't all hearts and flowers. When people talk about School Days, it's usually \"wow that anime is so messed up\" or \"that anime is a work of art\". For me, School Days was a little in between. \r\nStory: \r\nThe series starts with a student named Makoto seeing a pretty girl on thetrain named Kotonoha. Instantly she catches his eye and he falls in love with her. There is a rumor going around that if you have a picture of your crush as your phone wallpaper for 2 weeks without anyone noticing, then you will end up together. Later on, a girl in Makoto's class, Sekai, discovers Makoto's love for Kotonoha and decides to help him out. She begins to fall in love with Makoto and wants him for herself, so she offers to let him \"practice\" various things on her so that he can be prepared when he's with Kotonoha. The story begins to go downhill when Makoto starts getting into relationships he cannot commit to and craves more and more lust. Throughout the series, you will get to see the things people are willing to do to be with the one they love and what happens when you push someone to their limits. Being someone who doesn't really like romance animes, I liked the story because it was different. The fact that they decided to make a romance anime with such an interesting twist to it made it really special.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThere's not much I can say about the art, I would say it's a 6.5/10 because it's just \"fair\". Throughout the series, the art pretty much stays the same. They don't add in little chibi moments or breathtaking scenery. It's not amazing to the point where you will gaze at it and make gifs of the art, but it's also not bad enough to make you not want to watch it. There are some scenes in particular that I thought were quite beautiful, but overall the art was average. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI think the sound is something that they did a great job on. The voice actors suited the characters well and the background tracks added suspense to the anime. The opening is upbeat and I had no problems with the ending tracks, they had multiple different ones and they all sounded great. The tracks were wonderful and gave me the chills. It replays certain scenes in my mind when I play them, meaning it was powerful enough to leave an impact on me. All in all, the sound is probably my favorite part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere's quite a variety of characters in this anime, but let's just discuss the main characters for time's sake. For starters, we have the male protagonist, Makoto. He starts out as a well-mannered, innocent, typical high school student. As the story progresses, you will get to see he is not as typical and innocent as he seemed. Makoto is one of the worst, if not, then the worst, anime character I have ever seen. He hurts just about every girl in the anime and shows absolutely no remorse and/or shame. It angered me that he was treating the girls in such manner and didn't even feel a sliver of regret. Then it began to scare me when I realized he was able to do such things without feeling like he was doing something wrong. Then we have Kotonoha, Makoto's love interest. She is a shy, quiet, beautiful girl. She tends to keep a distance from guys so Makoto was quite surprised when he found out she was interested in him as well. Because she is shy and quiet, she is not used to the relationship that Makoto craves and begins pushing Makoto away. Although she tries her best to make the relationship work, she comes off as indecisive due to the fact that she simply isn't comfortable with Makoto's actions. This triggers Makoto to go to Sekai, his classmate, for advice. Sekai is an out-going and cheerful girl who likes to poke fun. The more Makoto went to Sekai for advice, the more Sekai started to fall for him. It wasn't long until 'advice' turned into practice and practice turned into an excuse. Sekai continues to push Makoto to improve his relationship with Kotonoha, but selfishly wants him for herself on the inside. The characters are well developed throughout the series, you get to see how much they change and how they react to certain situations when things don't go their way. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nOverall, I rated the anime a 6/10. I can't say I enjoyed this anime a lot, but I can say I liked how different it was from the other romance animes. Because of it's 'originality', it has become quite infamous. Personally I feel like it's not as bad as everyone says it is, but it honestly isn't a masterpiece either. When I finished the anime, I didn't feel bored and I didn't feel amazed either. I simply felt satisfied, but at the same time it was a satisfaction that didn't feel quite right. I wouldn't recommend this anime to everyone, but if you're someone who likes plot twists, psychological animes, and/or unpredictable romance, then this should be right up your ally.",

            "content": "So, I was reading a few reviews for School Days, and to my surprise some people actually consider this a good anime. Of course opinions are subjective, and I can usually understand, but in this case I just couldn't let it slide. Why, dude? Why on earth would you actually consider this anime a good contender? It has pretty much no redeeming qualities. Because we all have our opinions, feel free to disagree, but I'm going to review this anime that I consider my greatest waste of time.\r\nStory: 2.\r\nMaybe it's just me, but I never found harems to be that great story wise. From whatI've seen (which hasn't been a lot, so bear with me) they're all generally the same. 3, or more girls fall for the most uninteresting male lead, and calamity ensues. Usually these girls can have any guy they want, but they all go for the very lack lustre lead. Why? I don't fucking know. So, School Days is no exception. But what makes this anime's story WORSE than other anime (yes, even you, Tokimeki Memorial), is that there's literally barely any story at all. The main, Makoto, falls for this girl who he sees on the train. To his surprise, she likes him too, and they begin to go out thanks to his classmate, Sekai's, help. After a day of dating, and her not giving it up right away, he's suddenly uninterested, and that's when the story seriously goes to shit. Let me tell you, it's the second fucking episode. If you can watch after this point, then you deserve a medal. I don't want to spoil what happens after he realizes his feelings, but lets just say the story turns into a giant cluster fuck. Pun intended. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6.\\n\r\nSome people who hate the anime even praise the art. I won't actually praise it , but I'll note that it's leagues better than everything else in the anime. The main issue for me was the character designs. I hated the way every character in this anime looked. Every God damn one. I'm not a fan of characters with eyes the size of half of their faces, imo they look like they're in middle school and not high school, and whenever I see a profile of ANY of the characters, I cringe at the lack of attention to detail. Don't let me even start on Makoto's hair. Or Sekai's. Because trust me, I'll go on forever. Besides the characters though, the backgrounds are nicely done. The quality seems to take a dive towards the middle of the series, and only gets actually pretty good on the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.\\n\r\nOh look. Another thing I didn't completely hate. Don't get me wrong, I skipped the OP's and ED's, but they weren't bad. In fact, I have heard A LOT worse. The in anime score was handled very respectably. I don't really have much to add about the sound, but lets just say that the sound and the art are the 2 things that this anime has going for it, if anything at all. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1.\\n\r\nOh my God, I don't think I've ever disliked an ensemble of characters SO much. Maybe when I watch an anime, there's one or two characters I don't like, but I literally hated every character in this series. They're a mess. Let's start with our main: Makoto. At the beginning of the anime, Makoto's portrayed as this fun loving, kind of awkward guy. But by the end of the series, he's just a fucking dickhead. A remorseless, soulless human. Mind you, it only takes 12 episodes to completely change this characters persona COMPLETELY. By the end of the series, he literally has no redeeming qualities. But don't think he's alone. Sekai, his classmate, is also fucking insane. At first she comes off as this fun, hyper, helpful girl, but by the 3rd or 4th fucking episode, you should know she's a bitch. A conniving little devil. Then you have  Katsura: your typical shy, but attractive female. She might seem likeable, buuuut she's batshit crazy. I don't know why the creator of this show thought that it was a good idea to have ALL unlikeable characters with the most awful development I've ever witnessed. There's literally no one to root for in this anime. At least if the characters were portrayed well, I could hate them, but still respect them. But noooo. Take Death Note: by the end of the series I didn't particularly like Light, but I could still respect his character because he was well done. But the leads and secondary characters in this anime were allllllllllllll, as in every single fucking one, BAD. How am I supposed to like an anime when I hate all of the characters? Please, just tell me how. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3.\\n\r\nOk, I'd give my overall enjoyment lower if it wasn't for the \"wtf\" ending. Not going to lie, but that made watching this anime worth while. It's still a piss poor show, but the ending is just so lulzy, and off pace with the beginning of the show, that I couldn't help but love it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.\\n\r\nWhat makes me laugh the most is how some people consider this anime to be a great psychological ride. Wtf? Did you and I not watch the same anime? Because, what the creator made was FAR from a good psychological. Honestly, all they did was ride on the out-of-ordinary ending, and hoped that it would redeem the rest of the series. I'm sorry, but that 22 minutes of pure lol didn't make up for that 11 episode hell I went through before hand. I never thought I'd see the day when I'd dislike a show more than Tokimeki (not inc.

            "content": "School Days is what would happen if your average harem lead actually capitalized on the fact that he had a harem. An unbelievably fantastic show that does exactly what it is meant to do, make you uncomfortable. Of course when people watch an anime, or any show for that matter they watch it not to feel uncomfortable. So I can understand the reasoning behind the score to an extent. This is actually not a very good review.\r\nStory: The base story is very realistic, it's about a your average high school boy who gets away with cheating one time. Now we all know how high schoolboys are, they are horny and if they get away with something once they think they can get away with it a million times. That is what this anime is about, but if you are someone like me who graduated high school a few years ago then you understand how real this story is and you know exactly how it will end. Well, Kind of.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I think your view on the characters can change your enjoyment of the show, yes the MC is a horrible guy, but there are actual people out there exactly like this guy and personally I loved watching him doing what he did because the consequences of what he was doing was building and building. The female leads are great, they act like women who are confused in love. Stuff like breaking up with somebody but wanting them back for no real reason. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Your enjoyment on this show is dependent on how much you like watching somebody crash and burn. It's like when you play roller coaster tycoon and you make a roller coaster that kills everybody. Watching this anime is like watching the roller coaster in action, you know there will be a horrible outcome and you are merely seeing how bad it can get before it crashes.\\n\\n\r\nWell, this was a horrible review. The reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because the realistic nature the show had lost it near the end just to give a different type of ending that will stick with the audience and also to teach a lesson. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, this was a horrible review, but watch School Days anyways. It's something else. \\n",

            "content": "Makoto Ito, a first year high school student who happens to notice a cute and busty lady by the name of Kotonoha Katsura who takes the same train as he does to school, Makoto is desperate to get acquainted with this girl and he receives help from fellow classmate Sekai Saionji (who has a crush on Makoto) who manages to pair the two together. Makoto then sets about trying to 'wow' Kotonoha and push her to do things she is not ready for, which could spell trouble for their relationship. \r\nSo what can i say about this anime that hasn't already been said?\r\nSince this alternativetake on the harem genre arrived people have been criticizing this series left, right and center; to be fair they have their reasons for hating this series with a passion.     \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of problems with this series and i'll start off with the characters and their personalities and traits. The characters in this series are very... aggravating. Their personalities and choices make them look moronic, they have no sense of right or wrong and for the majority of this series make very unrealistic choices. \\n\\n\r\nThe only character you can feel any connection or sympathy for is Kotonoha as she is pushed to breaking point throughout the series as a result from being bullied by other girls and being neglected by her boyfriend! (Makoto)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is awful as it goes about showing how one guy likes a girl, gets lucky enough to start dating her and then he changes his mind and sleeps with various other women throughout the entirety of the show. (May i also remind you that Makoto is a 14 year old)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing spectacular and that goes for the sound too. The opening song is way out of place for this series (though it is likable) and that goes for the ending song as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs awful as this anime is there are some notable things i can say about it. This is something different... by that I mean an anime that is a melodrama. I have never seen such a melodramatic anime before and i would almost mistake this for a melodramatic soap i would see on TV. This was a different take on the harem genre and at least they gave it a new look. (Even if it was a disfigured one at best)\\n\\n\r\nI have always wondered if the writer of this anime intended to make people hate it in order to try and get some recognition or whether he was being serious about this anime and the characters retarded personalities. I hope one day i can find the answer. (If i can be bothered to Google search it)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was horrible and a horrible experience, there are a lot of things about this series that can turn the nicest and calmest of people into bloodthirsty psychos calling for Makoto's head. I would advise people not to watch this anime. (You can go give it a try if you wish)\\n\\n\r\nTHANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS, LEAVE FEEDBACK IF YOU WANT, IT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED!!\\n",

            "content": "When watching School Days I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. It's because this anime starts out in such a natural and welcoming way, you feel happy watching it. However when things start going wrong, terribly wrong... you just want them to stop but you can't. You can only watch as the drama unfolds before your teary eyes. \r\nItou Makoto, a Japanese high school student, is your average guy. He's interested in girls, he doesn't really care about education and he's a bit of a layabout. There is however one girl he's particulary interested in. They always ride the same train to school andhe always glances at ther. Well one day he decided to take a picture of her with his mobile, what harm could that possibly cause? Besides they say that if you keep someone's picture on your mobile for 3 weeks then your love will come true. Well they eventually meet (through someone else though) and decide to go out with each other. Hmmmm.\\n\r\nAnd that's where the epic story begins.\\n\\n\r\nYou will be presented with the real world out there. Everything in this anime is plausible. Hell, it's probably happening somewhere right now. It's a story of how one girl fails to satisfy her boyfriend and he ends up cheating on her with another girl... and another... and another, it's a chain reaction. Once you set a man's sexual drive in motion, you can't stop it. It's like a speeding train. What makes it worse is the fact that there are a lot of willing and submissive girls around our character.  Add to that the fact that some of them are doing it becase they actualy love him and you have a recipe for disaster. \\n\\n\r\nSchool Days will shake you. I know, it shook me horribly. Trust me, the first episode is deceiveing. This is not a happy anime, I just want to stress that. I went in expecting sillines and some kind of a funny story. Well it's not like that. Also the ending, I will not spoil it for you, so I'll just say that it's shocking. Yeah, that's all I'll say on that matter. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review I'll say that this series is a must for every anime connoisseur. School Days made me thank god that I didn't have a girlfriend in High School. That's how powerful this anime is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI for one, will never go back to it again.\\n",

            "content": "When I first started watching School Days,I was a aware of its reputation,being such a contraversial anime,I decided to give it a try and it has certainly lived up to its name.\r\nOn first sight,School Days seems like and average Romance,School,Slice of life anime.However,after a few episodes in,I realized it is everything,but average.\r\nThe story starts with an average japanese guy,Itou Makoto, who frequently rides the metro to school and has recently caught an eye for a girl in the metro Katsura Kotonoha ,to wich he has taken the liking of.The guy being shy and inexpiernced couldn't gather any confidence to confess to the girl.On the otherhand,in his new class he meets a girl,Saionji Sekai who sits beside him and befriends her.Sekai then finds out Itou has started fancying Kotonoha and so decides to help him gather confidence to ask her out.\\n\\n\r\nNow,Everyone keeps calling this anime either an utter disaster or a psychological materpiece.I,on the other hand,don't think that either is true.\\n\r\nOne thing that I can definatley conclude is that the anime is certainly something new and unexpected,as well as surprising.What is odd inthis anime is that it tangles with a contraversial idea of cheating.Some aspects in it could definately be considered realistic.Through the main character in practically represents everything that shouldn't be done in relationships.And although,some people may be in dissmay,calling him immadiately a jerk,having thought a bit about,I have realized not only are there guys like that,but in this time of increasing insolence in sexual acts and decreasing values of relationships,this anime could just be the right thing for opening eyes to people if only looked at in the right way.The characters in the anime do develop,but in a negative way.While the main character develops from a shy unexperienced guy to a lust-craving,sexuall addict and playboy,the girl he first starts dating becomes an obssesingly,attached ignorant girlfriend.As the episodes keep progressing their personality traits keep getting worse and worse,so basically there is no positive character in the story.They all keep lying,cheating,obsessing,lusting ,all of the seven great sins depicted in each person,only in a diffirent way.It's a donwnward spiral of innocent kids who believe that maturity is being in a relationships and engaging in various sexual acts and being badly influenced.It's a sad thing that this could be transeferd onto the real world and it's clear that this becomes worryingly frequent as time progresses and children keep entering puberty earlier ,so they keep DOING mature things without their mind keeping up and results in a series of consequences and that is what this anime is trying to present or maybe it is consequence itself of a growing deviation and regression in our society?\\n\r\nThe very title 'School Days' opposed to the story of the anime clearly states the changes in our societys' perspective towards what School days should really be like.But maybe I'm delving into psychology a bit too much.\\n\r\nIt woudl be fair to say that watching this anime was a bit amusing for me,as it was something diffirent,but at the same time I was often frustrated because of various things,such as poor dialogues,annyoing music,shallow and ignorant characters or sometimes over dramatized situations which can sometimes make an american-like soap opera feel ,only in form of a japanese anime.\\n\r\nOverall,I can't call this anime neither good nor bad,but bearing in mind it hasn't exceeded in any of the categories such as art,story,character or sound it is bound to get a low mark.However,I would recommend people to watch either way,it might not be a true quality or completely enjoyable,but it offers a diffirent perspective on things and can be thought provoking,which is why some people my call it psychological,although in the essence it is not that.It can make us question the values we bear nowadays.\\n\\n",

            "content": "School days is, without a doubt, the worst anime I have had the displeasure of watching in my entire life. Now, if you like this series, I can totally understand why. Not everyone will have the same opinion on a series, and everyone has different tastes. However, this is my opinion, but, this anime is fucking trash. Flaming dumpster trash. Trash that left me disoriented, dissatisfied, and sick when I finished it. Keep in mind that this is my first review, so I might not be very good at it... with that said, let us begin.\r\nI remember learning about School Days from an anime YouTuberwho said something about it being about a yandere love story with lots of gore. So, being a naive ten-year-old who had just finished Future Diary, I was like, ''Hell yeah! A yandere murder love story?! That sounds like the best thing ever! I'm totally going to watch it!'' \\n\\n\r\nI did watch it. It was not the best thing ever. \\n\\n\r\nSchool Days was just...confusing. Why was this Makoto suddenly acting like a jackass? Wasn't he afraid to even TALK to girls? Why is he suddenly okay to start cheating on everyone he meets and start fucking them from the getgo? Why is Katsura suddenly a psychopath? Yeah, I get it, being dumped is hard and shit, but she was just obsessive for no reason whatsoever. The story just made no sense.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character and I mean EVER CHARACTER has the intelligence of a goldfish. Actually, scratch that, goldfish are probably 50 times smarter than these sad excuses for human beings. Everyone in this series has the personality of a soggy biscuit, and everyone makes so many dumb decisions simultaneously that it makes me wonder if this is just an alternate universe where humans have no concept whatsoever of social skills or, you know, basic human morals. I wasn't even happy when everyone got slaughtered at the end because I wasn't really rooting for anyone, and I can honestly say that I hated absolutely everyone in this show. Makoto's a pervy asshole, Sekai's a weak bitch who isn't confident enough to be a decent human being, and Katsura's....just kinda there. Being dumb. The rest of the supporting cast are....okay? I guess? But they still act like idiots. Or maybe that's just how every highschooler on the planet acts. IDK.\\n\\n\r\nArt was awful. I would have rather poured bleach into my eyes and gouged them out with spoons than have to watch this absolute failure again. \\n\\n\r\nMusic was trash and stayed stuck in my head for hours on end, repeating endlessly to keep reminding me how shit it was.\\n\\n\r\nI just hate this anime. I really do. I completely regret watching this failure of an animated production. Consider this review a warning to never, ever watch this piece of trash.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Read on my blog for far better presentation: https://rogueshogunate.com/2019/04/20/fantasyjareds-anime-corner-week-1-school-days/\r\n*CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS, will warn before they appear!*\r\nIt is virtually impossible to discuss School Days without noting its rather divisive reception. Based off of the visual novel School Days HQ, some people think this anime is bloody stellar, featuring a multi-layered quandary and conspicuous ending that will be sure to stick with the viewer long after it has finished. Others despise it, claiming that the characters are malevolent and/or irrational to the core, causing the overall experience to be infuriating to watch as a result. And while my score of this anime will very obviously indicate whatmy stance is on this show, it is crucial that I mention regardless that your mileage may vary with this one.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I also cannot help but think that detractors of School Days entirely miss the point of what the show is trying to accomplish with its characters and predominant message. But for the sake of consistency, I will touch upon that a bit later.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is delivered continuously, as most of them are. It begins as innocuous as a romance harem possibly can, with a high school kid named Makoto Itou, main character of School Days and horndog extraordinaire, developing a crush on another girl, named Kotonoha Katsura. A third girl, Sekai Saionji, then tries to help Makoto get with Kotonoha, though she secretly likes Makoto as well. It certainly does not take a bachelor's in Philosophy to follow the basic premise of this tale.\\n\\n\r\nTo add upon this, I find the pacing of the story to also be quite effective in the sense that School Days takes its time to establish its characters in the first half, giving us the essential key details of their character that accurately foreshadow how they may come to act in the future. For example, very early on we see Makoto interacting with Sekai Saionji, the matchmaker crush of the story mentioned earlier. They are talking to each other on the roof of the school, when Makoto suddenly threatens Sekai when she jokes about sharing to the school that Makoto has a crush on Kotonoha. This scene is efficient at showing two things. First, that Makoto can take things too seriously at times, and secondly, how he immediately regrets doing so, indicating that he means and tries to do good with his actions, but can make the wrong choice despite his best efforts.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the second half picks up the pace quite noticeably, though I never got the vibe it was rushed. The characters and their motivations are clearly established as always, just with much more in the way of foreshadowing and dramatic moments. And that brings me to one of the biggest strengths of School Days's story, the way it exponentially builds over the course of the show. While it commences with your standard romantic dalliances, showcasing the characters' personalities and motivations, as conflicts start to arise between the characters, the tension between them is dramatically increased as the precarious situation they dug themselves into only grows in ferocity.\\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILERS PRESENT HERE!*\\n\\n\r\nAs to illustrate this point, after a few episodes we see Makoto suddenly declare that he no longer wants to date Kotonoha. One person on this site titled Kotonoha as prudish, and I think that is the perfect word to describe her. Makoto got \"tired\" of the limitations that Kotonoha pushed on him and as a result, Makoto goes after Sekai instead. Regardless of how absolutely trashy a move like that is, it is the entire point to Makoto's character. People like him do exist in the real world, ones who are garbage at communicating with others face to face about serious topics and suddenly want to go out with somebody else, but are too cowardly to break up with whoever they are currently with in person. And as I will mention later down the road, it is not solely even Makoto's fault that the story ends up where it does. But again for the sake of consistency, I shall touch upon that later.\\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILERS END*\\n\\n\r\nTo build upon this, the direction of the narrative is extremely clear from the get-go and is proficiently paced for it. And while this may seem incredibly obvious and fundamental, it is also a great deal less common than you might initially think. So many anime tend to lose their focus and/or run out of ideas to conclude their narrative, including some of my personal favorites (Black Cat comes to mind), but School Days had one goal from the very beginning; to addict the viewer within the wonderfully elementary first half of the show, and fire on all cylinders in its quick-paced and dramatic second half. And on this front, it absolutely succeeds, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the animation of the show is rather great for a 2007 anime. The backgrounds are of notable detail at times, and the character design all-around is simply fantastic. While slightly lacking in realism as the eyes are perhaps a tad too large, the fluidity and quality of the actual artwork itself is quite impressive and greatly enhances the presentation of the overall product. Each character is highly distinct in their appearance, fit the theme of the show, and are discernibly unique in retrospect.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the sound design has discernible effort put into it. While the opening certainly lacks in terms of memorability and catchiness, the background music is what really works here, particularly when the somber piano kicks in for the more intense scenes. The voice acting also brings each character to life, with clearly recognizable voices for each character that further support the distinctiveness of the cast as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they are the bulk of School Days's story, as it is predominantly driven by them as opposed to the events. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the characters is that, as Amazon user Erich Hartmann once said, they all believe they are the protagonist of this story. Each one of them strives for their satisfying conclusion, but once they begin to realize they cannot obtain that, they start to push the boundaries of their morals further and further as the story progresses. This results in a highly fascinating cognitive dilemma between the main characters as everyone is reaching out for their happy ending that may or may not work out at all. Such is life, I would imagine. But this point is also where I feel most critics of this show miss the point of School Days's message. They claim that the characters grow despicable and irrational, making it seem as if that was not what the writers were trying to accomplish the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nTo illustrate this, take Makoto Itou again. He gives into his desires not guilty of ignorance, but sexual ardor and the incrementally toxic influences around him. The centralizing factor of the characters in this show that most people fail to understand is that they are intentionally written to be surreptitiously repulsive. What I mean by that is when you first meet the cast, they are like any other high school students in the world and feel like people you can relate to and genuinely chill with. And despite some exaggerated scenes in particular, for the most part, the characters acknowledge what they are doing is not right at times. Despite this, however, they try to make the best with what they have while refusing to own up and admit their faults, unknowingly contributing a hostage to fortune of sorts to the story.\\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILERS PRESENT HERE!*\\n\\n\r\nAs an example of this, about halfway through the show Makoto and Sekai get together and try to avoid confronting Kotonoha about it. While the show makes it abundantly clear that they both regret what they are doing, in the end they are too afraid to break the news to her. Earlier I mentioned Kotonoha's prudishness, as it is essentially the reason why Makoto stopped wanting to date her. However, time and time again we see Makoto try regardless to get back in contact with Kotonoha as he feels incredibly bad for what he has been doing with Sekai and how they have been neglecting her. He does not even want to start dating her again, just apologize, speak the truth about his feelings for Sekai, and own up to his faults. This shows that Makoto is an actual human being, one who acknowledges when he is screwing up badly and wants to make up for it. However, one of the characters in the show, named Setsuna Kiyoura, is an adamant friend of Sekai and only wants Makoto with Sekai, not Kotonoha. While at first Makoto strongly resists Setsuna's efforts to keep them ghosting Kotonoha, even going as far as blocking her number on Makoto's phone, it proves to be too much for him to handle as eventually, he gives up and totally ignores Kotonoha as Setsuna wanted. Not to make it sound entirely like Setsuna's fault, as Makoto wanted to get with Sekai in the first place, but there is clearly multiple factors at play here that build up to the end.\\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILERS END*\\n\\n\r\nSo why is it that School Days gets so much backlash? Predominantly, I have come down to three explanations for this. For starters, naysayers to School Days may claim that the characters act unrealistic, and I wholeheartedly disagree with that sentiment. For instance, if a bunch of girls started to bandwagon on a high school kid in real life, wouldn't any flawed and horny human being in over his head carelessly jump at the opportunity? While Makoto is most certainly a terrible person, he does share a lot of toxic traits that people in our world might contain at his age. His characterization speaks for this as well, regretting his actions but doing little to change it.\\n\\n\r\nThese critics also claim that the entire cast comprises of frustrating, terribly written trash that makes for a contemptful experience overall. And it is this complaint in particular that I find especially weak. To paraphrase MAL user Zergneedsfood, just because a character is a bad person does not, by any means, make them a bad character. Where critics of School Days get this preconceived notion that all characters in anime must be heavenly role models, I shall never know. By that logic, fictitious characters such as Dr. Eggman and Bowser are horribly written simply because they do not exactly fit the description of \"good.\" Surely we can see the fault in this argument.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, potentially the biggest reason people dislike School Days is the way it goes from a charming, traditional romantic comedy to a madhouse of love affairs as the characters cause their lives to become doomed to spectacular failure. No conventional harem would operate the way in which School Days does, and as a result, it may leave the viewer feeling betrayed and forcefully pulled into the harsh realities of our own world. Thus, they begin to hate the characters, and subsequently, the show as a result. The writers did such a stellar job at making Makoto seem like an unworthy sack of shit that completely disregarding this as the very purpose of the writing, the viewer starts to feel enraged and heartbroken simultaneously. I urge new viewers with this knowledge to not fall into this trap, as every bit of writing in School Days was entirely of the writers' own volition, rest assured. And while I obviously cannot give away many specifics, it is best you walk into this series with a very open mind.\\n\\n\r\nI say this because there is not necessarily one solid concrete way to interpret this show, though the moral at the end remains clear. To me anyway, School Days is the quintessence of the worst-case scenario, which could theoretically happen to anybody should they allow lust to control their actions. And that is the noteworthy topic I must bring up as well, that the characters act realistic and believable enough because people like them do exist in real life.\\n\\n\r\nTo quote The_Bif from a MAL forum, \"I've known a great many men like Makoto and it was actually quite common when I was in high school for boys to act that way. Bed as many women as possible to up your score in the locker-room, boost your self-esteem, or just because you're a horny douchebag. Passive, shy girls like Kotonoha were quite real as well, I only had to deal with one in my life and it was long after high school but they do exist. Girls like Katou and her harlot trio of bullies are actually pretty average high school students, they exist everywhere en masse. Events like the friend who helped you hook up with your girlfriend suddenly trying to break you up and keep you for herself, I've witnessed them through the eyes of nieces and nephews during their high school days. Considering I've witnessed those particular events in some shape, form, or fashion in my decades of life, how rare or far-fetched can they be?\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you forced me to think of legitimate complaints I have for School Days, two tend to come up immediately. For one, the first half of the show replicates the genre it is trying to deconstruct a little too well, with copious amounts of fanservice in the first five episodes in particular. The second half thankfully does away with most of the unnecessary shots, though I suppose you really cannot tell a story like this without including it somewhere in the first place. Hell, it can even be argued that this is a good thing, as it helps the show more faithfully spoof and/or mock the harem genre. Interpret it as you will.\\n\\n\r\nMy second complaint revolves around a select few hyper-specific moments in the second half of the show that are admittedly pretty far-fetched, even to the point that you would recognize them instantly if you saw them. Just to touch upon this point and nothing more, there exists a \"Break Room\" that the high school contains as a tradition of their annual festival. What is this Break Room for, you may ask? Simple! For couples to engage in sexual intercourse...What kind of school would allow a room solely designated for students to screw each other? Ah, but I must digress.\\n\\n\r\nAs the curtain closes, the reason I love School Days is the way it deconstructs the harem genre, making it virtually unsurpassed in the premise that it creates and executes. In the writers' almost contrarian mindset, they created School Days to be darker in its malignant realism, taking this unorthodox concept and running with it. For the cast is plagued with exacerbated traits intentionally meant to cause the viewer to love them one moment, and loathe them in the very next scene. This culminates with a strikingly cathartic ending sure to never leave your mind once you have seen it, giving the series a memorable vibe to it that I feel was a bold move on the writers' part. And maybe School Days even relies on the ending a bit too much, but because of the excellent construction of the story and its pacing, I can hardly complain. For better or worse, the series truly is an anime that you will never forget about, and the unique experience it brings to the table is something I would consider worthy of anyone's time.\\n\\n\r\nIn that sense, I honestly find School Days to be somewhat of a misunderstood masterpiece. To again paraphrase the words of MAL user Zergneedsfood, the anime acts as an exemplary tragedy, a naturalistic harem, and even a bit of a sardonic parody all in one. And the fact that this show had the audacity to challenge the norm as boldly as it did still leaves me astounded to this day. By no means is School Days one of the greatest shows of all time, but it is the most intricate middle finger to conventional storytelling as well as the most elaborate deconstruction of a genre that I have ever witnessed first-hand. And for that, School Days, I applaud you.\\n\\n\r\n\"Life is not a game. You can't just hit reset. You only have one life.\" -Makoto Itou",

            "content": "Before you pick up the DVD for this, please note the following. As innocent as this anime seems to be in the beginning, the ending is far from it. As you progress through the episodes, slight nudity, sexual acts and even discreet rape appears. \r\nThis series was based on the hit (methinks) based dating sims game called School Days. The art styles, characters and the plot is almost identical the the series. However it was famous for their three \"bad endings\" as if you do screw up somehow then you'll be in for a violent bloody scene. The anime, is VERY SIMILAR TO THE GAME.\r\nPersonallyI didn't like it. I really got bored of it. Well, I may not be into romance-drama genres, but this anime was plain old boring and by 3/4ths of it, I wanted to shoot myself. If you like shows with LOTS of drama, love... octagons... (get it? love-square, love octagon) and harem, and a bit of fanservice here and there, you'll love this anime. I will not spoil the ending for you, but this whole anime leads to a WTF-ness factor.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is quite good actually. Sekai, Kotonoha and Makoto's true nature reveals itself by the almost end of the series. Sekai's nature is revealed, Makoto's sudden change and attitude towards both Sekai and Katsura, and Katsura's despair all spirals down to the conclusion of the story. What impresses me the most, was that Makoto's character was the most similar to it's game counterpart (hint: different people has different opinions and actions, therefore, their endings are different from others). If I say anymore of that, I may be spoiling. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend you watch this over a one episode a day thing, instead of watching it all in one day.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Although I personally thought the entire series was a waste, the ending of it, has risen the overall score. I'm assure that if there is some hostility towards an character you dislike, then you will enjoy the ending as well.",

            "content": "It should be noted that this series is a tragedy, if you don't already know. If you're after a sweet romance, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a horror series with yanderes and blood galore, you should also look elsewhere. If youre looking for an ecchi harem, you might not be dissapointed at first...but you'll feel guilty by the end of the series. \r\nThis really begs the question, who is this show for exactly? The only answer I can come up with is bitter lesbians. yes. By the end of this series you too will walk away with such a hatred men everywhere that witha pair of loose fitting jeans and a short haircut, you might just pass for a lesbian yourself. Even if you're a man.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving away too many spoilers, the story begins like any ecchi harem would. Dimwitted guy has several girls falling for him, and darnit! He dosn't know what to do! But this is where we leave harem world and things get real. At this point the asshole protagonist decides to get with ALL the girls, which might work out well in To LOVE Ru, but in real life it makes you a two timing (or six timing) douchebag. Thats once thing the story does all too well. By the end of School Days the male lead Itou beat out Light Yagami the mass murderer for my #1 most hated protagonist. Easily. Apart from that however the story relies on cliche, coincidence, nonsensical events to tell an unrealistic tale of an idiot getting his just desserts. Story gets a 6/10 and thats being generous.\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints with art to speak of, decent enough throughout. Sound was decent, voice acting was par, but the happy-go-lucky opening theme got old in a hurry, and ruined the tragic depressing mood on more than one occasion. Art 8/10. Sound 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days deserves one honor. It has, hands down, the worst cast of characters I've ever seen. I hated literally every character that appeared on screen. I'm having trouble coming up with adjectives, because idiot, asshole, and pervert don't do the main character justice. He isn't a lovable idiot, he's not a wisecracking asshole, and hes not a lovable pervert. He is just...terrible. The supporting cast is equally abysmal, from nearly every girl who inexplicable falls for, and clings to this asshole protagonist, to the protagonist's equally annoying male friend, to the manipulative skank female lead, I. Hated. Everyone. And you will too. Characters 3/10, and again, I'm being generous.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not enjoyable. Every episode is specifically designed to make you hate the protagonist more and more untill the inevitable, blissful end. And what an ending it was. People joke that for a tragedy, School Days has one of the happiest endings of all time, and I must agree. School Days was literally 6 hours of head pounding, forehead slapping, swearing, and daydreaming of creative ways the protagonist might die. School Days was not, however, enjoyable. Only because of the ending does this series get a 4/10 for enjoyment, instead of a 0\\n\\n\r\nOverall School Days earns a 5/10, I'm sure far worse shows have been, and will be made, and ultimately, I DO reccomend the show for those 16 and up. If for no other reason than because it is 'unique' and because its a legend in the anime community. Albeit a horrible legend that we all want to forget.",

            "content": "\u201cEverything depends on the colour of the crystal through which one sees it\u201d - Calderon\r\nA favourite quote of mine, and one which I think perfectly applies to School Days, an anime which can be either an incredible work of fiction or a steaming pile of doggy poop, all depending on the lens you are looking through.\r\nBefore watching School Days, I had no idea just how hated it was, especially here on MAL.  I think I\u2019d heard about it through a recommendation on YouTube that described the story along the lines of \u201clove can be a very dark and scary thing.\u201d  I had alsoheard hints about the show\u2019s infamous ending, a grand finale that was likely to leave me more than slightly emotionally disturbed.  As a lover of dark, psychological stories, I was eager to give it a go.  After watching the anime in two sittings, hungrily consuming one episode after another, I surfaced from School Days mind-blown at the masterpiece of fiction I had just watched, and was genuinely surprised to learn that around 90% of the people who had seen it had experienced the polar opposite reaction from me.\\n\\n\r\nTo enjoy this anime, School Days should be watched with several things in mind.  Firstly \u2013 this has been said before but is worth repeating \u2013 this is not your typical high school romance or harem anime.  In fact, it never, ever tries to be.  Secondly, it is a deconstruction of the aforementioned genres.  It expertly establishes a handful of tired clich\u00e9s and tropes, and then sadistically enjoys dismantling and destroying them piece by piece.  Thirdly, this ain\u2019t no anime for kids.  Despite its innocent looking appearance, a number of dark, mature themes are uncovered and explored right through until its tragic and stomach-churning conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is Makoto, your typical high school boy with a crush on a cute girl, Kotonoha, who rides the same train to school as him every day.  After snapping a photo of her on his cell phone, his crush is discovered by his female classmate Sekai, who proposes to set them up.  Within the first few episodes this fun, cheesy romance arc develops and then reaches its climax; Kotonoha and Makoto confess to each other, and it is also revealed that Sekai secretly has feelings for Makoto.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this seemingly innocent and well-crafted start, things start to go downhill.  Not for the anime, but for Makoto, Sekai and Kotonoha.  As these characters and the supporting cast show us, love and life are not as simple and carefree as we would all like to believe.  People make mistakes, feelings get hurt, people can be selfish, people can be torn between love and friendship, lust can lead to us to make errors of judgement, bullying can destroy people \u2013 especially sensitive people \u2013 and sometimes it just takes one small act to push someone over the edge. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, this is what School Days gets spectacularly right, and is one of the main reasons why it gets such a high rating from me.  Some people have called the characters and their actions unrealistic, but for me this is some of the most true-to-life drama conveyed on screen that I have ever seen.  Anyone with a modicum of life experience should be able relate to almost all of the feelings and actions \u2013 positive and negative \u2013 that Makoto, Kotonoha, Sekai and the rest of the cast play out in this story.  Makoto and Sekai get a lot of hate, but aren\u2019t we all guilty of having been cowardly, selfish, hurtful (intentionally or unintentionally), na\u00efve, cruel, angry, hateful, jealous and frustrated sometime in our lives?  \\n\\n\r\nThis poignant exploration of the characters\u2019 \u2013 and our \u2013 darker selves is only made more impactful by the truly excellent writing, animation and direction of School Days.  Its character designs and scenery are typical of a high school comedy-romance, but notice how the sombre colour palette hints at the darkness to come. The first few episodes seem typical of a humdrum romance plot, but some odd camera angles should be telling you things are slightly off-kilter.  The comedy and fanservice moments are carefully placed in eerie and uneasy contrast to the oppressive darkness that slowly consumes each of our main characters.  There are no internal monologues, but the characters\u2019 faces, words and actions carry so much raw emotion we can feel their excitement, lust, desperation and pain as they do.  There are, in fact, so many layers to the gathering darkness that School Days needs at least one rewatch to pick up on all the verbal and non-verbal cues that are present right from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard to do justice to something as brilliant as School Days.  10/10 is perhaps a controversial score to give, but in my opinion it thoroughly deserves it \u2013 this anime is a bonafide masterpiece.  If you enjoy dark and psychological stories, tragedy, genre deconstructions with an element of satire, characters that have very human flaws, and writing and direction that \u201cshow\u201d rather than \u201ctell\u201d, chances are you may very well enjoy School Days as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nA word of caution, however; no matter how much you brace yourself, that ending really is more than slightly emotionally disturbing.  It is also an epic and unforgettable conclusion to the descent into hell that is School Days.  You have been warned.\\n",

            "content": "*This is my first anime review. All constructive criticism is welcomed and appreciated.*\r\nSchool Days: After watching this you'll be thankful your days at school weren't as f**ked up as this! In all seriousness though, the mental torture some of the characters have to endure is heart breaking so if you intend on watching this expecting a light-hearted love-triangle, DON'T! This is one of the more psychological romance animes i've come across meaning you're likely to enjoy this if you enjoy depressing romance animes.\r\nStory:\r\nThe synoposis already explains the jist of the story. A love-triangle between the protaganist's childhood friend, Sekai, and his love interest initially, Kotonoha.What makes the story of 'School Days' different to other love-triangle animes is how it's presented and carried out. Normally, a lot of those animes are light-hearted and throw in some comedy to lighten up the mood. This isn't the case in 'School Days' and because of this I find it to be somewhat unique in that sense. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nArt - It's on par with most other animes for its time. I personally liked the character designs because they made the characters look cute and suited the anime rather well (similar to Kyoto animation). The background art was also fairly good.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The Japanese voice acting was good and suited the characters pretty well. However, the opening song didn't suit the anime at all. It's a very cheerful opening and, personally, it sucked. Not only didn't it suit the anime but I found it to be lame. With that being said, the ending song wasn't too bad. Sure, you wouldn't find me listening to it on my iPod but it did suit the anime pretty well. It sounded sad and depressing and that's the sort of song an anime like this needs. Normally I listen to anime OP and ED sequences but on this occasion both of them sucked. On the other hand, the sound effects and lip syncing was well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe two female protaganists aren't anything new to the genre. Infact, they are quite generic to be honest. A shy/quiet girl and an up-beat childhood friend. However, the male protaganist, Makoto Itou, is in my eyes, to be frank, the biggest douche in any anime i've seen thus far. At a first glimpse he appears to be a normal teenager in love. That isn't entirely the case. He's like a child with a toy. When they don't like it anymore, they stop using it and throw it away. I feel this is a perfect analogy to use to describe Makoto Itou. He plays with their emotions and uses the girls for his own perverted pleasures. Then, when he's bored with them, he chooses another girl to sleep with. I guess you could say Itou is \"the man\"! But, in all seriousness, he's the most despicable protaganist i've ever seen. Personally, I quite liked this aspect of 'School Days'. They thought of the biggest douche bag possible and chose him as the leading main character. Something I don't see too often. The supportng cast was also fairly decent. Sekai's best friend seems almost emotionless but only cares for Sakai's well being whereas Itou's best friend is a cheerful, dorky character who tends to lighten up the mood by constantly trying to impress Kotonoha.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I didn't enjoy this anime and i'm amazed that it's raked within the top 100 in terms of popularity. Why is this piece of trash so popular?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nAfter I completed this series, I sat down and reflected on what I just watched while listening to some music. After about 10 minutes or so, I realised something. There is a moral to this story. The human heart is a fragile thing and you shouldn't play with other people's emotions. You can't just treat girls like some sort of object and throw them away when you grow bored of them. It'll eventually come back to stab you right in the chest.",

            "content": "Alright - this series has gotten a lot of flak from many of the reviews on this site, and I've come to the conclusion that people just don't understand the series. Maybe they expected something different, maybe they just aren't mature enough to grasp the raw emotional power behind this anime.\r\nA few warnings beforehand: This show is not for the weak-hearted. I had never imagined that an anime would make me bang my head against a pillow repeatedly, several times each episode, but this proved me wrong. Brutal is the word that comes to mind when describing this show as a whole.\r\nA few suggestions: Thereare two things you need to realize to get the most out of this show. One, you're not going to be uplifted or happy. This show is depressing. Two, you need to allow yourself to be immersed in the world, to suspend your disbelief and be a part of the characters' world. If you're watching this show casually just to understand the \"Nice Boat\" meme, you're wasting your time - just go read the Wikipedia article. Watch the show in a dark room, alone, in one sitting. Preferably late at night. Keep all sharp objects away, because you might want to kill yourself. Here we go...\\n\\n\r\nStory: Starts off with the development of a generic love triangle between the seemingly creepy, but not mean-spirited, protagonist, the object of his desires, and his friend. And from that, it spirals into emotional madness. I don't want to spoil anything about the events of the plot itself, but the amount of twists and turns that take place made it impossible for me to stop watching after episode 4. And yes, the ending is worth watching it all for. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'll admit that I don't have very high standards for anime art, and only flinched once or twice in the infamous second episode of Akikan, but I think that the show's art, while not stellar, is still quite good. The characters are well drawn, and while nothing is exceptional, it's fully adequate for conveying the relationships between the characters successfully. It's important to note that Sekai is drawn in such a way that she isn't a kind of blatantly gorgeous character, which, while unusual in anime, works very well here. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I don't really have much to say about this. Adequate, and parts of the OP have this perfect atmosphere for the series, which really puts you in the mood for the emotional trudgery that follows. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where the show really shines. The incredible power of the characters in School Days, the emotional forces created by their strained relationships, the feelings spawned by their actions... together they made it unforgettable. What's so particular about the show is the fact that by the end of it, I wanted to practically rip most of the characters apart. There's no shining beacon of moral goodness, there's no character out there to help the others, there's just this shocking revelation of base human instincts. The characters are so incredibly cruel to each other, even to a point where I felt like I couldn't continue to watch - though I did anyways, and was glad that I did. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Let me set this straight - I did NOT enjoy watching this anime. It was a horrible, depressing experience that left me feeling like shit for weeks. But that's why I love it so much - not in a sadomasochist way, but because its sheer emotional power was so goddamned impressive. It was hard to watch, so very hard to watch... but worth it. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Brutal. Watch it. I have yet to find an anime that made me this depressed, and yet made me think so much. 10/10",

Well, I will not deny that I cheated on my girlfriend.\r\nHowever, what I will deny is that I approached them, in fact, it was the opposite, those women approached me. They wanted a piece of me. And I gave it to them. Should I have declined their offer?\r\nNo. That would be stupid. That would not makeme a man, but a pussy.\\n\\n\r\nIf a woman asks for sex, then I will give it to them. Because, really, I\u2019m the best man there is. And, besides, all those women were stupid and slutty.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, if you have a boyfriend, why should you go cheat on him for me?\\n\\n\r\nMy only conclusion seem to be this: I got the right stuff and those women wanted a piece of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, I wasn\u2019t like this, I was infatuated with a girl named Kotonoha Katsura. She was polite, reserved, and cute. At one point, I was dating her, with a little help from Sekai, and things were good. After awhile, I was getting bored, I wanted our relationship to progress, you know kiss and sex and what not, but Katsura didn\u2019t like that.\\n\\n\r\nI turned to Sekai to fulfill my sexual urges, and she fulfill them. I never knew how easy that was! I think that\u2019s because she liked me, but I didn\u2019t care. I just had sex and it felt so good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, afterwards, many women approached me and asked for sex, and I, being the gentleman that I am, had sex with them.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, I\u2019m a nice, kind, and well-spoken person, but underneath I\u2019m a lying, deceptive, dishonest, egotistical person.\\n\\n\r\nBut, women don\u2019t care about my personality, all they really want is me and my body.\\n\\n\r\nIf this body leads me to having sex with woman, so be it.\\n\\n\r\nThe End",

            "content": "\"All the world\u2019s a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts[.]\" --Shakespeare: As You Like It - Act II, Scene VII, Lines 1-4.\r\nI went into School Days aware of its infamous ending having been shown the clip firsthand years ago by a friend. At the time, it looked like a really generic series with a really messed up ending, and that pretty much holds true; it is through and through a cookie-cutter looking series but with content that is quite atypical. Shrugging it off due to thenotoriety and general widespread notion that the ending was either: \"the only good thing about the series\" or \"only has bizarre joke/novelty value\", I let the series slip by for many years until it was announced that North America would be getting a localized home media release. Shortly thereafter, I read the ANN review on the series to humour myself and checked into the discussion only to find several people lauding it. Being the curious mind that I am, I took a chance and ordered the series figuring I could at the very least get a laugh out of it or own it as a piece of anime history. Turns out I find it to be a flat out genius.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake, this is quite a divisive series (and rightfully so), as aforementioned, it looks like a mass produced harem rom-com romp, the ending is pure insanity, nearly every character is quite reprehensible one way or another and it plays out a lot of its genres tropes straight with quite subtle winks that you have to be patient and alert for. The end result however, is one of the most intense tragedies, one of the most scathing satires, and one of the most twisted cautionary tales of love you can find. \\n\r\nWhile I was watching the series (ending in mind), from the first episode alone I was absolutely awestruck when I probed into what was unfolding. That first love encounter when the world slows down and you are entranced and enchained into your own small little Eden, and both your crush's naughty bits and their face are captured in that brief yet magical moment. The nostalgic first steps onto campus for a new school and the path that awaits, where the crowd fades to nothing and you encounter your fated crush again. School Days captures these simple, almost rote moments with inexplicable grace and naturalism - never wallowing in excess of either poetic monologues or ridiculous fanservice like with the first scene mentioned prior, and these seemingly insignificant scenes would later be reinforced over the series' duration and cement some of its core ideas - the conflict of passionate romance and lustful desire. Such grandiose ideas really came to light in a later conversation in that same episode when lead Makoto is on the roof having a chat with new friend Sekai Saionji, who muses that her first name means \"world\".\\n\\n\r\nAs the various characters' interactions unfolded and the sensitive mise en scene kept playing out, Terrence Malick's equally divisive 'To the Wonder' came to mind; that film is also about the sensationalism of love and the nuanced values it means to each of its characters, but contrary to School Days, its narrative is quite oblique and is far more spare with dialogue - streaming through almost empty but blissful scenes like a wistful dream and bearing an understated gravitas for the strong yearning for love and the pain of being unrequited. In that film, its male lead Neil doesn't know how to channel his love - seeking to be a white knight to longing women, but never seeking more than accommodation and remedying their isolation. Makoto is equally as torn, but on the opposite end - he seeks unyielding love and completion of the self akin to Sartre and the complete body, but has trouble meeting the wavelengths of interest Kotonoha Katsura once he begins a relationship with her and feels alienated that he can't form a quick connection as she wants a slow and steady companionship. He is initially quite inept and lost at how to level with her, with their early dates having him either lost in activities he himself enjoys or trying to only meet his desires (the scene at the movie theaters is hilarious and absolutely brilliant). Katsura is akin to the main lover Marina in 'To the Wonder', but like with Makoto and Neil, her resemblance isn't a 1:1 comparison; in the latter half of the series, her pure, almost singular trust and loyalty to the unfaithful Makoto after she alienates him with her restraint manages to give her an ardent drive, but she originally sought love akin to Neil's while Makoto's form of love resembled Marina's and vice-versa. Now where does Sekai come in? She is Neil's fling Alice - a woman who had some independence and was trying to deal with her sole problems by herself while secretly longing for 'human' partnership. Sekai's dialogue in the first half of the series comes off as though she is an otherworldly guide like a cupid or angel of sorts, a messenger of the 'Earth' (\"Sekai\") who is forefront and helpful, keeps any 'human' problems largely to herself and  almost naive to some societal customs or restraints (her \"lessons\" with Makoto to help him out where she almost nonchalantly gives him her body). Sekai's struggle is with her mortal 'Saionji' self - her trepidation comes in that form of wanting some love herself, and once Makoto begins to seek that part of her while building on their strong friendship, Sekai becomes less impartial to her feelings and finds oneness through Makoto. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a myriad other brilliant cues loaded in each episode and the contrasting character traits among the cast that make the trysts so intricate and elaborate. Katsura being teased and constantly alienated by her big breasts and the jealousy that causes, partially assuming Makoto may have only been drawn to her that way to begin with and Makoto's beginning to lean on his more romantic spurrings by seeking the smaller sized Sekai for more earnest reasons; visual cues with the whole conflict as Makoto's growing indifference to Katsura capping off episode 3 is countered by early panty shots and the only uncensored breasts in the series in the following episode and many more. The series' direction is economic, unassuming and understated to make it all the more brilliant, especially considering how it makes all of that silly sounding stuff become so poignant. Yes, the classic romantic triangle between these 3 crafts an elaborate Shakespearean tragedy in its execution, hinted and epitomized in scenes as early as again, episode 1 and the high school entrance board scene where there's a crowd of unimportant shadowy figures as only Makoto and Katsura are portrayed normally. Shortly thereafter though, we see some other clear figures in the crowd - secondary characters that would try to force their way into the stage, with Sekai the foundation herself in the middle of them as the unassuming bridge of destiny to make the wheels of fate spin even more wildly.\\n\\n\r\nAs I passively mentioned earlier, while  the series has many twists and turns throughout its span it is very much a theatrical 2-act story (contrary to typical Malick works that are very cinematic and not as rigidly act-based) and the secondary characters share some interactions with the core 3 in the first half while they go about their romantic threads, they act more rebelliously, almost as if aware of their initial hand in the story to work their way into the core cast's lives more personally with more agency and ideology not normally found in \"secondary characters\". As episode 7 closes, one of the most vital (and naturally handled) twists occurs to shake the foundation of the story; Makoto's inability to flat out break up with the kind-hearted Katsura who had reciprocated his crush but not met his desires to go on and have affairs with Sekai, the one who had forsaken her role as an impartial guide to all of the \"humans'\" loves only to cater to the one innate to her human self as well is then directly confronted with Katsura, the one whose trust she had betrayed. As a result of this, Katsura's paradoxical doubting faith becomes twisted denial of Makoto's rejection and relentless devotion, Sekai becomes more tormented and begins to have very frivolous and even more \"human\" (and/or asinine) thoughts and worries, becoming a bit more distanced with Makoto and splitting their 'perfect being' absolution of love, which in turn, causes Makoto to become detached - desperate for a new fixing and union of love through easy sex. In comes the school fair, and with it, opportunities for secondary characters to act on their feelings more. \\n\\n\r\nFirst is Otome Kato, what would be the \"tsundere\" archetype for your normal harem (more on that later) who was buddy-buddy with Makoto in middle school but had become alienated by her feelings while constantly berating Katsura and so she finally gets the nerve to act on her true feelings and ask Makoto to go to the fair's special love room and accept her true feelings. Makoto, coming off the heels of feeling betrayed, simultaneously caters to his desires out of spite for Sekai and playing the love doctor for Otome so they both have something to gain out of it. They have sex in the special room at the fair (hint hint: the school is not normal, and that is deliberate) so Makoto now feels gratified with this new potential love interest and seeks to pursue it secretly as well to a degree while bearing with Sekai wanting to cement their relationship through the school bonfire dance (a very \"human\" or \"Katsura-esque\" thing to do) much to Makoto's chagrin. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the school festival \"arc\" is Kiyoura Setsuna (the scarcely emotive loli) trying to serve as Sekai's confidant after the latter comes down to Makoto's level to be in a relationship with him, helping to keep their relationship in tact while keeping Katsura at bay; truly however, she too desires Makoto herself after Makoto came to her aid when she was being bullied while hiding her desires and holding them off for later as she enabled Sekai to befriend him earlier in the year - be it to befriend him and work her cupid magic or actually start a relationship which runs a finely tuned ambiguity. She irrationally kisses Makoto twice under different circumstances, and the second one (when he is conscious) has him come to acknowledge her feelings for him, and as she goes to confront Makoto one last time at his apartment after his second affair with Otome telling him to \"commit to Sekai\" again, he sees through her ruse and acts on her true desires, having already experienced it in lieu of Sekai, and she embraces him for sex, betraying Sekai in the meantime while rather indifferent to Katsura in the long run. \\n\\n\r\nNext is Hikari Kuroda who was initially interested in another character: Taisuke Sawanaga, Makoto's \"friend\" who is an overt womanizer who wears his vices on his sleeve as an honest guy while making it out to be an exaggerated outcry of his loneliness; Hikari tried to get Taisuke to notice her feelings earlier on in the pool party episode, but he was typically too naive and jaded to notice, later going on to rape Katsura in an act of unhinged passion and desperation for Makoto betraying Katsura and getting so much sex while he is committed but unlucky. With Taisuke's ignorance of Hikari, affair with Katsura (also vaguely reminiscent of 'To the Wonder' with Marina's love fling) and all of the other events mounting together, Hikari's loneliness as her seeking sexually affluent Makoto to get some love herself. Although the school's awareness of Taisuke's act could be called into question, nonetheless Hikari was getting tired and desperate herself, and while she is probably one of the most morally shallow of the cast with her casual flirtation in Makoto's dangerous affairs (going to Sekai's house shortly after and lying through her teeth), her raw and simple drive can still bring some empathy out of her at the crux of what this series is all about. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Makoto is aiding all of these women, he is equally caving to more shallow desires with his lack of commitment and it is nurturing the bad qualities of his character creating steady moral decay intricately handled by his dialogue and reactions and the progression and ideologies of his road of sexual partners. Katsura, still aimlessly wandering and holding onto her hope of Makoto's return, is vulnerable to constant abuse from her peers yet again, and to an even greater degree as she breaks down more and more with how the world is completely destroying her. Sekai, whose relationship with Makoto is several shades or notches stronger than Katsura's, is still tormented by her thoughts of his infidelity while not totally on the brink of surreal insanity that Katsura is. The earthly guide has become a very affected individual while the very pure human girl has lost her humanity. \\n\r\nThings reach their boiling point when it is revealed that the \"special couple's room\" at the fair was being videotaped this whole time; Otome, having just met Sekai, is shown the video in front of a wide audience, and her affair with Makoto is now shown to Sekai who she just met. Sekai confronts Makoto about it in tears and then begins to become more recluse and deal with her feelings. \\n\\n\r\nMakoto now having nearly destroyed 2 great relationships, starts to show signs of duress, malaise and withdrawal, getting more sex out of Hikari for pleasure but feeling less satisfied, only for several of his classmates who saw the affair video and hear about his sexual endeavours wish simply to get in the action themselves, having no real connections to the main 3 prior, so Makoto gets into his most impersonal and nymphomaniac-driven outing yet: a 4-way with 3 random girls from school.\\n\\n\r\nLater, Sekai begins to suffer some morning sickness and misses her period (the latter part could be a lie), and in a fit of surprise and anxiety unwittingly yells to Makoto about it in class, subsequently reaching out as gossip in the school and having all of Makoto's mistresses cut their ties so he can take responsibility and raise a proper family with Sekai. Makoto, tainted by Sekai's earlier bits of dejection and spurred on by the copious amounts of sex he's had, is reluctant to comply to Sekai's wishes and tries contacting all of the other girls to no avail, until he runs into Katsura, still hysterically clinging to her love of Makoto, calls for him and he embraces her again (strengthened by an incredibly clever Chekhovian plot element). The trinity has now reformed and the stage is set for the finale of the grand tragedy as everything comes full circle and is honed, leading to the infamous conclusion which I shan't spoil to give you the treat of witnessing it in full if you haven't already as it is an absolute powerhouse and the perfect ending to all the madness.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, School Days is a series with which its characters provide a lot of the meat of the story, it takes the tired and true romantic triangle and tragedy story and takes it to explosive new heights. There is such a tempered, natural and poetic direction in its execution that never misses a beat, creating a masterclass work of fiction that is sprawling in its ambitions but deceptively unassuming in its intelligence that it can only be considered a near-godsend creation devoid of pretension but unfathomable in its power. With the constant mention of Terrence Malick, School Days again crafts an odyssey that has such smooth lyricism in its seemingly simple delivery, that it goes down so easily but with such an inexplicable majesty in each and every little scene that--as others have said of Malick--only come off as pretentious when you try to quantify them with just the right words, but I feel with such a magnificent Frankenstein's monster such as this, I must feebly attempt to do some justice.\\n\\n\r\nThe series tries to be both a meticulous satire and a flat out intense drama as I mentioned earlier that it has to be very careful that it doesn't become an absolute trainwreck, and I think it absolutely succeeds, but almost inherently in playing with such contrary ends, it is understandable that a lot of people would have a problem with it. The cast is filled to the brim with characters that are simultaneously total wretches and distorted plays on harem archetypes and achingly mortal individuals undergoing so much pathos that you don't get a truly clear feeling for them, but School Days doesn't hold your hand and look for easy answers. Makoto is your every-man - he's the blank slate, typically dorky and stupid male insert that wants to get laid and gets his wishes fulfilled fairly easily and in large doses, but on the other hand, he's a lost guy, looking for satisfaction and success in love, especially since he was rewarded a first and reciprocated one, but his mortal coils that trap him in trying to work with so many romance protocols to form a middle ground with your partner is so challenging when you plea so heavily for the complete end that he gets put off by Katsura's mixed signals and gets impatient with her restraint. It is akin to the social commentary in the episode of Kino's Journey where the whole town can constantly read each others true thoughts and isolate themselves as to not harm others and have privacy, meanwhile Makoto, despite struggling with his adolescent male libido, wanted a fantastic union with Katsura but was frustrated that they couldn't understand each other. Katsura in the long run is fully on board but takes her feminine agency and leash on Makoto so steadfastly while burdened with what might be Makoto's superficial desires for her large breasts to her character that she doesn't know how to keep his interest while she pines for the same end result. Sekai--as I've divulged earlier--is torn between the satisfaction she gets from the stability of everyone else in her world (the Sekai side) and her desires as a human woman (her Saionji side) which begins to root her more and more in the latter and ends up being her downfall. Whether Sekai's indecisiveness in itself, her attachment to her other friends to segue their involvement into the core tryst or simply her role on Earth caused things to take even wilder turns is another thought-provoking idea on just how much nature and spiritual forces coupled with morality could have a hand in making things take the route they did. As for their archetypes, Katsura is the central, faithful and sincere girl whose torment and betrayal twists her into a psychotic devotee (a shift to yandere tendencies as well) while  Sekai is the best pal outsider who then becomes the center of attention and becomes deprived of her new joy to become a genuinely hurt young woman. \\n\\n\r\nThe satire elements play out incredibly well through the visuals and plot as well, as normative events found in harem stories become outlets to explore darker outlets of these scenarios almost a la a deconstruction nature. \\n\r\nMost obviously for one is the classic pool/beach episode, in which Makoto's dwindling attraction to Katsura, increased feelings for Sekai coupled with the battle between the erotic desires and the romantic - utilizing Freudian psychology with precision and subtlety. Simple quick glances between cleavage and faces (character) again show stunning directorial deftness to elevate the ideas to something more profound. \"If it's not constantly and exaggeratedly highlighting the breasts, ecchi and fanservice can't be the highlight, yet the main character doesn't have long-winded faux-intellectual monologues, so it can't be some sappy romance, right?\" Right. This is something much more refined. \\n\\n\r\nThe other obvious occasion is the school festival where romantic pledges tend to come out in full as students profess their love and publicly display it in couple's dances and the like. Instead, we have the dance as the back-burner as the student-constructed festival (I don't even think you visually see teachers in the whole series) has a private love room which ends up being recorded on camera to cater to teen voyeurism ultimately (note that the pool episode is also in the first half while the festival is in the latter) as we realize that these generic harem scenarios can take ominous twists and adolescence isn't as straightforward and clean as it can be. The students' behaviour ends destroying one another as Makoto, Otome and others become further victims of scandal and deceit, so no one is safe from the clutches of these crazy yet initially common scenarios, and every small yet dire turn in morality can have overwhelming chain effects.\\n\\n\r\nThese broader things are bolstered by lots of minutia and red herrings in the script even from early episodes, there's haunting premonitions buried in some of the more anime-esque gags or slight temperamental reactions and changes of heart that pick things apart at the seams. It is sublimely orchestrated so much so that it again feels like unprecedented skill of writing. The series must be experienced first hand to cover each and every bit, because it is so dense. Notable examples like a line: \"What are you doing!? We're in Japan!\" Makoto says in response to a strange action at one point. The levels of irony both in Makoto's character saying this along with the very nature of the sentences are mind-boggling. Then there's stuff like Katsura's chat with her little sister Kokoro (meaning \"heart\") as Kokoro mentions that Makoto will be coming to stay the night some time and that \"lots of things can happen\" when he stays the night, to which Katsura upstartly retaliates: \"It's nothing like that! We're not going to be getting it on!\" (paraphrased), meanwhile Kokoro responds: \"I meant he will be able to play with us lots and lots!\" The characterization and broader implications of even small scenes like this are just astounding.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as production values go, this series looks and sounds for the most part REALLY generic (it's also called \"School Days\"), but I think that only further serves to lure otaku in and get the attention it needs to bait and shatter them. Mamoru Oshii tried his hand at a satire of otakudom and spoon-feeding of mass-produced genre fiction devoid of intelligence and originality, however, the problem with Sky Crawlers is largely in its execution and ultimately leaves it lost and not as important and pronounced as it could be. Oshii made a flat out boring film crammed with so much dead air, esoteric Oshii trappings and generally unexciting content of some clean visuals that it would easily turn away all of the people he's directing his criticism at, leaving only the well-minded individuals to indulge in his oblique rant and meditation on how bleak and crappy things are right now. Preaching to the choir Oshii! School Days meanwhile, is involved, committed, deceptive and broad in its scheme. People who want another harem genre will get bits of that, then get their presumptions and ideologies totally annihilated while keen viewers will get a rise out of the blistering satirical nature and richly nuanced and thought-provoking story of love and its disastrous, world-shattering consequences in its many forms.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is an uncompromisingly brutal antithesis to the harem genre and the people who gluttonously intake it - presenting how standard archetypes would unravel with callous regards to morals and how unrealistic those expectations for women are to begin with as Makoto indulges too much in the dark side of love and gets his just desserts. School Days is also a beautiful examination of the trials and turbulence of love and those mislead by it; Makoto's desire for the ultimate ecstasy and transcendence out of love (partly factored and nurtured by his demographic) is amiable, but he forgets to regard some of the hanging emotions of those he makes love with and allows himself to become corrupt and chaos to unleash because of it.\\n\r\nSchool Days is a series that has gained a reputation at least, even if it is for some of the wrong reasons, the series is iconic and has a small place in anime culture, but I'm sure with time people will give it another look and warm to it as the wunderkind it truly is. Many may see a sleazy, messed-up and inane harem story with a bunch of unlikable characters. Others, an identity confused mess perhaps. Given the weird nature of the series, all of the stars aligning and points being held positively in such a strange way may be seen as heresy, but I see a masterpiece, call me crazy. I don't think I can cover everything even.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is a mis-appraised modern Shakespearean tragedy, a pertinent and important satire and dark and challenging love story of the highest caliber.",

It's been given many names..\r\nSuch as\u2026a psychological high school drama\r\n\u2026Messed Up Anime Number Two [Number One being Boku No Pico]\r\nAnd the worst anime ever.\r\nJudging by the score I gave this, try and see what I thought of it.\r\nSo, I'll try to make this short. The main character, Makoto Itou, does look kinda cute at first, but then he turns into a guy so pathetic and hungry for women that a complex romance happens that usually has him going out with almost every girl in the show. Honestly, it's even degrading women.\r\nThe only decent character that I actually felt sorry for was Kotonoha.You'll find out why if you ever lose your mind and actually watch the show. The others are just stereotypical women with common senses of cardboard and you just want to slap Makoto in the face all the time.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I will give it credit for being better than Boku No Pico and having a decent-ish ending.\\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fan of good anime, stay the hell away from this. But, if you are bored and want to see what the controversy is about with this show, go and watch it. Also, at least the animation is the most decent thing in the show.\\n\\n\r\nDon't say I didn't warn you.",

            "content": "This anime could be considered one of the more controversial anime out there because its either said to be a great psychological anime, or an utter waste of your time. And in my opinion, it was an utter waste of time.\r\nPlot:\r\nWeeeelll, plotwise, the anime doesnt set any kind of new boundaries, but thats not to be expected in an anime about a dude who wants to get girls into bed.\r\nIt's revolves around relationsships and a crapton of betrayal. There is a lot of melodrama and the only saving grace for this animes story is its twist ending. And honestly, it was pretty damn satisfying. Imean, it was the only thing that actually stood out in this anime. All in all, the story is generic, but that wouldnt be that much of a problem if there werent the ....\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTHIS is the point that made me mad. The MC, Makoto, is a douchebag. I think his brain slipped down into his dick when he was in kindergarden ... but uhh, nevertheless, he is irresponsible for his actions. He is in a relationship and cheats with multiple girls at same the time. And he does so many stupid decisions, that not many anime dicks could do, but I think his end was quite fitting ^^\\n\r\nThen theres Sekai, without getting to much into her (*badpunintended*) shes a person who doesnt do anything without ulterior motives. She is the person who triggered the whole thing around Makoto. Makoto's girlfriend, Kotonoha is the victim of the Makotos actions. Shes a pretty airheaded, shy and most importantly ( at least for Makoto i guess ) busty Character. You cann see some of the effects on her around the end ( especially in the ending ).Theres the best friend of Makoto, and the girls he cheats with but they're basically just there to be there. Theres next to nothing about them that stands out. I short, they are quite irrelevant in this anime. In terms of character development, ... well ..., at least some of them changed during th 12 eps, but that stuff toned down my personal enjoyment of the anime, because I got pretty fucking angry at the way some of the characters developed. A quick summary of all this: Characters ruined the anime for me, because 2 of the most important characters are people that you'd call: Slut, whore, dickbag, asshole ( ... ) in real life.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\r\nIts fine, i mean, the art is pretty run of the mill, while the animation is farely okay too. The music was pretty forgetable. Righ now, I dont even remember on single OST from the anime. School Days' Presentation is okay.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOh ... My .. God... if you havent realized yet, in terms of enjoyment this think is absolutely horrible. Even if it were a psychological expermiment, the characters just piss you off and the way the develop doesnt make you like them as well. I watched this anime due to its infamous reputation in the anime community and of course .... THE ENDING. This anime basically builds up to the ending and BAM, and done. I think that the ending is pretty well done. But if the best thing about your anime is THAT and HOW it ends, that isnt a good thing. The ending was pretty good, the beginning was okay and the middle is pisspoor in my opinion\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIts a piece of garbage with some gold under it. That is what School Days is to me. An Anime that stinks of MEH with a shocking but damn satisfying conclusion. Would I recommend it ? HELL NO! If you want to see School Days for that psychological aspect, go ahead. But that aspect doesnt make it fun to watch. So for any anime watcher who like charismatic, cool, likeable characters you can sympathize with ... STAY THE HELL AWAY ^^.",

            "content": "I first heard of School Days as a psychological anime, and I totally agree with that. This anime shows you how doing certain things and not doing certain things to a girl will hurt their minds so badly it will be beyond repair. Literally. Romance is not a thing to be taken lightly.\r\nStory: 8/10 *MIGHT CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS*\r\nIt starts innocently enough. Makoto, your average high school guy, likes this girl, Kotonoha, and doesn't know how to confess, etc. Then, Sekai comes along, and helps him. A love triangle forms, and it's basically how an average romantic love triangle starts. Makoto starts being perverted, Kotonoha doesn'tknow how to react,  and Sekai starts \"training\" him in the art of getting a girl. This is where it takes a turn for the worse. Makoto starts having feelings for Sekai, and they cheat behind Kotonoha's back. Then, 2 more girls, Setsuna and Otome, started to like him, and a complicated and perverted romantic relationship occurs, with Makoto, being the perverted bastard he is, starts to bounce between the girls, having sex with them too (except Kotonoha, sadly). As if it could get any worse, a big plot twist appears. Seriously. I really expected the plot twist, but it was sickening nevertheless. \\n\\n\r\nThen in the ending Makoto gets what he deserves.\\n\r\nThe ending was when I was shouting \"hell yeah!\" to my computer because seriously. The ending was that fulfilling.  Makoto got what he deserves in the end, and trust me, you'll hate him as much (if not more) than I do. The scene was awesomely done too, and it made me sick to my stomach to see how horrifying the ending is. It almost justifies how the rest of the series played out, but not exactly. I found the story to be truly unbelievable. 4 girls liking the same guy? Them having sex and not getting pregnant? Unbelievable! Oh, I also have to note it's adapted from a H-game, so expect many inferences about sex scenes here. I guess that the original game had a harem ending, but there was a VERY messed up ending, which is what they adapted here.  The producers are assholes, to not even adapt the WORST ENDING POSSIBLE from the H-game, and make one themselves. According to wikipedia, there were 3 bad endings, where either Makoto, Sekai, or Kotonoha dies. I'm guessing they created their own bad ending, because the anime ending is not in there.\\n\r\nRants aside, the story is great for sickening your stomach and teaching you a lesson: Karma's a bitch and how NOT to treat a girl.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art fits this anime, with their eyes animated to show their emotion at any given point. As I said, it also tricks you into thinking this is your average romantic anime, which has its props, knowing how sickening this show is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening did not fit the anime. It was way too cheery knowing the tone of this. BGM was okay, it didn't really set the mood for me. The seiyuus did a pretty good  job with their characters, though I thought Sekai's seiyuu doesn't fit her character, but maybe that's just only me. And I felt sometimes their voices did not fit the situation either. Again, maybe it's just only me.\\n\r\nI just felt the sound was average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nI gave a 5/10, not in a good way, but of how much you'll hate the characters so much. Makoto is my most HATED character of all time, whose a horny, selfish bastard that doesn't care about who he hurts and who he doesn't. All he cares about is getting laid. When I first watched it, I really didn't get what's with the hate surrounding Makoto. Now after I watched everything, I know. To wish that he would stop being a stupid asshole and actually get a clue of what's going on was actually a great feeling, and when the ending came I cheered and cheered, as I mentioned. \\n\r\nI hated the girls too. They were your generic, anime girls, but still. Clueless as hell, mostly selfish except for Setsuna, who shows a little unselfishness, no character development, etc. The only girl I cared about was Kotonoha, and that was out of pity more than love. Overall, a 5/10. I applaud how much I can hate EVERY.SINGLE.CHARACTER. in an anime, which I thought would never be possible. The only thing that was good about the characters was the design, but that's it!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nIn terms of a psychological  anime, which I love, it was horrible! I didn't enjoy it, and found myself thinking \"why did I watch this shit???\" in the ending, despite the good ending. And I was sick to the stomach all the time, to the point where I had to pause the video to calm myself down. And I didn't like it. The first few eps were also a surprise for me, which played as a stupid romance, which I don't watch much.\\n\r\nTL;DR, I didn't like it. Call me a hater if you shall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI found this to be very interesting. The characters I despite with a passion, and combined with a story like this one, it's a masterpiece in dark storytelling.\\n\r\nMorals will be learned. Hate will be formed towards the characters.  Shock will constantly enter your mind. This is first, and foremost, a psychological anime, so don't expect lovey-dovey crap. Expect to hate, and hate, and hate even more. This is what I experienced when I watched School Days.",

            "content": "This was probably the most aggravating anime I&rsquo;ve ever seen; yet I finished it in a few days time because it makes you want to see the end. Frankly there&rsquo;s not much point in me writing this review, School Days has been reviewed 45 times already. Seriously, it must be one of the most reviewed anime on MAL. But the more reviews it gets&hellip; the more people take notice and watch it. However, if you also notice that while it has almost 10,000 members, it has only a little over 200 favorites. If you watch this series you&rsquo;ll see why&hellip; it&rsquo;s addicting, but most peoplewould be fed up and baffled over the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nNever have I been so entangled in such a despicable story. I hated it, but at the same time I must admit, I liked it. Is this your typical harem you ask? No. No it isn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d think it might be if you haven&rsquo;t heard any spoilers or shocking exclamations over the show, and you just found School Days at random. You&rsquo;d think it might be the first 5 or so episodes when everything is progressing as a normal harem would. And then&hellip; it gets a little shaken up. You see, the story begins with the protagonist Itou Makoto. At first, the basic concept is that he likes a shy girl named Kotonoha. His newly found friend Sekai helps him, and it turns out Kotonoha feels the same way, etc etc. However&hellip; Sekai actually has feelings for Makoto as well. \\n\\n\r\nWhat&rsquo;s more, may I state that also never have I before hated the protagonist as much as I did while watching this series. Basically every girl he met he found a way to hurt them, while completely disregarding their sentiment and only thinking of his own feelings of covetousness and sexual passion. I mean, honestly, as you watch the series, Makoto pretty much takes any girl he can put to bed easily. And for some reason, quite a few girls like him. Don&rsquo;t ask me why, it&rsquo;s incomprehensible. This anime really sets you up for the end so it&rsquo;s vital to watch the whole series once you get started on it; there&rsquo;s no point in dropping it beforehand no matter how annoyed you get (and trust me, you will). You possibly will want to shake the screen, so out of safety precaution to your monitor, please scoot your chair back a bit while viewing. \\n\\n\r\nIs it entirely Makoto&rsquo;s fault, this screwed up chain of events that you may or may not witness, depending on whether you wish to watch this deranged series? Perhaps not. Certainly at one point Sekai was in the blame, especially to Kotonoha. The other girls were at fault as well as Sekai. Kotonoha, throughout the series, was one of the few who didn&rsquo;t really do anything wrong&hellip; she was the only one who actually lost their sanity, too, which graduated slowly from denial to mental illness.  Nevertheless, if Makoto wasn&rsquo;t such a complete jerk then none of this would have happened. There are moments where it seems he feels resentment towards his actions, and regrets what he&rsquo;s done. But then his further actions prove otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nice. I can't say it's beautiful, but it&rsquo;s pleasing to the eye. They style that the characters are draw in is pretty, and most of the time the animation is consistent and fluid enough. As for sound, the opening was all right, with a somewhat generic sound. I liked the ending themes a little more. But the BGM was very fitting most of the time&hellip; I loved the waltz-type piano BGM that played once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nThough this series is absolutely frustrating, I must say it certainly knows how to draw the audience in, to be sure. You want to keep watching and watching, just to see if Makoto gets what he deserves. And does he? Hmm, well, wait and see. School Days reminds me of the review quote on the back of Lord of the Flies, which I just read&hellip;\\n\r\n&ldquo;Evil is inherent in the human mind, whichever innocence may cloak it&rdquo;. You may like Makoto at first&hellip; but watch out&hellip;\\n",

            "content": "- \"This anime is ridiculous\"\r\nIt's tragic, it's twisted and has maybe the best end i've ever seen in an anime, but it isn't psychological, please stop saying that. Now alllow me to explain:\r\n-> School Days is about a love triangle. Starts with Makoto, a shy guy who finds attracted to a girl named Katsura and with help from Sekai, his classmate, he manages to talk to her and start a relationship.. Everythingl good until there, but there are lots of plot twists, and things suddenly go in an unpredictable way ending with tragedy ala some Shakespeare novel. Sounds good right?\r\n- But wait, some of theso called plot twists make you enter in despair and hate almost every character, specially the male protagonist [Makoto], who is a weird mix between a shy, indecisive person and a sex hungry animal that somehow manages to get 90% of the cast to sleep with him. See? Ridiculous\\n\\n\r\n-> This anime shows us a good amount of dramatic cases in a relationship, the lack of decision to move on, how uncomfortable can be dealing with situations when you no longer love a person but don't wanna hurt him/her, the \"denial\" syndrome, and the thin line existing between love and obsession, very deep.\\n\\n\r\n- Still, something didn't make this series enjoyable, and i'm not talking about the despicable characters, i'm referring to certain cases in which you just couldn't believe how nonsensical the situation was.. Chapter 11 is maybe the perfect example, but there are quite a few spread over there. This situations ruined what could have been a very good tragedy story, and turned it up into a ridiculous one.. Moreover, the \"normal\" parts of this show adopt a soap opera style, something which honestly bored me to death.\\n\\n\r\n** I'm not a person who demands a lot about the art and sound, so i found them right, although the animation maybe was a bit subpar considering the date of release.. The sound blends well, that means it does the job perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, this is a hit or miss show, ones may be fascinated by the unpredictability on the story and for some of the characters' personality, and others may feel disgusted or even sad to see how unreal this so called \"psychological\" tale can become.. For me it was a miss, i expected a lot of this show and ended up being dissapointed.. oh well, that happens.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nYou Should See At Least: 5 episodes, from there and if you have read any synopsis you can pretty much tell how the story will turn out to be, also you can get a grasp of the \"hate\" factor if you reach there\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all from me, first review.. i don't know, i just felt like writing one :) \\n\r\nThanks for reading! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "School days is an anime that is infamous for its different take on the harem genre by taking a dark path. But even though it brings these new ideas to the table of the harem genre, it does a lot wrong, a whole smegging lot :P. \r\nArt and Sound: 5/10\r\nThere isn't very much special about the art and sound of this anime. The art and animation is nothing special, it isn't good but it isn't bad either. The intro isn't special, but it does match the (sort of) eerie tone to the series. The soundtrack isn't particularly impressive either, only the soundtrack used in thelast episode left any effect on me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThe thing that absolutely pisses me off about school days is the characters, this series possibly has the worst characters of any anime that i have watched, they are all barely fleshed out that they barely felt human, the actions that they take is the most illogical bullshit i have ever seen in my life. I don't know any person with at least half a brain that would do any of the things that these characters seem to think as a logical choice. and then. There is. Makoto.... \\n\r\nHe is the biggest fucking shit cunt asshole motherfucking piece of shit scum, the world has ever fucking seen, i have never gotten as pissed off at any character until i saw Makoto, and boy, was i fucking pissed. I nearly punched a hole in my wall because of how much of a cunt he is. He shows no respect for everyone and he is just determined to backstab people. He also reminds me of some dipshit that goes to my old school :P.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nThe story is so far fetched that and stupid, i don't know who in their right mind thought that this story would make a good anime adaption. I find the main basis of the story bs, because the main basis is everyone falling for the shitcunt A.K.A Makoto. But.. What is special about him, he looks like the biggest dumb cunt and he has no likable qualities except for having empathy at the start of the series, but for some reason this makes everyone fall head over heels for him. \\n\\n\r\nI would give my enjoyment of Schools Days a 1/10. But.. That is not including the last episode :D\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode for me was one of the greatest finales i have ever seen. Not because it rounded up the show well, leaving you satisfied. It was because i have never felt so happy in my life, the last episode was meant to leave you shocked, but for me i was crying tears of joy. I cant say what it was exactly because that would be a spoiler, but if you have seen the show, you know exactly what i am talking about. So i give the final episode, 11/10\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Schools Days tries to aim for something new in the harem genre, but instead falls flat with poor story writing and shitty characters. I would only recommend this show if you a masochist or if you like getting really angry (idk why). \\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review (if you don't count my troll sao review). So if it was pretty shitty or not up to your standards then instead of going on my profile and chucking a tantrum. Give me some constructive criticism",

            "content": "All I can do is praise this series for its incredible power to piss the viewer off. Where do you even begin? I will just start out by saying that I have never wrote a review on here before, but after I finished this series I was so horrified and irritated by it that I couldn't help but to explain everything that is so wrong about this show. So without further introduction, Here is what i got from when i was watching school-days. I have tried my best not to include any spoilers but for a warning, it is hard not to get to theroot of the problem of this series by not addressing them. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: (4/10)\\n\r\nSchool Days is passed off as a psychological anime (If you want to give it that much credit) and starts out with a clich\u00e9  love triangle type harem storyline.  Makoto Itou is on the train to school one day and falls for Katsura Kotonoha, later that same day, A girl who goes by the name of Sekai Saionji who sits by him in class, notices this and makes a plan so that she can get the two of them together. It all seems to be going well until at the end of the episode we see Sekai kissing Makoto, leading us to believe it could be something more than just an act of friendship. Aside from the fanservice scattered throughout the story, the idea behind it isn't so bad, and I probably wouldn't of minded it if it wasn't for its main downfall, the characters, which I will get onto later. The main thing I disliked about the story is that to me the pacing seemed very odd, In the last 3 episode there is so many betrayals it is hard to keep count of what girls Makoto hasn't been with, and the love triangle ends up evolving into a love octagon, and everything he does just seems to be there for a mixture of shock value and to annoy the audience, not to actually move the plot forward. It just left me to think ''What actually is so attractive about this guy?' because it makes no sense to me why he any of the female characters in this show would want to be with a indecisive, lying, cheating joke of a protagonist (and that's putting it nicely).  Additionally, I did some research into the use of love-triangles in storylines and it seems to me that the entire plot of the show was just taken from Wikipedia, which leaves me to wonder what the director even did in the production for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOne person typically ends up feeling betrayed at some point, e.g. 'Person A is jealous of person C who is having a relationship with person B who, in person A's eyes, is \"his\" person'. Love triangles are inherently unstable, with one sided love and jealousy as common themes. Love triangles have been known to lead to murder or suicide committed by the actual or perceived rejected lover. (Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle).\\n\r\nSchool days storyline in a nutshell is basically just a butchery of this concept,\\n\r\nwhich is why I am unable to give it more than a 4 because it is neither an enjoying or original premise.\\n\\n\r\nART: (5/10)\\n\r\nThe artwork for this series is average, I wouldn't say there is anything that was fantastic in terms of the animation but thats not to say there is anything specifically wrong with it, I didn't find a problem with the artstyle I just found the colour palette behind it a bit boring and overused, many of the girls look extremely similar. The art for the main protagonist (Makoto) in my opinion is the worst, his facial features are pretty simple and I don't really know what the animators we're thinking behind his hairstyle, I just didn't think that it suited his personality. The art redeems itself in the Introduction, which has some of the best drawings in the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (3/10)\\n\r\nThis isn't going to be a long section because I think I listened to the intro once or twice and then found myself skipping through it to get to the episode. It just wasn't for me. I found that as the episodes progressed it didn't really fit very well with what was happening on the show either, it seemed strange to have such an upbeat and light sounding song when the show was getting very dark. None of the music in the actual episodes stood out to me either, and was pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: (1/10)\\n\r\nI don't think I have ever been so vexed by any characters from any anime series as i was with this. I wish there was a 0/10 option because the main character for the most part was beyond repulsive its hard to put into words.\\n\r\nNone of the girls are really given a brain, and just seem to be there so that Makoto has more people to have sex with, as if they serve no other purpose. \\n\r\nThe problem with this? You are left with a character base of 2-dimensional high school girls (no pun intended) and a fuckboy of a protagonist (excuse my french). You may be wondering what could be so bad about him? Apart from the fact that he is a cheater, Makoto simply does not take into account anybody else apart from himself, He seems to only care about satisfying himself sexually than anybody elses feelings. And when hes confronted about it? He simply denies it or blames it on somebody else. In this series, nothing ever seems to be his fault. Which seems ironic since he is the one who cheats not with one - but about 8/9 different girls. His very indecisive behaviour to just choose one girl and stay with her becomes really old really fast, and if he was a real person makes me want to physically punch him in the face. Again, the girls don't seem to notice this and instead fight with eachother over who deserves him more, quite frankly, he deserves nobody. The moment when it goes downhill is when he tells Sekai ''Having Kotonoha as a girlfriend is kind of tiring'' after they have been going out for...you guessed it! Two days! After he started a relationship with the girl hes had an eye on for a while, how does he thank her? By sleeping with Sekai who acted as her friend to get them together in the first place! No words...  Even if this was a proper relationship, there is a very easy way to solve this, he could just break it off with Kotonoha, but instead, he continues lying to her and avoiding her so he can have his secret ''practice lessons'' with Sekai.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main female characters, Kotonoha and Sekai, end up being no better either. At first, you do feel sympathy for Kotonoha but in the end this is all lost due to the fact of how stupid she is, ofcourse you would be upset if you're boyfriend was cheating on you, but to me it makes no logical sense how she could be that attached to him after 2 days, throughout the series she constantly tries to get him back even after finding out about all the horrible things he has done, such as lying to her, blocking her number, avoiding her, trying to feel her up, cheating ect. Any normal person would run 10 miles. What does she do? Keep telling people that they are boyfriend and girlfriend. This eventually leads to her downward spiralling into insanity, which seems completely unjust and unreasonable since like i said..they we're dating for 2 days!!! If anything, the most upsetting part about this is that her so called ''friends'' we're completely fine with what Makoto was doing and went around calling her a slut and bullying her because Otome (another forgettable sex partner of Makotos) was jealous. Oh the irony. \\n\\n\r\nSekai comes in at a close second, why you might ask? Because she is Vindictive and two faced so she can get whatever she wants. So when her best friend cheats with THATS RIGHT YOU GUESSED IT, Makoto, Nobody is bothered since she did the exact same thing. She lies to Makoto to seduce him and drag him away from Kotonoha, showing that she actually has an ulterior motive for everything she does and that she is not genuinely in love or upset about what has happened, and its all just to get back at somebody or to get what she wants because she is Jealous or that she has to be in control. As you can probably guess, Both Sekai and Kotonoha end up becomind Yanderes by the end of the series, and who really can blame them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters just make unrealistic and baseless decisions that are impracticable and don't really serve up any real purpose except to make it come off that the highschool they go to is full of fake lying sluts and boys who are so horny they will sleep with anything that moves if he opportunity arrises.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: (3/10)\\n\r\nThe only reason I haven't given this a 1 is because of the ending, Even if it was a little unexpected, I feel like it is the only time in the show I actually rejoiced and was happy. If you haven't guessed what the ending is by now, well you're in for a surprise. I don't know if i could say it was worth sitting through 11 episodes of this crap though, although it was definitely satisfying for the amount of rage that I had accumulated.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: (2/10)\\n\r\nThe series really left me with nothing except questioning the morals and mindset behind the characters, then after i remembered that the director gave them none whatsoever, it just left me really really angry. The anime does not deserve its credit based on the ending alone. And when people tell you this is a series to be avoided, heed the warning, I wish i hadn't wasted any time and energy watching this garbage.",

            "content": "Okay I'll try not to include any spoilers so bear with me. So from the synopsis given at the top of the page, you pretty much have all you need to start watching. Is it enough? Well even I don't know that after watching this anime. This is one of those shows where your going to have an opinion at the end; when it comes down to who was right and wrong, it will make you think. \r\nStory: 9\r\nIn my opinion, this was a great story line. This is a gut wrenching story about the lives of a group of students and what can happenwhen you disregard the feelings of another. Most of the events and scenarios are quite capable of being real but thats the beauty that draws you into their world. There is probably a small percentage of people who don't know someone who has Motoko-like qualities. He was the nice guy who talked to you when you were lonely, the guy who became your friend when you no one else, even your childhood buddy. But then he changed, what exactly these girls see in him, who knows.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nOverall the art was drawn nicely, not enought to make you press pause and stare at the light shining in the window but clean and tight enough to help move the story. As far as characters, I thought they could have made Katsura and Saionji a little more distinguished from each other in the beginning. I think my only reference during beginning closeups were the difference between Katsura and Saionji's eyes. Once you get past the beginning it is much easier to tell who is who.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nAh the music fit so perfectly, a blend of softness and correct placement is part of what made this anime. The story is sad enough as it is, but added with the soundtrack, I'll be a little surprised if your eyes don't water at least once. Actually I would be very surprised...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAlright this is where I have my problems. Don't get me wrong, I know this series was about the girls and their relationship with Motoko but come on. We weren't introduced to any decent guys. They could have done a little better not portraying all guys as dogs. Well I take some of that back, the only two guys we know that don't cheat, also never showed their faces in the series(I'll let you figure out who). I thought a little more could have been done with Nanami Kanroji (the tall basketball girl); though she is not a major part of the story, by the end of the story I was wondering what happened to her because of *certain circumstances*. Also I didn't really like the amount of girls Motoko was involved with during that 1 to 2 year span, (compared to the amount of girls we were introduced to). It was a little over the top near the end, something I felt wasn't really needed. That being said, I like the recovery of Otome's character at the end, she had me doubting her a few times. But everyone can't be good, we see this in a variety of characters near the end regardless of their relationship \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really liked School Days. It was a pretty sweet train ride that got me thinking about a lot of things. When it comes to people around us, are we being considerate of others or using others to feel better about ourselves? Should we wish for our loved ones happiness with person or should we claim it ourselves? Sorry I'm rambling but yeah, I definitely recommend this anime as long as your ready to delve into the lives of people desperately wanting to be loved. If you end up taking this anime too seriously, the lines between fantasy and reality may disappear and thats something we don't want happening.",

            "content": "There are few shows that make you truly put yourself in the shoes of the protagonist as School Days. That being said, be prepared for one of the most complex and lovable main characters in anime if you intend to watch this show. Yet, despite all the empathy, feel-good moments, and moral lessons present, the show itself isn't the most recommendable thing.\r\nSchool Days is the story about a boy named Makoto struggling with his undying love and affection in a cruel world trying to take advantage of him. With a cast of predominantly crude females trying to erode his incredible spirit, you'll smile every timehe manages to come out on top; I won't spoil it here, but the understanding and sheer consideration the main character possesses in the face of adversity is inspiring to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, that's where the show's story shines, but it also has some less sightly aspects. For instance, this is a drama, which means it moves slow, and if you couldn't tell by the title, it takes place in a \"School\" during \"Days,\" which is as exciting as it sounds at times. It's easy to be bored, at least before getting to know the illustrious depths of our male hero's goals, but once invested, you may weep with passion.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the art is rather dull, being barely passable as something to look at. Some characters look nearly identical and that's rather misleading. They seem cute and bubbly, which may be artistic subversion, as it's quite a dark world our innocent Makoto inhabits. \\n\\n\r\nSound isn't much to write home about, but what you can write is one of Makoto's amazing, heart-felt speeches to his adversaries. It wouldn't surprise me if the script for this show was written by a politician; this character knows how to move a crowd. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want to experience an enlightening, warm character come...out on top of it all  with a will to triumph against all odds, you must watch this show, even though it's mostly slow and uninteresting.",

            "content": "It is rare that an animation has enough emotional impact to influence almost every person that watches it. School Days is a jem in that way. Most people have a strong (usually vehement) visceral reaction to it. I walked away shocked, disgusted, and disturbed. I hated this anime to the fullest extent, and wondered why I wasted my life watching it. When I said \"shocked and disgusted,\" I was sugar-coating it. \r\nI thought that this had to be the most horrible anime I had ever seen. The characters were so shallow, the plot paper thin, revolving around a wavering moral hook hidden beneath senseless violence.Well, people are shallow. Most of us don't like admitting it, but most of us are soiled in some way. We're vain, petty, arrogant, stupid, and all around imperfect. All guys have a little Makoto in them, and all girls have that Sekai impulse at some point or another. (If you haven't seen the show and don't understand what I mean, then that's fine. Suffice to say that no one's perfect.)\\n\\n\r\nOnce I finished this anime, after the shock and disgust settled in, I felt compelled to rewatch it. Then, for some reason, I skipped to where the drama began boiling up. Then, I skipped right to the end. I rewatched those three parts over and over, arbitrarily, and walked away with a guilty pleasure. Oddly enough, I found myself craving the relationship that grew between the main characters (minus the ending). I craved that level of emotional intensity and devotion. I even found another person who admitted the same to me. In fact, it seems a fairly common reaction. In retrospect, it isn't all that surprising that people walk away so disgusted. They aren't disgusted solely at the show, but at themselves as well. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I would rate as \"must watch.\" It's not excellent in the classical way, nor does it demonstrate revolutionary characteristics. Instead, it gets down to the nitty gritty. It shows--no, assaults--us with what we're borderline afraid to see in a way that allows us (if we give it the chance) to reflect on our lives and all of that fun stuff.",

I was getting really fed up with how he acted, but I figured i shouldn't half-assit, so i continued. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the series, i found myself disturbed, yet at peace because Makoto got what he deserved (YES!). I also was unable to sleep because of the fact that this can be high school drama at its worst in some twisted world. I found myself hating this series, but i started realizing, no other anime i have watched in all my years has made me react in such a passionate way.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"School Days\" is a must see anime, and will go down as one of my favorite, and most hated anime's of all time. I highly recommend watching it.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: this anime is not for the feint hearted.",

            "content": "YES. It is ANOTHER SchoolDays review!\r\nFirst and foremost I have a split personality and sometimes \"it\" also wants to write. \"It\" is a very tidy monster so it will use (brackets) to do so. Ignore him if you want.\r\n\"School Days haters. They're Everywhere.\" \r\nHow far would you let your emotions take you?\r\nFor a magnificent and very singular piece of work, a (excentric) ordinary review.\r\nThe truth about us humans is: we make mistakes, undeniably make mistakes. Some of us try to go back and turn them into good solutions but others only live on with things like they are.\r\nSchoolDays is a H-game based anime, nothing comparedto what you have ever watched before. One could say it shows the \"true side\" of dramas/harems. You may like it or hate, however, almost everyone who watched it says it was unique. For modern anime fans it's a must.\\n\r\n(This is the \"viewers\" thoughts, of course.)\\n\r\nThe production thoughts would be something more like: We made a nice profit from this game... why don't we put it on TV and see if we can make more (honey) money from it?!\\n\\n\r\nShall we start with the best elaborated part of it? The Story!\\n\r\nYour School Days weren't that awesome? Aren't you glad that you had a ordinary school life?\\n\r\nAfter you finish watching try to answer this question.\\n\r\nIt's the freshman year for Itou Makoto... blablabla. I won't waste your time with the summary of this story. What you need to know: It was based on a GAME, so don't expect too much. Basically, it follows the well known patern of harems. 50 different writers gathered to write their ideias, then in the 7th day, the director selected the worst of them and gave it to a monkey. The monkey selected the best parts and then SchoolDays were born. Bald with red eyes. (Sorry I digress, lets get back to the topic)\\n\r\nThis is a story you must (try) to watch without any kind of spoilers (yes I know, even here the synopsis itself spoiled the entire first episode) but make a try because if you do so, you'll (probably) have a way better enjoyment of the series than the ones who already knew the ending. This way you'll keep getting surprised until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give 9 of 10 to the characters of SchoolDays. While reviewing we try to give scores based on how this characters were placed into the story, how were they animated and how character development worked. Working with this parameters, it was a magnificient job for a Visual Novel adaptation. Now, if I were to review the characters personalities' (...) \\n\r\nTwist this score upside down and you have my rating.\\n\r\nThe main character is a damn man whore. His only objective is to have sex with almost every girl he meets. (I spoiled? where!? oh...) Fluffy stuff like \"other ppl feelings\" doesn't mean a thing to him. In order to maintain my dignity here, I won't talk about the girls.\\n\\n\r\nI would review OST and BGM. Would give it a score and show the good and bad aspects about it (like every other review) but... To be honest, I didn't give importance to it. It was there, of course, but nothing stood out. It was average. So average that I can't even remember any song in particular. The OP and ED were nicely animated but again, followed that clich\u00e9 pattern. \\n\r\nKeep in mind that this isn't a anime that will have heart touching moments with violins in the background like it's usually seen in other romance/drama stories.\\n\\n\r\nJust like sound, don't have great expectations about the artwork. It is alright. Not perfect. You can notice that it lacks of budget sometimes. For characters, they all had pretty \"standard faces\" and expressions sometimes seemed distorted. The girls obviously had gorgeous bodies that sometimes appeared with larger boobs like in the bikinis scenes, making you wonder \"how I didn't notice it when she was in her school uniform?\".\\n\r\nSimplifying it, Artwork: As you would expect from a average harem.\\n\\n\r\nIts hard to measure the enjoyment of this show. You may find it disgusting, horrible, much more realistic than you expected, messed up, perverted... Don't worry! Even if you find it hilarious you're not crazy at all. (Hysterical laughter would better describe it) \\n\r\nThis is a anime for you to sit back and watch. Don't try to find a \"deeper meaning\" into it, because THERE ISN'T ONE. \\n\r\nThere're a lot of reviews about this anime saying it deserves a 10/10 for its \"psychological touch\" and all this crap. For me, enjoyment is measure by how you liked watching. It doesn't necessarily mean you felt good after watching it, sad stories are also great. However, if you finish it stressed, cursing everyone, or wondering \"what the f*** did I just watch?\" then my friend, it was CRAP. \\n\r\n[FAQ]Is it twisted? Yes, it is. Don't expect a light-hearted school drama.\\n\r\nAfter watching this, you'll feel the need to watch something innocent. Try Lucky Star :D\\n\\n\r\n Final score> yeah... worth watching.\\n\r\n::Story 6/10 | Characters 9/10 | Art 6/10 | Sound 6/10 | Enjoyment 4/10 | Overall 6.2/10::\\n\r\nThank you for reading my nonsense. (triyed hard to not make a \"nice boat'ed\" review)\\n\\n\r\n[English is NOT my first language, for the mistakes my apologies!] [Whatever button you decide to hit, please help me improve by making comments or sending me a PM. Appreciate it]",

            "content": "It was on a rainy day, and I was bored as hell, but too tired to visit some friends, so I thought: Well let's watch a lightweight Anime. I remembered the name School Days, the name sounds like the typical slice of life Anime. Nothing to think about just stare... Well in fact I thought it was one when I started watching it. And at the beginning it even seemed like one! I thought: Yeah another Anime where I get to watch 12 episodes with an kiss as the highlight near the end.\r\nThe first few minutes really seemed peacefull... But the difference to \"other\" sliceof life Anime shows up faster then you think. To hell with innocence, the story takes a big turn, and the protagonist becomes the type of guy, most teenager guys would like to be. Popular with women but nearly none of the girls he sleeps with, thinks of a real relationship with him. It sounds like paradise to the most young boys. In fact when i was younger, i wasn't much different...\\n\\n\r\nHowever the story evolves in to an unseen level, in fact, it get's perverted but still somehow deep and interessting. I think the most interessting thing about this Anime is the fact, that there isn't any other Anime you can compare it with. It's somehow shocking that the bright sunny world you get to see normaly, isn't there. I mean the whole Anime is special, but the ending is very unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animations are great, well they also were in the H-Game. So it was to be expected. The Voice actors are doing a good job and the music is ok. My favourite song was the one used in the ending scene ;): Kanashimi no Mukou he... \\n\\n\r\nWell to watch this Anime you shouldn't be: prude, or anti sexual. You won't get to see an Hentai but it's ecchi non the less. And hell if you want to watch it, you really shouldn't be underage, it's an role model Anime for the mature audience.",

You will also hate Society and your friends for a few days after completing this Anime.\r\nAll in all.... this anime made me hate society in a while. Which in a way is a good reaction.\r\nStory-\r\n What appears to be  your average Romance Anime Story  just got shot and replaced by a psuedo Romance Anime Story. There are some Risque Scenes in this anime, but.... it gets easily overlooked. The story was something I enjoyed, but hated at thesame time. There were ALOT *I Repeat* ALOT of Plot Twists that rivals M. Night Shamalym. But, due to time constraints, im guessing they didnt have any space for more backstory. *which would have been a nice addition* \\n\r\n-Ending-\\n\r\nI wont go into Great Depth into this part... but lets just say the Ending basically justifies you watching the other 11 episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- Voice Acting was just perfect. The confession scenes really felt like something you would seen in Real Life. Something that I would like to see more in other animes ^^\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nThe if not, Greatest part of this anime. The character development was really good in terms of the amount of time the writers had to finish the series. The Main Character, Makoto, is someone you will hate. Basically, the whole anime watching him step all over the other main character and supporting characters*which are girls*.  This made me hate him and hoping he was dead by the 4th episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nThe Ending justified all the other emotions i felt during this anime. The ending left me sitting on my chair with a blank expression. 5 minutes later... i was going \"WTF JUST HAPPENED O_O\". I havnet had a blank expression from an anime in quite a while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\n Its was really hard NOT to watch this anime. But once you start watching, dont drop it.... the ending is something you really dont want to miss.",

As the episodes go, the feeling of Kiminozo sorrounds you until the main character is misleaded by one of the main girls that sex doesn't mean you have to be in love with the person, or less alone care for it; so, we have a typical boy who doesn't stand out, that begins to sleep with basically every female on the school, and  at the same time has a shy and naive girlfriend who is trying her best to overcome her intimacy problems because she loves him a lot. Thegirl that started this whole bizarre plot was the person who sat next to him at class, who then becomes his friend at trying to succeed on dating the girl he likes. This is not your typical love comedy harem series, as it deals with psychological and mental issues of the main characters (mostly at the final 4 episodes).\\n\r\nEven when you can't see it, there are strong leads that advise you of the type of ending this series will have. Just remember to look closely and the ending won't take you as such a strong surprise.\\n\r\nThe music (both theme songs and OST) is superb, save for the generic haremy opening.\\n\r\nAs for the animation, TNK has proven to be an inconsistent studio, that can produce high quality works in animation such as Kannazuki no Miko, and then you have School Days, who has mediocre backgrounds and inconsistencies on the character design (specially on some scenes of the final episode).\\n\r\nOverall I'd give it a solid 7.",

            "content": "School Days is the worst anime I have ever seen. And that isn't just some off statement for this review, it is the absolute bottom of the barrel, the lowest bar anime has ever set and ever will set. \r\nStory 1/10\r\nAt first the story seems harmless, a student named Makoto Itou becomes intersted in a girl named Kotonoha Katsura. One of his classmate, Sekai Saionji, helps him get with her, but secretly has feeling for Makoto as well. Sounds harmeless, but then around episode 3, when Makoto starts to lose intrest in Kotonoha, is when it all goes to shit. Makoto proceeds to have sexwith every other girl in the school until (Spolier) Sekai kills him. I will give credit were its due, that it has one of the best ending ever. NICE BOAT\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI have to admit that the animation is very good, and its one of the shows strong points, but it still cant save it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack is decent, but its nothing to write home about. The voice actors do a good job, with the execption of Makoto, which doesn't help the fact that he's a asshole.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n1/10\\n\r\nThis is where the show really falls flat on its face. The main problem with the show is that the charecters are all HORRIBLE people. They all fit into one of three categories: a Dick (Makoto), a bitch (Sekai), or an idiot (Kotonoha).\\n\\n\r\nBest Character\\n\r\nSetsuna Kiyoura\\n\r\nThe reason that Setsuna is the best character is because she is the ONLY person in the entire show who cares about someone other then them self. She tries to make sure that Makoto stays with Sekai becasue she cares for her. As soon as she left the story, the show's single light in the darkness went out.\\n\\n\r\nWorst Character:\\n\r\nMakoto Itou\\n\r\nMakoto has got to be one of the most despicable character in any media ever. Out of curiosity I checked out the visual novel the show was based on. In that, they dont exactly make Makoto the nicest guy ever, but at least you wanted things to turn out good for him. In this, you wish he would just burn in hell for all the terrible things he did to all these girls.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10\\n\r\nThe only emotion you will get out of School Days is anger\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10\\n\r\nDespite the decent art and sound, it still gets a 1. Because you can have the best sountrack and animation in the world, and if your story and charecters suck ass, it wont make any diffenrence. School days is so bad. So so so so so so bad.\\n",

School days is an epic anime about cucking and cheating some of my personal favorite elements of romance in anime. School Days is an emotional  roller coaster every time inevitably watch in and it has become one of my favorite anime of all time.\r\nPlot: 3/10\r\nThe story fallows Makoto through his romantic tale in high school. with out going into further details without spoiling i can say that it was just ok. the main idea is simple but the execution is where school days shines. (just trust me after ep 6 theresNO WAY you can put this down)\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI will simplify this and combine the two categories.... Their both bad and nothing to wright home about. unfortunately these were the lowest parts of the anime but they both have a couple of scenes where they a nice. but aside from that its underwhelming compared to the rest of the great anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain the characters are nothing to write home about but they are certainly like nothing i have seen before. The characters are all shitty people but thats the intent of the anime. I think its like a play on your're average High School ecchi harem anime or something but it sure does make you think at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nI was hooked on this anime from ep 5 and could not stop. i was constantly surprised at twists in the plot and it made me concern for the characters on a personal level .  I cant really say more. If you like cheep drama and bad anime, you'll love this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is so bad it's good. Everyone is scum, and I love it. This low key is enjoyable through and through and i highly recommend it.",

I was wrong.\nThe beginning was fine: the main dude (Makoto) had a crush on a girl (Kotonoha) and his friend (Sekai) helps him out with getting with the girl, nothing special. Then it turns out that things weren't quite so simple. The conflict was actually Makoto himself, as he constantly ends up doing the dumbest things.\nStory: 5/10 \nLike I said nothingspecial really happened in this anime, but what surprises me about this anime is the ending and that the worst anime character ever obviously exists and there is potential of becoming a super saiyan just by staring at his pathetic face! I blame Makoto for everything single thing that happened in this anime! The whole time watching the anime is for hoping for the main guy to get hit by a truck or punched in the face but the ending actually gave me more than expected, the ending saved this anime from becoming a one on my rating scale.\\n\\n\nArt: 6/10 \\n\nThe art was fair nothing bad about it but nothing good or surprising about it neither.\\n\\n\nSound: 5/10 \\n\nMusic and sounds were fine didn't get my heart pumping or anything like that.\\n\\n\nCharacter: 4/10 \\n\nThere is so many things wrong with the characters. The main girl (Kotonoha), I actually like this character because she stayed faithful the whole time to that piece of crap Makoto and mainly because I felt really bad for her mid way in the anime, but there is still problems with even this character. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 3/10 \\n\nThis score is just for the ending. \\n\\n\nOverall: 4/10 \\n\nBeginning was good then the anime turns into a piece of crap anime.\\n",

Pretty much all I want to say at this point.\r\nI was really skeptical about wathing this seies beforehand, but I grit my teeth and made myself watch it, and to be completely honest, I'm really glad I did. It was an awesome series in my opinion, and was weel done too.\r\nGoing to split this into 5 sections for commenting, giving each a rating out of 10.\r\nHere we go.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nNow, this isn't normally the sort of anime I watch, but overall, I think that the storyline was actually quite good. There were enough twists and turns in it to keep me interested.

I say no more, because that could result in spoilers. I did however, do some research and found out the reason for the editing of the blood. Yay.\\n\r\nOther than that minor flaw, I really enjoyed the animation, it was quite good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the sounds were in place, and fit really well, but I didnt really like the OP/ED, therefore I'm only giving this section a 7. :p.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI think that the development of the characters was really good, and that each episode did each character justice in the right places.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this, and it's high on my rewatch list.

            "content": "Well...\r\nI finished watching School Days (in one sitting) and got exactly what I had expected. Now don't get me wrong, what I expected still utterly shocked and disturbed me in a way that I'll probably remember for a long time. And for that, I ranked this series as a 10.\r\nThis psychological drama started off fairly innocently. Light humor, boy likes girl, other girl helps boy try and get girl, things get crazy from there. It's all fairly formulaic. But that's about where it ends in its unoriginality and it ends pretty quick.\r\nI think it was only about one or two episodes in that situations startedbecoming less \"haha that's pretty embarrassing\" to \".....oh crap, did that just happen?\" What's more is the situations are all fairly believable in a way that reminds me of how crazy relationships became in high school (minus some obvious stuff of course) and that things can get out of hand fast.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've taken the time to read other reviews you will quickly discover that the general consensus is that the male protagonist is a terrible person. I completely agree. Now, while I would never wish terrible things upon another person, by the end of this series I was so completely disgusted with the way he was handling the situation it was almost unconscionable. Makoto is hands down one of the most despicable male main characters I've encountered. While is he (as usual) crippled by indecision most of the time this is strictly limited to his verbal interactions with fellow characters. When he does make a decision, it's more often than not one that will make you face palm (seriously, my head hurts because I was hitting it so much). By the end, you can no longer even justify his decisions by teenage hormones but more so that he's clearly a sociopath. His complete disregard for the repercussions of his actions goes beyond \"troubled youth\" and lends to the realm of utter insanity.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of School Days I was so distraught about how do these girls handle all of this crap he gives them that I completely overlooked how messed up they were as well! Now, not all of the female characters were beyond redemption. For example, Nanami seems to be a pretty upstanding person, but that's where it ends. Towards the end of the series you find out how morally inept they all are. Even with seemingly the best of intentions, there isn't a single character in the series that didn't do something wtf-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it was easy to find all the terrible things I disliked about each character, it's equally easy to overlook the redeeming qualities as well. A perfect example would be Otome. Early one, she's a pretty unlikeable character and for good reason. At the end of all things, even though a bunch of stuff she did was pretty bad, she had a decent heart and even had a \"hell ya, you go girl\" moment.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I found wonderful about School Days was the art and music. Character animation was all pretty top notch from what I could tell. Scenes were crisp and attractive, but not so busy that it drew attention away from what the characters were doing. Every environment was beautifully done and really draws you in.\\n\\n\r\nThis was all masterfully combined with a great, classic score of music that drew out the emotion of every scene. If I wasn't so busy trying to cope with the shock of what happened at any given time, I might have shed a tear or two because of a beautiful moment. After reflecting on it further, I think this was done to reserve moments of silence for those times when the characters did something shocking to which I tip my hat. One thing about a musical composition in media is that it is often used to illicit an emotional state at the time of the event to allow the viewer to essentially \"know what to feel and when to feel it.\" This was clearly absent in several pivotal moments of the series to cause the viewer to reel emotionally and feel stranded in thought (re: Buffy the Vampire Slayer s5ep16 \"The Body\" - which won an Emmy for this btw).\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days left such an impression on me that it made me question all of the decisions I've made in my love life over the years. The heart and mind are terribly fragile things and this series reminds us that we should all be vigilante in how we treat other people. I strongly recommend this anime.",

The story was not soap opera styli'zed as it was not generic, so it has a degree of uniqueness, and it is played out rather well.\r\nArt of course is flawless, and Sound? It had different songs for every ending, which were all pretty good.\r\nCharacters fit their roles in unexpected ways, managing toleave most of it unpredictable as to what is happening next (unless someone had hinted it to you)\\n\\n\r\nSo this Perfectly Heartless anime gets a 10.

To put it simply, without complicated extrapolation, the anime was just plain awful.\r\nStory: \r\nIs there a 0? What story? Was TNK asleep while they edited this show? Without \"giving away\" any of the few plot elements there may be, I can say that the first eleven episodes build up a hatred for a certain character who encounters...shall we say, an unfortunate event in the final episode. \r\nArt:  4/10\r\nWell, there was art...Absolutely nothing spectacular. Of course, I'm not one to talk, since I haven't seen much anime to beable to correctly judge a company's work, but I can tell when quality is less than quality. Nothing to scream at, certainly. Oh, was I too vague?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe only reason I enjoyed the sound was because of a certain scene that saved this anime from an evil hate letter written by yours truly. And even then, I was a little disappointed. Nothing awesome, nothing less from TNK.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nThere was really only one character.

He was everything you don't want in a main character; lazy, mean/cruel , a rapist, abusive and inconsiderate, basically if he wasn't feeling up a girl or not having sex with her he didn't care for them. The best part about this character was that he died, that was probably one of the most satisfying deaths that I have ever seem in anime before in my life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-1 I hated everything besides Makoto's death. Which honestly didn't make me enjoy the anime any more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-1 If I had to describe what true and utter garbage was in two words I would use school days.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ever watch this anime, it is one of the worst animes that is existence right now but if for some reason you decide to watch this piece of garbage then just skip to episode 12 at the time 16 minutes 2 seconds and watch the best part of the pile of garbage.",

            "content": "It has now been several years since the controversy surrounding School Days   have come to pass. The meme has faded into relative obscurity, Yandere characters are now a dime a dozen, and that very nice boat has long sailed off into the sunset. With the controversy behind us we can now begin our analysis to determine whether this cult title is a work of incredible bravery and intellectual substance as some have suggested, or the ludicrous eroge turned soap opera as others have claimed. In order to settle the dispute I have striven to make this evaluation as objective as possible, by detachingmyself from the work as far as possible and instead exploring it in the form of a series of hypothetical questions.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days is an anime about a  love polygon with so many faces that if you were to draw it,  a grade schooler would be able identify it correctly. There is nothing wrong with this on a conceptual level, quite the opposite in fact: it's undoubtedly a recipe for intrigue, but one with a high likelihood of failure. Without taking the utmost care about the execution, the story could quickly disintegrate into pure exploitation, rather than the vivid exploration of the human condition desired by the creator.\\n\\n\r\nSuppose that the protagonist of the series was a very charming, and powerful person, though lacking in integrity and moral fibre. Under those circumstances, it's not too much of a strain on the imagination to suppose they could be a cold yet  seductive character, with no qualms about sleeping with multiple different partners. This would not be inconsistent with common prejudices about human interaction as if instead, a rather plain man was  portrayed  in the same circumstances. A man who say, didn't appear to have much in the way of a sense of humour, one who lacked any charisma, was not physically attractive or had any outstanding personality traits other than indecisiveness.  Suppose in fact that he were so bland that he did not seem like a character at all, and was so generic that he came across more like a basic representation of an adult male, devoid of palpable personality traits to the degree that he feels more like a framework in which almost anyone could insert themselves if they so desired. Supposing that were the case, then it probably wouldn't make the story very convincing. In fact, it would probably feel more like a mechanism for living out some adolescent sexual fantasy, supposing that it were approached in that way. Theoretically speaking.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are two sides to any relationship, and perhaps it is the female characters who can elucidate what it is about this seemingly plain and rather bland figure who inexplicably never fails to leave every woman he meets stewing in their own sexual juices. It would not be sufficient to simply depict them falling in love with him again and again; there would need to be some exposition to explain what it is about this person... actually, let's give him a name. Something right off the top of my head, I don't know...  Makoto Itou maybe. Yes, let's have the female characters verbally signify what it is about Makoto Itou that they find so captivating. Perhaps a whisper in the ear of \"You're so handsome, Makoto-kun\" in a moment of tenderness. Or a \"You're so kind, Makoto-kun\" after a gesture illustrating his humanity.  Who knows, maybe even something like \"You've got such a huge dick, Makoto-kun\" would provide sufficient explanation as to why this Makoto Itou character suddenly finds him self inside every female he encounters. The specific details are not too important in the end, provided that some kind of reasoning is applied and not some redundant assertion like \"You're very popular with the girls, Makoto-kun\". While it's widely accepted that all women are prone to extreme jealousy and are by their very design, sexually insatiable, expecting them to make that deduction on their own is a bit unreasonable. Yes, I know that this is the only explanation that makes sense in the circumstances, but making it explicit will be necessary if we are going to create a work of intellectual substance.\\n\\n\r\nIt cannot be said enough that well developed characters are essential in creating a story, and that relying on plot twists alone is not sufficient. The purpose of any twist is to shock the audience with an unexpected turn of events, and in order to preserve the atmosphere where such a device is viable requires a great deal of diligence.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, one must take care not to overuse plot twists throughout the story. And it goes without saying that you should not reuse the very same twist multiple times. Let's take a purely theoretical example of a main character initiating an affair with a female character. The first time this happens is likely to come as a shock to the audience and will undoubtedly lead them to invest more of themselves into the story. If that character were to then initiate another affair, while still shocking it most likely would not have the same impact on the audience as it did in the first instance. If the same character were then to begin a third affair, a sense of incredulity or even a feeling of being patronised to may eclipse the feeling of surprise. Yet another affair afterwards may even have the unintended consequence of becoming so over the top to be unintentionally humorous.\\n\\n\r\nThis feeling of incredulity may not be limited to the same plot device, but any new developments that may occur later on. If the patience of the audience has been stressed to the extent they are no longer able to take the work seriously, the impact of even a significant and unexpected twist may be wasted. It may even have the opposite effect of what was desired, causing the audience to laugh uncontrollably at the mess you have made.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, of course, assuming that creating a work of intellectual substance was your original intention. You could, of course, be perfectly content with making a harmless exploitation piece, with ambitions no further than titillating your audience before doing something a bit unusual at the end. But supposing for a moment that you really were trying to make something clever, a modern Greek tragedy say, or even a serious examination of the consequences of being sexually promiscuous or indecisive are... then you might inadvertently make yourself look rather foolish. \\n\\n\\n",

I hate almost all of the characters in this anime. But I could not stop myself to finish this anime as soon as possible. School Days is really different compare to all anime that I've watched. The first two episodes is sweet just like all love stories in general, but after that it made me mad, angry and vexed at the same time. And the last two episodes really made me SHOCK! To tell youthe truth I really had hard time to rate this anime. It's really difficult to give a rating that fit this anime perfectly. I suggest you don't get affected by the rating that I gave. Because I believe everyone will have different perception about this unusual anime.",

A tenth of my hate was jealously, however the rest was out of how much of a cunt he is, around episode 10 I was getting worked up, yelling at my TV, repeating calling him a despicable cunt and how I hope he just kills himself before this anime is over. The way he treats people was disgusting, he's cheating with multiplegirls and this conniving, twisted, manipulative cunt couldn't give a shit about their feelings, Katsura-san had gone fucking insane, she was delusional and all Itou-kun could care about was who he was going to fuck next. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of telling her that he didn't want be with her in the beginning he cheated on her, at this point I was just slightly irritated that he didn't just tell her, but as  the story progressed this got worse, he was just playing with her, all of these girls were his mere puppets. I couldn't fucking stand him.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, when Sekai drives that knife into him, I smiled, as she continued to demolish him that smile transitioned into laughter. This is what I  was hoping for, nothing made me happier than seeing this boy die.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you're probably wondering why I gave this a 10, and that reason is because this affected me, School Days had managed to claw out all emotion inside of me, any anime which can cause a person to get this emotionally worked up and give them this feeling..\\n\\n\r\nIs one brilliant fucking anime\\n",

( maybe even  never !!! )\\n\\n\r\nAlso , since English is not my first language , I apologize for any mistakes I made in this review.\\n",

I've decided on everything other than overall score, which I'll fill in after the episode finishes.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is great for what it is. A highschool love triangle, set in as real a world as I can imagine.\r\nArt: 9/10 \r\nThere's not much to talk about. The art is on par with most anime I've seen, other than the ef series, but if I rated all art against that, everything would be 2's or 3's.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe sound is good, great voice acting, but there isn't really any music that makes me think \"I love this song\"\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nFirst thingsfirst. I rate the characters on how human I see them, and how well rounded and dynamic. NOT on how well I like them.\\n\r\nThey are all disgustingly human. I watch anime to get away from the kind of people in School Days. And I went through the show hating Itou. I can't stand him. But I know one hundred and one people just like him. Now, they may not get as many women as he does, but they treat them the same, if not worse. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nThe show was great. But I couldn't enjoy it. I spent more time with the show paused as I screamed at my computer \"NO. NO. GRAH NO DONT DO IT. NOO. ARDGIHDRAHIAROA:OJAEWR. PLEASE. GOD DAMMIT NOOOOOOOOOOO\" than I spent actually watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nI am now going to attempt to sit still and watch the last 15 minutes of this show, without raging or punching a hole in anything.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nJust finished...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: ...\\n\r\nOverall I'm rating it a 10. And sound is going up to a 10.\\n\r\nThe song that played from the time Sekai making tea, till the right before the ED was great.\\n\r\nAnd... \\n\r\nThe ending. Was amazing. I cried. There's nothing I can do to describe it. I had so wanted a happy ending. But this was... Better closure than I could have ever dreamed. I can not say that I would ever recommend this show to anyone. It made me rage more than anything I've seen before... But the ending made everything better, in a depressing way.. I was planning on finishing Higurashi Kai, or making an AMV, or playing guitar, or writing a story, or drawing something, after I finished School Days... But now I think I'm just gonna go fall asleep depressed.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers for up to Episode 8-9 of the anime. You were warned.\r\n\"Another harem anime... Boooring!\" is something you might say while looking at surface of School Days. Never could you be more wrong.\r\nBasically, School Days follows Makoto in a huge story of betrayal and cheating. He goes pretty far with it: for example, once, he cheats on his Kotonoha (his gf) with Sekai (his \"BFF\") on whom he cheats on with many, many other girls a little while after...\r\nTo be honest, the more you watch this anime, the more you hate everyone in it. The more you hate everyone in it, themore you want to see how it plays out. It's an endless circle.\\n\r\nIn fact, this anime nails just perfectly the feeling of guilt when you like something because you hate it. You will hate Makoto and his stupid decisions from Episode 4 onwards, as well as everyone he cheats with for letting themselves get fooled, but you'll keep watching. I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nBut School Days isn't just some random high school drama; it's a big satire on the whole harem anime genre: it shows how crazy people in these harems would be IRL and is pretty much propaganda against cheating on your SO!\\n\\n\r\nSmall parenthesis: the OST is pretty good and fits all dramatic or joyful moments. Also, although the opening fits the few first episodes, it still is funny to see a happy opening when the anime changes its theme entirely.\\n\\n\r\nSo, back to the anime itself, I really enjoyed it kind of in a masochistic way. Listening to episodes was becoming more and more painful as the series progressed, but I kept watching to see the ending. And I wasn't disappointed. Let's just say that, depending on which anime you saw, the ending can vary from being very predictable to incredibly surprising.\\n\\n\r\nTruly, I think that if you stop watching School Days before being finished, you haven't seen the best part of the anime. In fact, the ending was like the cake on the icing (yes, I switched them up on purpose), so I recommend watching it all the way.  \\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict is that School Days is a very original concept with a very -cough- touching -cough- moral and will divide many people on liking or disliking it (just on this review section, half of the reviews are negative, the other half is positive). It is not a happy anime, and it shouldn't be. It is only about betrayal and cheating, as I said, and it portrays that brilliantly. School Days sometimes made me tear up, sometimes made me really mad, sometimes made me hit my head on a wall. You get so emotionally involved (negatively, of course) with the characters in such a short time (remember, SD is only 12 episodes long!) that you don't want it to end, even if it drives you mad. For that, I feel that School Days deserves a lot of praise.",

I got into it expecting it to be a mediocre, school life anime but was a bit surprised.  I think the series honestly started off pretty well. It was cute, you know, with the typical boy asking a girl out stuff.  However, it went downhill pretty quickly from there.\r\nSo, the first episode pretty much establishes the overall quality of the show itself.  The art isn't great, but it also isn't terrible.  The animation itself is fine (movementis smooth, etc), I just didn't love the character styles.  The personalities of the characters are a bit weak, at first. However, the first episode was entertaining enough to make me want to keep watching.\\n\r\nNow, the anime turns into a psychological anime pretty quickly.  I like the ideas behind the whole thing, but I am not convinced that the themes were conveyed well.  I understand that School Days was supposed to bring to light the darker side of relationships and people, exposing how cruel and selfish anyone can be even if they at first appear normal, and how other can be sucked in to the negative influence of someone they admire.  I think that's a pretty interesting topic, to be sure, but it just wasn't done well or with taste in School Days, in my opinion. \\n\r\nSo, Makoto is the male lead of the series.  At first he seems like a weak character, if a bit of a clueless sort of guy.  However, after manipulating the feelings of his girlfriend, hooking up with another girl (Sekai) multiple time, being generally abusive to Sekai, having casual sex with three random girls from his class (while dating Sekai and Kotonoha), generally not caring about consent or the feelings of anyone else and denying getting Sekai pregnant (even though he is the only one she has had sex with) just so he could return to doing it with Kotonoha, it becomes pretty clear what an abusive toolbag Makoto is.  There are so many moments that are uncomfortable to watch and just plain disturbing, not de to sheer sexuality, but because of how twisted and abusive this guy is.\\n\r\nAlso, I found the ending to be a bit of a cop-out.  I'm not saying I know how it shoudl have ended, but it seemed a bit cheap to have the girls go into murder-mode.  I understand that they were abused, but I also do not think it was in either of their characters to lash out with violence, since they both seemed to find Makoto faultless for the entire anime.  They were both self-depreciating characters, so I don't know if it really made sense that Sekai would kill Makoto. But, that's just my opinion.\\n\r\nI do understand why many people think this anime is a work of art. It's themes are really intriguing and it could have been really good.  For me, though, there were too many weak spots, overly disturbing bits and frustrating characters for me to really care about any of them.  The only emotion this show really got out of me was frustration.",

            "content": "School Days is the story of a horny teen boy, his annoyingly timid girlfriend, his side chick, and a bunch of other girls with poor decision making skills who refuse to mind their business. I'm actually unsure of how this anime has gotten so many bad reviews because it was genius in my opinion. It was also infuriating and literally made me sweat from rage.\r\nSchool Days should be classified as a psychological anime because it definitely deconstructs the harem genre. I initially thought this would be some sappy love story with Makoto finding his true love while making a few mistakes along the way. Iwas only partially right because he made nothing but mistakes. This is not a happy anime. It is full of angst and pain. This depicts what happens if you decide to indulge in your harem instead of being confused and fighting off the women while blushing and stuttering. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were horrible people. I don't think I've ever hated anyone more than Makoto. Ladies, think of the worst man you can imagine yourself dating. Makoto is this man personified. He is selfish, immature, and generally despicable while having the sex drive of a seasoned porn star. Sekai isn't any better since she actually tries to pretend to be nice. Kotonoha is the only character I really felt sorry for but she was so timid and shy that she just made me yell at the TV mostly. All of the other female characters aren't worth mentioning but they served their purpose. I described them in the first sentence of this review. \\n\\n\r\n***SPOILERS AHEAD***\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode of School Days is what makes this anime worthwhile and one of the best endings I've ever seen. The last episode neatly wraps everything in a cathartic package and delivers the poetic justice that we all craved. Makoto's affair with Sekai is what started all these problems and he died by her hand. After finding Makoto's corpse, Kotonoha lures out Sekai and avenges Makoto's death on the school rooftop. I've never been more proud. She then validates that Sekai wasn't pregnant by gruesomely cutting her open and\u2026checking for herself. I had a problem with this because I'm certain that the baby wouldn't be visible to the naked eye at that point but at least it gave Kotonoha some satisfaction. Whether she was pregnant or not, it lead Kotonoha to speak one of the greatest lines in history. The last scene shows Kotonoha peacefully laying on the yacht while cuddling Makoto's severed head, her eyes full of life. \\n\\n\r\n***END SPOILERS***\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was excellent. I was hooked while absolutely loathing the majority of the characters. I wanted to see how this would end because I knew this would be a different type of harem. The only reason this gets a 9 is because the art style isn't that great. School Days is a must-see that even those who aren't anime fans will enjoy. \\n",

If you had a cheating spouse or have just gone through a bad break up and have a lot of pent up hateful feelings towards your ex this is the anime for you my friends. \r\nThis series has some of the worst characters in the history of anime. There was not one character I could sympathize with. The first few episodes were not so bad. Actually the story developed pretty well and held my interest. But then itwas like the writers just lost their minds or had a nervous breakdown and just wanted to mentally scar the audience for the rest of their lives.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days starts off as a romance anime which has the potential to develop into a typical love triangle story but then becomes something completely mutated and distorted. I wouldn't even call it a psychological anime because other than the fact that it leaves you mentally disturbed after the last episode there is not much depth in the story or psyche of the characters. The characters just seem to do things senselessly without any good reason and it all just seemed devoid of any passion or motive to me. \\n\\n\r\n It is nonetheless quite a disturbing anime so I would recommend a marathon of romantic comedy anime after you finish School Days.       \\n",

            "content": "(spoilers, but that should be obvious)\nSo what is School Days? School Days is, supposedly, a ''dark'' and ''psychological'' anime that tries to give you a shock factor at the end but fails to do so because of the many, many faults throughout the series.\nStory: The story is about a guy named Makoto and his love triangle with Kotonoha and Sekai. I say love triangle, but the story ravels out into nothing more than Makoto having sex with every character that has female genitalia, so it's more of a love octagon. The original premise had me interested for about an episode or two because it couldhave become somewhat deep and fleshed out, but it amounts to nothing more than a hentai but just without the sex being on screen.\\n\\n\nAll of this to lead up to the conclusion of the story, which can be seen a mile away unless you have the IQ of a half-eaten bar of chocolate. This leaves the viewer with a miniscule sense of satisfaction, however it cannot redeem the series by having a ''wow'' factor that doesn't leave me wowing but sighing in relief that School Days finally came to an end due to the amount of dissatisfaction in the lack of a story worth noting. (2/10)\\n\\n\nCharacters: So as previously stated, School Days focuses around Makoto, Sekai and Kotonoha. Makoto starts off as a teenage boy who cannot talk to girls properly, has the personality of a 2x4 piece of wood that has been left out in the rain for far too long and every single girl seems to gravitate towards his penis for some reason that can only be known by the gods of anime. At the end of the series he is the exact same way, literally no character development at all throughout the series and has no remorse for his actions at all. \\n\\n\nSekai ''helps'' Makoto by setting him up with Kotonoha, and then helps him throughout the series by....''practicing''...kissing at the beginning which then becomes ''practicing'' sex. She then goes into a fit of jealousy because Makoto is with Kotonoha which leads up to the murder. I honestly have no idea how the creators wanted to me to feel about Sekai, whether I should have despised her for sleeping with Makoto fully knowing that he was in a relationship or feel sorry for her because she isn't with him but in love with him. In the end I just hated her for being incredibly stupid throughout all of the series.\\n\\n\nKotonoha suffers from what I call ''shy girl, big boobs'' syndrome. Kotonoha is also incredibly stupid and I feel absolutely no sympathy for her at all because she is with Makoto full well knowing that he is out filling up every one of her friends with his love seed. I'd say that she is obsessively in love with Makoto, but she ends up making really bad choices through sheer stupidity.\\n\\n\nThere are also a number of side characters that are completely forgettable (I actually can't remember their names) that aid the story and character development of the trio in no way at all and should never have been included in the series to be sex fodder for Makoto. (1/10)\\n\\n\nSound: The soundtrack was completely forgettable, I apologize for this section being EXTREMELY short but that's it, it's forgettable. (1/10)\\n\\n\nArt/animation: The art was simply the generic high school anime look and the animation wasn't anything to sneeze at either. There was fan service in School Days, but the only character worth giving fan service too was Kotonoha and she barely provided any anyway, and even when she did the sheer lack of intelligence of her makes it even more mind numbing. I don't dislike fan service if it is done right, but this is also one of the many things that School Days does wrong. (2/10)\\n\\n\nOverall: Do not watch. Nothing about this anime makes it worth watching. If you're that interested in seeing the ending then just watch it on Youtube because it is not worth wasting 4 hours of your life of awful story and terrible characters for. 1/10  Disgusting and should burn in a fire.",

            "content": "Okay so this is going to be a long review but believe me... once its over it will definitely be worth it\r\nfirst things first.... this anime is not to be compared with other anime like toradora or clannad... the reason for that is that the genre are COMPLETELY different.\r\ni don't understand why people forget that this anime is under the genre 'tragedy'; most of the times i've seen people saying that the ending of this anime was really bad. this is a personal review which will be talking about this in detail.. so bear with me!\r\nto start off things..\r\nSTORY: one of the most important thingsin any anime. the story ( may contain spoilers) was typically about a highschool boy who started liking a girl, kotonoha, who comes to school in the same train as him. knowing nothing about making a girlfriend.... he asks for some help from his friend sekai. ( which is technically the most hated anime character all time of almost every single person who watched this anime but anyway) with her help they successfully start dating. one day, out of the blue, sekai, confesses her love before him. thats when everything goes blank.....now  slowly he starts to fall for sekai and completely forgets about kotonoha and maybe thats y people hate this anime so much ( i'll be leaving the ending part for later :p )\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: one of the most important things that people don't notice in this anime is probably that while he was dating kotonoha, he was also seeking help from his other friend who used to lend him some 'flirting' books once in a while.. and because he knew close to nothing about how to handle girls... he did exactly what was written in the book because of which things ended the bad way.....\\n\\n\r\nImportant Note:   this is a different but  the most important note as it is important for you all to know that there is also a visual novel for this anime . and apparently this anime was based of it. whats surprising is that there were about 20 DIFFERENT ENDINGS to the show but they decided to go with this one as they probably thought people would find it unique but i guess it had the opposite effect.\\n\\n\r\nnow lets fast forward....... \\n\\n\r\nART: really nice and technically the best choice of art suited for this type of anime as it was very nicely showing every single emotion of the characters. one thing to note here is that when there is a sense of hate or disgust towards something people often tend to ignore its positive factors... thats how human nature works sadly...\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: amazing again... especially the opening which suited the anime well. all the dubs were also pretty nice. I dont think people should have any problems with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: i don't know bout u guys bt i really , enjoyed this show.. if not every episode but i definitely loved the show as a whole . \\n\\n\r\nNow here's something important... its not like i loved every single aspect of this anime. there was surely one thing that i really hated as well and that was:\\n\\n\r\nVIEWER INTERFACE: its as everyone says, this anime is technically not made for the people bt is made just as an anime.. the creators have not taken into account that what the people like in an  anime..in the beginning it was seeming to be like a slow paced romantic anime.... the middle was something really frustrating as the protagonist, the most important piece of any anime, became IRRITATING! and just the viewers needed a break from all the torture... came the ending which was too much for the people to dig in at the time..... thats y in this field, i'll be giving this anime 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: although the viewer interface is bad... it doesn't necessarily mean that the anime is bad as well. but without knowing this people mostly mistake to give the viewer interface rating in place of the overall rating.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: i don't think i will be talking much about this section of the anime because i think u all are already well informed bout it bt i would definitely say that although it wasn't the strongest point of this anime bt still i don't hate it as much as other people do. i can say so as just like very few anime you will still remember the names of atleast some of the characters for a long while because of all the controversies around the anime and that bring me to my final topic....\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: there are definitely few if and buts in this anime bt everything put together i think this anime is nothing less than a masterpiece... i've surely seen people talking BS bout this anime bt i don't care because i think that it was amazing i loved it because of alot of reasons bt one of the biggest reason was that this anime is really UNIQUE. i had never seen any anime like this and i'm pretty sure that the chances of such an anime to air again are almost none existent.\\n\r\ni will also add tht its no wonder that people didnt like it as much as i did because this anime is only for a few no. of people.. people who can completely watch series like higurashi without droping it down in the middle because of all the gore so basically its an anime for stronghearted  people who can watch a romantic anime with a sudden gruesome twist~\\n\\n\r\nCONFUSION: there are some things that really confuses me... no, i'm not talking bout the anime i'm talking bout the people... why do people always search for negativity in an anime.....now i'm going to tell you 2 facts bout this anime and who watched it\\n\\n\r\n1. some people have given this anime an overall rating of ..1! no surprise well then lets leave aside the overall rating and talk bout something else... we all know that the art and sound of this anime were splendid then tell me y have most of the people given this anime's art and sound field a ranking of 1 too!!!! Now that is surprising!!\\n\\n\r\n2. despite of its bad review this anime is actually one of the most popular anime!! \\n\r\nits true!!\\n\r\nalthough probably because of the controversies but yeah at least its famous :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm doing this review in 2 pieces, the first one is a simple review and my opinion. The second one is more about why this is a bad anime that goes beyond the scope of a review.\r\nStory: The story starts out simple enough, you got your protagonist guy that takes a liking to a girl and all is happy until he starts doing things. At some point you're going to close your eyes because you can't bear to watch this stupidity anymore. Bust still a very plausible premise (actually no I'll get to that later) with a main character that's just so stupid and decentprogression.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is actually nice thought I had difficulty recognizing characters because they share the same school outfit and similar designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is also very nice. I really liked the background piano musics that sets the tone for some lighthearted moments and the ending song when big revelations happen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think i've made my point that the main character is a total freaking idiot without a care in the world. But Makato is a saint compared to a certain someone I'll get to later.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Truth be told after I finished watching I felt happy I watched it. It felt like it made me a better person.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the second part. This will have disturbing spoilers from the entire days series and before that.\\n\\n\r\nSomething you won't know by watching this anime is many of the characters reasoning behind their decisions. Such as why Sekai and Setsuna both love Makato. Setsuna does everything in her power to get Sekai and Makato together but kisses him twice and later sleeps with him. Also Sekai seemingly kisses Makato just to tease him but there's a flashback scene explaining why both girls are infatuated with Makato. This is one of the many things that was dropped from the anime that results in the anime looking like people with 69 IQ interacting with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing you won't find out is actually all the characters are related. There's Makato's father who lives with Itaru that's named Tomaru Sawagoe. Now he's just the devil himself. In addition to being Makato's father he's Sekai's grandfather on both her parents and Taisuke's grandfather, Setsuna's grandfather on both her sides and her great grandfather on her mother's side. As if that wasn't bad enough Setsuna and Sekai despite being a generation apart share a father whose Tomaru's son (Makato's half brother), Sekai's mother is also Tomaru's daughter from someone else (that makes Sekai children of 2 half siblings with the same father) and Setsuna's mother is Sekai's cousin. This effectively makes Makato Sekai and Setsuna's half uncle on both their sides and Setsuna's great uncle on her mothers side. Tomaru also apparently impregnated his great great great granddaughter when she was in kindergarden using drugs so they can have children early. She is also impregnated once by Tomaru's son/grandson from someone else. The fact that Itaru lives with him raises concerns. This is such a big mess that makes you wonder who in their right mind thinks of this.\\n\r\nEveryone is related to Makato (except the Katsuras who have managed to escape this tangled mess of a family tree). Almost everyone is inbred except Makato, Itaru and Katsura. This makes me get a whole new perspective on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally this anime was adapted as the worst possible version of the visual novel because it took every bad things from the novel and crammed it into an anime without thinking about the reasoning of those actions. Because all these happen in the anime which can't happen in a single playthrough of the novel it makes no sense whatsoever. On the other hand the visual novel has less things happening in a single playthrough so there's reasoning behind people's actions that doesn't make them look like idiots and some of the endings are truly touches your heart. Because this is still a review I can't recommend you to play the visual novel but I can recommend you not watch this abomination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's taken me a bit of time to get around to doing this but seeing as how this anime aired so long ago and is still the topic for a lot of debate; I thought I'd write a review on it. Reason being I feel that alot of the people who have watched this and show alot of hate for it is simply because they didn't want anything unexpected.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThis is where alot of people have the hangups when it comes to this anime. Personally I think the story is pretty decent. However the first few episodes are slow even for what looks like ashallow boy meets girl anime. As the plot gets in to the mid point, it starts taking a darker turn which seems to be the main complaint from people. The thing that alot of people don't realise when it comes to a situation that the characters find themselves is sometimes there isn't an ideal solution. The characters are teenagers after all and at \"that age\". By the end, things spiral out of control but it's not an unbelievable turn of events. Hate and jealousy are powerful emotions which can drive even the happiest and carefree person to things they never thought they were capable of. I won't spoil the end but you will either love it or hate it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special, the characters have decent designs on the whole and the dingy backgrounds on some of the scenes are quite fitting, especially as the story draws to it's inevitable conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, it's nothing special but it does the job. There are no real memorable tracks in the OST. The voice actors are pretty good though, Setsuna's in particular stood out to me. How she didn't get more work seems to be a mystery though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the other main part where people have hangups. Plenty of people believe all the characters should have been torched in a house fire. However what you have to take into account is the age and mindset of the characters at that age. Makoto despite being almost universally hate-able is not unrelatable. Many teenagers who are the same age in reality would do everything he did and more given the opportunity...I probably would have been the same myself in his shoes to some extent. It seems to be an unforgivable sin for a teenage boy to have commitment issues in an anime which is something which confuses me no end. I think most people have cheated in their lives at one point or another yet we don't get alienated by everyone for it. However I digress...\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also topics for discussion. Kotonoha in many people's eyes seems to be nothing more than a victim throughout the series. In my own opinion, if she wasn't so sheltered and abit more aware of things around her instead of being so unrealistically clueless she wouldn't have been as hurt as she was. However, there are people who will consciously blank out things that will hurt them so I suppose the attitude is not without merit.\\n\\n\r\nSekai I feel is the most real of all the girls in the show. I had friends that were just like her when I went through high school (A while ago lol). It's typical of girls her age to have a hard time expressing themselves romantically and still be bubbly and spontaneous. Many people blame her for warping the plot but I don't believe that at all. All of the characters in some shape or form are guilty of pushing the plot to the inevitable conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, I enjoyed School Days, once the drama started it was hard not to watch to the end. Sure you want to punch Makoto for hurting people. I wanted to give Kotonoha a good smack and tell her to let him go. But it's things like that that add to the enjoyment of a show. It's originality is where it's strength lies. Whereas most anime in the romance category will give you male leads too scared to even look at a girl let alone anything more. School Days delivers a breath of fresh air to a very overused genre. It's also one of the most conclusive as well as infamous endings in anime history which alone makes it worth looking at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI rate it a high 7 overall. If it wasn't for the slow start it would be a bit better. I would have loved a couple of OVA's showing endings which were a bit happier as the game the anime is based on has over 21 different endings. It would have been really nice to see some of the others animated.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, I feel this show has WAAAAAAAAAAY too many haters who simply want some \"feel good harem fluff\" instead of something darker and more real. If you want to watch an anime riddled with despair then give this a shot. You won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Ah, the harem genre: We all know what it\u2019s about. Guy moves to some new area filled with unfamiliar faces, meets girls, and decides to date one of them, in typical visual novel form. School Days is, yet again, an adaptation of a visual novel, using this tried and true formula. School Days, however, decided to go the extra mile. \r\nA harem doing something new? What blasphemy is this!?\r\n-Story & Characters-\r\nMakoto Itou, our main protagonist, is your average teenage boy: He\u2019s shy, he\u2019s clueless, and, well, stupid. The beginning of the first episode depicts Makoto riding a train to get to school for the newterm, and takes a picture of a girl that he likes, Kotonoha Katsura, that boards the same train as him. Rumor has it that if you take a picture of someone that you like with your cell phone and keep that picture saved for a certain period of time, you and your crush will eventually start dating. After Makoto takes Kotonoha\u2019s picture, he arrives at school and sits down at his desk and looks at his picture of Kotonoha while Sekai Saionji, the girl that now sits next to him, peeps at him, and starts bombarding him with questions. The episode then progresses, and Sekai decides that she\u2019ll help in getting him and Kotonoha together. The two of them end up dating, and Sekai decides to, for some reason, kiss Makoto right on the lips before leaving school, revealing that she has feelings for Makoto. \\n\\n\r\nThis already doesn\u2019t make any sense: Why would you want to hook up someone that you like with someone else? Why not just take him for yourself? What would have worked better is if Sekai genuinely wanted to help Makoto, then as she watches him and Kotonoha date, she gets jealous, and learns that she also likes him, but nope: She just likes him right away, for no reason. And this isn\u2019t even the worst part.\\n\\n\r\nEVERY girl in that entire school wants a piece of Makoto. I mean that literally, too, Makoto ends up having sex with almost every female character, whether it be a major character or just someone in the background, if it has a pair of breasts and a uterus, Makoto WILL have sex with it, mark my words. What kind of a school is this, anyway? A school filled with hookers that give him freebies? Are ALL girls this easy? \\n\\n\r\nFor the entire anime, Makoto will cheat on Kotonoha with everyone, completely ignoring her in the process. She does her best to spend time with Makoto to make the relationship work, but he blows her off every single time just to find that next good time. The story itself is very straightforward and consists of little more than Makoto sleeping with everyone. There are a couple of good moments that happen (The Culture Festival scene gave me a good laugh), but the story, to be frank, features some of the worst writing that I have ever seen. There is no substance to be had here; it\u2019s just a twisted harem. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall cast of characters are even worse than the story itself. These are some of the most idiotic characters that I have seen in a very long time. The only two characters that were likeable were Kotonoha and another girl (Who also has feelings for Makoto\u2026\u2026 shocker) named Setsuna. But the worst of them all is Makoto: This guy is my most hated character of all time. He is literally the absolute most morally reprehensible, selfish, manipulative human being that I have ever seen. His idiocy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms\u2026\u2026 everything. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is one redeeming quality in the story: The ending. This is, without a doubt, my favorite ending of all time. I saw it coming, but that actually added to the experience: Seeing my prediction come true was extremely satisfying, and, as much as I hated this anime, the ending made me glad that I watched it. \\n\\n\r\nReally, if you actually like this story, then I can\u2019t take you seriously, I really can\u2019t. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Visuals & Sound-\\n\r\nThe visuals of School Days are fairly adequate. While they aren\u2019t anything amazing, they\u2019re still above average. However, I do want to commend the show for its distinct art style. Everything looks bleak and drab, and while this sounds like a bad thing, it works in its favor, and it makes everything feel more realistic. The character designs are also worth mentioning, as there is not a single character with \u201canime characteristics.\u201d No one has huge eyes and pink hair, or green hair, or what have you. Everyone looks normal, which I have yet to see in any anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has no dub, and since I don\u2019t know Japanese, I cannot, in good conciounce, critique the Japanese dub, as I don\u2019t know how well the lines are delivered or how much emotion is portrayed, so I cannot comment here.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, however, is really quite nice. I can\u2019t say that every single song stuck out, but they were definitely very solid, however, my absolute favorite song has got to be Kanashimi no Mukou he, which plays during the show\u2019s bone-chilling ending. Listening to this song, even out of context, gives me goosebumps every single time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nSchool Days is, without a doubt, the worst anime that I have ever seen. I\u2019ve seen some really bad anime, don\u2019t get me wrong, such as Elfen Lied, Tsukihime, Sword Art Online, and Air (I could go on), but this just takes the cake as the worst. School Days is just a hair-ripping, rage-inducing, and overall frustrating experience, and despite the grand finale, it doesn\u2019t justify 12 episodes of pure juvenile garbage. Like I\u2019ve mentioned before, if you actually like this anime, then I\u2019m sorry, but I cannot take you seriously. Don\u2019t watch this.\\n\\n\r\nYou have been warned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n+Solid visuals\\n\r\n+Good soundtrack\\n\r\n+Amazing ending\\n\r\n-HORRIBLE story\\n\r\n-Idiotic characters\\n\r\n-Makoto is the worst character is any narrative medium\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n1/10",

A lesson not to tolerate what the protagonist is doing.. And for girls out there, please watch this anime.. It's an eye-opener for all of you, it'll make you choose your \"man\" thoroughly..  Because relationship, isn't just one-sided, it's not just about the \"lovy-dovy thingy\" but also has a cruel side of it which is told by this anime..\\n\\n\r\nThis is my favorite anime because the story line may happen in real life..

            "content": "For my first review, I never thought it would be School Days but I just couldn't hold back so I will keep it to the point.\r\nThis isn't one of them anime's which goes along the lines of 'your typical romance school life'. No, this is far from it. The anime is filled with tragedy of how cheating can affect someone\u2019s mind and the type of drama on which can happen due to peoples actions. This can be related in many forms of very day life but as you progress into the show, I believe that everyone can agree on how 'over the top' itbecomes.\\n\\n\r\nWithout as many spoilers as possible, the story starts off revolving around the main characters, Makoto, Kotonoha and Sekai. Starting out to be your typical anime love triangle, Makoto and Kotonoha starts dating with the help of Sekai, when suddenly she begins having feelings towards Makoto. Now this is where everything begins going downhill when Makoto true colours are beginning to show..\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't help but find how disgusting Makoto is as a  character, I won't say too much as I don't want to spoil anything. He starts the show off as what you will think, is such a great guy but suddenly out of the blue.. Turns into the complete opposite. Understanding of his rights and wrongs and also unknowing of what his actions cause to the other characters; he is suddenly controlled by his desire for sex doing what he wants as he pleases.\\n\\n\r\nI just couldn't stop myself but I was spending most of my time shouting 'WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?'\\n\\n\r\nNow we have Kotonoha, very lady-like and insecure with little self of esteem. Loving Makoto with all her heart, but when he leaves her behind she is then left thinking that its only herself to blame. I couldn't help but feel sorry for her but thinking at the same time of how much Makoto never deserved her. Sekai on the other hand is a very to the point type of person, while she is helping Makoto build his relationship with Kotonoha things start going for the worse. Deeply in love with him, when he comes crawling back to her she is then believing that he loves her back. Two interesting characters, both full of drama that\u2019s for sure.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto being this, well far from realistic type of a character stuck inside this love triangle, heavily full of events such cheating, even rape but not all is bad for School Days. It left a surprisingly satisfied ending on which you can see coming episodes before hand, but its twisted and dramatic. Very over the top I should say but overall I still found it to be a shallow watch and very frustrating for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nPlease beware of the different endings between the Manga and the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nWell, its a very dark type of anime which isn't filled with happiness but provides a form of message towards the viewer on the tragedy and disasters in life. I do not recommend being someone like Makoto however. But it is greatly done, has a pretty good production for the year it came out in and the music is excellent and fits in beautiful with very decent opening and closing themes. But if you are into dark type romances with everything this anime provides, then this would be perfect for you!\\n\\n\r\nI give this an overall score of: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow if I was given money for very time I heard someone say sorry within this anime, I would be very rich..\\n",

            "content": "I wanted to see a harem anime involving a guy with two eyes and a brain for once, and that's exactly what I got in this anime (heart and soul sold separately). For once, this is not your stereotypical harem anime plot that just pretends to get more complex until (surprise!) deus ex machina, and the guy ends up with the girl you knew he'd end up with from the first episode. In my opinion, that ALONE makes it worth watching at least once, and it's got a lot more that makes me recommend it as well.\r\nStory - 9\r\nI'm honestly sick of the I-have-no-idea-what's-going-on-I-just-want-all-these-unrealistically-gorgeous-women-out-of-my-life haremanime bullshit. That's why I really enjoyed the blatant irony with which School Days attacked that harem stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nClueless, lustful teenage male protagonist? Check.\\n\r\nBeautiful girls who want to get in his pants? Check.\\n\r\nProtag unable to commit to any one girl while they fight over him? Check.\\n\r\nProtag therefore becomes a lying, cheating, manipulative scumbag so he can have sex with all of them? Che--wait, what?\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you want to know what would really go down if harem animes were real life, this is a story you are going to love. It loses a point because the beginning is so slow that I almost lost interest halfway through episode 2. Watch episode 1, but you can probably skip episodes 2 and 3 and just read the synopses.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't bad, but it bothered me that I sometimes couldn't tell all the girls apart except by their hair or voices. I guess they have to be true to the games, but come on, the anime doesn't have boxes in the corner that tell you which girl it is so they could have tried make it a bit more obvious.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was used very effectively. Silence creates tension, and there was plenty of that in this series, but what was in between the silences (usually cheerful instrumentals) really made it work. I didn't really like the OP or ED, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm totally going to get flamed for this, but I really, really liked Makoto as a character. He is utterly unique in how well and how completely he pisses off everyone who has watched this series. I thought I was fully prepared for anything Makoto might do or not do, but several times I was surprised at his actions until I realized that they made him even more of a scumbag than what I thought he was going to do. I have never, ever seen another character demonized so beautifully, and for what? Cheating, being an uncaring pervert, running from responsibility? We've all seen characters who have done worse--hell, we've probably all seen real people who have done worse--and yet NONE of them are as universally hated as Makoto. THAT is what makes Makoto such a masterpiece of a character.\\n\\n\r\nSekai is probably my second favorite because she is simultaneously manipulative and naive. Pay close attention to her, because every time says one thing with her mouth and the exact opposite with her body, it's a foreshadow of what will eventually happen to her.\\n\\n\r\nKotonoha appears to be very stereotypical to begin with, but the way her character develops is unexpectedly fascinating. For example, while I knew the general details of the ending, it still took me by surprise because I was certain that her role in it would be different (I was close, though ^.^' ).\\n\\n\r\nSetsuna ... well, she isn't a bad character, but unfortunately she's stuck being a Sekai substitute for 90% of her screentime. I kind of wanted her to have a bigger role, but at the same time I'm glad she didn't because that would have just turned her from \"Sekai substitute\" into \"Sekai wannabe.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nSlow opening aside, you will not be able to leave this anime alone once you get into it in earnest. I, at least, enjoyed this anime quite a bit when even when I was just watching to see what sort of crazy, idiotic stunt Makoto would pull next. Sure, it was uncomfortable at times, but that was definitely part of the appeal for me. The second half of the anime is especially riveting. Be sure to set aside plenty of time to watch each episode, too, so that you can pause every few minutes to mentally cuss out Makoto for being a massive prick. I found that helpful in reducing the urge to punch a hole in my computer screen whenever his stupid face appeared on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in the beginning, School Days is unique enough to be worth seeing at least once, even if you never watch it again. It's a good anime with a refreshingly unique story and spectacular characters. Watch it with an open mind, and I guarantee you will not regret your experience.",

            "content": "School Days is a psychological anime first and foremost, do not expect a heart-warming romance set at school as the title might suggest. The anime explores the dark side of relationships and the negative effects they can have on people\u2019s mind.\r\nThe concept of a love triangle is nothing new and for those who have watched romance anime before will immediately recognise some familiar patterns, however, the way School Days deals with this concept is something many anime have not done. Instead of focusing on the positive aspects that come with relationships the anime focuses on the negative aspects; it shows us what jealousy can doto people and how they deal with realization that their love is unrequited. \\n\\n\r\nThe first part of School Days is spent developing the relationship between Makoto and Katsura with the assistance of Sekai. These scenes consist of Sekai teaching the two how to approach and communicate effectively with one another. During these scenes it was interesting to see Sekai\u2019s feelings for Makoto start to manifest themselves; at first she was fine with watching but like most people in love they cannot help but desire the object of their affection. This is where the psychological part of the show comes into play as we soon find ourselves with scenes of Sekai getting intimate with Makoto under the guise of \u2018special training\u2019; we witness her go from feeling guilty about seducing Makoto to not caring about the consequences of her actions.  \\n\\n\r\nThe culmination of these scenes ends with Katsura witnessing the affair between the two, delivering a huge blow to her psyche, triggering a psychological breakdown. This event signals a shift in the shows atmosphere as the rest of the episodes focus on the effects of cheating; Katsura refuses to believe what she had seen and insist to everyone she is still Makoto\u2019s girlfriend; Sekai tries to come to terms with what she has done; and Makoto begins to believe he can continue cheating despite the fact he knows his actions are wrong. The accumulation of these thoughts are what serve as the ingredients to the finale, involving the three finding a solution to their respective problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe personalities and designs of the characters presented in School days are hardly original; the main characters and the supporting cast can all be found in any other school romance anime, however, what separates them from the countless other characters found in the romance genre are their actions. \\n\\n\r\nSekai, one of the two main heroines in School Days is a character whose motives and actions can only be called irrational. She is in love with Makoto but instead of confessing her love for him she goes out of her way to please him by introducing him to Katsura; effectively giving away the object of her affection to someone else. During the course of series I found her to be just as despicable as Makoto. Even though she felt guilty for betraying Katsura and tried to stop what was going on between her and Makoto, she never once tried to apologise, instead she chose to avoid her, deluding herself into believing her actions were permissible simply because Makoto and her friends said they were. \\n\\n\r\nThe other heroine Katsura could be labelled the victim of the Makoto and Sekai\u2019s selfishness. Her character can be defined as an innocent and na\u00efve high school girl, with no experience with boys. I found this part of her to be quite realistic, it was easy for me to believe a girl with a sheltered upbringing like herself would have trouble interacting with the opposite sex. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing Makoto cheating on her with Sekai causes her extreme psychological pain leading to some rather bizarre changes in her personality. I feel like this was exaggerated as it was hard to believe someone would do the things she did, if they found out the person you love is no longer interested in you, however, her actions may plausible if you take into account that this was her first love and like most people in a relationship the last thing they want to think about is that their partner does not love them. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character Makoto is probably one of the most despicable characters I have ever seen and easily one of the most hated characters in the show. He could be best described as an indecisive coward, throughout the show he is constantly thinking about himself and refuses to acknowledge anyone else\u2019s feelings. All his choices are made solely for his benefit; he should of broken up with Katsura the moment he realised he was no longer in love with her, but instead chose to avoid her.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, I was surprised he felt guilty about cheating and at times even thinking he is the worst because of it, although, this did not last long as he quickly forgot about these feelings and continued to cheat on Katsura, whilst behaving like he has done nothing wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter observing Makoto\u2019s actions I realized he might be like other teenagers his age who had mistaken love for lust. What he did was perhaps what the average teenager would do given the opportunity, assuming most boys his age are only interested in the physical side of relationships i.e. the sex. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, School Days may fail to deliver a great romance story, however, it does succeed in illustrating the negative aspects of relationships and the effects cheating can have on people\u2019s psyche.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, I encourage everyone to watch School Days for the sole purpose of learning just how fragile the human mind can be and how cheating can lead people to make some very irrational decisions.",

            "content": "Well... I am pretty sure by now, everyone who knows at least something about anime has heard of the infamous school days... This show doesn't deserve to be giving an automatic 1/10... This is a great example of a flawed but not entirely terrible show... with the important lesson of \"never fuck every girl in school and think you can get away with it\". It really is sad and has a deeper meaning with things such as responsibility, relationships, love, drama, and a bunch of other emotions. It is hard to explain what this anime really is which for the first time watching it overtwo years ago, thinking it was a sick stupid show with a fucked up ending and rewatching it now... (I don't know why I did) but understanding that there is more to it. So lets get down to business. \\n\r\n(spoilers)\\n\r\n(This anime has probably been spoiled so let me try to explain and it for you)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nA really generic plot of boy who goes to school discovering a new girl on the train.. reading a book. He has other friends and needs some help in \"dating\". MC or Makouto Itou um I think.. has one of those generic guy pervert friends always trying to get a girl. Makouto finally gets some help from the girl sitting next to him named Sekai she realizes that Makouto wants something and tries to deliver... She gives him \"SPECIAL TRAINING\" to supposedly get him used to dating and junk... Sekai wants to help support MC but eventually turns to like him and give him some real \"SPECIAL TRAINING\".. (sex) and kind of push off train girl Katsura...It really is a blunder mess but eventually MC gets the train girl Katsura... and later gets greedy since hes pretty much being spoiled by Sekai always giving him what he wants behind Katsuras back.... Other girls at school are introduced trying to have a weird one episode relationship with MC, having the girls revealing feelings, and reuniting with child hood friends or something and then having sex... He really doesn't understand others feelings and just goes behind the girls backs and sexes them.. He eventually has a phone book filled with like 30 bitches on speed dial... Why would anyone like this guy is my reaction but who cares bout that.... The show continues and reaches climax when Sekai supposedly becomes pregnant and Katsura becomes so in denial that MC has been fucking all the girls in school and hasn't even talked to her since episode 3, she really thinks they are still dating and hasn't done anything really wrong... In the end, MC finally realizes he's kind of a asshole when no girls are talking to him at school anymore or answering his calls, but runs into Katsura who has been sitting under a Christmas tree talking to her cellphone pretending MC is actually talking to her when i'm pretty sure he blocked her number or something. Sees her traumatized in denial face and she just expresses her unconditional in denial love for him even after everyone basically knows hes the biggest douchebag ever... and goes with it and says he still has \"feelings for her\" even though he hasn't talked to her in ages or thought about her at all. She accepts him and they become bf and gf...  BUT WAIT Sekai and MC are already bf and gf... Sekai is even pregnant... oh wait MC doesn''t care oh.. okay.. Eventually Sekai finds out and flips shit, going to his house makes some tea and stabs poor MC in the chest like 6 times... Katsura is finally happy to have MC all to her self and is recovering telling Sekai to get aborted but OH NOO... MC is kill.... Katsura has no one... umm... So then Katsura tells Sekai to meet her on the roof... and Sekai actually goes... for some reason... and confronts her love and asks if the baby was real or if it was just attention schemes telling Sekai shes basically a slut that made MC want all the bitches... and now hes dead oh yhea I also have his head in a bag... So basically Katsura goes can I see your baby grabs a huge as knife and slices Sekai's stomach open seeing if there was really a fetus or something developing... she says oh well know one there and credits roll.. It really is hard to explain I just wanted to rant about it like an idiot but yhea thats the generic unfulfilling garbage story with a YANDERE TWIST. It wasn't a bad story but every episode was repetitive and tedious to get through... every scene with MC made me want to cringe on how awkward he was and there was no real pay out at all, It doesn't feel good to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nWell the animation wasn't terrible it was probably the only okay thing about the show. MC was made looking awkward and he portrays it throughout the show. Other girl characters are decently copy pasted to look different and unique, but still are generic. The show reuses the same stills of the outdoor landscapes as well always showing the apartment building with that \"Nobil\" gas station that gets old quick... Everything was well animated but it wasn't amazing just average good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nIt wasn't amazing as well just average. Voice actors were well done. Stabing sounds sounded okay. Music was kind of good. I think the opening is kind of annoying but I like it kind of. Every episode has a different ending theme except for the last one I think, so that was cool. Everything was clear, just basic sounds and nothing really amazing, opening doors, walking, cutting, talking, really just the basics...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\r\nYou have some good characters like maybe two and a lot of bad characters plus fillers. It just goes all over the place. None of the characters are really memorable well fleshed out or likable. Theres the serious one, loli, pervert, childhood friend, bitches, bullies, etc. None of them are enjoyable. I am pretty sure its safe to say that Makoutou Itou or MC is one of the worst MC's in all anime... He has NOTHING unique about himself, no likable qualities, and is just a greedy guy who is really selfish. Then gets killed. Sekai is whatever... literally tries to support MC and Katsura and fucks the whole relationship up giving him opportunities to get with more girls and just being the cause of the problem. Katsura didn't really do anything wrong. She was pretty innocent always thought about her bf telling her sister about him, trying to learn to cook, sew, etc. and then gets left alone, bullied by other girls at school, cheated on, and becomes an in denial girl with a crazy yandere look in her eyes. She then takes stuff to extreme measures and is a little at fault for killing Sekai... or something its wierd...\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 \\n\r\nThere is literally 0 to know enjoyment in this entire show. Some scenes may be like oh they were child hood friends and oh they all love each other and oh the drama... but it is really just completely terrible to go through there is no motivation I have to watch this anime other then to get through it. It has nothing you can be happy about, be interested about, cry about, its just like oh they had sex what... or oh he cheated on her again.. and then oh Crazy Ending... and credits.... Its hard to get through when the viewer doesn't get rewarded for the time spent watching the mess of a show... but it is just not fun at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nIt isn't the worst anime you will ever watch but it will be the one you remember as wow this was so ridiculous and unfulfilling... Every episode is basically the same... It is hard to judge this anime but it just isn't good. It had a good lesson I guess to stay faithful and be responsible and all but it was just a unsatisfying way to put everything together.. I don't know why I wrote a review on this.. but I guess I needed to express that (No this anime is not a 1/10 a 1/10 is a ridiculous score making an anime basically unviewable)... which this isn't, and I am always seeing these 1/10's So ignore them. If you really want to watch this anime I encouarge that you do but with warning that you will not get any real satisfaction after watching it. You probably have already seen it so whats the point... but just do if you haven't so you understand how basically everyone who has seen it feels...",

IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONTINUE, THEN YOU MAY WATCHED THE WHOLE THING OR SOMEONE ELSE LIKES TO GET SPOILED. EITHER WAY I DON'T CARE, AND YOU MAY CONTINUE.\r\nENJOY!\r\n:D\r\n______________\r\n**Plot**\r\nA young Japanese Highschool student, Makoto Itou, is beginning is second his second term at Sakakino Academy. As he usually takes his train ride to the Academy, he spotted a girl who is a fellow student that caught his eye. Her name is Kotonoha Katsura, a girl who also commutes. A new classmate friend, Sekai Sainoji discovers Makoto has a secretcrush on Kotonoha, she helps both of them to get together and then eventually started dating. However, despite all that effort Sekai is developing feelings towards Makoto and grown with jealousy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThus, starting to turn this cute love story,\\n\\n\\n\r\n.....into a living nightmare!\\n\\n\\n\r\n______________\\n\\n\r\n**Story**\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's basically a story of a love triangle that can bring so much not only to everyone around them, but also to themselves. This anime is predictable if you know what's going to come up next.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAt first when I started watching this anime several years ago, I did recommended to some of my friends who loves light novels and love stories. Yet, little do I know when I've progressed a little further. Y'know in RL when if one person gets into another person's pants is easier than the first one, then I am okay with that. Why, would you ask? Well there is a logical and acceptable way to solve everything and goes smoothly. Which is by telling your first lover first that \"it's not working\" and break up, wait a few (or more) days to have everything to cool down, then move in with the other lover.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDid Makoto do that?\\n\\n\\n\r\n.....\\n\\n\\n\r\nNO!\\n\\n\\n\r\nInstead, Makoto just moved in with Sekai and forgets Kotonoha as if she's only a memory. Which makes things worst with the other classmates to assume that the logically stuff has happened and Makoto and Kotona have broken up without Kotonoha knowing this. Which makes Kotohona SLOWLY STARTS TO GO INSANE!\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike, I mean.... SERIOUSLY.....\\n\\n\\n\r\n>8(\\n\\n\\n\r\nFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\n\\n\\n\r\nLater, Makoto gets to sleep with four different girls (and maybe perhaps  more off screen) then later meets Kotonoha that he really wants them to get back together.\\n\\n\\n\r\nwell.... interesting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI wonder how Sekai takes this news.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI would imagine not very likely, for it feels like it's a stab in the back.\\n\\n\\n\r\nor more like in the front.\\n\\n\\n\r\nY'know what they say, what goes around, comes around.\\n\\n\\n\r\n___________________________\\n\\n\r\n**Animation**\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation by TNK is really outdated comparing to what recent animes are now; However... well.... I have to agree that it's actually pretty good back then. If only animated something worth watching.\\n\\n\\n\r\n___________________________\\n\\n\r\n**Sound**\\n\\n\r\nThe Openings and Endings, in my opinion, are very decent and standard, It's not like making the whole anime worth watching and I have to say skip them.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack during each episode however, is bleh. Not that appealing for me.\\n\\n\r\nThank goodness it's not Dubbed, otherwise I would go out of my way by blowing up whatever studio who would green-light this.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________\\n\\n\r\n**VERDICT**\\n\\n\r\nJust as everyone who reviewed this anime I have to agree. Young love is fragile to ones hearts and minds. This anime can be a good lesson to give to young adults who thinks to want a relationship with someone, or already in one, but I wouldn't recommend it so.\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, I..... personally..... HATED IT!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing note worthy for me is how the ending of this anime got delayed in Japan due to recent actual murders that happened in the region. It can be the same local cases as this. Thus replaces the ending with calming music, and scenery.\\n\\n\r\noh look a boat! :D\\n\\n\r\nSome people say, I may have been very harsh on this anime. Y'know what, those people can go ahead and sleep with many different men and/or women before might get stabbed to death or worse because I believe I am not being too harsh on it at all. It's not the kind of thing I would like watching Love Stories. Hell, I would find hardly to believe that ANYONE would LOOOOVE to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder..... Why? Who's this anime for?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime.... for me.... has come to be.... ONE OF THE WORST..... ANIME.... EVER TO BE MADE INTO EXISTENCE!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: 1/10 - WHAT IS LOVE? BABY, DON'T KILL ME! DON'T KILL ME! NO MOE!",

            "content": "Oh dear... Oh dear oh dear... Seeing reviews for this going any higher than a 5 really makes me loose little faith in humanity... Calling this piece of bubo puss a \"deep psychological\" anime puts it on the same level as good anime, such as Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain and Aoi Bungaku. It's not. I'd go as far to say that this is the worst anime I've ever seen.\r\nThe characters. No development or progression. At all. We see the main character progress from a complete and utter c***, to !SPOILER ALERT! a dead complete and utter c*** because he acted like a complete and utterc*** throughout the entirety of the series. Bitch A is your typical air headed, big titten harem love interest, then you have bitches B, E, D, F, G and f*** knows how many more all trying to f*** the c***. I knew nothing more about any of the characters by the end of the series that I didn't already know by the end of the first episode.\\n\r\n Art. Not great, not really that dreadful either. It's watchable. \\n\r\nSound. Every piece of music is very forgettable.\\n\r\nStory. Hooray, we get to watch some horny tw*t fuck everything that has a pair of breast with no remorse or poor feelings towards anyone. If the plot were even remotely well executed, I may just let it go but it's not. It's just awful.\\n\r\nThe only enjoyable thing about this anime is the ending, seeing Makoto (the c***) dying was one of the most satisfying resolutions to an anime ever. And seeing the credits roll afterwards, knowing I don't have to drag myself through any more. This anime is pathetic, it does nothing new, executes none of it well at all and has generic, undeveloped characters. I'd sooner rate Boku no Pico a masterpiece than give this any higher than a 1.",

            "content": "Chances are, if you are viewing this page, you have seen this series, or are aware of what happens in the end, and the circumstances surrounding its broadcast (nice boat etc). School Days is one of those anime series that demands you form an opinion of it, whether disgust, hilarity, depression, aggression, School Days is successful in, if nothing else, than garnering an emotion.\r\nAt the outset, the plot seems pretty straight-forwards, a simple romantic comedy with possible harem connotations, not unlike shows like Haruka Nogizaka no Himtsu. By the end you are presented with one of the most unique (for better or worse) anime experiencesyou'll have. At it's core the show is simply misanthropic. No other way to describe it. The teenagers involved engage in a web of lies, infidelity and meaningless sex, not to mention the bullying, murder and rape; you know, the sort of show you can sit down and watch with your Grandmother on a nice Sunday afternoon.The story is fast paced if utterly ridiculous, most of the problems with the story lie with the lack of good characterisation. However, the anime seems to be struggling against the constraints of the source material at times. School Days, the H game is not a particularly good H game, and many of the complaints against the anime can be traced back to problems with the H game. This, however, does not excuse  the bad dialogue and over-reliance on melodrama the anime has. The story in School Days is acceptable if only for its novelty and sheer exaggeration, although nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of School Days is by the most part acceptable. Remaining true to the source material (albeit with much better animation), it is  not particularly adventurous, yet not anything special either. The characters don't seem to be all that expressive, even during the emotional scenes (and, my God are there a lot of those). Also the characters have ink for blood and probably never sleep as they all have bags under their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the sound is not the delivery, although interviews with the Seiyuus indicate they way not have fully understood their characters properly (&quot;Makoto's just an indecisive character, and a bit [!] of a pervert as well&quot;). The problem with the sound lies with the dialogue. The poor dialogue really hampers characterisation and often sounds clunky and unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto is one of the most notable characters in anime, if only for the massive shitstorm his very presence manages to conjure up. Simultaneously whiny, indecisive and self-centered, I often find myself saying Makoto's promiscuity would be completely respectable if only he was a fucking man about it. the female leads seem incapable of rational thought, not that it's a particularly strong trait in anyone in this anime, and the more minor characters are so laughably badly developed that in the end they are robbed of any of their motivations and are reduced by the director to simple cock sleeves for Makoto. The characters in School Days are bad, just bad, but, here's the rub, they are effective. They create emotion in the viewer, whether empathy, exasperation or hatred, the characters are doing something many anime characters no longer do, and actually make you feel something.\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy School Days when I first watched it. Maybe I took it too seriously at the time, but the show was so callous, I couldn't really enjoy it. It seemed to delight in the agonies of the characters, yet unlike a good soap opera, didn't provide any emotional resolution (consequence-free murder and an abrupt ending don't count). Others found enjoyment in mocking it, others found enjoyment in being able to get angry for half an hour every week. Not me though, by the time episode 11 finished I didn't want to watch it anymore, and only the promise of a BAD END made me continue.",

            "content": "This is my first review that I am making about any anime because this specific anime (School Days) has to have a review. It was such a compelling story and had a lot of drama. It started out as the normal love triangle. Itou Makoto has a crush on Katsura (A girl from the same school who rides the same train with him). Then he gets help from Saionji Sekai who hooks them up and even she falls for him. \r\nWell the anime gets more crazy as each episode draws near and I can say there are quite some surprises. Itou Makoto (main character) drawsquite a lot of attention and ends up affecting just about all the other characters in this story. And not in a good way either. Anybody who watches this anime will most likely end up hating the main character. School Days has you feeling all kinds of emotions but I rarely seen a happy moment. You are interested all the way to the end and the end is something you don't want to miss. Even though I kinda figured what was going to happen, I was wrong and the ending took me by surprise and I am still thinking about.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, School Days is not your regular romance story. If you like happy endings, don't watch this. There is a lot of reality in this anime by what happens in the story. \\n\\n\r\nStory-8- I gave the story a 8 because it never left me uninterested and it just seemed to play out well with a surprising ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9- I gave art a 9 because it great.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10- I love the music and it seem to fit School Days nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7- The characters in this story are kinda pathetic. Where are there morals. Even though most of the characters were backstabbing they seem to bring this anime to what it is now. Great\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9-I enjoyed every moment of this anime except the backstabbing. The story keeps you interested.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a 8 because of the unique story line. You don't see too many anime like School Days. It shows a side of reality and isn't all about the happiness.",

It's a shame to spoil an anime like that saying it's plot/story is this simple. In the end it might be the story's moral not to cheat and screw around with other's emotions by acting out of personal desire.\r\nThe anime starts as a beautiful love story and later twists into some kind of forbidden/secret love. From there it becomes a quite sad story as there is a lot emotional painbetween some of the characters. At this point you start to dislike the main character Itou, as he handles others' emotions of love and desire in a wrong way, and only acts out of his own personal desire. As other reviews may mention, you WILL hate the main character in the last third of the anime, as he acts against what you as a viewer want to happen.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story in itself is very good; as stated above the theme of the story twists and the sad aspects somehow mix together and form story that I couldn't put away. I felt caught by the story from the very beginning till the very ending, and even after watching it I had it troubling my mind for several hours. I watched the entire anime of 12 episodes in a row and couldn't let it go. I think this should be enough to describe how I think of the story :)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThere are no significant special effects, as there is not much real action or &quot;spells&quot; that require this, instead the anime uses an nice style that suits my taste regarding the genres.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe seem cool to me all the way though. Again here there are nothing extreme that require some cyper sound, just the daily speech and environmental sound and music as needed for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe story doesn't go very deep into the personalities or characters. You only get to judge upon the characters' from their present actions. There are only a few flashbacks that helps you settle the character's emotions and feelings towards each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs I might have given the impression of already, I really really liked the show, and therefore I strongly advise people to see this anime if they have interest in its genres.\\n\\n\r\nNote: You will dislike the main character Itou at some point of the anime so much you can call it hate and that he really annoys you, but beware that this is the anime's intentions and you shouldn't be fooled to back out of it because of this. This anime is truly a masterpiece of you've got nerves to endure the mental pain.",

All but one of the characters in this show are completely sociopathic, to the point where you eventually begin to legitimately wonder if the author understands basic cause and effect. It's almost unfathomable how a show can be written where every single character fails to exhibit even the most primitive inkling of having responsibility for their actions. The authors writing skill set is juvenile at best, and fails to follow even the most basic storytelling premise of presenting the story through the main characters' point of view. This lack of focusis so unimaginably flagrant, it borderline questions who the main characters of the show even are. Devoid of almost all sense of realistic human interactions, this story falls completely flat on its face.\\n\\n\r\nArt is less than standard. Sound is almost non-existent.

            "content": "A show with a 6 average rating is probably not something you\u2019re gonna plan on watching anytime soon. But School Days, when watched as the psychological series it was meant to be (rather than the high school opera people see in it), can be an absurdly entertaining show. The show manipulates its plot and high school  setting very well to keep the show both entertaining and thought-provoking. The hidden layers of theme and ideals make the series great for its unique perspective of relationships and love. To enjoy School Days as much as possible, regardless of whether you\u2019re watching it for the first timeor for the hundredth time, I\u2019d recommend watching the show for its two very important themes/messages:\\n\\n\r\n((Below these recommendations are what I liked in the series)\\n\\n\r\n#1) Love does not care about how difficult your upbringing might have been, the mental problems you may have endured, or if you have constantly tried to act morally; love is indifferent to everyone. It spawns from the desires of people. Thus, regardless of who you are and how justified your actions may be, love has no rules. Good things don\u2019t happen to good people and bad things don\u2019t happen to bad people. I would say the series focuses on this idea in Sekai, Katsura, and Makoto throughout the series. Each one approaches relationships with different desires, and each one falls victim to the cons of love in their own way. Makoto acts purely out of selfish desires with no regard to those he may be hurting, but still often receives sexual reward. Katsura makes no attempt to hurt others initially, but she is bullied to the point of insanity. Sekai is a mixture of the two, serving as the reality check for the show. Regardless of who they are and what they stand for, the wheels of reality always turn and the three of them all end up having to adapt to the cold world of high school romance.\\n\\n\r\n#2) Abandoning your moral compass and sacrificing your good conscience for happiness always ends poorly. True happiness cannot be achieved by indulging in the easiest decision if it means sacrificing your principles and good conscience. Makoto is easily influenced by this theme. Presented by constant sexual reward with little resistance, he abandons his somewhat-kind disposition In favor of the temptation of sex, regardless of who he\u2019s nailing (which he does. A lot. Like damn Makoto. You\u2019re getting more action in sophomore year than I will my entire life). Sekai tries to stay strong to her ideals, constantly trying to do the right thing and feeling guilty for those she hurts, but she begins to crumble farther into the series when faced with losing love. Katsura loses her identity and sanity in pursuit of the brief happiness she and Makoto shared. \\n\\n\r\nTWO IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE SHOW I FELT REALLY IMPROVED THE SERIES\\n\\n\r\n One of the reasons I enjoyed School Days so much was because it reminded me of my past in a way. The first girl I ever developed feelings for also liked me, and so we dated. It was my first time ever pining after someone, and I was immediately given what I wanted. While we were dating, I walked all over her and thought only of my own well being. But when I broke up with her, I thought there would only be more girls to cycle through and more fun to be had. But for the next two years, to my dismay, I didn\u2019t make any romatic advancements. The regrets, the anger, and the desire to constantly fill an emotional hole haunted me. It took me a while to learn that, by being given what I wanted instantly, I took relationships for granted and never really learned to appreciate romance.Looking back, my decisions seem both understandable and horrific. Makoto always seemed to remind me of the person I could have become had circumstance been different. The high quality of School Days\u2019 writing always keeps me thinking \u201cthese characters could be just like me. Their decisions are understandable and their scenarios are somewhat realistic\u201d. For me, this was a really big part of enjoying the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, finally, I LOVEDDD SEKAI\u2019S CHARACTER. She is such a great character to watch in the series because you can never decide whether or not you want her to find happiness. Sekai makes both good and bad decisions, and she has both selfish and selfless motives. She\u2019s just such an incredibly well done character, and she portrays how a person\u2019s desire to be loved can change who someone is. Her development in the series was a part I just could not exclude from my review because it was that good. I feel almost anyone can easily relate to her given the circumstances she has to endure.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I finished watching School Days I felt enraged. Now that isn't really surprising, considering that the show left many people in a state of dreadful anger. But what made me even angrier wasn't that what I had just watched was horrible, it was that people PRAISED it. They praised it for being a 'deconstruction' of the harem genre. That it was 'different' and that you were supposed to hate it. Well I disagree completely and here's why.\r\nNow as many know the show starts of as you expect; a boring harem show. To my memory for 3 episodes the show was just boring. However, afterthe first 3 episodes the show decides to be a story about an asshole who fucks a bunch of girls until the inevitable end ( hint; Makoto will never speak again ).\\n\\n\r\nNow a surprising amount of people say that the show was supposed to be hated and that it was 'realistic'. Sure the show does stuff differently from the typical harem show, but in no way is it good because of it. Being different does not mean quality. But why do I consider the show so horrible. Well mainly because the show will do ANYTHING to move the plot along. Seriously, the characters are ridiculous in how stupid they are. Makoto think's with his penis before he think's with his mind, while the girls act like mindless sheep that will do anything just to be with Makoto. But why? What reason is there for a bunch of ( admittedly ) attractive females to be so obsessed with a guy that not just acts like a complete dick but also seems to have the brain of a chimpanzee that hit his head against a tree. He doesn't care about consequences or the feelings of others, no. What he cares about is sex. Sure he's a teen boy that probably can't wait to fuck but no one would act that way, absolutely no one. Kotonoha becomes a yandere because reasons. Sekai lies to Makoto about her pregnancy and the rest of the girls want his dick badly. Like what the fuck? The characters just seem to act for no reason and I'm supposed to believe all that nonsense. Everything in the story just moves along until the ending but while I did feel satisfied ( at seeing you know what ) the show seems to think I'll forgive everything purely because of the ending and that two horrible characters get what they deserve. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also bad. While not as horrible as everything else ( except the music ) it looks so ugly to me. Maybe it's the fact that everything seems to be grey, white or black most of the time or maybe it's that the eyes look too big, I'm not completely sure. The music is the least worse thing because while forgettable it never made my ears bleed. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion; what makes me angry about School Days is not that the characters and story are unlikable, it's that there seems to be no reason for it being unlikable other than moving towards the ending. Makoto seems like a nice guy until for whatever reason he seems to start fucking every female within his eyesight. He goes from boring harem guy to asshole for no reason at all. Sekai seems to like Makoto from the start despite the fact that she never knew him at all. Kotonoha becomes obsessive over him despite being originally shy and timid. I think you get the point of why I hate it.",

            "content": "This review contains mild spoilers, viewers who have not seen the show or haven't heard about its reputation are advised to look elsewhere. You have been warned.\r\nHigh school isn't a particularly rare setting in anime. No sir, in fact, high school seems to be freaking everywhere. How many times have you heard someone whine and complain about how anime is always set in high school? How many times will you hear that Japan can't let go of anime in high school, how people whine from season to season about how anime (modern or in general) sucks, how the cliches are tedious, how that one tsunderefrom that one anime is insufferable, how shows which are not in high school are automatically given points or credit or any of that? If you've been an anime fan for longer than a few months, you've definitely heard these complaints from someone, somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nHarems in particular take the cake. Seriously, there's the quiet girl, the tsundere, the tomboy, the random best friend, the sister of one of the main characters, the best friend who only exists to say dumb sex jokes...and sometimes several of them overlap with one another. \\n\\n\r\nSo what happens when a harem tries to break out of the mold, and instead of the guy being unable to get laid and is seemingly oblivious to all of the girls liking him, the guy actually wants to get laid with everyone and is fully aware and uses that to his advantage.\\n\\n\r\nThis should be an interesting series, was my first impression. I didn't buy into the hate that everyone was giving this show; after all, a deconstruction should avert tropes and make them apply in a more realistic manner, right? If you think of it that way, this show should've been really interesting to watch, right?\\n\\n\r\nWhile many people agree with the logic present above, I am here to say that that simply isn't true. School Days doesn't only fail as a stand alone show, it also fails as a deconstruction.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is stupidly written and has some of the strangest logic I've seen in my life. Some would argue that the show's first few episodes are cliche harem, while the rest is pretty bad melodrama, but I personally disagree. The first few episodes are every bit as stupid as the rest of the show, maybe more so.\\n\\n\r\nLet me provide you, reader, with what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nHow does the whole thing start off? Here it is (try not to laugh, like I did when I discovered this); the first episode starts off with a rumor saying that if you take a picture of a girl, and keep it as your wallpaper on your phone for a week, that girl will fall in love with you.\\n\\n\r\nI was in high school. I also am aware of how normal, fully functioning human beings (high schoolers or otherwise) think. If your instant reaction while reading the above paragraph wasn't that that was one of the stupidest things you've heard in your life, then I suggest going to a doctor as quickly as possible.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, School Days isn't exactly a show with bad ideas. Its ideas are actually quite captivating and interesting. The problem is that the road to get there is filled with drama. Not the good, well-written and well built up kind of drama. Do you know shows like Gossip Girl, where every interaction between the characters is written simply to add drama for the sake of drama, and contradicts logic present in the show earlier on? Yep, that kind of drama.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait, you may say, the characters have to be interesting and captivating for this to work. Even if the side characters are forgettable, all can be forgotten if the show focuses on the main leads and develops them in a great amount of detail, you may say.\\n\\n\r\nYou are right, but this is not a show with interesting characters. Hell, I don't even know if these guys can even be called characters, much less human beings (and unless the characters were never the point, the moment a work of fiction fails is the moment when the characters don't feel human).\\n\\n\r\nThis is why the show fails so badly at being a deconstruction; for a show that is averting so many tropes related to harem anime, it fails to avert the most important one. That is, failing at making the characters more humanized, and simply being satisfied with them being darker takes on the archetypes that the characters follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe main lead is still boring and has the personality of a brick, the main shy girl is still very bland and way too dense (not to mention her breasts being more memorable than her personality), the main best friend character who is secretly in love with the main character is still dumb and incredibly illogical about her actions (this is taken up to 11 here) and so on.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the interactions feel human, none of them resemble something an actual human being would do or say. Yes, we all say and do stupid things in high school, but we still have some kind of logic that we follow. This show has none of that, it only wants to stall for time until we get to the ending, and wants to add more drama and walking character archetypes while its at it.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is unremarkable at best and outright terrible at worst, since every face looks exactly the same (to the point where I was confusing several characters with each other). This wouldn't be a problem, since a lot of shows have faces which look exactly the same and where the coloring is done well enough, to the point where we don't notice this or even feel it. The coloring in this show is terrible, however, and everything feels like it's intentionally shaded in a darker color (not black either, it's this strange purple-lack color), to the point where the blood that I saw over the course of the show looked no different than the color of one of the main lead's hair.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is no better, with very little movement and what little movement there is feeling clumsy and awkward, almost like I was watching flash animation and not a fully budgeted anime series with actual professional animators responsible for it. \\n\r\nThere is a clear improvement in the animation in the last episode, but even that looks average at best and still doesn't improve in any way my opinion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, School Days fails on every single level that I can think of. I couldn't even get angry at this show; hell, I was laughing my head off at many of the more \"serious\" moments present throughout the show. The only reason I give this a 2 rather than a 1 is because, however I feel about the show's quality, I can at least give it credit for entertaining me from the beginning to the end. Hell, I bet it would make a pretty good drinking game with friends, but I'm not entirely certain I'd want to do that, since I wouldn't want to constantly choke over my drink.\\n\\n\r\nThat's exactly what this show is, overall; a joke. This is the kind of thing you'd give to your friends or people you hate and have a laugh about later. There is nothing I can recommend about this show unless you want to have a laugh, want to rage on something or simply watch bad anime because why not. If you don't follow any of that, I propose you stay as far away as humanly possible from this show. Do take a good look at the character art or something though, you wouldn't want to get pranked into watching this.",

HAH! enjoyment... This anime bring you to the limits of how much shit it is... Okay i will start to explain each category one by one...\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory: The story involves a male protagonist, Makoto Ito *cough* twat *cough*, who \"supposedly\" fallsin love with the female character, Kotonoha Katsura and then the story continues with him falling in love with 5 more other girls... Now this is the stupid part... Is this guy supposed to be a guy? Does he deserve to live? The ending from what I saw was one of the most greatest boner killer EVER... If you haven't watched it, don't... It'll only make you more pissed...\\n\\n\r\nArt: Let me say, the art was pretty okay... The adaptation from the visual novel to the anime was actually pretty good but the male protagonist looked literally like a male whore...\\n\\n\r\nSound: Meh\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Please...Don't get me even started... The development of the character was like stopping right before an orgasm... It brought you to the point where the romance is building up and drops you even below where it first started... Now, what was the fucking point in that? I have no fucking clue...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: *sigh* must i really go through this pain-staking job to explain to you how much laughter i gave to this anime because of its stupidity?? To summarize it in 3 words: Whore, twat and shit...\\n\\n\r\nBefore you insist you want to watch this anime, please refer to the source i have found...\\n\\n\r\n-Source- A very famous anime reviewer said this\\n\\n\r\n\"The reviewer found it to be \"annoying, stupid, mean-spirited, and full of some of the biggest idiots [he had] seen in an anime in a long time.\"",

            "content": "whats up anime lovers,\r\n        today i'm reviewing this awesome love story known as school days\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this next paragraph is basically a spoiler but many parts are vague and nothing too good is spoiled so please read on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nLets see what's really going on here, we start with your typical loser main character, you know a normal guy we can all relate to, staring at his love at first sight girl from afar. So far this has been your typical romance but woahoho whats this, a nosy girl gets involved and manages to hook these 2 love birds up, and bythe end of episode 1, kudos to you love doctor. Of course this is still pretty between the lines, the only odd thing is how fast the relationship is moving. So now these 2 are hooked up and poor little mokoto starts feeling different about his perfect, hot girlfriend, who clings to him because she's ostracized by her classmate (we all know girls like this...right). Now loverboy mokoto wants miss nosy and she agrees to cheat with him, eventually they do what comes naturally and she allows him to f**k her brains out on a dialy basis. Now you're feeling bad for his girlfriend but eventually you realize she's crazy around the time she offers him lemonade, she finds out he's cheating on her but she's still too insane to do anything. Mokoto continues to refuse to DTR but sekai a.k.a nosy still doesn't care. Eventually makoto see's her as a hassle and continues to cheat on her with girls that range from best friends to the most random girls that had anything to do with the story but you know highschool girls, all they wanna do is sleep around, i'm so glad they kept this realistic. So eventually sekai pisses mother nature off and doesn't recieve her gift and eventually we're left with 2 things, me at the last episode so pissed off at motoko I'm jumping up and down shouting seppuku, and what I consider one of the best endings for an anime ever, and i mean it, usually they suck, but not this time, oh and it was such a happy ending to, it really warmed my heart, but that I won't spoil for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, lets see, motoko was an average guys who went crazy sex beast that only cares about himself, throughout the anime he was an ass and you'll never fail to hate him, every chance he is given he will always pick the path that'll piss you off and he'll even go out of his way to piss you off some more, of course I thought he was a great character for the anime because it's about time we see an average guy turned into an asshole instead of someone with this hidden potential, you were meant to hate him, deal with it, he isn't a real person and if you feel you're better than him then you need to stop comparing yourself to someone so low on the bar and start working at being a decent human. Let's look at kotonoha, which is easy considering she's hot as hell, but really she starts out an innocent person who's shy, hot, and doesn't fit in, completely realistic, throughout the story it is revealed that she is an insane person even before the cheating, another perfect character for the anime because she reminds us that there are people who can be crazy and you need to watch out for them, personally i cheered her on at the end. Every other girl in this story was completely unrealistic and dick hungry, even sekai, she was nothing more than the first girl he cheated with, some other special things happen with her but she's no different from the rest, they let mokoto have them and he moved on as soon as things were clearing up for them. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good. nicely done overall but i don't think you really care too much about that, as long as it isn't complete garbage you're fine, nothing mindblowing, it was a little choppy if you're looking for some criticism.\\n\\n\r\nNow for music, let me tell you one thing, if all the making out scenes didn't give you a boner (or make you wet...ladies) then the music will, of course i'm bs-ing to get your attention, calm down and put it back in your pants, the music was fine, nothing worth noting, sorry if i got your hopes up or something.\\n\\n\r\noverall the story was good but it's taxing on your mind to put up with all the drama and all that goes on in each episode. I'll give it a 10 because that ending was perfect and the story was an easy to make up drama that an h-anime writter could've come up with but we don't see it too much so thanks for not sticking me with another one of your linkin park anime's (named since alot of their song sound similar and all the anime in a genre follow a basic pattern). Now if you're still following this you should also read the manga because it is very different from the anime and will actually redeem motoko a little because he is more considerate of others feelings and the plot is a lot less slut heavy.\\n\\n\r\nso long otaku, nerds (not a derogatory term in my book), asians, and those occasional beautiful people that like anime (not that you can't be more than one of these) thanks for reading, don't take me seriously, and if you message me make sure you at least add snowboarding in there somewhere...i love snowboarding.",

My first impression there, was that the main character, Makoto Itou, had a weak, timid personality.\r\n To avoid spoiling the plot, I can say that about the first half of the show wasenjoyable, watching as a new couple go through all the probllems of a relationship, not knowing when is the right moment to say 'this' or do 'that' and blah blah...\\n\r\n The second half of the series went downhill for me, and the 'eroge' side came up, and transforming the main character into a selifish moron who can't make up his mind about who to be with. From that point on I hated the main character, in fact, he has become one of the worst(If not THE worse) main characters I had ever seen, along with the other main characters becoming disturbed and/or paranoid.\\n\\n\r\n The finale was shocking, but kinda expected, and despite so many comments I have read saying how &quot;stupid&quot; this ending was, I enjoyed watching the main character getting what he deserved, though I don't think he needed to...\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review is filled with some minor spoilers that will not matter unless you have some prior knowledge of the show. The series started off like any other, a boy sees a girl from his school on the train. He was to afraid to talk with her so instead he snaps a picture of her with a cell phone and tries out a superstition about keeping the picture of the one you want to be with as your cell phone wallpaper for 3 weeks. After this another girl he doesn't know sees the picture, she sets the two of them up on a date together.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has it merits as a drama/love triangle show, but it quickly turns into every girl is either a someone who only wants to have sex or the only girl who doesn't have sex with the main character either moves away or she goes insane literally. \\n\\n\r\nThe breaking down this show is simple, the main character Makoto is unlikable, his girlfriend Kotonoha is in denial but she is likable only because everyone else isn't. Sekai is such a strange and bipolar character. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing i have to give the series props for is making a character that I didn't just dislike or hate, but actually wanted dead. I would want whoever was responsible for that single character to write villains from now on, from beginning to end he is a jerk with the and very oblivious to what kind of impact his actions will have on others. I hope the show was purposely trying to make me hate him, but that made me want to stop watching the show. I even did this but then i read what happens at the end and I had to see that for myself. The ending only redeems the show slightly because the ending isn't a happy ending, but that's fine because after watching the first half of this show I wasn't happy either.\\n",

            "content": "The epic question always comes to mind when I watch something like this.  What makes a good story?  Is it the characters, their actions or their interactions with others?  Is it the message found within the story?  Does it have anything to do with how one feels through out the story and even the ending?  Did it effect you in any ways, good, bad or otherwise?  Did it make you think, feel, or react during or after the story ended?\r\nIts these kinds of questions that should really be posed after watching such a story as School Days because manyseem to not like School Days, and to a certain extent I can understand why.  But, for the reasons people dislike School Days, is it because it has a bad story, or bad context within the story?\\n\\n\r\nI will admit, School Days seem to have started off as a typical high school drama story.  What I ended up with is something far from where the story started off.  So I want to hit on something that caught my eye right off the bat while scrolling through some of the other comments made.\\n\\n\r\nOthers stated that there was no character development.  While I have no issue agreeing that there was not much back story to our characters, what we where presented with was a window into their current present day of life.  As we got to see how things transpired we really didn't need much of the back stories but only to see and understand what was going on with our characters in the hear and now.  With that said I cant understand how anyone could not see any sort of character development within this window.\\n\\n\r\nCase in point: Makoto is a naive, innocent, inexperienced boy who also is a coward.  Because of these attributes we where introduced to him early on and it is no surprise he acted the way he did.  Between his adolescent nature of being a young boy and being completely jerked around/misled by the other girls around him we witnessed his cowardice blossom into a complete jerk of a guy.  But his actions, while completely wrong and misguided, put him into a position of extreme stress.  The character didn't have enough gumption to face the swirling issues around him but instead allowed them to fester and go completely out of control.  His way of coping with these stresses was simply to heed no regard for the other girls around him because the ones close to him where hurting him so much.  He was looking for an escape but this path only made things much worse.  I am by no means giving this guy and out.  None of this would have been an issue if he simply acted like a man, grew a pair and took control of the situations he started getting into.  Ask yourself this, how many times did Makoto stammer when asked a question or confronted by others on the situation(s) that was causing him stress? We as an audience saw first hand how much of a coward he is.  We also bared witness to how he reacted. Through the stresses he was dealing with we saw him develop into something far less desirable.  I call that plenty of character development.  This character is a mirror unto our own society.  We are a sincere-less culture that is afraid of actually saying what needs to be said which allows other things around us to spiral out of control.\\n\\n\r\nKotonoha was introduced to us as a very sweet, innocent and inexperienced girl.  Even within the story we were told how poorly she was treated in her past due to certain physical attributes.  Yet we see this very cheerful, happy, soul of a person that literally had her spirit broken by everyone around her.  What we ended up with was a completely broken shell of a woman that simply lost her mind due the world that was thrown at her which she never asked for.  Of all the characters I can not understand how anyone could say this character did not develop at all.  We as an audience again bared witness to fall of this characters sanity brought on by others.  Furthermore she tried everything to set the wronged ship right and was constantly blocked in doing so.  As a person watching this I could not help but feel for this character.  To top things off, she is truly the personification of our current society.  Where men throughout high school, collage and beyond, break and bust up women psychologically because they have all been led to believe that women like jerks and the bad boy.  And because of that kind of thought we are left with women of all ages filled with angst, spite, and vexed understandings of what is good or not.\\n\\n\r\nSekai is a real piece of work.  A person so willing to go out of the way and do things for others, and from what I gathered, enjoyed the end result.  She just could not handle dealing with the consequences of her own decision when it came to Makoto and Kotonoha.  She innocently played match maker and concerned herself with other peoples happiness instead of simply looking to herself, being a little selfish and dealing with her own happiness.  That is until it was to late, which then we see someone completely change from someone selflessly creating happiness for others to selfishly trying to gain what she lost in the process.  That is Jekyll and Hyde character development if I have even seen any.   Furthermore she went so far as to lie about something very profound for her and Makoto yet held onto that lie right to the very end even after she was confronted with the truth right in the hands of the very person she screwed over.  Someone willing to do such selfless acts for others in the beginning could not let go of her own selfish desires in the end.  She is truly the picture of the death of sincerity in our culture.  if there was any character anyone should hate in this story it should be Sekai well before Makoto.\\n\\n\r\nLook the bottom line is that for anyone who thinks there is no character development in this story I would simply ask them to watch it again.  The problem is that this story is a reflection of what is wrong with us as a people today.  This story has some very deep psychological undertones that I can understand is easy to miss by most.  But that does not make it a bad story at all.  What gives me pause mostly is how I started this review off in the first place by asking what makes a good story.  So many people where effected by this stories ending and how \"messed up\" it was.  And yet it is that very reaction that I pose those question at the start of this review.  This whole show made me squirm in my chair several times included the ending.  That means it did its job and did it well.  It created a reaction and for that I cant help but say that this was a good, no, great story.\\n\\n\r\nKnarfis",

            "content": "School Days, a rare anime where getting the ending spoiled for you is actually a good thing. I finished watching this anime today, in marathon, after I have read a lot of things about it, especially the \"Nice ship!\" phrase.\r\nIt starts out as your usual love triangle school drama, switches into harem anime during the mid-point, and switches back into love triangle near the end, but don't let that description fools you. While this kind of plot is usual in soap opera, the protagonist Itou Makoto is in no way your usual male lead. I mean it unusual in a bad way. I have seena number of protagonists for harem anime, usually they are indecisive, oblivious and a loser in treating their relationship; but none of them as bad as Makoto.\\n\\n\r\nThis guy Makoto screws with every female characters in this anime, except some tall blue haired girl and the underage girls. This guy is more horny than a rabbit. He's also a liar, denying all his unfaithfulness in front of people. He's a jerk, hurting everybody's feeling, tramples on everybody's hearts, and tosses the girls he's no longer need aside. He's also an irresponsible person. All of his behaviors make you want to punch him in the face. No wonder he ranks first as the male character you want to kill in several voting occasions.\\n\\n\r\nWait. Doesn't this make this anime a 3/10 trash? How come it's 7/10?\\n\\n\r\nWell, this is where my description in the first sentence comes in. Throughout the viewing experience, you can't help but wonder:\\n\r\n\"Divine punishment will drop unto this guy, right?\"\\n\r\n\"There's no way he can get away with these, right?\"\\n\r\n\"This guy should better off dead.\"\\n\r\nCongrats. Those wishes are granted. Without this spoiler, watching this anime will be really painful. But by knowing the ending before, my viewing experience is quite enjoyable. Seeing all the bad things he has done, I kept telling myself, \"He will pay for this! He will pay this!\" Don't drop it. Stick to the end. And you will find yourself jumping with joy with a clenched fist, and shouted with joy \"God exists after all!\"\\n\\n\r\nNow, unto the uncovered part. The art is a mixed bag, if I may say. The girl characters are quite cute, but the guys are ugly, especially the main character, he's just a walking egg. Come to think of it, his eyes shaped like eggs too. The animation is lacking, but it doesn't matter much since this is not an action anime. Most of the time is filled with talking anyway. The sound effects are barely existent, and the songs are forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this anime. Don't call yourself an anime viewer if you know nothing about this anime. Lol. I don't regret watching it myself. It gives off important message too, \"Don't ever make the same mistake, kids. See ya!\"",

            "content": "My review of \"School Days\". \r\nWarning: The following review contains minor spoilers. \r\nPlot: 7/10\r\nSummary: Matoko is a normal teenage boy who has a crush on Katsura, the girl who rides his train and also happens to go to his school. Sekai, a friend of Makoto finds out about his crush and helps the two get together, despite having a crush on Matoko herself. This ends up leading to a very twisted sequence of events that can only be described as \"School Days\".\r\nThe Good: This anime, while not entirely fresh, is definitely different from what one may be accustom to seeing. School Days deals with themorality of cheating and lying to others. It shows in detail the psychological implications that these behaviors can have on the teenage mind. It dares to go where many anime dare never to tread. For that, and that alone, I highly commend School Days. It's not afraid to break from the mold as it were, and create something that people won't like in the hopes to convey a darker aspect of human nature. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: I could write all day about what is wrong with this anime. Other than what is mentioned above, the plot has no good points at all. It's actually highly annoying and by episode 4, perhaps 5, you'll probably want to bleach your brain and throw the viewing screen off a roof while cursing like a maniac. It's really that bad. So. Much. Drama. Not only drama, but completely unnecessary drama. If anything, it was pretty incredible how much bullshit was able to be placed within this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo why rate the plot as a 7/10? Simple: the ending. I'll get to that later. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. At times it was downright lazy and they didn't even try to hide the fact. The angles and the drawing was oftentimes just odd or unappealing. However, it wasn't horrible either. In many scenes, the animation was very well done and even commendable. Because of the blatant laziness at times, I'm giving this part a 5/10. After weighing the good scenes with the bad it pretty much evens out as simply being average. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: The voice acting wasn't bad. I think the actors conveyed exactly what was meant to be conveyed. While it wasn't awe-inspiring I think the voice actors did a very good job portraying the characters. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: I liked the music. It went along with the feel of the anime and did it's job exceedingly well. \\n\\n\r\nWhile only one bit of music was particularly memorable, the majority of it is quite easy to forget. The voice acting, while good, wasn't brilliant, earning a 7/10 from me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is where it gets interesting. The characters. Holy fucking hell...the characters. What more can you say except: Are they really that damn immature? I know it's high school, but I've seen grade-schoolers with more maturity than the characters of this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Good: You will loathe these characters. If you don't, then I'd love to hear your reasoning as to why you like them because there isn't anything to like. Nothing. And you know what? I LOVE that about this anime. Weird, right? Let me explain. You are suppose to hate these characters. They aren't meant to be likable. That means that the people who made this anime did their job. You will hate them, especially Makoto, with a passion that will likely be unmatched for many other anime characters you'll come across. This wouldn't be possible if the characters weren't so well written and played out. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: Literally everything about these characters. Everything. \\n\\n\r\nMakoto: He's like a little kid that goes into a candy store, eats every piece of candy he can find, then wonders why he has to pay for what he ate. That's really what his character boils down to. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I could understand him. I really could. I even sympathized with the prick. My sympathy for him ceased by the end of episode 11. If anyone can continue to feel for this character after episode 11, I tip my imaginary hat in your direction, because I'm just not that nice. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people may not like him because (spoiler) he's pretty much a sex-addict. That actually didn't bother me. He can do whatever he pleases to whomever he pleases, but it's the way he goes about it that makes him so despicable to me and more than once I wanted to commit violence against him while watching his dumb-ass. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, he's just an immature teen who can't handle the slightest bit of responsibility. I don't say this often, but the guy could have benefitted from growing a pair. \\n\\n\r\nSekai: Also known as the Slut of School Days. I may be one of the few that didn't see her as such. It's not wrong, in my opinion, for a woman to want to have sex. I'm fine with that. What I wasn't fine with was her overall personality. I wanted to like her, I truly did. I was rooting for her quite often, but there is only so much stupidity one can handle. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end she came off as weak and a home-wrecker who had about the same maturity level as Makoto and it was nearly impossible to feel badly for her.\\n\\n\r\nKatsura: She the one you are suppose to feel pity for. I didn't think she was pitiful. I thought she was just pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I understand why she ended up the way she did. I wanted to slap some sense into that female so desperately at times that it make me sick just to continue watching what was playing before my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters were just as bad. One in particular I found to be very distasteful and out of place. This friend has a crush on someone throughout most of the show, then suddenly with no reasoning behind it, she's having sex with Matoko. \\n\\n\r\nI see two reasons for this. The first is shock value. The second is to make Makoto look like an even bigger dick than before. It's like the creators just woke up and thought to themselves 'Let's see how much more we can get the audience to despise these characters.\" I'd say in that factor, they succeeded. Far, far too well. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is what I love about School Days. At first, everything is normal. The characters are normal, the events are rather realistic, but then it gets crazy. Not just normal crazy, but bat-shit crazy. You get to watch these characters change from normal people into twisted individuals over the course of the 12 episodes and School Days did this almost flawlessly. That is why this is rated an 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not a 10/10 because no matter how great the anime succeeded with making us hate these characters, it doesn't change the fact that I really REALLY hate these characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere really wasn't much to enjoy. It was like watching a badly made horror movie that leaves you shaking your head at the sheer stupidity at what is unraveling before your eyes. You'll probably curse, bang your head against a hard object a few times, and.....wait YES! Redemption! Suddenly, those agonizing hours spent watching this anime seem worth it. How? How can this be? It was almost painful to watch, how could I possibly enjoy it now? \\n\\n\r\nSimple. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending. The ending is worth it. Now, I knew about the famous ending before watching this anime. It was completely spoiled for me before hand. That was the reason I decided to watch this in the first place. So I stuck with it and I'm SO glad I did. I rejoiced at this ending. I wanted to celebrate and throw a party. Not because it was over (okay, maybe a little for that reason), but because the ending was really just that damn satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nHence, why I give my enjoyment level a 5/10 (and the plot a 7/10). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDid School Days suck? Yes. Were the characters unbelievably idiotic? Definitely. Would I watch this again? No. Okay, well...maybe the ending. \\n\\n\r\nPutting aside everything I dislike about this anime, I can still say it was good. The staff who created this knew what they wanted (well, mostly). They created characters we were meant to hate and they did that amazingly well. They tackled a subject you don't often find in anime and also did that amazing well, despite the filler and over use of pathetic 'pull your hair out because this is so damn stupid' drama. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? Absolutely. Not because I liked it, but because I think it's worth watching, if for no other reason than for how happy the ending will make you after hours of questioning why you're still watching this crap. \\n\\n\r\nI think this anime did what it set out to do. It showed us the darker side of relationships. It showed cheating, hatred, heartbreak, insanity, jealousy, etc... and did it in a way that I found to be interesting (if not slightly unrealistic). So, overall, yes, it was a good anime to me. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone who hasn't really watched anime before. This is one you'll probably have to be introduced to slowly and one you'll have to have a high tolerance level for before going into it. It's worth it though. \\n\\n\r\nThat ending...yeah. It's worth it.  \\n",

            "content": "First of all, if you don't know what exactly School Days is, and expect a lighthearted high-school romcom: DON'T WATCH THIS! If you are into the typical lovey-dovey fun romp and you are not a stone-cold cynic or have nerves of steel, give a wide berth to School Days, for your own good. Seriously, stop reading this review, close the page and forget you ever heard about this anime. Don't say I didn't warn you. (Oh, and tell whoever suggested this anime to you, to go where the sun doesn't shine, because you are obviously being trolled.)\r\nSo, what exactly is School Days, and how didit become one of the most controversial anime ever? \\n\\n\r\nIn short, School Days is a landmine. It's a cruel joke. One, that you play on your anime loving friends you don't wanna be friends with anymore. It's especially effective if your target loves high-school romantic-comedy series or games, like Toradora, Clannad, Love Hina and such. It's obvious the creators had the same goal in mind, because School Days is a horrific deconstruction of the genre, that not only makes fun of the premise and those who watch it, but it also breaks every rule in the book to drive the point home. It's a clear and concise \"F*** YOU!\" to the entire genre. The whole anime is perfectly camouflaged for a sneak-attack. The description, the cover images and even the first few episodes reek \"fun romcom romp\". The only thing, that might raise a red flag, is the R+ rating, but who looks at that anyway, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out normal enough. One could say TOO normal. Our protagonist, your average high-school student boy Makoto Itou, falls head-over-heels for a mysterious girl he rides the train with every day, yet he is too timid to even say hi to her. Instead, he takes photos of her with his phone and daydreams. His classmate Sekai Saionji finds out about his secret crush, and tries to play cupid to get Itou, and his love interest Kotonoha Katsura together. She succeeds in the endevour, Itou and Kotonoha becomes a pair, but in the process Sekai falls for Itou, too. Enter clich\u00e9'd high-school love triangle fun times. Or so you though! Be prepared for one of the wildest roller-coaster rides you've ever experienced in anime!\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILERS AHEAD! No specific plot points, but if you don't wanna rob yourself of the shock value of this anime, skip this part!]\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days' ability to lull the audience into a false sense of security is simply masterful! There is a reason for the R+ rating, which becomes VERY apparent in later episodes, and it WILL catch you off-guard. Let's be honest, School Days can be very shocking, unsettling and even downright vulgar and disgusting for some people. But the creators played the \"boiling frog\" concept like a boss, it all comes on slowly and gradually, it sneaks up on you until there is no escape, and that's when it tears off your head and screams into your soul. It hides the dark side, packages the vulgar in ecchi, the shocking in drama, etc, to the point you'll constantly be puzzled as \"Wait, did I just see that?!\". School Days breaks all the rules and stuffs them into your mouth as a ball gag while having it's way with you. This anime has everything from easy going humor, light romance and clich\u00e9'd hooks all the way to hardcore ecchi, bullying, depression, mental problems and all the \"hard stuff\" darker anime dares to go. But wait, School Days doesn't stop there, oh no, it goes BEYOND all that. Underage sex, physical abuse, teen pregnancy, outright mental breakdown, suffering, graphic violence, psychosis, murder and everything in-between. Don't worry, it's never outright graphic, all the NSFW stuff is merely suggested/off-camera or only talked about (this is not hentai after all) but it's there enough to make it VERY clear what just took place.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first few episodes, the anime takes all the drugs from the trunk, all the uppers, downers, screamers and laughers and it won't stop in Bat Country. It gets realer than real, it becomes a story that you might see on the evening news or read in the paper. After the last episode, I could've imagined what the news anchor would say about what happened, word for word. It's creepy! Not only that, but the reality seeps in through my own (and I imagine many people's) personal experiences. For example your very first incredibly awkward attempts at \"love\", physical intimacy, kissing, groping and even sex. How the inexperienced, hormone-filled minds try to rationalize everything and try to tackle very real emotions. How easy it is to go overboard when you don't know the boundaries yet, and how easy it is to just lose control and just catapult your brain to space, especially the last few episodes. The characters themselves are but hollow shells, they don't really have distinct personalities. But what they have is the uncanny ability to serve as a vessel for the viewer and their own personal experiences, like I mentioned. Like Itou, the high-school boy. We get to see inside his head based on his actions and dialogue. I mean I'm a young man (close to 30), but I still remember how I was back then, we all had dirty thoughts and I imagine many would've done the exact same thing Itou did in the series. Maybe not go as far as him, but given the opportunity, I think many would've jumped at the chance to do some of the things he got to do. [SPOILER] I mean what standup high-school boy didn't dream of banging all the girls in the school, LOL! [/SPOILER] But it's not only teen angst and suppressed urges, it's the rest of emotional scale too, ranging all the way to the inexperience resulting in insecurities and indecisiveness of dealing with your first relationship, the good and the bad of the learning experience. I can't speak for the female viewers of the anime, but I imagine the creators captured at least a good number of the thoughts, desires, insecurities and fears that really goes on in the heads of high-schoolers.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a downright insult to call School Days \"dark\", it's way beyond that, It's like waking up from a nightmare to the smell and warmth of your house burning down around you. It's something, that not many people will walk away from unscathed.\\n\\n\r\n[END OF SPOILERS]\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure School Days was concocted up as a sort of genre experiment. A sort of anti-romcom, that may or may not have actual artistic merit to it, it all depends on the viewer. One thing is for certain, however, that there is intent and effort behind all this. A sort of method to the madness. School Days is not just some random psycho's idea of a sick joke that he made in Paint on a lazy afternoon. There is real work, artistic credit and real production value put into this anime, by not just one, but many people. Someone wrote this, someone directed it and someone animated it. What I'm saying is, School Days is not an accident, it's been intentionally made to be what it is. And if you can look behind the shock value and the pretty obvious stream of \"in your face\" innuendos, there are some very real and very hard questions and societal critique buried in there. And also, there is the WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, why are you still watching this, are you mad,  seriously it only gets worse and more mental the more you watch it, why are you doing this yourself *cries*\\n\\n\r\nIn my experience, the only way to \"enjoy\" watching School Days, is to not take it seriously. Channel your inner cynic and go all the way, draw every last drop of sadistic pleasure from it. Disconnect yourself from the story, and watch it as a very badly made drama/dark comedy, and you might get a few laughs out of it. Because if you let yourself get immersed in the story and you get emotionally invested, you WILL get wrecked. School Days doesn't pull any punches, in fact, it lays into them with incredible force. It wants to hurt you, and knows exactly how to do it. The one person I inflicted School Days upon, got reduced to a sobbing mess by the end, with a thousand yard stare, whispering to me \"Why? What did I ever do to you?\"...\\n\\n\r\nSo, in closing, School Days is a landmine for the fragile-hearted romcom watching crowd. If you look at it like that, it's a brilliant anime. It's exceptionally unassuming, draws you in and then blows your soul sky high, you won't even know what hit you. If you are cynical enough and/or have no soul, you might even find it weirdly entertaining. There are morals and the asking of hard questions, and some profound meaning in there also, if you are into that sort of thing. Other than that, School Days is the perfect weapon to troll your light-hearted anime watching friends, but do take care in choosing your target, because this landmine is definitely not a dud.",

It basically makes every wrong decision for you. Taking the worst possible route. School Days is largely misunderstood and I think it is a good example of something that was taken the wrong way. Anyway, that was my 2 cents. Do with it which you will. I know this review is short, but I'm pretty sure everyone and their mothers have already heard of this anime by now.",

            "content": "So, before you even consider watching this I'll like to say a few things. \r\n1. After about episode 3 this becomes a very frustrating show.\r\n2. This is more of a Psychological, Slice of Life, Drama than a Romance. You are almost forced into disliking the main character.\r\n    2(a). With this in mind, if you want to watch a show along these lines, but don't want to be frustrated at it I recommend watching Clannad or maybe Angel Beats instead.\r\n3. This show portrays almost the most extreme outcome from this sort of situation created, because of this it is very easy to predict.\r\nNowwith all of that in mind, this show was very well written. I don't want to say much about the characters, because I believe you should go into this show without any precognition. The story is excellent, but as I said it shows an extreme outcome, and for me that kind of took away from it otherwise it would probably be an 8. It is based around the main character, and 3 \"main\" girls (one of which is not really as prominent). Throughout the show the ever changing relationships of nearly ALL the characters are shown, as well as the repercussions of their actions. With that in mind the character development was good, you get some scenes of individual characters showing their inner thoughts as well as how they are changing. I gave it a 7 on enjoyment, merely because of the end. Otherwise it was like pulling nails off, it was almost painful to watch them blunder about not learning from their mistakes or the mistakes of others. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend it if you think you can sit through 9 episodes that are hard to watch (Only 9 because the first 3 aren't too bad). As I said before, if you want something of this genre but don't want to \"suffer\" for the ending I recommend watching Clannad (or something from this writer in general) instead. As I mentioned before, I don't want to comment too much on the actual story line or characters because you may form different opinions than if you have ideas about the show from before hand.",

            "content": "Hmm... well I have to say that it was somewhat painful for me to watch this anime. The reason for this is because I kept feeling a huge urge to reach in my computer and try to slap some sense into some of the characters. (WAAH!! Its a drama!)\r\nStory:\r\nI don't really know the definition of harem but if that's code for drama then I would have to agree. This show takes off pretty quickly on what I thought what would be a boy meets girl and they have 12 episodes to get together kind of thing. Instead it turns into what could possibly be ananimated soap opera that includes the whole package of romance, making out, and betrayal. I usually am not one for the whole drama and stuff but School Days did a good job in pulling me into the developing story that never stopped being exciting. Then after a few episodes I started to wonder whether or not they changed the writers, because past midway into the show it took an interesting turn. Sure it was a big change turning this innocent love triangle into what might be better defined as a hexagon but, it definitely made it fun to watch (made me laugh =P). Also concerning the ending I would say even if you don't like School Days from the start don't give up to easily, seeing as its only 12 eps long and has a interesting way of ending a good show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about animation, but I was kind of confused at some scenes where I saw little mistakes like a character missing a pinky. Also sometimes there were other little things like not bothering to draw in the extras or when a character would be far away they were more lazily drawn. Besides the characters the background itself was pretty a constant theme based around school. Animation was nothing special but still nothing bad...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe theme songs seemed to set up the show in a deceiving way by making it look all innocent like. If they were to get a more Higurashi like theme song it would make more sense, but they fitted to be what they were tagged: Harem. As for voices and background music, well the voices were all good and matched up with the personalities of the characters and all. For background music, the weird thing is I don't remember hearing any BGM, but that only means it wasn't special or horrible enough to remember.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat do you get when you find pair up a clueless sex-driven retard and a bunch of horny girls? School Days! Really though, the characters in this show were a little unrealistic on some standards. The one thing I don't like about the main character was that he was stupid and only cared for sex. I didn't mind the actions as much as what was backing up the act. As for the other two main characters one I felt constant pity towards while the other I thought just made the story more interesting. Now the rest of the supporting characters is where things start to get ridiculous. I kept thinking if schools were really like that then the population would double in a year.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI found this show very enjoyable to watch and thought it succeeded in making a sad and crazy anime. If your not into drama then I would strongly suggest watching something else because that's basically what this show is made of. If you like a show that doesn't hold back and gets really FUBAR at some points then this might be close. I thought it was a good show and would suggest watching it, so yeah...",

            "content": "When it comes to the Slice of Life genre nowadays, it really isn't a surprise to see Romance/Drama genre tags placed on the shows. Its not like I have an issue with these shows, but it just feels like most of them are shallow romances, or they don't end up being romantic in the slightest. Being adapted from an Adult Visual Novel (oh boy), School Days is a wonderful example on how you can seriously fuck over your anime in more ways than one (no pun intended).\r\nThe story of School Days is very simple. Guy A likes Girl A. Unfortunately, Guy A is too scaredto confess to Girl A. Girl B, however, finds out about Guy A's feelings towards Girl A and decides to help them out. After successfully getting them together, Girl B decides that its a great idea to slowly confess her love to Guy A. Anyone with a brain will know that at this point, the roof, and maybe even the house at that, will just start coming down.\\n\\n\r\nOur Guy A in this situation is Makoto Itou, a quiet guy who is usually by himself listening to his music. Like most other Harem (yes, its a Harem) protagonists, he doesn't possess any qualities of a character whatsoever. He notices Girl A, who is Kotonoha Katsura, on the train to school that they both ride. Kotonoha is also usually quiet and is seen reading most of the time on the train. Finally, our Girl B is Saionji Sekai, the more energetic, outgoing girl in this show. Not too much to say about her, other than the fact that she really turns the tide of everything quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, you noticed this as well? There have already been countless anime with these characters!\\n\\n\r\nMakoto Itou really has nothing going for him. I don't understand what these two girls (not just them though) truly see in Makoto. Its probably that overused \"He's so nice.\" statement that I'll never understand no matter how many times it gets thrown around. Kotonoha is dropped pretty early in the series and doesn't have much impact to School Days, other than the \"quality fanservice\" she brings. Sekai is also in the same ballpark, but she doesn't get dropped entirely.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story of School Days, its as atrocious as our characters. If you want the progression of the story in a nutshell, it goes from a Love Triangle to a Love Octagon, but calling it love at that point is laughable. School Days drops the Romance portion and creates more of an Ecchi environment for the people who enjoy that kind of stuff. The supporting characters are all forgettable and don't really do anything to influence this series in anyway, other than the- yeah, you guessed it, fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about School Days is the last two episodes. Episodes eleven and twelve really pack a lot of punch and shock factor, but it really felt like School Days only lived off of those last two episodes alone. They were really enjoyable to watch though, but still doesn't make School Days worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are average at best. Nothing that'll really stand out to you. The music played throughout the series is also very forgettable. The art is also average and not something worth mentioning much. The seiyuus fit the characters, which you could say is also a plus if you're into that.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much else to say at this point. If I had to put it in short, School Days is like driving through a city one day and having the scenery completely changed the very next day. If, for some reason, you're interested in seeing this anime, I would tell you to just read a summary of the first ten episodes and just finish off the last two, since that's all that is all School Days really has to offer you.\\n\\n\r\nTo all producers in the future, if you plan on making a romance anime, don't turn it into anything like this.",

            "content": "When I started watching School Days, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I saw the reviews, and it didn't exactly have promising reviews and reception. I watched the first episode, and didn't think much. Wasn't anything to dislike or like. Then, as I started watching the next episodes, and seeing the characters and situation reveal themselves, I was hooked. The main character starts off as a simple, standard, and pretty relatable character. Seeing him turn into a despicable, terrible person, while hurting those around him isn't 'enjoyable', but it's interesting indeed. Then comes the ending, which I won't dare spoil. However, it's probably the mostshocking ending I've seen in anime in a while. The show is disturbing, interesting, gripping, frustrating, and, quite simply, very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything to write home about, but like many anime I've seen, the quality comes from, well, everything else. The characters are very well done. They're realistic, and to an extent, relatable. Their interactions and decisions under the given circumstances are interesting to see. You genuinely feel bad for the characters, and you will feel some relief with what happens to the main character. The animations aren't over the top, and it looks quite nice. The visuals really add to the emotions and mood of the show. On top of the near perfect characters, the soundtrack is among the best I've heard. I listen to it all the time. Saying it's my favorite ost, overall, isn't an exaggeration.",

Main character doesn't realise that he's breaking heart of every girl, but seems like totally ignoring it and continuing his promiscuity. So it's here for us to see what it's like for both sides and what could possibly happen.\r\nStory (7): Itou Makoto seems like innocent student with casual everyday life, until he finds out about pretty girl Katsura Kotonoha, who is travelling by a same train as he does. At the school, he's set next to Saionji Sekai, who actuallystarts to help him with his relationship life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): I somehow enjoyed this anime a lot. I don't think that it's been too short though it only has 12 episodes. Truth is, I watched this in one day (more correctly - within first 20 hours). So I think most of you guys would just say that you only need 5 hours to watch whole anime, just like me. :)\\n\\n\r\nTip: NEVER EVER try to see any spoilers for ending. It's something, that you have to see on your own. No matter what, do not try to find out about an ending. Trust me.",

Honestly, I'm not really the critic type, but this anime was just so bad...\r\nStory (2): The plot is very poor and from the first episode you see how bad the anime really is. The story just gets worse and worse by every episode, especially in the ending. Speaking of the ending, I want to say that it was very disappointing and weird. The story just made a huge twist of events making it even worse. It had it's funny moments, but veryrarely seen. SPOILER (I just have to say it, if you don't want to get spoiled, read the next section) I just disliked how the author decided to make the protagonist have sexual relations with almost every girl seen in the anime. It was just so... NO!\\n\r\nArt (2): I guess the artists didn't spend much time on the art. When I began watching the series I knew what I was getting into, but I thought that the story may be bad, but the art had to be good. I began watching the first episode and I lost my hope.\\n\r\nSound (4): This is the only aspect of the anime that I enjoyed. It's the only ,, Ok\" thing about the Japanese cartoon. The opening and the ending just raise your moral a little bit about the episode you are about to see or just finished watching.\\n\r\nCharacter (1): I don't really want to say much about this because is the worst aspect of the anime. Just a little spoiler... The protagonist is one of the dumbest characters known to the anime history.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1): I only watched this anime to see why everyone hates it, and after I finished it I felt like I had to throw up because of how bad it is.\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'll give it a 2/10. Please spare yourself from this nightmare and don't watch it.\\n\\n\r\nWait a minute! Some people claimed that I didn't understand the concept, or say that is anime is a masterpiece. What the-...? So because of that, here is a continued version of the ,, Story\" section. Note that this will include major spoilers. If you don't want to get spoiled, just read another review. Here we go...\\n\r\nFrom the first episodes you would think that nothing can go wrong, wouldn't you? Well I'm going to get into details for episode1 and episode 12. So the episode starts with Makoto Itou just taking the train to school, like any other Japanese student, but he spot a girl reading a book. That's something new... Sorry, back to the story! So in his school, there is a popular charm among the students. The charm is that if you take a picture of the person you love and nobody finds out about it for three weeks, you will be together with him/her. Makoto decides to try it out and takes a picture of the girl, named Katsura Kotonoha. The train arrives at the destination and he goes to school. There, the protagonist thinks that the charm won't do anything, so he wanted to delete the photograph, but gets interrupted by his classmate, another girl. She finds out about what Itou did and decides to help him. She becomes friends with his crush and makes the girl that he is in love with to meet him at the train station. The male student goes there after school, but instead of finding Katsura, he finds Saionji Sekai, the girl that was helping him. She kisses Makoto and leaves by train. The two talk on the phone at night and the protagonist says the he will confess to Kotonoha the next day. And that's the first episode, kids! Fourteen lines? Well anyway. The characters will go through a love triangle, that will result in Makoto having sex with all of the girls in the show and Sekai and Kotonoha driving crazy. Sekai lies that she was pregnant, and Makoto leaves her for Kotonoha. At that point, Sekai decides to kill Makoto by stabbing him in the stomach. Kotonoha finds him dead and cuts his head off. Like any other loving and caring girlfriend. She puts the head inside a bag and meets up with Sekai on a rooftop of a building and shows her the new and improved Makoto Itou. Katsura pulls out a knife and stabs Saionji  in the uterus and finds out that she had no fetus there. The ending shows us Kotonoha Katsura on a boat, in the middle of the ocean, hugging Makoto's head. What the fuck??\\n\r\nSo let me say it again. The plot sucks, especially the ending. Why did the creators decide to make Makoto have sex with everyone, then get killed by the girl he almost made pregnant. AND in conclusion, School Days deserves a worse rating. Just don't watch it, and I hope I cleared things out with the School Days fans...",

            "content": "Well, we come to my  analysis of School Days TV.\r\nThe first episode, I must say I really liked to watch.\r\nAlthough it took quite a mild depressive atmosphere of the room, as Makoto's sweetheart simply can not find words - but was manageable.\r\nQuality animation, character design, but also very well done.\r\nThe only thing that has pleased me no end of Ep01, were the hair colors, since most black hair in anime for me pays a somewhat oppressive atmosphere, but good.\r\nA few more episodes turns out to be a bastard Makoto and the people around him as the idiots who do not can add up 1+1.\\n\r\nStorywise times must indeed be.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do not see the cake in front of him, although he is illuminated by a spotlight as baka = idiot.\\n\r\nMy hate against the evaluate Mr. Playboy aka Makoto Itoh, and as against all other characters brought me to be dawning for the first time in Ep 02 et  Ep04.\\n\\n\r\nA few months later I thought to myself, ' well, I look  the rest' - which lead me to a swimming pool sequence and the second break in the series.\\n\r\nI do not want to force me as a lot of garbage  into the brain, so I've seen the series, but I've yet seen to the end.\\n\\n\r\nMy head keeps a lot of stupidity, but Sekai and the Kotonoha, together we can compare with a toast.\\n\r\nWith characters like Lala ToLoveRu or Rosario TheVampire of a low IQ does not bother me anything, but when it comes to serious issues, the characters are but please do not run against any wall and it will be increasingly depressed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEp 12 has destroyed my brain on the window viewing.\\n\r\nSchool Days TV I have endured to the end.\\n\r\nThe series drifts starting from Episode 1 is illogical, of course.\\n\r\nIt's not as if we can not exchange phone numbers - Makoto can indeed good but Sekai and Kotonoha are totally incapable of doing.\\n\r\nIf they had ONE TIME the damn number and they'd exchanged \\n\r\nMakoto seems like wanted to want to be hated by the audience - the developers have done to me - such an exaggerated, unrealistical-selfish character I've never encountered.\\n\r\nKotonoha for their incredible stupidity, cowardice and selfishness.\\n\r\nSekai for their stupidity and beyond the fact that it totally before the world closes its eyes - it almost seems as if her mind is full of hot air.\\n\r\nThe 'Lady' the birds towards the end of the series with Makoto say - without much - excessive, unrealistic, absurd.\\n\\n\r\nMy first  biggest shock to me what was missing was the epilogue after the ep 12, though the main character was dead, he has been talking as if he had made it, as if he has learned to know the person Kotonoha  and scored at the end\\n\\n\r\nMy second biggest shock to me  as I have read about the game and looked at the Endings, and had to see the surprise ending  two lovers, although it was unrealistic, the series would end this way but no, the main character needs to do exactly the opposite. Something good has the series, it's masterpiece in genre, many have rated it better than me because they liked it,\\n\\n\r\nI am sorry that I reviewed the show so bad, but I must still cope with what was happening there.",

            "content": "School Days is your A-typical bad Harem series.  One guy, lots of pretty girls, and a lot of pointless fanservice.  I guess it's to be expected from an H-Game to have some fanservice.   SD is just as trashy as harems get, Girls Bravo or Shuffle are others that come to mind, and yeah even Elfen Lied.   \r\nI started this series simply because I had read about it somewhere, and frankly I was expecting a lot more.  Something to the quality of a show like Air from Kyoto Animation.  But no, School Days is a long winded andvery dull series that pulls a 180 on you at the last minute.   Basically the first part is your typical high-school romance, then the second part is the main character sleeping around with every girl he can find, and then finally he gets  stabbed to death by one of the girls he knocked up.  That is all there is to School Days, a three act shallow chronicle of a guy who can't keep his hormons in check.   \\n\\n\r\nThe creators certianly don't mind if you hate the guy for being an ass considering what happens in the end, which can be good for an ending like School Days.  The one character you feel for is the girl he supposedly fell in love with to begin with, and when she goes a little crazy after she finds he's cheating on him.  It's not entirely unrealistic to say a girl would act like that at all.  What is incredibly unrealistic is the fact it seems EVERY girl in the school loves him.  It's like a bad Mary-Sue filled fanfic.  Ironically the series writer is named Makoto as well as the main male character.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is dull and unexpressed and occasionally can reach interesting in it's songs.  Most of the songs and the themes are rather forgettable and don't really set the mood right.  The only exception is the one played in episode 12, the only decent song.   \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that kept me going through this long and very boring series was the fact that I knew people were going to die.  It's sad it took 12 episodes to finally do something.  Even the idea of the infidelity was made boring in this series.  There was barley any tension of if this main idiot will be caught cheating on his girlfriend or not.  Half the time it dissolved into minor characters who come and leave just like that.  I would even contest Higurashi is more interesting than this series, it was a long melodrama with little tension, little suspense.  What was good about it?  Simply enough the art.  Though of course you had to give the small crazy one huge knockers which is as unrealistic as anything else in this series.\\n\\n\r\nTwo things redeemed this series, the ending and most of the art and animation.  Other than that School Days is exceptionally boring.  I will watch Kare Kano, and Higurashi before I ever watch this again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "We've all have known some tragic romance stories like \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Jane Eyre\" (although the later happens to a bit happier).  School Days is a harem anime based on a visual novel that have a lot of angst and an infamous and controversial brutal tragic ending.  I would need to say about the \"brutal\" part, the ending so brutal that it is even censored at Crunchyroll (and even when you have an account when you watch the last episode).\r\nNow for the storyline, I personally enjoyed it due to a good mix of tragedy, comedy, and angst.  Like most harem orromance anime based out of visual novels, the series starts out comedic and light-hearted, but after a while, the story gets more dramatic and explores into more darker and serious themes (and in the case of School Days, it gets WAY darker to the point that the OP used in the series is highly ironic in the later episodes).  The story takes into the perspective of a high school student named Makoto Itou, who come across a young, beautiful, and cute girl named Kotonoha Katsura in the train station.  Makoto, when he first saw Kotonoha, was too shy to approach her, but he have feelings with Kotonoha.  When he heard about an urban legend about having a wallpaper of a person he admires in his cellphone and keep it without anyone noticing, he would end up with the person.  However, his classmate that he sits next to, Sekai Saionji, noticed this and thought that Makoto have a crush with Kotonoha.  Sekai then served as a \"matchmaker\"  and helped establish the relationship between Makoto and Kotonoha.  When Makoto asked Sekai what she can do to thank her, Sekai takes the first kiss.  From that point on, Makoto established more feelings towards Sekai, a love triangle is established, and there is a lot of angst, misunderstandings of each other, betrayal, and a LOT of sex (though not overly graphic).\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days takes a different approach on the concept of harem.  We've all seem harem anime as like a dream come true for a young man.  However, School Days takes the reality of the harem concept and looks into what society reality thinks about a man getting into love relationships with multiple women.  In real life, the man's lover would probably be angry of her lover getting into relationships with other women.  In our current society, it is totally unacceptable for a man to get involve in multiple relationships.  Heck, even societies where polygamy is tolerated (or once tolerated) like Mormon and Islamic societies, they have strict standards about a man getting into relationships with multiple women and would probably find Makoto's womanizing and perverted behavior to be unacceptable.  School Days is basically the harem concept in the real world, and this is something that makes School Days a more enjoyable harem anime than Shuffle!.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters, I would need to put a slightly lower score here, because almost every single character had pretty much did some really stupid and idiotic moves.  I could best say that every character happens to be an idiot.  However, I wouldn't say that ALL the characters are complete morons or idiots, as there are some characters that I do feel sympathy to due to the hardships that endure.  For instance, I mostly feel pity towards Kotonoha for being ignored by Makoto over Sekai, and the fact that she is constantly bullied and teased by Otome and her friends.  But at the same time, I really see her as an idiot for not fully realizing what kind of a complete monster Makoto is and her total obsession with him throughout the series (and still constantly thinks Makoto still loves her in heart).  Not to mention what she did at the ending makes me want to puke at her at the same time what to hug her. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest idiot in the series happens to be Makoto Itou.  Now, when it comes the characters of harem anime, there are a lot of shipping wars between characters among fans and who is best for the man in the series (like what many people would do in the Shuffle! fanbase).  However, it is generally agreed upon all the fans that Makoto should not be paired with [I]anybody[/I].  In fact, he is the most hated character in the series (and even I hate his guts to the point that I was happy when he came to his tragic end).  And those who ship Makoto is completely missing the point.  And I can understand this from many fans.  For his behavior, Makoto didn't fully commit himself to one relationship.  He only cared about his sexual desires and when Kotonoha didn't fit his desires, he turned to Sekai to fullfill his desire.  He doesn't completely love his girlfriends, and he only cared about his own sexual desires, which is why he caught in the web of relationships later in the series.  He has no redeeming qualities that I felt that he deserves to be burned in hell for his actions.  On the flip side, he is, for some reason, establish some sort of Internet meme where he is refereed as \"MANkoto\" within Imageboards where his head is photoshopped into muscular and half-naked bodies.  Needless to say, while I personally find the meme to be really funny, I don't find Makoto's actions to be really \"manly\" at all.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a dub fan, this is one of the many series where I watched subbed-only because subbed is only option available online.  And it is one of the many sub-only series I've enjoyed (others being To Aru Majutsu no Index and Sketchbook ~full Color'S~).  The series is available at Crunchyroll legally and free to watch.  If you are looking for a harem anime with a lot of drama and angst with a slight comedy in it, this is something I would recommend.",

            "content": "[WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR SCHOOL DAYS, SILENT HILL 2, AND DEATH NOTE]\r\nTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not sure how good School Days actually is from an objective standpoint. After all, my rating for it is based partially on the fact that 70% of the people who watched it here didn\u2019t understand it, and partially on its willingness to take a narrative risk that alienated the majority of its audience. Those aren\u2019t the only reasons it got an 8, but context is important when I judge the value of something. The context of School Days is that it\u2019s a slice of life showthat is infinitely more mature and complex than its most common recommendation Higurashi (why is Higurashi the most recommended show on MAL to people who liked School Days???), it took more risks and a bolder approach than most people give it credit for, its plot structure is extremely polarizing to the point where its reputation among anime fans is one of the worst of any show I\u2019ve watched, and it exposes a lack of maturity among anime fans that I point to as another reason why anime is seen as a niche artistic medium rather than a widely respected medium like film or music.\\n\\n\r\nSome personal background information: I have been cheated on. And people who have been cheated on, who have cheated on someone, or who are thinking about cheating on their partner are the target audience for this show. That seems to be something that most of the people who reviewed this show previously don\u2019t seem to get. This isn\u2019t a show to make the casual anime viewer feel nice about themselves and then they move on. It has several purposes depending on who is watching it.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who have been cheated on, it\u2019s a lovely dose of catharsis. It might open a few wounds that you\u2019d prefer stay shut, but the ending is delightful if you\u2019ve felt the same pain Katsura did. If you have cheated on someone, this show will make you feel like a piece of shit. If it doesn\u2019t, what happens to Itou represents what the person you cheated on wished would happen to you. Yeah. If you\u2019re thinking about cheating on someone, this show is a pretty strong argument against doing so. If you have any shred of emotional maturity or empathy, this should convince you to talk to your partner instead of being a selfish coward.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ (CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR DEATH NOTE)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the casual anime fan, watching this is something a challenge from the writers. It challenges you to step outside of your emotional comfort zone and see the main character as a selfish asshole, but also a flawed person. Itou is very young and has never had a girlfriend before. Most of his actions can be written off by the fact that this is his first relationship, but at the same time none of them should be. You see, School Days as a story would not work at all if the characters were any younger or any older. If Katsura was any older, it would be fair to criticize Katsura for letting it go on for as long as she does. If Itou was younger, the sexual aspect of the show probably wouldn\u2019t land and he\u2019d be too inexperienced with girls to even approach them. He already is worthless around girls at the start, but it\u2019s right at that age where he would start to develop. If he was any older, absolutely none of his actions could be argued were a result of emotional immaturity. Anyone who\u2019s been in at least one relationship before should know better than to do anything Itou does to Katsura and Sekai. What he does seems mean-spirited but given his age and inexperience with relationships; these acts of selfishness, cowardice, and insensitivity are par for the course for most guys in their first relationships. It takes practice and experience to be good at anything, and love is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nItou makes mistakes, but at the same time those mistakes SHOULD be seen as terrible things to do to another person. It\u2019s a case of a human being human, as well as being in a way a victim of Sekai\u2019s own selfishness and cowardice.\\n\\n\r\nItou is the \u201cvillain\u201d of School Days. He is the main character, but undeniably the villain. It\u2019s structured the same way Death Note is. Light was the main character of Death Note, but the villain as well. L was basically the protagonist, but the story isn\u2019t told from his perspective because Light\u2019s perspective is more compelling and the theming of the show is centered around Light\u2019s corruption. The same is true of School Days. For all purposes, Katsura is basically the protagonist of School Days. She\u2019s the most likeable character and one of the few that didn\u2019t really do much of anything wrong. Itou is NOT supposed to be the usual, likeable slice of life protagonist. You are NOT supposed to like him. He\u2019s the villain! School Days is told from his perspective because it wants to focus on his corruption and transformation from a shy, na\u00efve boy into a selfish, manipulative asshole. The Death Note corrupts Light. Sex corrupts Itou. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Story~ (CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR DEATH NOTE AND BIG SPOILERS (!!!) FOR SILENT HILL 2)\\n\\n\r\nConsidering everyone hates Itou so much, that would imply the message of the show hit its viewers hard. The problem is, few viewers seemed to recognize that it worked or even that it was intentional. They hated Itou the male protagonist and therefore concluded that the show was garbage because they didn\u2019t like a character or what he does. This is the challenge I was referring to earlier that\u2019s presented to the audience. Can you step outside of your little bubble and embrace the message of a show that is designed to make you feel angry? Are you mature enough to see a character as a human even when they do things you don\u2019t agree with? The subversion that School Days pulls over the viewer is based on this. Itou is presented as the bland, typical slice of life male protagonist that\u2019s dull, likeable, and relatable and doesn\u2019t do anything controversial that would alienate the show\u2019s audience. This is setup in the first episode where Itou is a shy, bumbling idiot around girls like most other slice of life shows do. But over the course of the show, Itou is gradually corrupted into an asshole that uses people and only thinks of himself.\\n\\n\r\nJust because a character does not do what you would do or does something stupid or mean or impulsive, does not mean they are a bad character. The generic male slice of life protagonist might train your brain to think that all protagonists should be relatable and not do anything bad or disagreeable, but this is not true. Light Yagami is a great example. Light is a terrible person who murders people based on his own na\u00efve sense of justice because he was given a power he was not mature enough to handle responsibly. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the artistic approaches are totally different. Death Note is very tongue-in-cheek. The cat-and-mouse game between Light and L is absolutely ridiculous and covers a lot of the dumber aspects of the plot by being silly and not taking it seriously. If it took itself seriously, the show probably wouldn\u2019t be nearly as popular. School Days is mostly serious. For the most part it\u2019s pure drama, with little sprinklings of slice-of-life hijinks. If it took itself less seriously and went for entertaining, would it be as popular as Death Note? Would people be willing to overlook Itou\u2019s misdeeds if he paraded around like a goofball and wasn\u2019t just an immature asshole? Definitely. There\u2019s not much to latch onto within Itou\u2019s personality that makes him likable despite his shitty actions. Light had a lot of other aspects to him that made him engaging and fun even though he was a terrible person.\\n\\n\r\nA better comparison might be Silent Hill 2. (Here\u2019s your spoiler warning, this spoils the entire game) The protagonist of Silent Hill 2 is James Sunderland, a man who killed his wife. However, the game does not construct itself around convincing you James is a monster. It presents James as a person; a flawed person that did something horrible for a combination of good and bad reasons. It presents what dumber games would tell you is just a murderer, as a human being. That distinction is why Silent Hill 2 is considered one of the best games ever made. Its story and characters are dark, fucked up, flawed, controversial, and above all: human. It\u2019s a remarkably bold and refreshing artistic statement that you very rarely see in video games.\\n\\n\r\nAm I saying School Days is as good as Silent Hill 2? Hell no. Silent Hill 2 is a masterpiece and has few, if any flaws. But the approach to the \u201cprotagonist\u201d is the same: a flawed person that made questionable decisions. I\u2019ll always applaud pieces of art that try to do something bold, controversial, and different. I prefer a Logan or Watchmen over Black Panther, Infinity War, or Thor: Ragnarok. I\u2019ll take my Evangelion over Gundam or Fullmetal Panic. And I enjoy a Spec Ops: the Line or Metal Gear Solid 2 over a Call of Duty or Battlefield. Not to say that those shows I don\u2019t prefer don\u2019t have some value nor am I saying they aren\u2019t good. Just trying to lay my cards on the table and explain why I admire the artistic approach School Days takes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt rarely tries to be funny, which is wise for a show trying to make the audience feel anger. It's something that a lot of shows in the slice of life genre don't seem to get: tone. If you want your show to make people angry, don't throw light-hearted scenes in that break up the tone. If you want your show to be sad, don't ruin your best scenes with attempts at comedy (Hi, Your Lie in April!).\\n\\n\r\nCheating does a lot more damage than you think it does. You might think it will only hurt one person, but one slip-up can lead a person down a downward spiral that causes them to use people, not consider other people's feelings, misplace their priorities, and generally act like a total dirtbag. By episode 5 or 6, I already hated the main character; and I felt bad for Katsura because she fell for an emotionally immature idiot that isn't actually in love with her, but the idea of her.\\n\\n\r\nThe event that pushes the main plot into motion is a single act of cowardice by Sekai, and most of the more unfortunate events of the plot could have been avoided had Itou not been such a coward. Ultimately, Itou\u2019s fate is ultimately sealed by one final act of cowardice. He doesn\u2019t get better over the course of the show: he constantly gets worse. By the end of the show, both Katsura and Itou are completely different people. Katsura is a husk, too numb and emotionally devastated to even function. Itou is a full-on player, telling a girl he just slept with \"she's the only one.\" And that\u2019s the thesis of School Days on cheating: a single act of cowardice can ruin people\u2019s lives permanently. 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~Art/Animation~\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are lovely but the character designs are very bland. Most of the hair styles are fine but every now and then there's a character with one that's so stupid it distracts from what\u2019s happening.\\n\\n\r\nIt probably shouldn't be animated. Most of the animation is pretty bad and lacks detail. It would make for a much better movie, and having real actors in it would probably sell the emotions of the characters better and feel more realistic. 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~Sound/Music~\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say regarding the sound or music. Music was bland, and the sound design seemed fine. 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I\u2019d leave the enjoyment part of my review blank because, as I have explained in several reviews before this, grading something subjective like enjoyment using an objective grading metric is a paradox. However, it comes into play here due to the audience it\u2019s intended for.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier in the review, I have been cheated on. Being cheated on absolutely breaks you. That's what you see from Katsura during the second half of the show. That is a woman torn apart by a man who doesn't give 2 squirts a piss about her. She has no idea why, and that's why it's hard to watch the scenes where she vacantly stares into the void while people are talking to her. I've been there. You wonder: what's wrong with me? Am I not attractive enough? Do I bore them? Is my personality weak? Does the person they cheated on me with have something I don't? There's an existential nightmare that bores its head when you're cheated on, and School Days nails that.\\n\\n\r\nSo naturally, my experience with School Days is different than most who watched it. From experience being in that situation, this show hits its marks quite well and I could understand and identify with most of the characters, while also reviling those same characters for their immaturity and selfish actions. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~Conclusion~\\n\\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t tell already, I thoroughly enjoyed School Days. A great deal of that enjoyment may come from the fact that it pissed off a bunch of neckbeards who don\u2019t like it when the male protagonist isn\u2019t a boring piece of cardboard, but I think it succeeded at doing what it set out to do and I admire its refusal to pander to its audience (for the most part).\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t have some gripes. The finale does feel like it was meant to be a dose of catharsis for those watching that have been cheated on. And while I appreciate that, it does feel misplaced. The finale is over-the-top like the ending of a thriller, but the rest of the series is mostly played straight, like a drama. The animation and art are rather crappy, and the first 4 episodes are pretty dry.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is good and deserves your attention. Try to look past the occasional misplaced attempt at comedy, crappy animation, and bland art style.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days gets an 8/10.\\n",

            "content": "I will start with saying that this won't feel like an 8/10 anime for everyone. It's depressing, dark, annoying at times. The plot goes over-the-top in last two episodes and the ending is definitely off-putting. You will hate many of the characters, especially the protagonist, who starts as a misguided teen, but ends up as a completely despicable person, selfish, uncaring and seeing woman as barely anything more than just sexual objects.\r\nWhat I disagree with, in reference to many other reviews, are the claims that this series is poorly written, cheap and all characters are negative/unlikeable. The show uses a bit of similar themes asElfen Lied, exploring the worst parts of human nature, this time in relation to sex, romance and high school environment. It shows negative consequences of peer pressure, bullying and, above anything else, not being able to handle emotions and understand each other in early relationships (here between inexperienced teens). \\n\\n\r\nWhile the protagonist simply disregards other people's feeling and act only according to his own whims, making him one of the most unlikeable leads out there, I find most of the female characters much more ambivalent and tragic. They take misguided decisions and often act against their own convictions, but mostly because they don't know how to handle their emotions and, unlike the protagonist, they actually feel guilty about it. Both Sekai and Kotonoha are above all victims, even if the former is definitely not without guilt herself. While one can say they act stupidly when it goes to their relations with the protagonist, they're basically kids and it's not that unbelievable at any point.\\n\\n\r\nI also see this anime as a sort of critique of harem fiction. It shows how protagonists engagement with multiple women destroys everyone involved, either psychologically or literally kills them. That's also how it often ends in real life, as behaviours portrayed here aren't completely taken out of nowhere. I find it cathartic after seeing so many kitsch plots where the main character can bang anything that moves without any consequences. Here we're shown how the weakness of character, disregard for other's feelings and inability to create real relationship have deep repercussions.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've said, it's easy to question giving this anime a positive rating. It goes over the top at the end and writers make some questionable decisions. But it also succeeds in what it tries to achieve - create a disturbing, dark story that will leave you scarred if you're not prepared for what's coming. It doesn't show any hope for the characters, doesn't force any kind of happy ending. But that also makes it honest in a way. Unlike some, I didn't find it cheap or exploitative, apart from a few isolated moments. I feel like everything I saw, at least up to a certain point, could happen for real, and while it might be horrible, there is some truth in it, one that is not that often shown in anime (and probably wasn't shown in any other series in this high quality). For that, I give it a full rating and recommendation, if you can stomach the pain of watching rather believable and in some cases likeable characters destroy themselves in a horrible fashion.\\n\\n\r\nAs I side note of sorts, I also think it worked really good as an advertisement for the visual novel - it shows the worst possible outcome and made me curious about what other paths the original game might offer. Navigating the maze of School Days HQ and seeing happy endings for Kotonoha and Sekai after experiencing the emotional despair of the anime is just that much more rewarding.",

            "content": "This review will have spoilers. You have been warned\r\nWell, that was fucking terrible. I\u2019ve never wanted to kill any anime character as much as Makoto. But we\u2019ll get to that. For now, let\u2019s review this fucking garbage. My god what a mess of a series on all accounts. First off, where was the budget in this? Who wrote this? Why did they take it in this direction? What the fuck?\r\nArt is a 4. Jesus, this show\u2019s animation does not age well. Some shots look sloppily drawn. A lot of still images over animation in a ton of scenes. The only times when the animation doesn\u2019tlook terrible is when there\u2019s tits shoved in your face and when someone is getting stabbed. The character designs are the most basic designs I\u2019ve ever seen\\n\\n\r\nSound is a 5. Most generic soundtrack ever produced. They really focused on quantity over quality this time around, because I\u2019m not joking when I say this soundtrack has 41 songs. Some songs I\u2019ve never heard in the anime, others that sound exactly alike. Does the animation look terrible because they spent their budget on the soundtrack with only 2 good songs? What the fuck? Most of the voice acting was terrible. There are like maybe 2 good performances and that was it.\\n\\n\r\nStory is a 3. God, what a fucking mess. None of the actions of the characters seem realistic. A lot of contrivances in the events that unfold. A lot of the problems in the story involve Makoto, but we'll get to that really soon. The plot is not structured really well. Most actions are caused from convenience or deception from characters. Overall, a gigantic mess of a story that only gets good at the ending. And the ending is the best part of the show, without question. Nice boat ;)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is a 1. Easily the worst part of the show are the characters. Kotonoha is the only character you can empathize with, because she had the terrible fate of being in this shitshow, and she gets treated like shit by everyone else. All of the characters are terrible human beings. They all lie, cheat, and deceive to get what they want. And that brings me to the worst anime character of all time, Makoto. God, this character is the fucking worst. Cheating on both of his girlfriends just to get his rocks off with anyone else. How am I supposed to root for this cunt? He breaks the hearts of many, but he just doesn\u2019t give a fuck. He ultimately is what\u2019s terrible about the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a 2. Pretty self explanatory. I wanted to blow my brains out every time I started a new episode. The only episode I enjoyed watching was the last one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3. I don\u2019t recommend this to anyone. If you feel like punching a hole in your TV, be my guest. But for me, fuck this show",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I cuss a lot in this review out of rage or something.\r\nI didn't know a show could make me feel this shitty. Honestly, just watch the last episode for the last few scenes(the final one actually being impressive) or search up the ending for school days, don't sit through this. You could watch Angel Beats -1 episodes through this time, or half of Stein's gate, or Your Name twice. Anything else you can do with your time that doesn't harm someone else is a better way to spend your time.\r\nNow time to say why it's bad. Atrocious story. It's an even dumber than normalharem male lead who goes around and fucks any girl in the school. There are two main girls, and each of them are very flat characters. The yandere is a remarkably boring yandere, and everyone else is plain as bricks. There was one(ONE!) character interaction which I found to be interesting, which was a dialogue between the two main girls(hint for those who've watched, stomach). After episode 3, this show just DRAAAAAAGGED on and on for no reason. They could have condensed this plot into 5 or 6 episodes tbh. And it flat out made me disgusted of humanity, it's a harem show that made me want to date LESS. I haven't even done any of the negative actions the male lead did, but god damn I feel like shit. That dude is a pathetic piece of shit excuse for a human and character in a story. God damn he's so spineless.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was based off a hentai game, and only picked up traction for the absurd ending. And then (some!) people call this story deep, it's really not. There was no good reason to milk this out into an anime, only for profit. Go play Doki Doki Literature Club or Yandere Stimulator instead, they do this sort of thing right.",

            "content": "First off, I have heard some people praise this show for being an accurate and dark take on school life. I only half agree with that since some of the decisions in this show seem stupid or just plain ridiculous and most of the characters in this show are too one-dimensional or too unrealistic. Now onto the review.\r\nOk first off, the Story (4):\r\nThis story is your typical harem story but with many dark twists to it. It begins with your typical love triangle between the main character, Makoto (a HUGE douche) and two other girls, Kotonoha and Sekai. Sekai gets Makoto and Kotonoha together butquickly develops feelings for him. As the story progresses, it gets more unlikely or unrealistic since people are (as I have said before) making stupid or ridiculous decisions. When Sekai said \"i'll give you practice.\" I was thinking '...wow...' First time I have ever heard of an offer like that. The story just keeps spiraling downwards and downwards. It was quite dull most of the time until one of those dodgy decisions pops up, then it returns to being dull again. I have to give it some points for SOME realism and its dark feeling but not much. So as I have said, I didn't particularly like the story which is one of the main reasons I came into this, other reason including the ending. I have to say, the ending was quite satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5):\\n\r\nThe art was pretty meh, nothing I haven't seen before. The animation didn't really have any parts to shine in. Not much else to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5):\\n\r\nMost of the music including the opening and ending themes were quite forgettable. They did fit the anime well but they were nothing impressive. The only piece I quite liked was the dark, piano piece that played at the end of some of the episodes when something dark or bad was happening. This was one of the few things that compelled me to watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2):\\n\r\nFirst of all, Makoto. One of the most universally hated characters in the history of anime simply because he is a huge douche to not only his girlfriend but many other girls as well. You have to give him credit though, I have no idea how he managed to get with so many different girls. I'm not sure what any of them found appealing in him but none the less, he is somehow appealing to them. I actually hated Kotonoha more than Makoto (only by a bit) because she did absolutely nothing after she found out certain bad things about Makoto. Other than that, she was quite meh until the ending. Sekai just annoyed me. Not entirely sure what parts of her character did. Any other characters that I thought had some decency just flushed that decency down the toilet. This is probably the weakest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4):\\n\r\nThere was some parts of the series that I did enjoy such as laughing at some of the situations some of the characters were in and the ending. But most of the time, this was overshadowed at my annoyance at how stupid some of the characters can be and (I cannot stress this enough) some of the decisions the characters made. There was a certain point where I just got sick of the repetitiveness of the decisions that the only reason I kept watching was for the ending. The only things I was remotely interested in was the initial love triangle and the ending (I have mentioned the ending a lot...). I eventually just cracked up out how insane and stupid some of the characters turned out to be. So it was relatively enjoyable at first but that died as the series progressed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4):\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the bad parts of the series outweigh many of the enjoyable/average parts that I found in this series.To sum it all up, I enjoyed the first part of the series because it was the most realistic and the ending because it was the most satisfying part of the anime. I didn't enjoy the repetitiveness of the stupid decisions and the unrealistic turn it had taken when it became a love square, pentagon or hexagon. None of this was helped by the mediocre sound and art. There is one thing I can take from this anime which is the most obvious point ever, don't cheat on your partner. Although, I highly doubt that if you do, it could lead to this. So yeah, I didn't really like School Days.",

I will devide this into 5 parts, Story, Art + Sound, Characters, Enjoyment and Overall.\r\nStory: There were basically 4 stories. The first one was in the first episode, it wasn\u00b4t so bad but it can\u00b4t be really considered a part of the anime, it was just the introduction to the series.\r\nThe second one lasted basically from the second episode to the eleventh. It was basically a REALLY bad hentai. Instead of watching this, you should watch Boku no Pico, it has better story and muchbetter philosophical message.\\n\r\nThe third one is some weird filler in the midle of the second storry, it\u00b4s located in pool and I would say that it\u00b4s a bit like a bad ecchi. It had one funny part.\\n\r\nThe fourth one was in the last episode. I don\u00b4t really know what to write about it, I just feal like it was bad. Maybe it\u00b4s not even because of the storry being bad, but the way it was presented, but basically I didn\u00b4t like it at all.\\n\r\nThe common thing to all of these storries is that there was no realism in it.\\n\r\nThe grades I would give to each of these stories on the 10 grades scale would these (in order) - 5 - 1 - 2 - 1\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound: Acording to my option, it wasn\u00b4t bad. Maybe I could even say it was good, but I don\u00b4t really care about these things very much so for me, it didn\u00b4t really matter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are basically three kinds of characters in this this anime. The first one is a \"Horny guy\". There are two of these. The second one is a \" Girl that loves the first \"Horny guy\"\". There are like SIX of them. The third one is a \"Girl that doesn\u00b4t love the first \"Horny guy\"\". And that\u00b4s all what there is to the characters. Really lame.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6 hours of watching, 10 seconds of a small grin on my face. That\u00b4s all what there is about the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Everything that matters was bad, which mens that the whole thing was bad as well.",

After finishing it I was depressed for an entire week (that has never happened to me in my life before). I feel like I was abused watching the show unravel as thing went from bad to worse and ending in such a ludicrous way. If you take my advice then stay clear of School days unless you want to feel all suicidal and emo for some reason.",

            "content": "-This is my first review so please bear with me-\r\nSchool Days is an anime which is based on a visual novel by 0verflow and is infamous for it's tragic endings. When I watched the ending of the anime, and I'm guessing a lot of people also did this, I laughed. Not a amused laugh, more like a crazy, evil laugh. That is how messed up the ending was.\r\nAnyway....on with the review.\r\nThe story is about a trio of friends, Makoto, Sekai and Kotonoha. Makoto appears to be a normal high school boy. He has a crush on the girl he rides the train to school withand one day decides to take a picture of her, believing in the &quot;Cellphone Charm&quot;, which states that if you take a picture of someone you like and nobody finds out, then you will be together with that person. Makoto's new seat mate, Sekai, see the picture and decides to help Makoto. She introduces him to Kotonoha, and continues to support him, but soon she starts to develop feelings towards Makoto as well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of this anime's biggest flaws is it's characters, and more specifically, Makoto. He is like poison in that he hurts everyone who gets involved with him and he, most of the time, doesn't even care. He is apparently popular with the females and I don't see a reason why. He's worthless, uncaring, perverted and other things. To quote some guy who commented on some site, &quot;Makoto just wants more sex.&quot; The two female leads are the only ones who make this anime worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was satisfying. In this anime, there is divine retribution. &quot;You reap what you sow&quot;. Throughout the series, you can see whats coming and it will eventually come. It is a disturbing ending, and does not seem to be the ending of an anime with the title &quot;School Days&quot;. The last part, however, creeped me out a bit.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, everyone gets what they deserve. It's KARMA. This anime really shows how relationships can mess up your mental state and that the heart is really fragile. School Days hides under the guise of innocence and eventually shows it's true nature. It is a very interesting anime in that I've never seen an anime like this, but be prepared when you watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Ohaiyou Gozaimasu! It's such a sunny day, perfect for an outing with your family and friends, perhaps have a decent picnic at the nearby park, and of course, row a little NICE BOAT on the lake while enjoying the radiance from the sun. \r\nLol. Anime is fucking serious business, you should know that, and not something for you to sit back and relax about. A lot of anime should really be treated with due solemn, and that, of course, includes THIS - the bloodiest, sexiest, most so-horrible-it's-awesome harem series. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome School Days.\r\nSTORY:\r\nHere's the recipe to make School Days: You start off withthe simple life of a perverted male high schooler. You add in a sexy bitch, with big boobs and an innocent mind and such, who became the official girlfriend of the high schooler. You add in a love rival, who pretends to be the love mentor of the high schooler, but instead enjoys sucking his d*** in the dark. Sprinkle some more bitches on top, throw in a complicated love-hate plot, wrapped with a bloody ending, let it simmer for thirteen episodes and you get School Days.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the gourmets have diverse opinions about the cuisine they tasted. For me, it's fresh, juicy and delicious. Fresh, because it has an original taste. Juicy, because the fanservice is too much to bear. And delicious... do I need to talk any more about that?\\n\\n\r\nPut into simpler words, School Days is a highly satisfying series for me. Not only because of the unexpected ending which granted a 'happy' conclusion for our protagonist(s) (which I enjoyed a lot), but also because the pacing is excellent. I'm not being sarcastic here. Indeed, the flow of the plot is good and you can literally feel yourself immersed in the harem world of our protagonists. Or should I say, antagonists?\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nNow here's where School Days suffered a lot. The character designs were actually good, but if you put them into animation, oops. Other than the infamous pool episode, the (sex) scenes and the ending, I could not see good effort put into the drawing by our beloved animators. The characters seemed... off at a lot of times. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nExcellent. The soundtrack blended with the mood of the show well, turning from a few whimsical melodies in the earlier episodes, to melancholic, sorrow tunes in the middle episodes; and in the end, the music became so sad that you will weep just by hearing the soundtrack alone. For the vocal songs part, we have a few memorable inserts, particularly \"Kioku no Umi\" (which I also enjoyed a lot), \"Namida no Riyuu\" (used in the turning point of the series - the raining scene), and of course \"Kanashimino Mukou e\" used in the final ending. The OP also deserved a special mention, although I did not enjoy it as much as the other songs.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nSince School Days is a deconstruction of the harem-high school genre, rather than saying that the characters received any form of development throughout the show, I would suggest that the characters received a lot of \"anti-development\" (yes, it's a new word I invented). Indeed, you can see Makoto turning from just a normal high schooler to a pervert who does nothing but having sex all day. Kotonoha turned from an innocent young woman to a love-craze. Sekai... Ughh. She was as bad as she was throughout the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I was particularly impressed about School Days is that it managed to give everyone a fair share of screentime. We see action from the main characters as well as the minor characters. The latter, especially, a few will get stuck in your head after you watched the show. For me, it's definitely Setsuna.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nSchool Days is an anime with a highly exciting setting and interesting development of the plot with a final twist that makes it unforgettable. In short, it's a good anime that I would recommend to my pals to watch, except for those whose hearts are weak of course.",

Honestly, I think the ending is what makes it most exciting.\r\nThe story is rather interesting, about cheating and how a simple affair can easily change someone's life completely. I'm sure everyone knows that the ending is a bit different from the rest of the series, but that is not a bad thing, not at all. If it hadan't ended the way it did, I would probably say right now that School Days was about a boy who liked to mess around with all the girls in his school, breakingtheir hearts. Boring. I'm honestly thankful for the gore ending that changed the dull atmosphere right away.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are ok. They carry a large variety of feelings and they are very very expressive. Each character is different in its own way so I can say that the anime includes all the types of classic anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nI rated School Days 9/10 because there were a few less interesting episodes, so I didn't actually get bored. I find it amazing to watch an anime about the every day life of some school students and don't get bored.",

            "content": "School Days is one of the most controversial anime of all time. Some hate it, and some love it. What's my opinion on this work? Well let's take a look at School Days.\r\nStory-9\r\nThe story of School Days is extremely interesting. Unlike most anime, it goes over problems that most wouldn't even dare to touch. But this is why many hate it. Unlike most harem anime, it does not focus on the happy parts of a relationship. School Days's uniqueness is what turns people away. Like most fans of this anime, I consider it a deconstruction of the harem genre.\r\nArt-6\r\nThis is School Days's worst aspect. TNKhave never been the best at animation. But, School Days didn't really need great animation. But certain scenes have a good bit of fluidity. The character designs are good, but hard to tell apart.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThe OST is AMAZING. My 3 favorite instruments are the piano, organ, and violin. I have the OST on my computer and listen to it quite a bit. But I have to give praise to the song Kanashi No Mukou He, which is one of my favorite songs. I can't judge the voice acting, because I don't personally speak Japanese. But it sounds nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nOur main character Makoto is probably the most hated anime character. While I didn't love Makoto, I found him to be a good protagonist. At least he has a personality.. And he also has remorse for all his actions. Kotonoha is the highlight of this anime. I feel really bad for her, and wish she had a better life. Sekai is also really good. While not as good as Kotonoha, she's still likable. There's also Setsuna. She is great with her conflict. I can't spoil it, but its also really emotional.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is ok. But the characters of Taisuke, Otome, and her clique are some of my least favorite anime characters. Otome is actually my least favorite anime character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nI really did enjoy School Days. Despite its short coming, its really good. So, my overall score is a 9/10",

Humans ARE selfish. Asides from that, if I ever consider doing what makoto was doing in the anime, I would not onlythink twice but thrice about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story was really good including art and character. The good thing about characters was they developed along the series as were the case with Makato who from being a good guy became a Jerk.

Makuto, Sekai and Kotonoha (Katsura). i feel that some things could have been left out to allow the end to come easier. like the three girls that come to Makutos' place (those whove seen it know who im talking about). they could have been for the most part left out of the story line and it still be fine. altough the less serious scenes were entertaining especially for the animes higher level of seriousness through most of it. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: i dont know much about art but even from the crappy quality that i watched this anime from i could tell that it was very well drawn. i have now seen it in high quality and this supports my oppinion. the characters were the exact type of drawing style i like. not too serious looking but not a full out chibi. not too unbelievable (example. a character is extremely skinny beyond human ability or fater than possible). nice art. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: now i based this on basically the last episode. because frankly without the final episode the sounds just kinda standard. also this is from the uncut ending not the one on TV. i wont spoil for those reading this looking for a new anime to watch but being able to every little metallic sound and every little water like sound in the end won me over. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: okay the characters.... in two word all the characters are messed up. everyone has a problem in the end ( some more than others lol).\\n\r\n Makuto our main character- ok most will say that Makuto is vial and dispicable. well i dont sorry. i fell that yes there are aspects that are vial or despicable but he himself is not. i just think he got confused by a certian girl *cough* Sekai *cough cough*. if this person had done one of two things maybe there might have been a different out come.\\n\r\nKatsura the love interest- truly probably my favorite character. i like the quiet shy type but is beautiful at the same time. the kind that makes you wonder what they do in there free time being quiet and well-in-dowed. anyway, i feel only slightly angry with Makuto because of what he did to her. but like i said not FULLY his fault.\\n\r\nSekai the \"friend\"- if no one else applies she is my least favorite character. the reason i hate her so is because she (in my opinion) screwed Makuto over. if she had just told Makuto her feelings in the first place instead of doing what she did he'd still be himself. or if she had stopped where she started. but no she never told him her true feelings and let him deteriorate and inevitably end the series. (stupid Sekai)\\n\r\nover all these characters are what make the series to me anyway. i gave it a 9/10 because of the conflicts they create (wouldve got a 10/10 if not for Sekai)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: this series is good for those of you wanting a different anime. and if you want a surprise ending. i enjoyed this anime from the start pretty much, but lie ive said its a bit slow at the start (after episode four it gets better believe me). also like ive said you either love or hate this anime 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: overall i would highly recommened this anime to all. unless you dont like school stories this is a great anime good story. good conflict. but the ending will make you freak. youll actually feel like you know some of the characters and be (like me) yelling at the screen telling them their idiots. even though you know full and well they cant hear you at all not to mention they arent real T.T\\n\\n\r\nwell for those wanting to know wether or not to watch this or not oi hope this has helped you deside. thanks for reading.",

As you are watching School days you may find that the story is dragging on, but the last episode is what makes this show.\r\nPLOT: It is going to be very hard to convey the plot to you without giving spoilers, but I will try my best.\r\nFirst off this is NOT a love story, though it may appear likeone, it is much more beautiful than that. It is the story that shows to us the true hidden nature, that we all will deny, of the male and female spirit. Guys being horny bastards why doesn't give shit about girls emotions, and girls being dormant psycho paths.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto, our main character, who I will refer to as Unlucky Lucky Bastard, or ULB for short. The story starts off with ULB starting off a new school year and riding on the same train as another main character Kotonoha, who I will be calling Psycho #1. ULB has a crush on Psycho #1 so his friend Sekai, or Psycho-slut, sets them up on a date. After that it terrible turn in fate ULB gets busy quickly unleashing the psychotic powers hidden within each of these girls by breaking their hearts.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly its really hard to explain this plot seriously because its just a typical heartbreak/love story, until episode 12 that is. You wont like this anime if you don't like love stories. I felt that it did drag on near the middle but I encourage you to power through because it is worth it in the end. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\r\nUnlucky Lucky Bastard is probably one of the most hated characters in anime history. I can understand why. He is a complete bastard who breaks every girls heart just to get laid 1 or 4 times a day but honestly guys he is just a typical horny high schooler. Girls can hate him because they don't want to think that normal guys would be like him in that situation, but guys hate him because he succeeded where guys have tried and failed. Honestly, at his age, most guys were very much like him.\\n\\n\r\nHe is just a typical horny teenager that spends the shoe thinking with the wrong head and so ends up doing things you as the viewer won't like.\\n\\n\r\nPsycho #1 is an extremely attractive yet shy girl who most people sympathize with but who no one should. Now you may be wondering why there is a Psycho #1 but not a #2, #3, and so on, and the answer is simple, she is all of those numbers. You see one number wasn't enough to capture how psychotic she is. \\n\\n\r\nShe starts off this show as a psycho path. Don't believe me? Name one sane person who serves hot lemonade. But don't worry, she will become much more insane over the course of the show, going so far as to physically transform by episode 11, giving up her eye color to sport pure black empty eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMost people will say that ULB is the villian of the show but I think that Psych #1 is the main villian. Sure she is the product of ULB's creation, but for her to get so infatuated after a single date, I see her as a time bomb with her going crazy at some point or another.\\n\\n\r\nPsycho-slut is the third main character. She is ULB's friend and is a very confident and out going person. Aside from her insanity she is a very likably character. She too, like Psycho #1, will grow gradually more insane over the course of the show. She too will be an antagonist of this show because she instegates all that is to happens in this show. She is more sympathetic because she is a half breed, half psycho half slut. Being such a half breed age doesn't posses the full power of the psychopath nor the free range of a slut.\\n\\n\r\nShe is an enjoyable character who has her ups and down moments but, like most characters in this show, if the words slut, psycho, or bastard aren't being used to explain her, she is just a normal teenager.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION: This show is great. The ending is the only reason you should watch this show and it will either be so shocking that you won't like it, or so shocking that you will love it. The majority of the anime is spent with a lot of the same thing happening over and over a few times in different episodes, so it does get repetitive. But there are some entertaining scenes to hold you ever untill thevend, like when a girl tells ULB \"I will let you cheat on my best friend with me, if you promise never to cheat on her.\" #logic.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime because of how shocking the ending is. You wont be thinking about anything else for a long time after seeing it, so whether you liked it or not, the show did its job. And again watch it in one sitting or don't watch it at all.",

            "content": "One of the good anime in this summers collection. \r\nStory revolves around love triangle with school student Makoto, his classmate Sekai and classmate from another class, Kotonoha. I though, this will be generic love triangle anime, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was something else... something really unusual to see in anime. Finally, someone made this kind of love triangle anime... You can name this anime as \"All goes wrong\" specially, after you see last (and THE BEST) episode in whole series. \r\nThough I liked game much, ending from anime was better, way much better.\r\nCharacters are one of the better that I have seenso far. You ask why? Oh come on, in how many anime you can actually hate main hero so much to wish him death? I think I know one, School Days. See, this is proof that characters are outstanding. They are just not good. Simple, isn't it? Everyone has his/her faults, girls are sluts, Sekai fake .... just to get Makoto and Kotonoha is crazy.... wow, what refreshing characters, instead of classical archetypes in harem/love triangle anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, good 7 from me. I liked it, it was fresh thing to see on PC, really good opposite to classical noend love triangle harem anime. I recommend it to any regular anime watchers, who are sometimes fed up with &quot;all went good&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nPS: NICE BOAT!",

            "content": "School Days is not your typical anime series, it's a diversion to the past few shounen series I'm hooked to. I knew of the series when some of my roommates started watching it, and me being eternally curious, began watching it too.\r\nSimply put, the anime is basically a part of reality for us teenagers, most of us are controlled by our hormones. Take Itou Makoto, the male protagonist of the series, as an example. He's the typical teenager guy that we see everyday at school: doesn't care about the world, listens to music, and secretly peeks at some girls in a perverted way.\r\nHe fell inlove with a girl he met on the train while heading to school. It was a normal love at first sight, and given the girl's beauty, he took a pic with his phone, which is a known \" charm\" to students.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the series has a darker, or should I say, more perverted meaning than the usual boy-meets-girl in an anime series.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto, Sekai, and Kotonoha had a boy-bridge-girl relationship which got more and more complicated as the series continued. The plot was twisted enough to be as real as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, especially Makoto and his girlS [yes, I capitalized the 'S' on purpose], have their own unique personalities and maybe, just maybe, you may relate to them, especially if you have experienced teen love.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the part I love the most is the ending of the series, because it was really shocking, and gave me creeps for the time being. Well, it ended Makoto's infinite loop of girls and at the same time, Sekai's paranoia.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were all good, and there is even \"fanservice\" throughout the series [the close-up on the girl parts, especially on Kotonoha]. \\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this to a person who is in a good mood, since I saw my friend [who just had a recent heartbreak] broke down while watching the series. There is something in School Days that stings to the reality of life that more or less, you'll relate.",

            "content": "A truly unique anime. You have not watched an anime like because it is truly special. It is so emotionally pushing, you probably won't feel as much emotion from any other anime. Feelings of depression, jealousy, sympathy, it is in truth a sad anime, not a bitter sweet one. \r\nTo begin, this anime is NOT for beginning anime fans. Go watch some romance, tragedy, and lots of other anime first. The reason is because you have to know that pain and negative emotions exists in anime, it is not all fun and games. And you have to appreciate having these sort of feelings.\r\nIf you havenot seen this anime, go see it right now, and here is going to be massive spoilers from here on out so go watch it now! Go watch this unforgettable anime NOW.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is tragedy, a fall of the main character due to his flaws. In the entire course of the anime, we see how he ends up hurting others because of his flaws. We have a main character who is lustful and indecisive. The ending is that of a Shakespearean tragedy, everyone ends up broken. To those who say it has a \"bad ending\", just because sad things happen at the end does not mean it is not good. The ending wraps things up nicely and is not left open ended. That means it has a FITTING ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. The reason is that they accomplish their means. Nothing stands out though, but that is not the highlight of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were well chosen. The music was alright. The ending songs were ok. \\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are what to watch this anime for. To those who say \"The main character is despicable\", I completely agree. Who did not cheer when Makoto was stabbed to death. To those who say \"The main character is very unrelatable\", I ask, why? Many anime fans enjoy harems yet VERY FEW have harems in real life. How are they any more relatable than a guy who does not have the courage to ask a girl who he likes, and takes a girl out on the first date to an arcade? Who WOULDN'T get too much ego when there are girls fighting for him. Who WOULDN'T forget to pay attention to the feeling of girls when hes getting as much as he wants. Makoto is probably more relatable than any other popular/cute/strong main characters in any other harems. And the reason why so many people hate him might be because he reminds us all how stupid and lustful real guys can be. \\n\r\nAnalysis of characters-\\n\r\n Makoto-  Immature boy at beginning, who is shy and somewhat considerate and is not straight forward. We see this when he helps Setsuna gain her courage. He is not smart nor very perceptive, as seen  by not realizing his middle school classmate had a crush on him. He is at first grateful for having Katonoha as a girlfriend, but soon wants to go further in their relationship. When a girl wants him, he has no motive to say no. Because of his premature mind, he does not realize how much he is hurting the girls. How could he? Whenever he was with a girl, that girl was happy to be with him at that moment. In his eyes everything was okay and all the girls were happy. Exactly what immature boys/men would do, but haters won\u2019t admit it.\\n\r\nSekai- A clinically depressed girl (Setsuna revealed this) who acts quickly and has a different code of morals.  Due to this, she is of the so called destructive type. This is seen when she  steals a kiss at the first episode, yells at Makoto at the pool, and first degree murder. Even though she set up Makoto and Katonoha.   I am no psychiatrist but I do know that sufferers love company, and that she really does want to be happy.  She breaks free of the tropes that often define and make a clich\u00e9 heroine, especially in anime.\\n\r\nKatonoha- A faithful beautiful girl without any self-esteem.   She sees Makoto as her beacon of light for liking her. Quite an original character as a yandere and a silient sufferer.  It was shown that she was constantly bullied before and during the anime, and when she does get bullied, she cries and runs away. Or take the scene from my memory when Katonoha visits Makoto because he had ignored her for a long time. Upon opening the door, she asks if he is with anyone. He blatantly lies no, and makes an excuse that he was sick. Katonoha looks down and sees a pair of women's shoes inside the house, and a look of grief spreads to her face realizing his lie, yet does not accuse of lying and walks away. She is the most well thought out \u201csilient sufferer\u201d I have ever seen in anime.\\n\r\nThe girls in this anime are complex and it is HEART BREAKING to see them mentally break down. Yes, some of them didn't make the best decision.  We are all human and I bet we all had those stupid teenage moments the characters are too. If you sympathize and try to understand them, you will have an emotionally painful experience. \\n\r\nThis also has one of the most famous scenes of anime, and I am not talking of Nice Boat, but when Katonoha cuts Sekai open. Most people just say, wow, that is disgusting and disturbing, but they missed out the most BRILLIANT line of anime of all time. Upon looking inside her, she says \u201cJust as I thought it was a lie after all. There\u2019s nobody inside\u201d. Oh Katonoha, you master of figurative language\u2026\\n\r\nI think the story was magnificent and the characters took me on the biggest emotional rollercoaster anime has ever had. 10/10\\n\r\nIf you find beauty in all sorts of emotions, I think you will appreciate it as well.\\n\r\nI will now argue against the most common arguments that unfairly criticize this anime for the rest of the review.\\n\r\n.1 The girls are sluts.\\n\r\nIf you mean that having a sex drive, which was Hikaru and the girls Makoto had a 4 way with then yes. That also means that all guys are sluts. People who use this defense don\u2019t understand that it is normal for a teenage girl who has been past puberty and has sex hormones desire sex as much as males do. Those who still insist to criticize this as the shows downfall don\u2019t realize how much society has warped the idea of gender roles. They think all anime girls are pure, laugh at sex crazed MALE characters of other anime, and then freak out when there are girls who express their natural feelings. This is by far the most immature excuse.  \\n\r\nI am no way implying all teenagers are sex crazed, and this anime is in no way trying to depict teens with urges as having no virtues. This is shown when all the girls stop having sex with Makoto when they hear that he got Sekai pregnant, which means they know when the absolute line should not be crossed. Another time is when Katou visits Makoto, tells him that he changed, and promptly leaving without doing anything, being done with him. Her crush on him was never about his physique but the type of person he was, and she cuddled with him to be with that person who was now gone.   \\n\r\n.2 Sekai is an idiot who completely messed up everything.\\n\r\nFirst of all, she is a first year at high school so her line of reasoning may not be that well (She even says she has no experience in episode 4). It probably started when Makoto repeatedly messed up his relationship with Katonoha. She most likely thought \u2013 Makoto is sex hungry and Kotonoha wants to be more reserved. The solution would be to take off the sexual pressure off from Kotonoha by taking her place ONCE. Unfortunately this does not work out as she does develops feelings for him and thus events spiral out of control and she herself admits, there is a point she couldn\u2019t go back during the final moments of the final.  With this in mind it is possible to acknowledge her as a plausible, realistic and pitiful character.\\n\r\n.3 This a bad show because it made me feel depressed/ it was not like 99 percent of other harems\\n\r\nI think this argument only justifies that is worth a watch.  \\n\r\nIf there are any other complaints, I would gladly update this review.\\n",

I keep reading reviews that say this anime was daring and new...how so exactly? Its your typically eroge harem anime, one boy many girls, lots of meaningless sex... Except for the ending...which to be honest wasn't really all that surprising an outcome, it seemed engineered purely for some kind of shock factor.\r\nI understand the maleappeal, the ecchi, and the alpha male who despite his dull and non descript persona still manages to hook up with half the girls in the school, it is a fantasy for most of the targeted demographic I suppose, which is why the game series and the anime despite their utter mediocrity still managed to gain such a following. Interestingly though I actually thought I'd be unlikely to find any female reviewers who liked the show I actually found one who gave it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway unlike those people who force themselves to watch entire series for...whatever reason they use, I stopped at four episodes, watched episode 1 and 2, 8 and the last episode and substituted the rest with plot summaries...made no difference.

The sterotypical love story with the close friend watching in envy.

But, on to the review.\r\nI'll start with the Art and the Sound, since those are the things I liked the least. The art was solid enough for what it did, but a few hiccups exist here and there. I just don't remember it that well, so that means it was mediocre. Hey look, a Mediocre rating. Perfect. Same for the sound. The voice actors do a good job portraying their roles, especially Kotonoha's. The kind of deadpanvoice she goes into later in the series is excellent, but that's all I can remember. Ergo, a 6.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, onto the plot and characters, where I feel this show really shines. This show takes the premise of your standard harem anime and gives it a dose of realism. It replaces your average spineless asshole main character with Makoto, the most pimpin' son of a bitch ever to live. When these women throw themselves at him tits first, he doesn't run away or get a nosebleed or whatever bullshit other protagonists do. He mans up and fucks them. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the meaning of self-control and everything goes to... well you'll just have to see for yourself.\\n\r\nThe plot itself is fairly dumb until about ep 6 if I remember right, in which he starts sleeping around. Then, all the characters show their true sides and shit goes down. The reason that the main character starts sleeping around is that this anime originated from an H visual novel, which was the whole POINT of the game. With that, I'll go on to my final point.\\n\r\nI believe that Makoto is School Days' look at what would happen if you put the average attitude of a nukige player into the real world. Nukige are Japanese porn games, and you can guess how much plot is in any one of them. Therefore, the whole point of the game is to screw as many girls as possible. Makoto also wants to screw as many women as possible. So, perhaps Makoto is the director's look at what happens when you do that in real life. For those uninformed (you sad people), your shit gets slapped; and boy does Makoto's shit get slapped. He may have had his shit get slapped harder than any other shit I have seen slapped. How hard? You'll have to watch to see.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, don't watch if you can't deal with mature themes and blood.",

This something never really happens throughout the whole series. You start watching to see when the main character finally \"mans up\", and believe me you'll be very disappointed with the story.\r\nThe ending was twisted and demented, the very end of the last episode you think oh I see but really no just more disappointment.\r\nThe opening movie clip is by far an exaggeration and should besomething else because it brings you into a sense of happiness and oh this is going to be a great anime but in reality its not. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a nice heartfelt story, try not to watch you find it with this anime. \\n\r\nIf you want a nice perverted anime, try not to watch you'll just be disgusted.\\n\r\nIf you want to cut you wrists after watching this anime, watch and you probably will.\\n",

How(??) donou! and we have staged some nasty butchery for dessert. \\n\\n\r\nThe theme of the show is 'cheating', strange enough, all fem characters cheated by shows no-response in ANY form for being cheated, fucking arround is like nothing happens.

            "content": "(Deep breath)  I watched this, on account on one guy at school telling me to watch this after showing me the ending.  Of course, I'm sure many people would've done the same thing, which is, wanting to know what events occurred to make such a train wreck happen.  Now, I wish to punch that guy in the face for wasting my time!  But enough of that, onto the review.\r\nStory: The story of \"School days\" revolves around our main \"protagonist\" Makoto.  In love with a girl named Kotonoha, he wants nothing more then to begin dating her, even going to theextent of using a picture of her as a charm as his cellphone wallpaper.  It isn't until a girl by the name of Sekai comes into the picture and decides to help him, which in the end, creates a love triangle.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Pff...again, where do I begin?  Makoto, as the main protagonist, all he wants is love.  As the main premise for the story, he begins falling for Kotonoha, then switches to another girl, which, is normal for guys his age as crushes do come on and off.  However, what makes this guy really special, is that he is in fact, a complete ass.  Without breaking off a relationship, this guy cheats over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and etc.  You get my point.  This guy really has no personality whatsoever.  In fact, he shows nothing in terms of personality other then being a complete player.  Next, Kotonoha, or should I say, the fanservice in this anime.  A quiet and shy girl, she becomes romantically interested in Makoto and begins stepping out of her shy bubble and tries to be braver.  In the end, well, she's a yandere.  Finally, we have Sekai, the over spunky girl of the series.  Though personally, I like her as she has a smidge more personality then the rest of the girls, she's not really any different as her thoughts turn to murder as well, oh boy.  Then we have the other 5-6 girls and one other guy which play an extremely minimal role to that point that I will not mention them any further. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: The soundtrack is nothing too good as no matter how many times you listen to it, you really won't catch it in your head.  It's really generic and not too noteworthy.  The art on the other hand, is rather good.  The animation is very fluid and concise, and the characters themselves have really well done designs.  Probably my most favorite part of this show.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: WARNING, some ranting may occur.  School days, is bad.  It's horrible and a disaster beyond belief.  Personally, I want the 4.5 hours I spent watching this back.  I really can't say anything good about this other then the art.  While yes, there were \"good\" points in the story, it really went downhill really fast.  First of all, Makoto himself.  There were many a time in this anime where the romance problems could've been solved rather easily.  First of all, break up with your current girlfriend!  IF that happened, this anime would've not had to end as it should've as its ending is very well known.  Second, I doubt anyone has this sort of problem at school, so it should be renamed to \"Life of a high school player\" or something.  And finally, idiotic choices.  Of course, if common sense was put into this anime, then it wouldn't be so debated as it really is.  However, I can't help but note that there are many idiotic choices made by the characters themselves that puts them to blame at how this turned out.  I-I-I can't say anymore.  Just a warning, watch at your own risk and try not to punch your computer screen in anger.  If you have a different opinion, I'd be glad to hear it.  Good day.  =w=",

He really doesn't know how to read other people's feelings. He just goes around doing whatever he wants and being a terrible person. He thinks of himself too much in this series.\r\nIf you watch this series, and enjoy it, there is simply something wrong with you. This anime really made me feel torn apart inside. It is very crazy the fact you think that you could do whatever you want in the world and get away with it. \r\nOther thanthat, I thought the art and sound quality of this anime was very enjoyable. It was on the lines of code geass and air. In my opinion that is.\\n\\n\r\n My overall rating of this anime is 5 for creativity. Nothing more and nothing less. \\n\\n\r\nThank You, Inu_Y4sha.",

            "content": "School Days starts off like a typical romance anime. Makoto, a seemingly normal guy, meets Kotonoha, and falls in love. After a few episodes I thought I might enjoy School Day. It wasn't anything special, but it wasn't horrible either. It's after the first few episodes that this anime begins to spiral downwards. \r\nThe story itself wasn't the worst I have seen and it can keep you interested for a few episodes. That being said, by the end, the story failed to keep me interested. I only suffered through the later episodes to see the ending. \r\nThe art was honestly pretty well done. It wasone of the better parts of School Days. Not too much to be said in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't too bad either. Not a whole lot to say about it either.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the reason I disliked this show so much. Makoto is a downright disgusting character, with no respect for anyone around him. The only motivation he has is to sleep with any girl he can. Kotohona is probably the only character I had any sympathy for and even then by the end of the show I found myself disliking her as well. The rest of the characters are awful as well. They have little regard for their \"friends\" and pretty much every supporting character only cares about themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't say I enjoyed this anime. Every episode made me hate the characters more than I had before. All I can say I enjoyed about the show was the ending. I had to struggle to hold back a smile, because I was so glad when it happened. It was the only thing that could somewhat justify my time spent with School Days. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly I'd say watch the show just for the ending. I would never watch School Days again for any reason somehow made it worth watching for me.",
