            "content": "Kotoura-san has the makings of an exceptional show. It has the ambition to be both an emotional drama and an uplifting comedy, to be an experience full of highs and lows to keep you engrossed to the end. It even has an intriguing premise providing a solid foundation for its narrative. Regrettably, it is clear from the very first episode that not only is Kotoura-san plagued by atrocious writing, it furthermore has the entirely wrong attitude when it comes to the use of drama in general.\r\nKotoura-san tells the story of Kotoura Haruka, a girl with the power to read people's minds. Whilst one would expectsuch a power to be a gift, this unfortunately couldn't be further from the truth for Kotoura, who goes through tragedy and strife. As more and more people reject her, she sinks into the depth of loneliness. Abandoned by her parents and afraid to get hurt, she moves from school to school, keeping people at distance. But upon transferring into yet another school, she meets Manabe, a perverted yet honest individual who accepts Kotoura for who she is, and tries with the help of others to get Kotoura to accept herself.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a promising premise, how did it all go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nKotoura-san, bless its poor, forsaken heart, knows nothing of subtlety. When it comes to the drama, the show's writers want you to know for certain what's happening on screen is tragic, and they are not leaving it up to chance. Kotoura-san makes sure you know by shoving it in your face, being incredibly melodramatic, and blaring histrionic orchestral music at your ears. You can practically hear the director shouting \"ARE YOU SAD YET? BE SAD NOW!\". The writing is so heavy-handed in its approach that the scenes often don't even make sense, as elements designed to make the scenes even more full of anguish are carelessly introduced without proper thought. At worst, things get completely out of hand as you are bombarded with one melodramatic scene after another.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first episode is a perfect example. Kotoura's tragic backstory is told, where each depressing event in her life is immediately followed up by another one, aiming to be even sadder than the last. Eventually it escalates into a ridiculous scene in which Kotoura-san, previously finding her only solace in a stray kitten, breaks down because she is informed that the cat has been taken away, leaving her alone. This would be acceptable, however the woman who informs Kotoura proceeds to shout at her, telling her to \"Leave and never come back!\" for no apparent reason. This is one of the many contrivances used to easily make the scene more emotional, which are the defining hallmarks of Kotoura-san.\\n\\n\r\nThe complete lack of subtlety in Kotoura-san's drama is replicated in the fanservice as well. The fanservice consists of eponymous Kotoura being cute, a rather innocent and likable form. However, when the show wants you to notice how cute she is, it again makes sure this is impossible to ignore; once again you are assaulted with one cute scene of Kotoura after another. Kotoura would be more endearing if not for how persistently the show confronts us with it. That said, the fanservice is still a relative highlight of the series, even if poorly executed like the other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the comedic aspect of Kotoura-san is also lacking. The essential joke of the series is that the male lead Manabe has a perverted fantasy of Kotoura; who will then get embarrassed and annoyed at him. This joke is then repeated throughout the entire series. Funny as it was the first few times, by the fiftieth iteration of the joke it was getting incredibly tedious. It is fortunate that the show invested in other jokes, however these are also repeated frequently and whilst some of the jokes were funny enough to withstand constant repetition, the majority were not. The repetition of this poor comedy becomes a dull monotony for the viewer. Additionally the humour comes at often inopportune times, causing a large emotional whiplash when placed right in the middle of a dramatic scene, a problem that pervades the entire show. If you are the sort that likes \"perverted humour\" then the comedy will most likely be more amusing, and will sustain its freshness for much longer.\\n\\n\r\nFor the writers, all that seems to matter is the result. They appear not to care if the story makes little sense or is filled with plot holes; so long as the dramatic scenes are saturated with sadness and woe, they consider it a job well done. This attitude is ultimately what's responsible for the terrible writing. It is indeed unsurprising that the writer who was unable to come up with enough jokes to last the series, was also unable to write more than one pattern of character development. Kotoura-san is rescued from her depression by her friends (notably Manabe) at least three times. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that it's the same issue every time, simply disguised by a different context. Ultimately what happens every time is that Kotoura becomes self-loathing and depressed because she blames herself for bad events, only to be \"saved\" by Manabe and the rest of her friends. Call me a cynic, but although it is clear that Kotoura suffered a tramautic past, the drama feels insincere when Kotoura is saved by Manabe through the same process multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, romance, and drama that make up the plot of Kotoura-san were in shambles. The quality of writing is dismal, it desired the story to end up a cohesive mix of these disparate narrative elements, but either they couldn't be bothered to actually put in the time and effort to make it work within a story, or they were simply unable to. Whatever the reason, the sheer quantity of inconsistent tone and plot holes is almost insulting- it's a depressing thought that this standard was deemed acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and character designs were of low quality, they both look messy and have very little detail. For the comedy segments this is not so much a problem, as the 4koma style character designs suit it well. However, when it comes to the dramatic scenes the character designs are in stark contrast to the melodrama, and appear incredibly awkward when the art gets in your face. The music is generic and lacks subtlety, dramatic scores being employed ruthlessly in every single scene bar one notable exception that verges upon melancholy. The opening is cute and likable, if not ultimately forgettable; the ending is simply nondescript.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the characters are all pretty likable. They evoke sympathy from the audience even if they are well defined by a limited number of distinctive traits, and are at times enjoyable to watch; you certainly shouldn't have a problem with any of them. Well, perhaps apart from Moritani. She starts the series as an antagonistic figure, only to have her personality overhauled, leading to an abrupt and irrational character change that is poorly explained. Again, the attitude of the writing shines through once again. However, there is one facet of Kotoura-san that was done right, and that was the romance. The relationship that develops between Manabe and Kotoura was surprisingly well done over the course of the series, despite it's repitious nature. Their interaction isn't complex or deep, but in a show where characters can just change personality at the drop of a hat, it was a real highlight.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the incredibly forceful attempts to evoke emotion in Kotoura-san is stifling, demonstrating an extreme example of the \"tell not show\" attitude to drama. If you can ignore poor writing, and relish heavy-handed drama and comedy, then this show will probably be of great enjoyment to you. If, on the other hand, you loathe over the top melodrama and care at all about plot progression, then Kotoura-san is nothing more than a trainwreck.",

            "content": "Our childhood is often filled with many blanks and not much memories. The few you might remember are some friends you made or games you played.\nBut, what if the memories you remember most vividly were the ones filled with bullying,ignorance, and broken hearts? \nKotoura-san starts off as a seemingly sad and powerful drama. Maybe a bit generic. What throws people off is that after the first half of the show, it just hits you with all this comedy that you weren't expecting. This is probably what caused the downfall of the show. I can't say I exactly disliked the comedy, but it would've been betterif the producer had focused a bit more on the drama. Still, there were some good comedy moments, and the drama was well played.\\n\\n\nThe art is nice and fits the mood of the story. It is a bit generic, but if you're a fan of moe, then the artwork might be something for you. There sad and happy moments of the story are portrayed pretty nicely, the coloring and shading helped the mood.\\n\\n\nCharacter development has its sweet and heat breaking moments. From Kotoura starting to learn to trust her friends and deal with yet, more bullying, to Moritani learning to deal with jealousy, it was pretty nice to watch. And so...friendship is building up between Moritani and the rest of the ESP Research Club. One thing that did kinda bug me was that the relationship between Kotoura and her mom was not really in depth. It seemed like they introduced her in the beginning and just decided to put her off for a while.\\n\\n\nOverall, the drama mixed with comedy makes this show pretty enjoyable. (Manabe having pervy dreams of Kotoura really makes this worth watching lol) Of course, I'd love to see Kotoura overcome more challenges as well. This show left me with mixed feelings. There were some moments I really enjoyed, yet some I felt kinda bored with. Nonetheless, I still think the drama part of the show displayed some pretty valuable lessons.  \\n\\n\nIt seems the biggest problem the show is having is the transition from hardcore drama to just plain comedy. I don't find this much of a problem since I think a show that's too serious is just plain boring. I recommend that if you're expecting Kotoura-san to just be a really good drama, then it's best you don't watch it. Of course, this is just my opinion.",

            "content": "Wow... Just wow. This show easily makes it onto my highest favorites. There is nothing I can truly nit pick about the show that would detract me from my rating. It took me for a ride I won't soon forget.\r\nStory: This is among the most emotional stories I have ever had the grace and the priveledge of experiencing. I'm not lying when I say this: It deserves to be seated in the high heavens for the drama genre. Why? Haruka's backstory alone had me under emotional torture. The show itself proved how serious it can get when it wants to, and boy they wasted notime in doing so. I have never had a stronger first impression for any show of any medium (yes, even stronger than Clannad). That isn't the say the story is always dramatic; in fact the comedy was equally well done. I might have broken a lung in laughter. Even if it's the same gag, there's still the hint of freshness in that it's done differently each time in differently awkward, yet appropriate situations. Bottom line: If you have any sympathy in you, then this show will exploit every part of it. It's likely the show will crush your soul once or twice, but it also leaves you happy and satisfied. Kotoura-san is absolutely top tier in it's story, and it's not just a simple Romantic Comedy. This story is one for the ages! 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nArt: It's simple, doesn't try to innovate, or invoke scenery porn all the time; but it's that simplicity which makes it very clear what we should be feeling and when.The graphics were very pleasant to watch, and I had no problem with it whatsoever (especially since I marathoned the show) .The special effects were also very pretty to look at and weren't overdone in the sense that they never distracted me from the one fantasy element the show focused on: the telepathy. The character designs were plain for the most part, but very cleanly done which is fitting for telling a story in an otherwise mundane setting. I didn't see any notably bad off modeling (QUALITY!!) during my marathon. I found all of the characters' movements to be enjoyable and sensible except for one: Daichi \"fish lips\" Muroto. His mouth was just too weird and strange for me to watch, and I can't see why they made that his default expression. He looks like a derp to me when he's supposed to be the smart one, and that doesn't register well with me. Still, the art overall is simple, yet elegant and vividly expressive. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting was absolutely perfect! The characters' emotions and personalities were portrayed in a very clear and concise manner on top of sounding their age. The characters' feelings can be readily felt in their voices, and each voice suited each character in each situation to excellent degrees. The opening and ending themes didn't catch on with me at first, but I grew to love them. As for the soundtrack, I didn't just hear the music, I felt it too. The classical music inspired soundtrack also accompinies the story to carry the appropriate emotions. Seriously, listen to the prolouge theme, as in right now. It is the most profound example of this phenomenon the OST can provide. Otherwise, the simplicity wins again, both in my heart and in it's catchy listening value outside the show. Pure ear candy 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It's amazing how much I attached myself to the main heroine in just 10 minutes. She is among the deepest and most dynamic characters I've ever followed. Everything about her from her personality, motivations, and thought processes is perfectly justified and empathic to  me. Manabe couldn't be a better foil for her, even if he tried. A guy who freely admits his perversion and an overall free and flexible thinker makes for the best long-term counter to Kotoura's telepathy in the most enjoyable way possible. Manabe may be an idiot, but his heart is definitely in the right place and he knows it! The guy definitely earns his balls as well as Kotoura's love by the end. The main supporting cast also develops surprisingly well and likable over, but some of those character's motivations were sold a bit short (I'm looking at you, Moritani, and your distaste for dojo inheritance). Muruto's neutral stance towards Mifune is also annoying and baffling to me, but not extremely so. Otherwise, the characters felt human and were dramaticly driven and they all had real power behind them. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I marathoned the entire show in just one night. That alone speaks volumes how much I enjoyed this show: it was an insatiable addiction! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: WATCH IT! I don't care who you are, or what genre you're normally into. Do yourself a service: drown in your own tears, break yourself in laughter, and/or just enjoy the ride. It's probably the wildest emotional roller coaster out there if you can stand seeing Manabe's perverted thoughts. 10/10",

            "content": "Have you ever tried rubbing lemon on your eyes? Because that pretty much describes what this show tries too hard to do. Forced drama, everywhere. \r\nSo the first five or so minutes of the first episode is the part where all the people ate up for some reason and it apparently managed to leave such an impact that people thought that this show was going to be good just from those five minutes alone. So this girl can read other people's minds, but her feelings get hurt because she doesn't realize she has such powers, and she's a bit insensitive because she was young. Alright,that's not too bad so far. It's fairly realistic as far as fictional mind reading powers go, but then stuff happens. Namely, the \"everyone is conveniently an asshole and stupid\" cliche- Where if you are too lazy to give a character a well written tragic backstory, then fuck it, just force it! Just make everything around them happen conveniently to drag them down! What makes me baffled is that it's not like the writers did not have the time to devote a whole episode for this; Instead, it's just rushed and feels completely forced, leading to an extremely lazy writing. In its original form as a 4Koma comic, this wouldn't be a necessity, but as an adaptation, I think it needs some more attention especially if you're trying to tell a serious story. \\n\\n\r\nSo, apparently Kotoura remains stupid about her mind reading powers while growing up and doesn't learn to shut up about it, and eventually pisses off her parents because her father is the most irresponsible father ever and her mother is just genuinely retarded. Instead of believing multiple doctors claiming that Kotoura is not a compulsive liar, she decides to believe her homeroom teacher who says she is. Who needs those PHDs? Then she sort of ditches Kotoura in her grandfather's house, and then the actual plot happens. Well, not before showing us that Kotoura gets more traumatic experience out of her favorite cat not being at the usual spot than being ditched by her parents. Brilliant. She eventually comes across the main character while still showing off that she can read minds, although she fully realizes that she's going to get her feelings hurt anyways about it because she's retarded- And what a surprise, the main character's mind is all wacky and funny! It's almost like some people honestly don't give a shit about Kotoura for once because she's the most important person ever! Realism! This apparently causes Kotoura to take interest just because he just so happened to not pay attention to her presence like every other human being that was ever around Kotoura in her life. That being said, this main character is awfully written too. He's solely characterized by his wacky silly perverted mind, and the writers can't seem to stop making overdone jokes about this, and this continues to drag on every episode in this show. Of course, outside of this, he acts like the most generic main character ever and serves as a white knight of sorts to Kotoura because everyone around her happens to be conveniently a dick just so that the main character can have a role. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait, there's more! More dumb characters are introduced; Daichi and Yuriko. They're both members of some stupid ESP research club, which I don't see how it got approved in the first place. Yuriko's initial plan was to use Kotoura's ability to prove to people that psychics were real because her mom died because nobody believed that she was a psychic. Now, I don't see how showing off that Kotoura is psychic proves whether her mom was ever a psychic in the first place, but that'd be too logical. Furthermore, why would Kotoura even agree to help Yuriko when clearly mind reading only makes her depressed? There's literally no reason. \\n\\n\r\nBut there was a reason after all- The show uses this as an excuse to introduce the next half-assed character. This character is named Moritani, and she is in love with the main character because of whole ten seconds they shared in the past. This causes her to get jealous of Kotoura because she was attracting all the attention from the main character. And then the next part is just awful: Kotoura makes a mistake, and accidentally ends up reading someone else's mind, so clearly this means that she has to actively target someone visually to read their mind. It's not something passive where she just 'hears' other people's minds. Therefore, she can technically just choose not to read minds at all, which is precisely what she doesn't do ever and she barfs all over herself because that's what people do when they're depressed and realize that others think badly of you. Then the main character defends Kotoura because she gets bullied yet again despite it being her own fault completely, which triggers Moritani to become even more jealous and causes her to order her friends to beat him up. Yeah, I'd call someone else to beat my secret love interest too because that's a smart thing to do. And she even manages to ask for help from people associated with her family dojo, so it's clearly impossible for that someone to realize she was responsible for it. \\n\\n\r\nSo at this point, it should be pretty noticeable that every 'drama' in this series is half-assed, forced, and just completely caused because the characters are mentally deficient. It's like watching a movie about zombie apocalypse where everything bad happens only because the characters are dumb and one just lets the zombies in because he thought he needed some fresh air- Except worse, because at least those movies are visually fun- This show is just boring, forced conflicts happening just for the sake of having a conflict. Then they constantly try to cram what they classify as \"comedy\" in, which includes a scene where the main character imagines Kotoura in a swimsuit or something. It's like the writers can't make up their mind about what they wanted to write, so they just taped the two together without any regard for transition. And unfortunately the show only gets worse from here- The show eventually introduces a mystery arc, where in theory, it should be interesting in conjunction with Kotoura's mind-reading powers. \\n\\n\r\nSummary of the \"mystery\" arc: Kotoura does something stupid and she gets into a trouble. In this particular case, she walks alone at night when she fully realizes it's dangerous to do so because there's a culprit somewhere in the local area, meets a person who's pretty much a stranger at this point, and follows that person only to realize that person was the culprit all along. This sort of twist would make Shyamalan shake his head in disapproval. And then the last episode just quickly resolves the whole mother-Kotoura conflict that the series has been building up to for the entire cour in five minutes. Brilliant pacing. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering how much useless filler there was in this series, this wouldn't really be classified as  \"rushed.\" Now one may argue that since this is an adaptation of a 4-koma comic, you shouldn't expect a well-written story. But that is the silliest argument, because if the series is going to attempt to take itself seriously, then it should be treated as such. The fact is simple; They tried to cram some drama in and failed pretty hard. Hopefully after this show, people won't decide that a show is going to be \"good\" just from the first five minutes of the first episode.",

I was worried about if they could do a good job mixing the comedy and the drama, without making any drastic change, but after ten minutes I was laughing and during all the anime both were mixed very well. Besides, although the drama is a little bit exaggerated, it will reach you and you will establish an emotional bond with the main character quickly. In addition, the story transmits a good message about the injustice of the way the society thinks, unfortunately itis too forced, for being too cruel and for being too pure. Kotoura has had problems with establishing relationships because of her ability to read people\u00b4s minds and according to the anime, everybody except her new friends have bad thoughts all the time. And that is something I didn\u2019t like because it is not very realistic. However, that\u2019s the only bad point of the story. It is enjoyable and charming.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not something that will amaze you but you will be comfortable with and surely you will enjoy the expressivity of the faces when they are surprised. There are some people that didn\u2019t liked the way the mouth of Muroto is drowned, but I found it very funny and a good way to give liveliness to one of the less participating characters.\\n\\n\r\nReferring to the sound, I know when a soundtrack is good when in the scenes I notice that background music stringing along with the moment. In this case I didn\u2019t realize at all. They are suitable for the scenes but nothing to be aware of. The same goes for the opening and ending songs and seyus. They all do their job good but without delighting us.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, they are pretty well done, however I think they could have done a better job with their psychological part. The main character, as I said before, has problems to socialize and the huge problems she has had and the distrust she has in people disappear surprisingly quickly as she met Manabe. I think it would have been great to give that part more importance, but I understand that with only 12 chapters they have to focus in other things. Referring to Manabe, the main male character, he is very simple but his perverted thoughts and the relationship he has with Kotoura offers plenty of comedy, and a little bit romance, to the anime. About Moritani, I didn\u2019t like her psychological evolution very much either. She is also a lovely character, but it is unrealistic how fast she stops having bad thoughts about Kotoura. And the last thing I would like to remark about is Kotoura\u2019s mother. I like the  role she has, it is essential for the drama part, but like I\u2019ve said, it would have been great if they had developed psychologically more this character and give more emphasize and more depth to the relationship between Kotoura and her. The other characters, although they fulfill well their part, there is no need to say anything else about them.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, it is a very entertaining anime, which mixes very well drama and comedy. I enjoyed it very much. However, because of its length, it cannot offer an in depth psychological part but enough to catch your attention and to teach you a little bit of empathy. I recommend it if you are looking for something light, charming and entertaining, but I don\u2019t if you are looking for a great drama or something that will move your heart.",

            "content": "As a fan of romantic comedies, I'm always looking for ones with a good balance between both genres and are enjoyable to watch. At some point along the line I stumbled upon Kotoura-san which happened to have two of my favorite genres. Catching my attention, I watched all 12 episodes, and I have to say, It's not the best I have seen, but it was certainly a good brief of enjoyment and I wouldn't have minded a second season. \r\nStory: The plot follows a young girl named Kotoura, who has the ability to read peoples minds. Due to this, it has caused various issues withher relationships, leading her to seclude herself from other people. But this changes when a boy named Manabe accepts her ability and takes an interest in her which leads to them joining the ESP club, introducing the other cast members. I found the story enjoyable to watch. It's fairly simple and straightforward, but it's not cliche either. The story starts of with a nice dose of drama, which I found shocking considering the genre of the show. It gives you the back story of our protagonist, Kotoura, and you get a feel for her character and how her ability actually had a huge impact on her as a person. It gets you emotionally connected with her, and sets you up for the rest of the story. But, despite the seriousness of the first episode, it goes straight to comedy and light-hearted scenes which get's you laughing. There were some scenes in the show that I felt were over-dramatic and exaggerated, but it added a good balance between comedy and serious moments. The plot also portrays this theme of injustice and bullying in society, which I think is realistic to our world today and it keeps the story interesting. As far as the romance goes, It's not what you would expect. The show does touch on it but there wasn't that much development, but it does go somewhere by the end of the show. It isn't literally stated that the characters are dating, nor did they kiss, but by the end they become aware of their feelings and confess to each other. The conflicts become resolved by the end too. Kotoura comes to accept her ability and she makes up with her mother who was divorced because of her psychic powers. The story overall is good, and it's charming in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation isn't the greatest, but it isn't bad either. I found myself comfortable with it and didn't find the show unpleasant to watch. I thought the character designs were cute, and the facial expressions of the characters were fun to watch and had me surprised. I didn't like how muroto's mouth looked, but it was certainly unique and something I haven't seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was fine. The BGM's were a bit plain, but they were noticeable and fit the scenes. I thought the OP was cute and fun to listen to, as well as the ED. Not something you would listen to outside of the anime, but it wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters weren't the most interesting, but they weren't bland, dead characters either. At the least, they are fun to watch. There was some character development too. In the beginning, Koutora resented her ability to read people's minds and even wished she didn't live. But this changes throughout the story. After she met Manabe, the rest of the cast members and formed a bond with them, you notice her becoming a little more positive and more proactive than before. She comes to accept her ability due to the support of her newly found friends, and she found her place in the world after being rejected by society for so long. All the characters are unique, with their own personalities. Manabe is the pervert of the group, adding a lot of humorous scenes. Muroto is the intelligent one, a lot more quiet than the rest of the cast. Moritani actually bullies Kotoura in the beginning, but eventually becomes friends with her and joins the ESP club. She is the most violent one of the group, attacking Manabe on occasions, adding to the comedy and light-heartedness of the show. Yuriko is the leader of the ESP, constantly making plans and watching over the group. She tries to use Kotoura at first for her own gains, but that changes by the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall, Kotoura-san was satisfying and it was worth the watch. The romance wasn't what I was hoping for, but the comedy was good. If your looking for something light hearted with a good mixture of serious moments then this is for you.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "(this review contains spoilers)\r\nKatoura-san was terrible because of how disappointing it was.\r\nThe first episode was AMAZING. It was so well put together, but then the rest, absolute horse shit.\r\nThe writers somehow think it's funny to have an old man mol\u0084esting his little granddaughter. They make jokes about him touching her and feeling her up all the time. It's not funny! It's just sick! I couldn't help but cringe and these moments that were supposed to be humorous. \r\nThe other jokes suck because they're repetitive. Pretty much every other joke revolves around the fact that the main male protagonist is per\u0084verted, and Katoura can read minds,so obviously it leads to some awkward situations. But they reuse this AGAIN, and AGAIN, and AGAIN, and AGAIN. Literally, like 99% of the jokes in this anime are just that reiterated. \\n\\n\r\nOther parts of the anime are just ridiculous beyond words! \\n\\n\r\nThere's this one part of the anime where Katoura reads the mind of a stranger by accident, and sees incredibly dark and grotesque things that causes her to faint. She then learns that there is a person in the city who is beating high school girls to a pulp and then leaving them there. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the show has a plot twist. The person doing it turns out to be one of the female police officers who is somewhat developed throughout the last two episodes. It was a slightly expected but decent plot twist. But right when you think the show is getting better, it gets worse. \\n\\n\r\nKatoura realizes that the reason the officer is beating these girls is because she had a terrible, abusive childhood. We also learned from the previous character development that the officer is antisocial and has pretty much no friends. Basically, the officer is jealous of these girls so she beats them. \\n\\n\r\nKatoura realizes this when she is cornered by the officer who is going to attack her. But Katoura pours out her heart to the officer and explains how people do care about her and if she were to open up, she would have more friends.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the officer feels ashamed and turns herself in.\\n\r\nSeems logical, right? Heh.\\n\\n\r\nWhen she turns herself in, she takes on Katoura's advice and asks her coworker to lunch after she gets out of prison.\\n\\n\r\nSo, think about it. You're working with someone, and you JUST figure out that she's been BEATING HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS HALF TO DEATH ALL AROUND THE CITY, and then SHE ASKS YOU TO LUNCH. You would obviously turn her down, right?\\n\\n\r\nNooooo! The guy doesn't even act the least bit shocked that he figured this out about his coworker and takes her up on the offer and sees her off, like NOTHING HAPPENED. \\n\\n\r\nNOTHING HAPPENED?! WHAT?!\\n\\n\r\nWhat's worse is how repetitive this anime is.\\n\r\nBesides this, all the other tangents involve Katoura being sad and running away and her friends coming to get her. It's just that over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing particularly wrong with the art or the music/sound.\\n\r\nThe story is just so terrible, repetitive, unrealistic, undeveloped, anticlimactic, lazy, and impossible to take seriously.",

            "content": "Well then. \r\nFirst off ill give a short reason why i decided to pick this up.\r\nI absolutely love watching RomCom's so i decided to watch this. Simple as that. But what intrigued me was that the main heroine had psychic mind reading powers, i somehow thought that having that kind of thing in the anime would have delicious drama involved. And i was right.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe way they started this anime, on episode one, i somehow thought it was going to be an amazing anime. The first 11 minutes was just crazy, incredibly tragic and sad. And somehow in the same episode it turned from crazydramatic-ness into something pretty damn hilarious. being a some what veteran of anime watching it was seriously easily predicted that she would get a few friends that would support her regardless of her freakish powers. Even though i knew that i still felt happy for her when she made her first friend. \\n\r\nOverall the story started out kind of nice i suppose but it started to feel a little bit awkward. I cannot really explain how but it just is. The story had potential to be something better but then it went downhill and then it went up hill but then downhill or some thing like that. But overall the story was not bad but at the same time not something spectacular. \\n\r\nA lot of things seemed really sudden, at least to me it did. One particular scene was the rooftop scene with Tsukino. I've seen many scenes similar to that, where the main characters win their battles by just talking and pleading. But man did that happen so quick. She started her plea and within 30 seconds it worked. What the flying F**K? Maybe it's just me. Maybe i just don't like things happening so fast. \\n\r\nThe process is more interesting not the result.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nI gotta say the art for this is not to my liking. I won't go as far as to say that it completely sucks. Maybe it is a sort of art style, a new style that i have not seen much before. I just think that it feels lazy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI almost never even notice the background music playing because i feel that it just isn't that great. It doesn't really stand out. There are only 2 tracks i liked, the ending theme song, which was pretty nice and peaceful and had a lot of great meanings behind it , and the track that played during the serious moments. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nManabe: \\n\r\nManabe is a pretty cool guy. He doesn't afraid of anything.\\n\r\nEven though he is seriously a perverted master of some sort he really does care about Kotoura which is pretty cool, a typical feature in all the main male leads in pretty much all animes.\\n\\n\r\nKotoura:\\n\r\nHer character was pretty interesting to watch grow. I know i made some kind of grammar mistake in that previous sentence.... \\n\r\nANYHOW. She had so much doubt in trusting people and in people trusting her and even decides to run away to prevent hurting others, but in the end she goes back. Good for her!\\n\\n\r\nYuriko:\\n\r\nI would say she's a bitch for trying to use someone just for her own selfish needs but in the end she is really guilty about it so i guess it's all yippy skippy.\\n\\n\r\nMuroto:\\n\r\nDid i spell his name right? Ill just call him Megane-Kun.\\n\r\nMegane-kun was a really interesting character. For one he is small as hell and smart as hell. He always has that =3 kind of face on but whenever he does not have it on it means he is serious. I always enjoyed seeing his serious side. The stuff he says to Yuriko is really great, \"I will neither help you or stop you, i am here because i choose to be\" That's some pretty cool sh*t.\\n\\n\r\nMoritani:\\n\r\nTruth be told, i really did not like this character. The show wudve been the same , if not better, without this character. She just .... sucks.... but at least she had the guts to confess to Manabe in the end. But still. she sucks.....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nEhhh this show was alright, it had potential to be a lot better but that's not to say that it was really bad. It is a pretty average anime, i probably would not recommend it to a random person, but if you kind of find this anime interesting from the given synopsis i will do nothing to stop you from watching it. But just a friendly warning , do not expect much from it.\\n\\n\r\n~Til next time\\n\r\nTomislol\\n\\n",

(Nurse, he's out of bed again!)\r\nLet me elaborate, what i mean is that the aforementioned sandwich which consists of bread and ham shares similar qualities with Kotura-san, and its not that their both assembled by underpaid employees who spend most of their days wishing the earth would explode..(although thats also true..) Its that both are quite good if you simply want a cheap quick snack, or if your just not really hungry for something more substantial. Ones a food, ones a anime (their both cops!) but no-one said they were gonna be filling\u2026\r\nBut enough ofthese high flying and bitingly witty sandwich analogies (always popular at parties) lets talk plot\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nKotura-san is, rather obviously, about Kotoura, no problems so far, although i must say i really love the amount of imagination and pizzaz they put into the title, thats a good sign right\u2026  \\n\\n\r\nKotoura Haruka is a 15-year-old girl who can read people's minds. Now you'd think this would make her the luckiest person in the world, and it should, but Kotoura is\u2026 well she's an idiot. And so logically she uses her powers idiotically, reading peoples minds and spitting out their secrets for all to hear. This causes her to be shunned by those around her, even her her own parents who go so far as to ditch her on her millionaire grandpa and piss off, (millionaire?). After this traumatic experience she shuts herself off and becomes bitter and melancholic, moving from school to school as a result. That is until she arrives at generic high school number 300192, where she meets Manabe Yoshihisa, one of her classmates, who because of his simple and kind hearted nature quickly accepts and appreciates her for who she is, creepy mind reading ability and all. And so gradually Kotura begins to open up and tries to live the life she always wanted, to simply be happy with her friends (and drive around in a van solving mystery's). \\n\\n\\n\r\nI would describe the plot in this series (using the, universal measuring system of sandwiches, naturally), as being just plain bread and butter. Its pretty much by the numbers what you'd expect, a lone socially awkward student transfers into a new school, they think its gonna be just like all the other schools (japan must have like a north south jerk divide when it comes to schools\u2026), they meet someone who understands them or accepts them for what they are, blah blah blah, they join a weird club, theres some obstacles or problems to overcome but at the end everyones better friends because of it. (By the power of Friendship!!!!)\t \\n\r\nWhatever, we all know the plots not the reason we're watching a series called kotoura-san released in January\u2026. the month were rejected idea's come together to blow their own brains and hope the ensuing spectacle will at least mildly entertain us.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets get to the meat of this series, or rather, (snicker,\u2026) the ham!!!!  (oh I'm sorry, did i get some of my wit on you, I do apologise.)\\n\r\nSo of course its Katoura, and first things first\u2026. GOD DAMN IS SHE CUTE, like they took every ounce of cuteness they had saved in the cute bank and shoved it into Katoura shares, she's cuter than a baby lambs pet kitten, I mean they pulled every trick in the preverbal book to make you sympathetic to this character, not only is she ridiculously cute but they also gave her own over the top tragic back story, one that would make even Clannad fans roll their eyes\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nBasically life treated her as it own personal shuttlecock and knocked her for six (phrasing, boom!). This caused her to close herself off until she met Manabe who immediately accepts her, and also almost immediately, she changes into what she really is, a timid little girl who just wants to loved (ah, bless). And thats really about it, (keep in mind this all happens in the first episode). After that theres not much to say about Katoura's character, she pretty much just falls into the role of \"female rom-com character\", there are some sweets bits with her mother here and there but its far too little far too late. Her mind reading ability is also never really looked into or explored, why can she read minds? can others? how does it work?  can she turn it off and on? In fact as the series goes on its almost forgotten, only working when its convenient for the plot. In fact this whole series could exist without the mind reading ability at all, just replace it with any social stigma and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference. \\n\\n\r\nBut my real peeve with this character is her uselessness, constantly throughout the show despite effectively having a super power, Katoura-san proves to about as useful as a magnifying glass to a blind man. No matter what the situation Katoura-san needs the help of someone else (usually Manabe) to save her, i can understand it at the beginning, but later, hmm i don't know\u2026 Unfortunately it all makes for a very predictable watch, which is real shame because there was some potential in Katoura to be an interesting character, but whatever... \\n\\n\r\nIn short kotura is defiantly the best thing about the show as she's just so damn cute and can deliver a nice scene once in a while, but unfortunately thats all there really is, she's like a sandwich cut into an amusing shape, fun to look at but still just a sandwich\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are just damn forgettable, Manabe is the most boring human being on the planet, he's in love with Katoura-san, and thats it\u2026 he'd throw himself in front of a truck to save Katoura's shoe. What did he do before she came along, was he just a robot pre-programmed to activate when he met Katoura? We learn nothing about him, other than he has mildly naught thoughts about women occasionally (that BASTARD!).  They give us no reason at all to care or relate to this guy, his every thought and move seems to be dictated by Katoura's existence, it's very charming but boring as hell to watch. (His sandwich ranking = bread thats fallen on ground...) \\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for everyone else. there's Yuriko, the club president who wants to prove her mother was really a physic by using Katoura, but it goes nowhere and just sort of fizzles out\u2026 There's Moritani who starts out interesting but then just becomes wallpaper... and then there that other guy who blah blah blah, voice of Katsuargi Keima from the world god only knows, blah blah blah, dry bread\u2026\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk comedy, since this show is a comedy, the majority of humour comes from Manabe fantasising about Katoura-san and then Katoura getting embarrassed and angry. But the show works on the logic that jokes get funnier the more times you see them, does it work, you decide\u2026(hint, it doesn't).  I can defiantly see some people enjoying this style of humour but it wasn't my particular sandwich so if you like the usually rom-com style of comedy then you'll probably enjoy this, if not theres nothing really new here for you. (sandwich ranking= Marmite sandwich) \\n\\n\r\nOne thing i want to say about the art style, is that this series was made by some of the same people who created Mitsudomoe, and this similar style can really be seen in Katoura-san particularly with regard to  making the series look as cute as possible, a skill that was well honed in Mitsudomoe. Just thought id put that in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Katoura-san is a pretty weak series that offers very little in the way of anything new or interesting, despite its interesting premise. However the show is difficult to hate despite its many flaws, due to the cute and charming way in which its presented, it manages to have its nice moments but unfortunately they're not enough to save the show from the depths of mediocrity where it will surely fall. If you are a big fan of rom-coms and just want to watch another one, then Katoura-san will fit the bill perfectly, but if your like me and want something more from a series, then Katoura-san will leave you still feeling hungry\u2026 And speaking of hungry all this talk of food has made me just that, I'm off to get something to eat, i think i'll make myself, you guessed it\u2026.            \\n\\n\r\nsoup... \\n",

            "content": "Kotoura-san is a series that exceeded my initial expectations.  Please read on to find out why:\r\nStory: 8\r\nI started getting Sankarea vibes after a couple of episodes, since Kotoura-san began with somewhat heavy drama before turning into more of a romantic comedy (with some occasional drama), but I did enjoy the show very much, just like I did Sankarea.  Other than that, I guess these two series are rather different so don't read too much into my comparison.\r\nWe have a fairly unique premise (I don't personally remember many other anime about psychics, especially portrayed as they are here), and I think that the storywas sufficiently interesting to follow in the end.\\n\r\nBeing adapted from a yonkoma, I expected comedy and I wasn't disappointed.  Though Manabe's pervertedness (if that's a word) did get a bit overdone, I still found it funny to watch, especially seeing Kotoura's reactions to said pervertedness.  The more dramatic elements were also generally well done and I appreciate that the show went beyond the usual cute slice-of-life story that I initially envisaged.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8\\n\r\nThe character designs aren't particularly detailed, but are attractive nonetheless.\\n\r\nThe one thing I didn't really understand was Muroto's lips, and then when I saw his sleeping eyes...  I thought it was a funny aesthetic idiosyncrasy to include.\\n\r\nAnyhow, the backgrounds were decent and animation generally consistent.  So all in all, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAh, I will forever be awed by Kanemoto Hisako's ability to sound so effortlessly cute (at least, imo).  She does a good job at playing Kotoura here, and I think really suits the role well.  I haven't really heard her in many other series so I keep being reminded of Ika Musume when she speaks.  (It's not just me, is it?)\\n\r\nFukushima Jun is competent in giving us the slightly silly tone of Manabe.  It's basically the first time I've heard his voice acting and I think he did great.\\n\r\nHanazawa Kana sounds rather different than most roles I've heard her in, but is still pleasant and engaging to listen to, portraying Mifune's enthusiasm very well.\\n\r\nWhen listening to Shimono Hiro as Muroto, I am again reminded of another character, this time Keima (from Kaminomi).\\n\r\nAs for Moritani (voiced by Kubo Yurika), she was nice in general, but I liked her the most when she would become easily upset over little things.\\n\r\nI liked the OP song from Nakajima Megumi, and I thought the main ED, by Chisuga Haruka, was even better.  The other EDs are ... amusing, to say the least.  The background music was also fitting and well-made, so altogether Kotoura-san has a solid soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nManabe is a funny and generally idiotic sort of character, but underneath he's a genuine nice guy and does care very much for Kotoura, so I liked him.\\n\r\nKotoura's character has a really tragic past; it's hard not to sympathise with her.  However, things do improve as she becomes more cheerful upon meeting the rest of the ESP Research Club (which belies the fact that they're really just there to hang out together), particularly Manabe.  I don't remember other psychics' childhoods being explored in this way so the show gets some plus points for that.\\n\r\nMoritani was initially a complete jerk and I still think that the sudden change in her personality was rather unexpected and abrupt, but I eventually grew to like her too.\\n\r\nAs for Mifune and Muroto, I found the dynamic between them fairly interesting, and I wish they'd have developed their relationship further or given us more backstory, though I guess with the main focus on Kotoura and Manabe, there wasn't really time for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThose who like this kind of comedic style will enjoy watching the perverted antics of Manabe.  An entertaining and individualistic series, Kotoura-san looks just like another school-based romantic comedy but her rather dark past and the added dramatic elements make for a great overall package.\\n\r\nIn summary, definitely a very enjoyable show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nFor anyone looking for a good heartwarming anime with a little romance, I'd recommend Kotoura-san.  It's nothing groundbreaking but does a good job at mixing comedy and drama and is a very decent watch.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!  Please give feedback if you found it helpful  (^_\u2212)\u2606",

            "content": "I had some mixed feelings with the anime. While the anime did a good job with the main cast, but I had some problems with it.\r\nWhen the anime started out, it was pretty dark, but became light hearted comedy. It's like Madoka Magica, but in reverse. It's about a girl name Kotoura that has a horrible past because of her ESP. She have a hard time making friends and her parents had a divorce because of her. She can't tell when people are thinking in their mind or if they are actually talking. She blurts out personal things and people were disgusted by her. Peopletreats her as an outcast. When she go to a new school, she meant this person name Manabe. He was the only one that Kotoura can't see how he feel because he is a simple minded perverted idiot. He was the one that slowly open her heart and accepts him. Then they join(forced) ESP Research Club. Where they met Mifune and Muroto. After couple of episodes a character named Moritani join their group. The anime has some arcs that progress nicely and some are episodic. I thought the story was enjoyable and solid for most part.(Excluding episode 11. Geez that episode was anti-climatic) The problem was that some of the character action feels awkward and unnatural. Tbh I feel like some minor/non important characters actions felt kinda not normal. They felt kinda like plot device. Though the anime does a good job mixing light and dark tone in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty nice. I like how the color tone change. When the anime gets dark, it has more of black and dark blue shadings. While the lighter moods as yellowish/orange colorful palette. The character designs was good. They have an interesting design. I like how some characters eyes change depending on the circumstances. When this certain character feel scared their eyes look like you would see in Corpse Party. The facial expression was well done. Props to the animators.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music is average. Nothing special imo. Though I love the opening and endings songs. Pretty catchy and heart touching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters has some good development. You get to grow to love the characters. Though the problem i had with it is that I question some of their actions and decisions. Few characters felt bipolar. Two characters started out as bitches, but at the end they aren't bitchy characters. The one main antagonist in one certain arc motives was pretty crappy and make you like \"bruh really?\" A few part felt kinda melodramatic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think the anime is good. The anime teach you that you shouldn't keep yours feeling inside and tell how you really feel. Also that how you think isn't how the person really feel. I give the anime 7.5/10. It would of been higher if it has some yuri..........",

            "content": "Kotoura-san is a comedy and romance/drama. I typically like fantasy/supernatural, action, and drama genres, so I didn't expect much from this show, but it was surprisingly attractive in its own way. Kotoura's life has been nothing but a road of sad memories ever since her childhood, but now she's taken a different road, starting with the encounter of fellow student shining with positivity. Of course, past mistakes and problems can't be resolved that easily, and it'll take time for Kotoura and her newfound friends to restore the happiness that she had lost.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story might seem a bit tragic at first, and many would expectan emotional coaster, but it really isn't as dark as it seems from first glance. From then on, the show is actually more light and comedic. Of course, the story has its fair share of serious moments as well. I think the story is satisfying even if it is more comedy than drama because Kotoura, the main female protagonist, had a very tragic past, and it was fair that her life was shown to get better after her childhood years of suffering. Otherwise, the viewers would feel way too bad for her and the story would be branded as nothing but a sad and pitiful tragedy that would never be resolved. The stories for some of the main characters were a bit anti-climatic or didn't have much of a resolution, but other than that the main story focusing on Kotoura was nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation weren't top notch but was bearable enough for me to watch the whole series without being disappointed or distracted from the story. I specifically like Kotoura's character design and the others' were fair. The chibi art styles in some scenes were fun to watch and were well done too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe first ED song - Kibou no Sora was rather good and emotional too. The voices were alright, including Kotoura's which was pretty cute. The OP and EDs are nothing memorable but last throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe best part about the show is the main female protagonist, Kotoura who I could relate with the most. Her life experiences and troubles are very similar to mine when I was younger. At some point in my life, I had lost hope too, like Kotoura, and I stopped trying to make friends and shut myself away from the outside world because of how I had been treated in the past. In Kotoura's case, she met a fellow student, Manabe who didn't mind her for who she was and accepted her. (There aren't many people who are like Manabe from where I come from at least) If this were to happen in real life, and a unfortunate person were to meet some good friends, their life would change for the better immediately too, especially if they yearn for company and friendship, so the character development is logical. You can clearly see Kotoura's character development with her opening up to more people and even developing feelings for Manabe. The treatment she got from some of the main characters might have been chilly at first, but one doesn't just expect a student who is made fun of constantly to suddenly become popular with everyone. The way the other characters eventually came to accept Kotoura for who she was flowed really naturally and didn't feel too forced. It took effort to bring the group of friends together which was respectable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe show is enjoyable while being watched, and can provide you with enough fun and interest to finish the show. After watching it and comparing it with some other emotional, drama animes, this show really isn't the greatest one out there, but this show wasn't bad in terms of in the slice of life/comedy genre since it isn't too cliche. A relevant story and clear aim accompanied by enough serious moments are provided anyway. The events are mostly logical and correlates with reality, if that's what you're looking for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThe show isn't anything special and probably won't be too memorable, but it's a good experience to be able to sympathize with some of the characters, at least for me.",

            "content": "As the winter season of 2013 comes to an end, and the new spring season fast approaching, I thought I would take the time to review a little romcom show at the beginning of the 2013 anime season by the name of Kotoura-san; a show, which I feel is slightly above average than what most romcom's would have.\r\nStory (7.48/10): The story of Kotoura-san is interesting nonetheless.  As a big fan of great exposition, I find the one to this show, to be some of the fastest, and most informative exposition in all of anime history.  In just about ten minutes into the show,the first fifteen or so years of Kotoura Haruka's life is revealed to the audience, giving an absolute perfect start for the rest of the series.  From the trials and tribulations of her life, Haruka is now exposed to newfound experiences and joys, from which she had never experienced before.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom this, the anime does seem quite interesting, as the exposition is the reason why this anime is so popular.  As for the rest of the series, well...it doesn't really quite match up.  The idea of the series revolves around Haruka's psychic ability to read people's minds, which gives a quite tragic and devastating-looking story as she suffers bullying and loneliness, completely changing her outlook on life.  This idea is shown and does make up the show, for about 3 to 4 episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I find very confusing about this show, is the fact that it doesn't know what it wants to be.  It wants to be a romantic comedy, involving a perverted guy as the main lead, but it also wants to be a drama show where the main character still faces the problems that she has had for the entirety of her life.  In the end, we get this heavily mixed show, which is the combination of both ideas, which isn't executed as well as it could've been.  Sure, by themselves, we would get a good show either way, but together, it didn't quite seem to click for me.  \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the anime does get a tad side-story like as the anime does go a completely different direction halfway through the anime, and forgets the most important aspect, the mind-reading ability that Kotoura has.  While yes, the anime does go back on track and put that as the main focus again towards the end, it was a bit odd seeing how the anime seemed to forget what it really was in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt a bit rushed too, as the creators seemed to just place a bunch of things together in order to create something that resembled an end.  It felt like a rushed piece of work, and it was slightly saddening for the whole series to end on something so generic and rushed.  Good end, but it was an idea done before.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series altogether felt like a romcom with a small twist in it in the end.  There's nothing wrong with a romcom, (as I watch many of them), but the way it was presented, along with this other idea that didn't click as well as it could've, made it a little awkward to watch.  A fair story still, nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.69/10): Kotoura Haruka, as the main character of the entire show, as well as her last name being the show's title as a whole, is a very standard moe girl with a slight twist to her.  For the most part, she is presented as a girl who has had many hardships in life.  In fact, she is presented as a cold, unsocial girl after the 10 minute exposition.  Beyond the first 2 episodes, Haruka becomes a rather different character, getting embarrassed at the main guy's perverted thoughts, always smiling, and being happy.  It felt rushed.  Like my previous point, the story of Kotoura-san was presented as a tragic story, so it was quite odd to see the actual affected person be so cheerful and happy at the very start of the anime.  Personally, I do like her character, as she starts to open up as she begins to feel like a normal person, as well as having more of a personality than 80% of the anime female world, but the series went a bit to fast on her development to become a general romcom main female.   \\n\\n\r\nNext is Manabe  (I can't remember his first name).  One word, pervert.  Manabe is shown at the very beginning to be a very perverted guy, having these fantasies about Kotoura inviting him to do things, which, coupled with her mind-reading ability, makes for some interesting flip-outs.  Manabe is actually quite generic.  He obviously cares very much for Kotoura, and does his very best to protect and care for her, but honestly, I really can't think of anything else in terms of who or what he is.  His personality really only stems off from Kotoura, and I felt like he really didn't have anything else other than that.  Most of the other characters actually do have better character traits and personalities than him.\\n\\n\r\nMifune Yuriko.  Normally, I wouldn't talk about more characters other than the main two, but this cast of characters is so small, that I felt like I should put more work into explaining the cast in greater detail.  Yuriko is the president of the ESP society, which is the home base for this show.  (Reminds me of Haruhi's SOS brigade.  Even the gender ratios are the same.)  As an outgoing sort of girl, Yuriko actually has quite a lot of depth for a secondary female character.  I could even go as far as saying that she has more than Manabe.  Without spoiling too much, Yuriko has also had a tragic past, and uses it as her motivation for continuing what she is doing throughout the series.  She has a lot of growth as well, and I was surprised that the rest of the cast got a lot of growth in terms of development.\\n\\n\r\nDaichi.  Short guy with glasses, and a strong attachment with Yuriko.  Quite comical and wise.  He's sort of the short end of the stick here.  \\n\\n\r\nMoritani Hiyori.  I find this character to be quite a drastic addition to this somewhat balanced cast, as her initial debut can turn some people off.  As the would-be successor of the Moritani Dojo, (where everyone shouts Mori for every pose they make), Hiyori is shown to have a lot of growth as well by starting off as an antagonist in the good half of the show, and becoming a friend in the meh part of the show.  She gets a good chunk of development, and has some good points to her as a character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters consist of about 5 noticable characters, with two of them being Haruka's family, and the other three being those other ones that help drive the story along.  There's not too much development there for them, but they provide some decent obstacles and support for Haruka's existence, making her a bigger focus for the show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the cast is decent, consisting of fairly well developed females, and underdeveloped males, creating a sort of cast that sort of works, but could use some help.  It wasn't a perfect cast, but it was good enough, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (7.34/10 and 7.65/10): The art of Kotoura-san is a heavily, white oriented palette with most of the colors and character designs featuring a brighter color on the spectrum.  It has a very big slice-of-life and simple feel, as the characters do feature exaggerated expressions with the majority of the episode consisting of them.  (Mostly, Kotoura makes the exaggerated expressions.)  The character designs are mostly moe-heavy, as Kotoura is very moe herself.  The light-hearted looking art is quite pleasing to the eyes and overall quite decent.  It's also quite easy to tell if a character is in a normal state or in a slightly insane state.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is quite an interesting mix.  The OP has a very happy and cheerful feel with a soft voice for the singer.  It's very reminiscent of a romcom show as it sounds somewhat generic.  I wouldn't say it was to the point of it being forgettable, but it does sound somewhat generic.  The ED is a huge contrast, featuring a very sad and tragic song with images of Kotoura as the background.  It sounds pretty damn good, and it was definitely different than normal.  There are still some different ED's as comical ones, like a Kotoura chibi sliding on her stomach across ice, wearing a school swimsuit.  (Not even kidding.)  I like how these tracks contrast, as the OP sort of starts out this anime in a happy and cheerful way, like how the anime is, before ending in a melancholy tone with the ED, always reminding you that you're watching a show with a tragic backstory.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound overall is definitely above average, and not as forgettable as many romance shows have churned out.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.56/10):  I will say that I am on the fence with this one.  On one hand, I like the show, as I truly did feel compassion towards Kotoura for her difficult life and the curse she was born with.  But on the other hand, I felt like it was sort of generic and predictable (as most romance shows usually are.)  I still feel like the show was missing something in order to tie the tragic backstory and the light-hearted present day together, as the story felt like water and oil.  No matter how you mix them up, they won't come together.  Overall though, I did enjoy the show, as the light-hearted comedy did make me laugh some, and the story was quite intriguing for me to continue watching.  In the end, I found this show to be a somewhat confusing show in its idea, but also a slightly rewarding show to watch as well.  It wasn't perfect by any means, but it did provide some decent storytelling and messages throughout.  I felt really happy for Kotoura in the end though, so thats a plus.  Still could've gone without that last arc at the end.  That felt really pointless.  -_-\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (7.34/10)",

It's just amazing how a creator could make it so that you could have a feel all over your heart just in one episode. Basically what he did is make the first episode feel like the ENTIRE series. That's not a bad thing no is it sarcasm. It appears at first to be a happy joy thing, which I tend to not like, and I nearly dropped the anime, but then it got this sudden drop down, very heart sickening partof the episode which made you want to watch more. Then bam, you get this good feel all of the sudden and you're yanked out of the gutter into one of the most amazing main characters of all time. The male protagonist just earns my admiration 100 times over. I have watched about four episodes now, and he'll do almost anything you wished a male character would do, and he is just absolutely full of surprises which you may never expect. It's a worth it anime. Please take this time to open up a playing window, to have the best 80 minutes of your life on those four episodes as like I did. It won't be regretted. \\n\r\nStory: Promising. 10.\\n\r\nArt: I thought at first its pretty mediocre, but it suits the anime. 8.\\n\r\nSound: Clear, I very much enjoy the voices and the music suits all the moods. 9.\\n\r\nCharacter: Aw heck, they got me tied down on this one. 10.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is a very satisfying series to start off the season. 9.\\n\r\nOverall: A solid 9.",

            "content": "Kotoura-San was somewhat of a disappointment and had so much lost potential is just saddening. The first three episodes gave us the impression that Kotoura-San will be more of a romantic dramatic with some comedy to ease the tension. Even though I thought highly of Kotoura-San in the beginning, this show began to deteriorate into a poorly done slap-stick comedy that couldn't even deliver good jokes in no time flat. The romance is barely there and what is there only includes that stereotypical romance with a bunch of blushing and no one acting on their feelings so don't expect a romance as beautiful as Toradoraeither.  Kotoura-San is suppose to be about how Kotoura is able to make and keep friends even though she has the ability to read minds which has driven off everyone else she has ever come in contact with. There's very little to actually enjoy about this show after the first half and just has so much lost potential. A story could of been built off of Kotoura's relationship with her mother and how her friends help her through it or at least involve a growing relationship between Manabe and Kotoura.",

It makes it so difficult to make the viewer believe he's the good guy.\r\nAnother negative point I have is the harsh line between emotional and then comedic moods. One scene will be SUPER emotional (especially the beginning) and then it cuts to extreme clown comedy and it just goes back to emotional every now and then. That's not a bad thing to do in an anime/manga tho, to have some highs andlows, it makes the story juicier. But having such polar extreme moods in one anime click on and off isnt enjoyable to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were fantastic though. The only one character I wish they gave more detail to though, was muroto san. I just felt his character was so flat for the image he has (midget, nerd with glasses). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, tho I did enjoy this anime. Minus the grandfather scene, I would even give this anime an 8.5 or 9.",

            "content": "Kotoura-san has the makings of an exceptional show. It has the ambition to be both an emotional drama and an uplifting comedy, to be an experience full of highs and lows to keep you engrossed to the end. It even has an intriguing premise providing a solid foundation for its narrative. Regrettably, it is clear from the very first episode that not only is Kotoura-san plagued by atrocious writing, it furthermore has the entirely wrong attitude when it comes to the use of drama in general.\r\nKotoura-san tells the story of Kotoura Haruka, a girl with the power to read people's minds. Whilst one would expectsuch a power to be a gift, this unfortunately couldn't be further from the truth for Kotoura, who goes through tragedy and strife. As more and more people reject her, she sinks into the depth of loneliness. Abandoned by her parents and afraid to get hurt, she moves from school to school, keeping people at distance. But upon transferring into yet another school, she meets Manabe, a perverted yet honest individual who accepts Kotoura for who she is, and tries with the help of others to get Kotoura to accept herself.\\n\\n\r\nWith such a promising premise, how did it all go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nKotoura-san, bless its poor, forsaken heart, knows nothing of subtlety. When it comes to the drama, the show's writers want you to know for certain what's happening on screen is tragic, and they are not leaving it up to chance. Kotoura-san makes sure you know by shoving it in your face, being incredibly melodramatic, and blaring histrionic orchestral music at your ears. You can practically hear the director shouting \"ARE YOU SAD YET? BE SAD NOW!\". The writing is so heavy-handed in its approach that the scenes often don't even make sense, as elements designed to make the scenes even more full of anguish are carelessly introduced without proper thought. At worst, things get completely out of hand as you are bombarded with one melodramatic scene after another.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first episode is a perfect example. Kotoura's tragic backstory is told, where each depressing event in her life is immediately followed up by another one, aiming to be even sadder than the last. Eventually it escalates into a ridiculous scene in which Kotoura-san, previously finding her only solace in a stray kitten, breaks down because she is informed that the cat has been taken away, leaving her alone. This would be acceptable, however the woman who informs Kotoura proceeds to shout at her, telling her to \"Leave and never come back!\" for no apparent reason. This is one of the many contrivances used to easily make the scene more emotional, which are the defining hallmarks of Kotoura-san.\\n\\n\r\nThe complete lack of subtlety in Kotoura-san's drama is replicated in the fanservice as well. The fanservice consists of eponymous Kotoura being cute, a rather innocent and likable form. However, when the show wants you to notice how cute she is, it again makes sure this is impossible to ignore; once again you are assaulted with one cute scene of Kotoura after another. Kotoura would be more endearing if not for how persistently the show confronts us with it. That said, the fanservice is still a relative highlight of the series, even if poorly executed like the other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the comedic aspect of Kotoura-san is also lacking. The essential joke of the series is that the male lead Manabe has a perverted fantasy of Kotoura; who will then get embarrassed and annoyed at him. This joke is then repeated throughout the entire series. Funny as it was the first few times, by the fiftieth iteration of the joke it was getting incredibly tedious. It is fortunate that the show invested in other jokes, however these are also repeated frequently and whilst some of the jokes were funny enough to withstand constant repetition, the majority were not. The repetition of this poor comedy becomes a dull monotony for the viewer. Additionally the humour comes at often inopportune times, causing a large emotional whiplash when placed right in the middle of a dramatic scene, a problem that pervades the entire show. If you are the sort that likes \"perverted humour\" then the comedy will most likely be more amusing, and will sustain its freshness for much longer.\\n\\n\r\nFor the writers, all that seems to matter is the result. They appear not to care if the story makes little sense or is filled with plot holes; so long as the dramatic scenes are saturated with sadness and woe, they consider it a job well done. This attitude is ultimately what's responsible for the terrible writing. It is indeed unsurprising that the writer who was unable to come up with enough jokes to last the series, was also unable to write more than one pattern of character development. Kotoura-san is rescued from her depression by her friends (notably Manabe) at least three times. This wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that it's the same issue every time, simply disguised by a different context. Ultimately what happens every time is that Kotoura becomes self-loathing and depressed because she blames herself for bad events, only to be \"saved\" by Manabe and the rest of her friends. Call me a cynic, but although it is clear that Kotoura suffered a tramautic past, the drama feels insincere when Kotoura is saved by Manabe through the same process multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, romance, and drama that make up the plot of Kotoura-san were in shambles. The quality of writing is dismal, it desired the story to end up a cohesive mix of these disparate narrative elements, but either they couldn't be bothered to actually put in the time and effort to make it work within a story, or they were simply unable to. Whatever the reason, the sheer quantity of inconsistent tone and plot holes is almost insulting- it's a depressing thought that this standard was deemed acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and character designs were of low quality, they both look messy and have very little detail. For the comedy segments this is not so much a problem, as the 4koma style character designs suit it well. However, when it comes to the dramatic scenes the character designs are in stark contrast to the melodrama, and appear incredibly awkward when the art gets in your face. The music is generic and lacks subtlety, dramatic scores being employed ruthlessly in every single scene bar one notable exception that verges upon melancholy. The opening is cute and likable, if not ultimately forgettable; the ending is simply nondescript.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the characters are all pretty likable. They evoke sympathy from the audience even if they are well defined by a limited number of distinctive traits, and are at times enjoyable to watch; you certainly shouldn't have a problem with any of them. Well, perhaps apart from Moritani. She starts the series as an antagonistic figure, only to have her personality overhauled, leading to an abrupt and irrational character change that is poorly explained. Again, the attitude of the writing shines through once again. However, there is one facet of Kotoura-san that was done right, and that was the romance. The relationship that develops between Manabe and Kotoura was surprisingly well done over the course of the series, despite it's repitious nature. Their interaction isn't complex or deep, but in a show where characters can just change personality at the drop of a hat, it was a real highlight.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the incredibly forceful attempts to evoke emotion in Kotoura-san is stifling, demonstrating an extreme example of the \"tell not show\" attitude to drama. If you can ignore poor writing, and relish heavy-handed drama and comedy, then this show will probably be of great enjoyment to you. If, on the other hand, you loathe over the top melodrama and care at all about plot progression, then Kotoura-san is nothing more than a trainwreck.",

            "content": "Our childhood is often filled with many blanks and not much memories. The few you might remember are some friends you made or games you played.\nBut, what if the memories you remember most vividly were the ones filled with bullying,ignorance, and broken hearts? \nKotoura-san starts off as a seemingly sad and powerful drama. Maybe a bit generic. What throws people off is that after the first half of the show, it just hits you with all this comedy that you weren't expecting. This is probably what caused the downfall of the show. I can't say I exactly disliked the comedy, but it would've been betterif the producer had focused a bit more on the drama. Still, there were some good comedy moments, and the drama was well played.\\n\\n\nThe art is nice and fits the mood of the story. It is a bit generic, but if you're a fan of moe, then the artwork might be something for you. There sad and happy moments of the story are portrayed pretty nicely, the coloring and shading helped the mood.\\n\\n\nCharacter development has its sweet and heat breaking moments. From Kotoura starting to learn to trust her friends and deal with yet, more bullying, to Moritani learning to deal with jealousy, it was pretty nice to watch. And so...friendship is building up between Moritani and the rest of the ESP Research Club. One thing that did kinda bug me was that the relationship between Kotoura and her mom was not really in depth. It seemed like they introduced her in the beginning and just decided to put her off for a while.\\n\\n\nOverall, the drama mixed with comedy makes this show pretty enjoyable. (Manabe having pervy dreams of Kotoura really makes this worth watching lol) Of course, I'd love to see Kotoura overcome more challenges as well. This show left me with mixed feelings. There were some moments I really enjoyed, yet some I felt kinda bored with. Nonetheless, I still think the drama part of the show displayed some pretty valuable lessons.  \\n\\n\nIt seems the biggest problem the show is having is the transition from hardcore drama to just plain comedy. I don't find this much of a problem since I think a show that's too serious is just plain boring. I recommend that if you're expecting Kotoura-san to just be a really good drama, then it's best you don't watch it. Of course, this is just my opinion.",

            "content": "Wow... Just wow. This show easily makes it onto my highest favorites. There is nothing I can truly nit pick about the show that would detract me from my rating. It took me for a ride I won't soon forget.\r\nStory: This is among the most emotional stories I have ever had the grace and the priveledge of experiencing. I'm not lying when I say this: It deserves to be seated in the high heavens for the drama genre. Why? Haruka's backstory alone had me under emotional torture. The show itself proved how serious it can get when it wants to, and boy they wasted notime in doing so. I have never had a stronger first impression for any show of any medium (yes, even stronger than Clannad). That isn't the say the story is always dramatic; in fact the comedy was equally well done. I might have broken a lung in laughter. Even if it's the same gag, there's still the hint of freshness in that it's done differently each time in differently awkward, yet appropriate situations. Bottom line: If you have any sympathy in you, then this show will exploit every part of it. It's likely the show will crush your soul once or twice, but it also leaves you happy and satisfied. Kotoura-san is absolutely top tier in it's story, and it's not just a simple Romantic Comedy. This story is one for the ages! 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nArt: It's simple, doesn't try to innovate, or invoke scenery porn all the time; but it's that simplicity which makes it very clear what we should be feeling and when.The graphics were very pleasant to watch, and I had no problem with it whatsoever (especially since I marathoned the show) .The special effects were also very pretty to look at and weren't overdone in the sense that they never distracted me from the one fantasy element the show focused on: the telepathy. The character designs were plain for the most part, but very cleanly done which is fitting for telling a story in an otherwise mundane setting. I didn't see any notably bad off modeling (QUALITY!!) during my marathon. I found all of the characters' movements to be enjoyable and sensible except for one: Daichi \"fish lips\" Muroto. His mouth was just too weird and strange for me to watch, and I can't see why they made that his default expression. He looks like a derp to me when he's supposed to be the smart one, and that doesn't register well with me. Still, the art overall is simple, yet elegant and vividly expressive. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting was absolutely perfect! The characters' emotions and personalities were portrayed in a very clear and concise manner on top of sounding their age. The characters' feelings can be readily felt in their voices, and each voice suited each character in each situation to excellent degrees. The opening and ending themes didn't catch on with me at first, but I grew to love them. As for the soundtrack, I didn't just hear the music, I felt it too. The classical music inspired soundtrack also accompinies the story to carry the appropriate emotions. Seriously, listen to the prolouge theme, as in right now. It is the most profound example of this phenomenon the OST can provide. Otherwise, the simplicity wins again, both in my heart and in it's catchy listening value outside the show. Pure ear candy 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It's amazing how much I attached myself to the main heroine in just 10 minutes. She is among the deepest and most dynamic characters I've ever followed. Everything about her from her personality, motivations, and thought processes is perfectly justified and empathic to  me. Manabe couldn't be a better foil for her, even if he tried. A guy who freely admits his perversion and an overall free and flexible thinker makes for the best long-term counter to Kotoura's telepathy in the most enjoyable way possible. Manabe may be an idiot, but his heart is definitely in the right place and he knows it! The guy definitely earns his balls as well as Kotoura's love by the end. The main supporting cast also develops surprisingly well and likable over, but some of those character's motivations were sold a bit short (I'm looking at you, Moritani, and your distaste for dojo inheritance). Muruto's neutral stance towards Mifune is also annoying and baffling to me, but not extremely so. Otherwise, the characters felt human and were dramaticly driven and they all had real power behind them. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I marathoned the entire show in just one night. That alone speaks volumes how much I enjoyed this show: it was an insatiable addiction! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: WATCH IT! I don't care who you are, or what genre you're normally into. Do yourself a service: drown in your own tears, break yourself in laughter, and/or just enjoy the ride. It's probably the wildest emotional roller coaster out there if you can stand seeing Manabe's perverted thoughts. 10/10",

            "content": "Have you ever tried rubbing lemon on your eyes? Because that pretty much describes what this show tries too hard to do. Forced drama, everywhere. \r\nSo the first five or so minutes of the first episode is the part where all the people ate up for some reason and it apparently managed to leave such an impact that people thought that this show was going to be good just from those five minutes alone. So this girl can read other people's minds, but her feelings get hurt because she doesn't realize she has such powers, and she's a bit insensitive because she was young. Alright,that's not too bad so far. It's fairly realistic as far as fictional mind reading powers go, but then stuff happens. Namely, the \"everyone is conveniently an asshole and stupid\" cliche- Where if you are too lazy to give a character a well written tragic backstory, then fuck it, just force it! Just make everything around them happen conveniently to drag them down! What makes me baffled is that it's not like the writers did not have the time to devote a whole episode for this; Instead, it's just rushed and feels completely forced, leading to an extremely lazy writing. In its original form as a 4Koma comic, this wouldn't be a necessity, but as an adaptation, I think it needs some more attention especially if you're trying to tell a serious story. \\n\\n\r\nSo, apparently Kotoura remains stupid about her mind reading powers while growing up and doesn't learn to shut up about it, and eventually pisses off her parents because her father is the most irresponsible father ever and her mother is just genuinely retarded. Instead of believing multiple doctors claiming that Kotoura is not a compulsive liar, she decides to believe her homeroom teacher who says she is. Who needs those PHDs? Then she sort of ditches Kotoura in her grandfather's house, and then the actual plot happens. Well, not before showing us that Kotoura gets more traumatic experience out of her favorite cat not being at the usual spot than being ditched by her parents. Brilliant. She eventually comes across the main character while still showing off that she can read minds, although she fully realizes that she's going to get her feelings hurt anyways about it because she's retarded- And what a surprise, the main character's mind is all wacky and funny! It's almost like some people honestly don't give a shit about Kotoura for once because she's the most important person ever! Realism! This apparently causes Kotoura to take interest just because he just so happened to not pay attention to her presence like every other human being that was ever around Kotoura in her life. That being said, this main character is awfully written too. He's solely characterized by his wacky silly perverted mind, and the writers can't seem to stop making overdone jokes about this, and this continues to drag on every episode in this show. Of course, outside of this, he acts like the most generic main character ever and serves as a white knight of sorts to Kotoura because everyone around her happens to be conveniently a dick just so that the main character can have a role. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait, there's more! More dumb characters are introduced; Daichi and Yuriko. They're both members of some stupid ESP research club, which I don't see how it got approved in the first place. Yuriko's initial plan was to use Kotoura's ability to prove to people that psychics were real because her mom died because nobody believed that she was a psychic. Now, I don't see how showing off that Kotoura is psychic proves whether her mom was ever a psychic in the first place, but that'd be too logical. Furthermore, why would Kotoura even agree to help Yuriko when clearly mind reading only makes her depressed? There's literally no reason. \\n\\n\r\nBut there was a reason after all- The show uses this as an excuse to introduce the next half-assed character. This character is named Moritani, and she is in love with the main character because of whole ten seconds they shared in the past. This causes her to get jealous of Kotoura because she was attracting all the attention from the main character. And then the next part is just awful: Kotoura makes a mistake, and accidentally ends up reading someone else's mind, so clearly this means that she has to actively target someone visually to read their mind. It's not something passive where she just 'hears' other people's minds. Therefore, she can technically just choose not to read minds at all, which is precisely what she doesn't do ever and she barfs all over herself because that's what people do when they're depressed and realize that others think badly of you. Then the main character defends Kotoura because she gets bullied yet again despite it being her own fault completely, which triggers Moritani to become even more jealous and causes her to order her friends to beat him up. Yeah, I'd call someone else to beat my secret love interest too because that's a smart thing to do. And she even manages to ask for help from people associated with her family dojo, so it's clearly impossible for that someone to realize she was responsible for it. \\n\\n\r\nSo at this point, it should be pretty noticeable that every 'drama' in this series is half-assed, forced, and just completely caused because the characters are mentally deficient. It's like watching a movie about zombie apocalypse where everything bad happens only because the characters are dumb and one just lets the zombies in because he thought he needed some fresh air- Except worse, because at least those movies are visually fun- This show is just boring, forced conflicts happening just for the sake of having a conflict. Then they constantly try to cram what they classify as \"comedy\" in, which includes a scene where the main character imagines Kotoura in a swimsuit or something. It's like the writers can't make up their mind about what they wanted to write, so they just taped the two together without any regard for transition. And unfortunately the show only gets worse from here- The show eventually introduces a mystery arc, where in theory, it should be interesting in conjunction with Kotoura's mind-reading powers. \\n\\n\r\nSummary of the \"mystery\" arc: Kotoura does something stupid and she gets into a trouble. In this particular case, she walks alone at night when she fully realizes it's dangerous to do so because there's a culprit somewhere in the local area, meets a person who's pretty much a stranger at this point, and follows that person only to realize that person was the culprit all along. This sort of twist would make Shyamalan shake his head in disapproval. And then the last episode just quickly resolves the whole mother-Kotoura conflict that the series has been building up to for the entire cour in five minutes. Brilliant pacing. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering how much useless filler there was in this series, this wouldn't really be classified as  \"rushed.\" Now one may argue that since this is an adaptation of a 4-koma comic, you shouldn't expect a well-written story. But that is the silliest argument, because if the series is going to attempt to take itself seriously, then it should be treated as such. The fact is simple; They tried to cram some drama in and failed pretty hard. Hopefully after this show, people won't decide that a show is going to be \"good\" just from the first five minutes of the first episode.",

I'll keep this short.\r\nThe characters are amazing. Their are constantly very funny scenes that will definitely make you laugh. It can be really emotional too.\r\nI enjoyed all 5 eps so far. Will definitely watch more of this amazing anime. It can be a little too cheesy at some parts but the reaction of the characters totally blow it away (almost).\r\nAnyways I highly recommend this to anybody. My little brother even watched it and loves it (he's9). It does have perverted scenes but that's nothing really.",

            "content": "Prepare yourselves for a good brief enjoyment.\r\nAt the beginning, we got a great dose of drama. To be honest I almost cried. I was worried about if they could do a good job mixing the comedy and the drama, without making any drastic change, but after ten minutes I was laughing and during all the anime both were mixed very well. Besides, although the drama is a little bit exaggerated, it will reach you and you will establish an emotional bond with the main character quickly. In addition, the story transmits a good message about the injustice of the way the society thinks, unfortunately itis too forced, for being too cruel and for being too pure. Kotoura has had problems with establishing relationships because of her ability to read people\u00b4s minds and according to the anime, everybody except her new friends have bad thoughts all the time. And that is something I didn\u2019t like because it is not very realistic. However, that\u2019s the only bad point of the story. It is enjoyable and charming.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not something that will amaze you but you will be comfortable with and surely you will enjoy the expressivity of the faces when they are surprised. There are some people that didn\u2019t liked the way the mouth of Muroto is drowned, but I found it very funny and a good way to give liveliness to one of the less participating characters.\\n\\n\r\nReferring to the sound, I know when a soundtrack is good when in the scenes I notice that background music stringing along with the moment. In this case I didn\u2019t realize at all. They are suitable for the scenes but nothing to be aware of. The same goes for the opening and ending songs and seyus. They all do their job good but without delighting us.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, they are pretty well done, however I think they could have done a better job with their psychological part. The main character, as I said before, has problems to socialize and the huge problems she has had and the distrust she has in people disappear surprisingly quickly as she met Manabe. I think it would have been great to give that part more importance, but I understand that with only 12 chapters they have to focus in other things. Referring to Manabe, the main male character, he is very simple but his perverted thoughts and the relationship he has with Kotoura offers plenty of comedy, and a little bit romance, to the anime. About Moritani, I didn\u2019t like her psychological evolution very much either. She is also a lovely character, but it is unrealistic how fast she stops having bad thoughts about Kotoura. And the last thing I would like to remark about is Kotoura\u2019s mother. I like the  role she has, it is essential for the drama part, but like I\u2019ve said, it would have been great if they had developed psychologically more this character and give more emphasize and more depth to the relationship between Kotoura and her. The other characters, although they fulfill well their part, there is no need to say anything else about them.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, it is a very entertaining anime, which mixes very well drama and comedy. I enjoyed it very much. However, because of its length, it cannot offer an in depth psychological part but enough to catch your attention and to teach you a little bit of empathy. I recommend it if you are looking for something light, charming and entertaining, but I don\u2019t if you are looking for a great drama or something that will move your heart.",

            "content": "As a fan of romantic comedies, I'm always looking for ones with a good balance between both genres and are enjoyable to watch. At some point along the line I stumbled upon Kotoura-san which happened to have two of my favorite genres. Catching my attention, I watched all 12 episodes, and I have to say, It's not the best I have seen, but it was certainly a good brief of enjoyment and I wouldn't have minded a second season. \r\nStory: The plot follows a young girl named Kotoura, who has the ability to read peoples minds. Due to this, it has caused various issues withher relationships, leading her to seclude herself from other people. But this changes when a boy named Manabe accepts her ability and takes an interest in her which leads to them joining the ESP club, introducing the other cast members. I found the story enjoyable to watch. It's fairly simple and straightforward, but it's not cliche either. The story starts of with a nice dose of drama, which I found shocking considering the genre of the show. It gives you the back story of our protagonist, Kotoura, and you get a feel for her character and how her ability actually had a huge impact on her as a person. It gets you emotionally connected with her, and sets you up for the rest of the story. But, despite the seriousness of the first episode, it goes straight to comedy and light-hearted scenes which get's you laughing. There were some scenes in the show that I felt were over-dramatic and exaggerated, but it added a good balance between comedy and serious moments. The plot also portrays this theme of injustice and bullying in society, which I think is realistic to our world today and it keeps the story interesting. As far as the romance goes, It's not what you would expect. The show does touch on it but there wasn't that much development, but it does go somewhere by the end of the show. It isn't literally stated that the characters are dating, nor did they kiss, but by the end they become aware of their feelings and confess to each other. The conflicts become resolved by the end too. Kotoura comes to accept her ability and she makes up with her mother who was divorced because of her psychic powers. The story overall is good, and it's charming in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation isn't the greatest, but it isn't bad either. I found myself comfortable with it and didn't find the show unpleasant to watch. I thought the character designs were cute, and the facial expressions of the characters were fun to watch and had me surprised. I didn't like how muroto's mouth looked, but it was certainly unique and something I haven't seen before.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was fine. The BGM's were a bit plain, but they were noticeable and fit the scenes. I thought the OP was cute and fun to listen to, as well as the ED. Not something you would listen to outside of the anime, but it wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters weren't the most interesting, but they weren't bland, dead characters either. At the least, they are fun to watch. There was some character development too. In the beginning, Koutora resented her ability to read people's minds and even wished she didn't live. But this changes throughout the story. After she met Manabe, the rest of the cast members and formed a bond with them, you notice her becoming a little more positive and more proactive than before. She comes to accept her ability due to the support of her newly found friends, and she found her place in the world after being rejected by society for so long. All the characters are unique, with their own personalities. Manabe is the pervert of the group, adding a lot of humorous scenes. Muroto is the intelligent one, a lot more quiet than the rest of the cast. Moritani actually bullies Kotoura in the beginning, but eventually becomes friends with her and joins the ESP club. She is the most violent one of the group, attacking Manabe on occasions, adding to the comedy and light-heartedness of the show. Yuriko is the leader of the ESP, constantly making plans and watching over the group. She tries to use Kotoura at first for her own gains, but that changes by the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall, Kotoura-san was satisfying and it was worth the watch. The romance wasn't what I was hoping for, but the comedy was good. If your looking for something light hearted with a good mixture of serious moments then this is for you.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "(this review contains spoilers)\r\nKatoura-san was terrible because of how disappointing it was.\r\nThe first episode was AMAZING. It was so well put together, but then the rest, absolute horse shit.\r\nThe writers somehow think it's funny to have an old man mol\u0084esting his little granddaughter. They make jokes about him touching her and feeling her up all the time. It's not funny! It's just sick! I couldn't help but cringe and these moments that were supposed to be humorous. \r\nThe other jokes suck because they're repetitive. Pretty much every other joke revolves around the fact that the main male protagonist is per\u0084verted, and Katoura can read minds,so obviously it leads to some awkward situations. But they reuse this AGAIN, and AGAIN, and AGAIN, and AGAIN. Literally, like 99% of the jokes in this anime are just that reiterated. \\n\\n\r\nOther parts of the anime are just ridiculous beyond words! \\n\\n\r\nThere's this one part of the anime where Katoura reads the mind of a stranger by accident, and sees incredibly dark and grotesque things that causes her to faint. She then learns that there is a person in the city who is beating high school girls to a pulp and then leaving them there. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the show has a plot twist. The person doing it turns out to be one of the female police officers who is somewhat developed throughout the last two episodes. It was a slightly expected but decent plot twist. But right when you think the show is getting better, it gets worse. \\n\\n\r\nKatoura realizes that the reason the officer is beating these girls is because she had a terrible, abusive childhood. We also learned from the previous character development that the officer is antisocial and has pretty much no friends. Basically, the officer is jealous of these girls so she beats them. \\n\\n\r\nKatoura realizes this when she is cornered by the officer who is going to attack her. But Katoura pours out her heart to the officer and explains how people do care about her and if she were to open up, she would have more friends.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the officer feels ashamed and turns herself in.\\n\r\nSeems logical, right? Heh.\\n\\n\r\nWhen she turns herself in, she takes on Katoura's advice and asks her coworker to lunch after she gets out of prison.\\n\\n\r\nSo, think about it. You're working with someone, and you JUST figure out that she's been BEATING HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS HALF TO DEATH ALL AROUND THE CITY, and then SHE ASKS YOU TO LUNCH. You would obviously turn her down, right?\\n\\n\r\nNooooo! The guy doesn't even act the least bit shocked that he figured this out about his coworker and takes her up on the offer and sees her off, like NOTHING HAPPENED. \\n\\n\r\nNOTHING HAPPENED?! WHAT?!\\n\\n\r\nWhat's worse is how repetitive this anime is.\\n\r\nBesides this, all the other tangents involve Katoura being sad and running away and her friends coming to get her. It's just that over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing particularly wrong with the art or the music/sound.\\n\r\nThe story is just so terrible, repetitive, unrealistic, undeveloped, anticlimactic, lazy, and impossible to take seriously.",

            "content": "Well then. \r\nFirst off ill give a short reason why i decided to pick this up.\r\nI absolutely love watching RomCom's so i decided to watch this. Simple as that. But what intrigued me was that the main heroine had psychic mind reading powers, i somehow thought that having that kind of thing in the anime would have delicious drama involved. And i was right.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe way they started this anime, on episode one, i somehow thought it was going to be an amazing anime. The first 11 minutes was just crazy, incredibly tragic and sad. And somehow in the same episode it turned from crazydramatic-ness into something pretty damn hilarious. being a some what veteran of anime watching it was seriously easily predicted that she would get a few friends that would support her regardless of her freakish powers. Even though i knew that i still felt happy for her when she made her first friend. \\n\r\nOverall the story started out kind of nice i suppose but it started to feel a little bit awkward. I cannot really explain how but it just is. The story had potential to be something better but then it went downhill and then it went up hill but then downhill or some thing like that. But overall the story was not bad but at the same time not something spectacular. \\n\r\nA lot of things seemed really sudden, at least to me it did. One particular scene was the rooftop scene with Tsukino. I've seen many scenes similar to that, where the main characters win their battles by just talking and pleading. But man did that happen so quick. She started her plea and within 30 seconds it worked. What the flying F**K? Maybe it's just me. Maybe i just don't like things happening so fast. \\n\r\nThe process is more interesting not the result.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nI gotta say the art for this is not to my liking. I won't go as far as to say that it completely sucks. Maybe it is a sort of art style, a new style that i have not seen much before. I just think that it feels lazy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI almost never even notice the background music playing because i feel that it just isn't that great. It doesn't really stand out. There are only 2 tracks i liked, the ending theme song, which was pretty nice and peaceful and had a lot of great meanings behind it , and the track that played during the serious moments. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nManabe: \\n\r\nManabe is a pretty cool guy. He doesn't afraid of anything.\\n\r\nEven though he is seriously a perverted master of some sort he really does care about Kotoura which is pretty cool, a typical feature in all the main male leads in pretty much all animes.\\n\\n\r\nKotoura:\\n\r\nHer character was pretty interesting to watch grow. I know i made some kind of grammar mistake in that previous sentence.... \\n\r\nANYHOW. She had so much doubt in trusting people and in people trusting her and even decides to run away to prevent hurting others, but in the end she goes back. Good for her!\\n\\n\r\nYuriko:\\n\r\nI would say she's a bitch for trying to use someone just for her own selfish needs but in the end she is really guilty about it so i guess it's all yippy skippy.\\n\\n\r\nMuroto:\\n\r\nDid i spell his name right? Ill just call him Megane-Kun.\\n\r\nMegane-kun was a really interesting character. For one he is small as hell and smart as hell. He always has that =3 kind of face on but whenever he does not have it on it means he is serious. I always enjoyed seeing his serious side. The stuff he says to Yuriko is really great, \"I will neither help you or stop you, i am here because i choose to be\" That's some pretty cool sh*t.\\n\\n\r\nMoritani:\\n\r\nTruth be told, i really did not like this character. The show wudve been the same , if not better, without this character. She just .... sucks.... but at least she had the guts to confess to Manabe in the end. But still. she sucks.....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nEhhh this show was alright, it had potential to be a lot better but that's not to say that it was really bad. It is a pretty average anime, i probably would not recommend it to a random person, but if you kind of find this anime interesting from the given synopsis i will do nothing to stop you from watching it. But just a friendly warning , do not expect much from it.\\n\\n\r\n~Til next time\\n\r\nTomislol\\n\\n",

After a lot of downs in her life , she transfers to a new school , where a guy called Yoshihisa Manabe , the typical type of high school boy , carefree and perverted , gets interested in her . Seems that bit by bit Kotoura'slife takes another turn as they streghten their bond.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nInteresting art in my opinion , but the thing is that it's really catchy and smooth . Character design is well done , no complains about anything , I actually praise it .\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nNothing special at all , but the op and ed might catch some of the anime viewers .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\\n\r\nYou get a highschool perverted student and a shy girl . The perfect combination. These two elements go along incredibly well and makes it super enjoyable . \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nOn this anime , I can say that I easily lived the most depressive 10 moments of my anime life . It got a great emotional impact on me . There are presented true things that actually happen in the real life , all the situations link themselves up and creates an enjoyable atmosphere .\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nAs I said , this might look poor , but I think nobody can deny the potential this anime has , to become recognized between the anime fans . I higly recommend it , believe me , once you watch the first episode it's going to get addicted , and you will spend beautiful time watching it :) So , give it a try folks !\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kotura-san is a ham sandwich\u2026\u2026..      (Nurse, he's out of bed again!)\r\nLet me elaborate, what i mean is that the aforementioned sandwich which consists of bread and ham shares similar qualities with Kotura-san, and its not that their both assembled by underpaid employees who spend most of their days wishing the earth would explode..(although thats also true..) Its that both are quite good if you simply want a cheap quick snack, or if your just not really hungry for something more substantial. Ones a food, ones a anime (their both cops!) but no-one said they were gonna be filling\u2026\r\nBut enough ofthese high flying and bitingly witty sandwich analogies (always popular at parties) lets talk plot\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nKotura-san is, rather obviously, about Kotoura, no problems so far, although i must say i really love the amount of imagination and pizzaz they put into the title, thats a good sign right\u2026  \\n\\n\r\nKotoura Haruka is a 15-year-old girl who can read people's minds. Now you'd think this would make her the luckiest person in the world, and it should, but Kotoura is\u2026 well she's an idiot. And so logically she uses her powers idiotically, reading peoples minds and spitting out their secrets for all to hear. This causes her to be shunned by those around her, even her her own parents who go so far as to ditch her on her millionaire grandpa and piss off, (millionaire?). After this traumatic experience she shuts herself off and becomes bitter and melancholic, moving from school to school as a result. That is until she arrives at generic high school number 300192, where she meets Manabe Yoshihisa, one of her classmates, who because of his simple and kind hearted nature quickly accepts and appreciates her for who she is, creepy mind reading ability and all. And so gradually Kotura begins to open up and tries to live the life she always wanted, to simply be happy with her friends (and drive around in a van solving mystery's). \\n\\n\\n\r\nI would describe the plot in this series (using the, universal measuring system of sandwiches, naturally), as being just plain bread and butter. Its pretty much by the numbers what you'd expect, a lone socially awkward student transfers into a new school, they think its gonna be just like all the other schools (japan must have like a north south jerk divide when it comes to schools\u2026), they meet someone who understands them or accepts them for what they are, blah blah blah, they join a weird club, theres some obstacles or problems to overcome but at the end everyones better friends because of it. (By the power of Friendship!!!!)\t \\n\r\nWhatever, we all know the plots not the reason we're watching a series called kotoura-san released in January\u2026. the month were rejected idea's come together to blow their own brains and hope the ensuing spectacle will at least mildly entertain us.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets get to the meat of this series, or rather, (snicker,\u2026) the ham!!!!  (oh I'm sorry, did i get some of my wit on you, I do apologise.)\\n\r\nSo of course its Katoura, and first things first\u2026. GOD DAMN IS SHE CUTE, like they took every ounce of cuteness they had saved in the cute bank and shoved it into Katoura shares, she's cuter than a baby lambs pet kitten, I mean they pulled every trick in the preverbal book to make you sympathetic to this character, not only is she ridiculously cute but they also gave her own over the top tragic back story, one that would make even Clannad fans roll their eyes\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nBasically life treated her as it own personal shuttlecock and knocked her for six (phrasing, boom!). This caused her to close herself off until she met Manabe who immediately accepts her, and also almost immediately, she changes into what she really is, a timid little girl who just wants to loved (ah, bless). And thats really about it, (keep in mind this all happens in the first episode). After that theres not much to say about Katoura's character, she pretty much just falls into the role of \"female rom-com character\", there are some sweets bits with her mother here and there but its far too little far too late. Her mind reading ability is also never really looked into or explored, why can she read minds? can others? how does it work?  can she turn it off and on? In fact as the series goes on its almost forgotten, only working when its convenient for the plot. In fact this whole series could exist without the mind reading ability at all, just replace it with any social stigma and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference. \\n\\n\r\nBut my real peeve with this character is her uselessness, constantly throughout the show despite effectively having a super power, Katoura-san proves to about as useful as a magnifying glass to a blind man. No matter what the situation Katoura-san needs the help of someone else (usually Manabe) to save her, i can understand it at the beginning, but later, hmm i don't know\u2026 Unfortunately it all makes for a very predictable watch, which is real shame because there was some potential in Katoura to be an interesting character, but whatever... \\n\\n\r\nIn short kotura is defiantly the best thing about the show as she's just so damn cute and can deliver a nice scene once in a while, but unfortunately thats all there really is, she's like a sandwich cut into an amusing shape, fun to look at but still just a sandwich\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are just damn forgettable, Manabe is the most boring human being on the planet, he's in love with Katoura-san, and thats it\u2026 he'd throw himself in front of a truck to save Katoura's shoe. What did he do before she came along, was he just a robot pre-programmed to activate when he met Katoura? We learn nothing about him, other than he has mildly naught thoughts about women occasionally (that BASTARD!).  They give us no reason at all to care or relate to this guy, his every thought and move seems to be dictated by Katoura's existence, it's very charming but boring as hell to watch. (His sandwich ranking = bread thats fallen on ground...) \\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for everyone else. there's Yuriko, the club president who wants to prove her mother was really a physic by using Katoura, but it goes nowhere and just sort of fizzles out\u2026 There's Moritani who starts out interesting but then just becomes wallpaper... and then there that other guy who blah blah blah, voice of Katsuargi Keima from the world god only knows, blah blah blah, dry bread\u2026\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk comedy, since this show is a comedy, the majority of humour comes from Manabe fantasising about Katoura-san and then Katoura getting embarrassed and angry. But the show works on the logic that jokes get funnier the more times you see them, does it work, you decide\u2026(hint, it doesn't).  I can defiantly see some people enjoying this style of humour but it wasn't my particular sandwich so if you like the usually rom-com style of comedy then you'll probably enjoy this, if not theres nothing really new here for you. (sandwich ranking= Marmite sandwich) \\n\\n\r\nOne thing i want to say about the art style, is that this series was made by some of the same people who created Mitsudomoe, and this similar style can really be seen in Katoura-san particularly with regard to  making the series look as cute as possible, a skill that was well honed in Mitsudomoe. Just thought id put that in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Katoura-san is a pretty weak series that offers very little in the way of anything new or interesting, despite its interesting premise. However the show is difficult to hate despite its many flaws, due to the cute and charming way in which its presented, it manages to have its nice moments but unfortunately they're not enough to save the show from the depths of mediocrity where it will surely fall. If you are a big fan of rom-coms and just want to watch another one, then Katoura-san will fit the bill perfectly, but if your like me and want something more from a series, then Katoura-san will leave you still feeling hungry\u2026 And speaking of hungry all this talk of food has made me just that, I'm off to get something to eat, i think i'll make myself, you guessed it\u2026.            \\n\\n\r\nsoup... \\n",

            "content": "Kotoura-san is a series that exceeded my initial expectations.  Please read on to find out why:\r\nStory: 8\r\nI started getting Sankarea vibes after a couple of episodes, since Kotoura-san began with somewhat heavy drama before turning into more of a romantic comedy (with some occasional drama), but I did enjoy the show very much, just like I did Sankarea.  Other than that, I guess these two series are rather different so don't read too much into my comparison.\r\nWe have a fairly unique premise (I don't personally remember many other anime about psychics, especially portrayed as they are here), and I think that the storywas sufficiently interesting to follow in the end.\\n\r\nBeing adapted from a yonkoma, I expected comedy and I wasn't disappointed.  Though Manabe's pervertedness (if that's a word) did get a bit overdone, I still found it funny to watch, especially seeing Kotoura's reactions to said pervertedness.  The more dramatic elements were also generally well done and I appreciate that the show went beyond the usual cute slice-of-life story that I initially envisaged.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8\\n\r\nThe character designs aren't particularly detailed, but are attractive nonetheless.\\n\r\nThe one thing I didn't really understand was Muroto's lips, and then when I saw his sleeping eyes...  I thought it was a funny aesthetic idiosyncrasy to include.\\n\r\nAnyhow, the backgrounds were decent and animation generally consistent.  So all in all, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAh, I will forever be awed by Kanemoto Hisako's ability to sound so effortlessly cute (at least, imo).  She does a good job at playing Kotoura here, and I think really suits the role well.  I haven't really heard her in many other series so I keep being reminded of Ika Musume when she speaks.  (It's not just me, is it?)\\n\r\nFukushima Jun is competent in giving us the slightly silly tone of Manabe.  It's basically the first time I've heard his voice acting and I think he did great.\\n\r\nHanazawa Kana sounds rather different than most roles I've heard her in, but is still pleasant and engaging to listen to, portraying Mifune's enthusiasm very well.\\n\r\nWhen listening to Shimono Hiro as Muroto, I am again reminded of another character, this time Keima (from Kaminomi).\\n\r\nAs for Moritani (voiced by Kubo Yurika), she was nice in general, but I liked her the most when she would become easily upset over little things.\\n\r\nI liked the OP song from Nakajima Megumi, and I thought the main ED, by Chisuga Haruka, was even better.  The other EDs are ... amusing, to say the least.  The background music was also fitting and well-made, so altogether Kotoura-san has a solid soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nManabe is a funny and generally idiotic sort of character, but underneath he's a genuine nice guy and does care very much for Kotoura, so I liked him.\\n\r\nKotoura's character has a really tragic past; it's hard not to sympathise with her.  However, things do improve as she becomes more cheerful upon meeting the rest of the ESP Research Club (which belies the fact that they're really just there to hang out together), particularly Manabe.  I don't remember other psychics' childhoods being explored in this way so the show gets some plus points for that.\\n\r\nMoritani was initially a complete jerk and I still think that the sudden change in her personality was rather unexpected and abrupt, but I eventually grew to like her too.\\n\r\nAs for Mifune and Muroto, I found the dynamic between them fairly interesting, and I wish they'd have developed their relationship further or given us more backstory, though I guess with the main focus on Kotoura and Manabe, there wasn't really time for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThose who like this kind of comedic style will enjoy watching the perverted antics of Manabe.  An entertaining and individualistic series, Kotoura-san looks just like another school-based romantic comedy but her rather dark past and the added dramatic elements make for a great overall package.\\n\r\nIn summary, definitely a very enjoyable show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nFor anyone looking for a good heartwarming anime with a little romance, I'd recommend Kotoura-san.  It's nothing groundbreaking but does a good job at mixing comedy and drama and is a very decent watch.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!  Please give feedback if you found it helpful  (^_\u2212)\u2606",

            "content": "I had some mixed feelings with the anime. While the anime did a good job with the main cast, but I had some problems with it.\r\nWhen the anime started out, it was pretty dark, but became light hearted comedy. It's like Madoka Magica, but in reverse. It's about a girl name Kotoura that has a horrible past because of her ESP. She have a hard time making friends and her parents had a divorce because of her. She can't tell when people are thinking in their mind or if they are actually talking. She blurts out personal things and people were disgusted by her. Peopletreats her as an outcast. When she go to a new school, she meant this person name Manabe. He was the only one that Kotoura can't see how he feel because he is a simple minded perverted idiot. He was the one that slowly open her heart and accepts him. Then they join(forced) ESP Research Club. Where they met Mifune and Muroto. After couple of episodes a character named Moritani join their group. The anime has some arcs that progress nicely and some are episodic. I thought the story was enjoyable and solid for most part.(Excluding episode 11. Geez that episode was anti-climatic) The problem was that some of the character action feels awkward and unnatural. Tbh I feel like some minor/non important characters actions felt kinda not normal. They felt kinda like plot device. Though the anime does a good job mixing light and dark tone in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty nice. I like how the color tone change. When the anime gets dark, it has more of black and dark blue shadings. While the lighter moods as yellowish/orange colorful palette. The character designs was good. They have an interesting design. I like how some characters eyes change depending on the circumstances. When this certain character feel scared their eyes look like you would see in Corpse Party. The facial expression was well done. Props to the animators.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music is average. Nothing special imo. Though I love the opening and endings songs. Pretty catchy and heart touching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters has some good development. You get to grow to love the characters. Though the problem i had with it is that I question some of their actions and decisions. Few characters felt bipolar. Two characters started out as bitches, but at the end they aren't bitchy characters. The one main antagonist in one certain arc motives was pretty crappy and make you like \"bruh really?\" A few part felt kinda melodramatic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think the anime is good. The anime teach you that you shouldn't keep yours feeling inside and tell how you really feel. Also that how you think isn't how the person really feel. I give the anime 7.5/10. It would of been higher if it has some yuri..........",

            "content": "Kotoura-san is a comedy and romance/drama. I typically like fantasy/supernatural, action, and drama genres, so I didn't expect much from this show, but it was surprisingly attractive in its own way. Kotoura's life has been nothing but a road of sad memories ever since her childhood, but now she's taken a different road, starting with the encounter of fellow student shining with positivity. Of course, past mistakes and problems can't be resolved that easily, and it'll take time for Kotoura and her newfound friends to restore the happiness that she had lost.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story might seem a bit tragic at first, and many would expectan emotional coaster, but it really isn't as dark as it seems from first glance. From then on, the show is actually more light and comedic. Of course, the story has its fair share of serious moments as well. I think the story is satisfying even if it is more comedy than drama because Kotoura, the main female protagonist, had a very tragic past, and it was fair that her life was shown to get better after her childhood years of suffering. Otherwise, the viewers would feel way too bad for her and the story would be branded as nothing but a sad and pitiful tragedy that would never be resolved. The stories for some of the main characters were a bit anti-climatic or didn't have much of a resolution, but other than that the main story focusing on Kotoura was nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation weren't top notch but was bearable enough for me to watch the whole series without being disappointed or distracted from the story. I specifically like Kotoura's character design and the others' were fair. The chibi art styles in some scenes were fun to watch and were well done too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe first ED song - Kibou no Sora was rather good and emotional too. The voices were alright, including Kotoura's which was pretty cute. The OP and EDs are nothing memorable but last throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe best part about the show is the main female protagonist, Kotoura who I could relate with the most. Her life experiences and troubles are very similar to mine when I was younger. At some point in my life, I had lost hope too, like Kotoura, and I stopped trying to make friends and shut myself away from the outside world because of how I had been treated in the past. In Kotoura's case, she met a fellow student, Manabe who didn't mind her for who she was and accepted her. (There aren't many people who are like Manabe from where I come from at least) If this were to happen in real life, and a unfortunate person were to meet some good friends, their life would change for the better immediately too, especially if they yearn for company and friendship, so the character development is logical. You can clearly see Kotoura's character development with her opening up to more people and even developing feelings for Manabe. The treatment she got from some of the main characters might have been chilly at first, but one doesn't just expect a student who is made fun of constantly to suddenly become popular with everyone. The way the other characters eventually came to accept Kotoura for who she was flowed really naturally and didn't feel too forced. It took effort to bring the group of friends together which was respectable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe show is enjoyable while being watched, and can provide you with enough fun and interest to finish the show. After watching it and comparing it with some other emotional, drama animes, this show really isn't the greatest one out there, but this show wasn't bad in terms of in the slice of life/comedy genre since it isn't too cliche. A relevant story and clear aim accompanied by enough serious moments are provided anyway. The events are mostly logical and correlates with reality, if that's what you're looking for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThe show isn't anything special and probably won't be too memorable, but it's a good experience to be able to sympathize with some of the characters, at least for me.",

            "content": "As the winter season of 2013 comes to an end, and the new spring season fast approaching, I thought I would take the time to review a little romcom show at the beginning of the 2013 anime season by the name of Kotoura-san; a show, which I feel is slightly above average than what most romcom's would have.\r\nStory (7.48/10): The story of Kotoura-san is interesting nonetheless.  As a big fan of great exposition, I find the one to this show, to be some of the fastest, and most informative exposition in all of anime history.  In just about ten minutes into the show,the first fifteen or so years of Kotoura Haruka's life is revealed to the audience, giving an absolute perfect start for the rest of the series.  From the trials and tribulations of her life, Haruka is now exposed to newfound experiences and joys, from which she had never experienced before.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom this, the anime does seem quite interesting, as the exposition is the reason why this anime is so popular.  As for the rest of the series, well...it doesn't really quite match up.  The idea of the series revolves around Haruka's psychic ability to read people's minds, which gives a quite tragic and devastating-looking story as she suffers bullying and loneliness, completely changing her outlook on life.  This idea is shown and does make up the show, for about 3 to 4 episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I find very confusing about this show, is the fact that it doesn't know what it wants to be.  It wants to be a romantic comedy, involving a perverted guy as the main lead, but it also wants to be a drama show where the main character still faces the problems that she has had for the entirety of her life.  In the end, we get this heavily mixed show, which is the combination of both ideas, which isn't executed as well as it could've been.  Sure, by themselves, we would get a good show either way, but together, it didn't quite seem to click for me.  \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the anime does get a tad side-story like as the anime does go a completely different direction halfway through the anime, and forgets the most important aspect, the mind-reading ability that Kotoura has.  While yes, the anime does go back on track and put that as the main focus again towards the end, it was a bit odd seeing how the anime seemed to forget what it really was in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt a bit rushed too, as the creators seemed to just place a bunch of things together in order to create something that resembled an end.  It felt like a rushed piece of work, and it was slightly saddening for the whole series to end on something so generic and rushed.  Good end, but it was an idea done before.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series altogether felt like a romcom with a small twist in it in the end.  There's nothing wrong with a romcom, (as I watch many of them), but the way it was presented, along with this other idea that didn't click as well as it could've, made it a little awkward to watch.  A fair story still, nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.69/10): Kotoura Haruka, as the main character of the entire show, as well as her last name being the show's title as a whole, is a very standard moe girl with a slight twist to her.  For the most part, she is presented as a girl who has had many hardships in life.  In fact, she is presented as a cold, unsocial girl after the 10 minute exposition.  Beyond the first 2 episodes, Haruka becomes a rather different character, getting embarrassed at the main guy's perverted thoughts, always smiling, and being happy.  It felt rushed.  Like my previous point, the story of Kotoura-san was presented as a tragic story, so it was quite odd to see the actual affected person be so cheerful and happy at the very start of the anime.  Personally, I do like her character, as she starts to open up as she begins to feel like a normal person, as well as having more of a personality than 80% of the anime female world, but the series went a bit to fast on her development to become a general romcom main female.   \\n\\n\r\nNext is Manabe  (I can't remember his first name).  One word, pervert.  Manabe is shown at the very beginning to be a very perverted guy, having these fantasies about Kotoura inviting him to do things, which, coupled with her mind-reading ability, makes for some interesting flip-outs.  Manabe is actually quite generic.  He obviously cares very much for Kotoura, and does his very best to protect and care for her, but honestly, I really can't think of anything else in terms of who or what he is.  His personality really only stems off from Kotoura, and I felt like he really didn't have anything else other than that.  Most of the other characters actually do have better character traits and personalities than him.\\n\\n\r\nMifune Yuriko.  Normally, I wouldn't talk about more characters other than the main two, but this cast of characters is so small, that I felt like I should put more work into explaining the cast in greater detail.  Yuriko is the president of the ESP society, which is the home base for this show.  (Reminds me of Haruhi's SOS brigade.  Even the gender ratios are the same.)  As an outgoing sort of girl, Yuriko actually has quite a lot of depth for a secondary female character.  I could even go as far as saying that she has more than Manabe.  Without spoiling too much, Yuriko has also had a tragic past, and uses it as her motivation for continuing what she is doing throughout the series.  She has a lot of growth as well, and I was surprised that the rest of the cast got a lot of growth in terms of development.\\n\\n\r\nDaichi.  Short guy with glasses, and a strong attachment with Yuriko.  Quite comical and wise.  He's sort of the short end of the stick here.  \\n\\n\r\nMoritani Hiyori.  I find this character to be quite a drastic addition to this somewhat balanced cast, as her initial debut can turn some people off.  As the would-be successor of the Moritani Dojo, (where everyone shouts Mori for every pose they make), Hiyori is shown to have a lot of growth as well by starting off as an antagonist in the good half of the show, and becoming a friend in the meh part of the show.  She gets a good chunk of development, and has some good points to her as a character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters consist of about 5 noticable characters, with two of them being Haruka's family, and the other three being those other ones that help drive the story along.  There's not too much development there for them, but they provide some decent obstacles and support for Haruka's existence, making her a bigger focus for the show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the cast is decent, consisting of fairly well developed females, and underdeveloped males, creating a sort of cast that sort of works, but could use some help.  It wasn't a perfect cast, but it was good enough, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (7.34/10 and 7.65/10): The art of Kotoura-san is a heavily, white oriented palette with most of the colors and character designs featuring a brighter color on the spectrum.  It has a very big slice-of-life and simple feel, as the characters do feature exaggerated expressions with the majority of the episode consisting of them.  (Mostly, Kotoura makes the exaggerated expressions.)  The character designs are mostly moe-heavy, as Kotoura is very moe herself.  The light-hearted looking art is quite pleasing to the eyes and overall quite decent.  It's also quite easy to tell if a character is in a normal state or in a slightly insane state.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is quite an interesting mix.  The OP has a very happy and cheerful feel with a soft voice for the singer.  It's very reminiscent of a romcom show as it sounds somewhat generic.  I wouldn't say it was to the point of it being forgettable, but it does sound somewhat generic.  The ED is a huge contrast, featuring a very sad and tragic song with images of Kotoura as the background.  It sounds pretty damn good, and it was definitely different than normal.  There are still some different ED's as comical ones, like a Kotoura chibi sliding on her stomach across ice, wearing a school swimsuit.  (Not even kidding.)  I like how these tracks contrast, as the OP sort of starts out this anime in a happy and cheerful way, like how the anime is, before ending in a melancholy tone with the ED, always reminding you that you're watching a show with a tragic backstory.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound overall is definitely above average, and not as forgettable as many romance shows have churned out.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.56/10):  I will say that I am on the fence with this one.  On one hand, I like the show, as I truly did feel compassion towards Kotoura for her difficult life and the curse she was born with.  But on the other hand, I felt like it was sort of generic and predictable (as most romance shows usually are.)  I still feel like the show was missing something in order to tie the tragic backstory and the light-hearted present day together, as the story felt like water and oil.  No matter how you mix them up, they won't come together.  Overall though, I did enjoy the show, as the light-hearted comedy did make me laugh some, and the story was quite intriguing for me to continue watching.  In the end, I found this show to be a somewhat confusing show in its idea, but also a slightly rewarding show to watch as well.  It wasn't perfect by any means, but it did provide some decent storytelling and messages throughout.  I felt really happy for Kotoura in the end though, so thats a plus.  Still could've gone without that last arc at the end.  That felt really pointless.  -_-\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (7.34/10)",

It's just amazing how a creator could make it so that you could have a feel all over your heart just in one episode. Basically what he did is make the first episode feel like the ENTIRE series. That's not a bad thing no is it sarcasm. It appears at first to be a happy joy thing, which I tend to not like, and I nearly dropped the anime, but then it got this sudden drop down, very heart sickening partof the episode which made you want to watch more. Then bam, you get this good feel all of the sudden and you're yanked out of the gutter into one of the most amazing main characters of all time. The male protagonist just earns my admiration 100 times over. I have watched about four episodes now, and he'll do almost anything you wished a male character would do, and he is just absolutely full of surprises which you may never expect. It's a worth it anime. Please take this time to open up a playing window, to have the best 80 minutes of your life on those four episodes as like I did. It won't be regretted. \\n\r\nStory: Promising. 10.\\n\r\nArt: I thought at first its pretty mediocre, but it suits the anime. 8.\\n\r\nSound: Clear, I very much enjoy the voices and the music suits all the moods. 9.\\n\r\nCharacter: Aw heck, they got me tied down on this one. 10.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is a very satisfying series to start off the season. 9.\\n\r\nOverall: A solid 9.",

The first three episodes gave us the impression that Kotoura-San will be more of a romantic dramatic with some comedy to ease the tension. Even though I thought highly of Kotoura-San in the beginning, this show began to deteriorate into a poorly done slap-stick comedy that couldn't even deliver good jokes in no time flat. The romance is barely there and what is there only includes that stereotypical romance with a bunch of blushing and no one acting on their feelings so don't expect a romance as beautiful as Toradoraeither.  Kotoura-San is suppose to be about how Kotoura is able to make and keep friends even though she has the ability to read minds which has driven off everyone else she has ever come in contact with. There's very little to actually enjoy about this show after the first half and just has so much lost potential. A story could of been built off of Kotoura's relationship with her mother and how her friends help her through it or at least involve a growing relationship between Manabe and Kotoura.",

It makes it so difficult to make the viewer believe he's the good guy.\r\nAnother negative point I have is the harsh line between emotional and then comedic moods. One scene will be SUPER emotional (especially the beginning) and then it cuts to extreme clown comedy and it just goes back to emotional every now and then. That's not a bad thing to do in an anime/manga tho, to have some highs andlows, it makes the story juicier. But having such polar extreme moods in one anime click on and off isnt enjoyable to experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were fantastic though. The only one character I wish they gave more detail to though, was muroto san. I just felt his character was so flat for the image he has (midget, nerd with glasses). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, tho I did enjoy this anime. Minus the grandfather scene, I would even give this anime an 8.5 or 9.",

            "content": "This is my first review in a while, so please bear with me!\r\nKotoura-san is basically about a girl, named Haruka Kotoura, who has ESP. Unfortunately, due to her ESP, her life has been completely ruined. That is, until she meets Yoshihisa Manabe, who, despite his perverted nature, accepts her as a friend. It's basically about Haruka finding love and acceptance, despite the disasters in her past.\r\nThis was one of the anime I had planned to watch during the Winter 2013 season, but I forgot about it until earlier this year. I thought that Kotoura-san would be a comedy, and for the most part, I wasright (and a great one, at that). Trust me, I laughed at nearly every joke there was in this series, even Manabe-kun's fantasies about Kotoura! It's not just comedy, though; it has a touch of drama in it, too, along with romance between Kotoura and Manabe-kun. I think Kotoura-san is one of the only anime that can mix rom-com and drama that well.\\n\\n\r\nThis series also has great music! I fell in love with the OP very quickly, and it took me a while to like the ED, too, but I did! Also, you either like or hate all of the characters because of that little spark they have about them. The art and animation isn't the best, but you'll get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion? Kotoura-san is definitely an anime worth the watch. Don't pay attention to the relatively low score it has here on MAL; it's much better than that. I know what's on your mind right now; you want to watch Kotoura-san right away. Go ahead!",

The ending \"arc' I guessis also out of place and dumb.\\n\\n\r\nArt:: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved this anime's art style, its colorful, bright and moe, however I understand that can get old to some audiences.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 I guess?\\n\r\nAnime like this are why I don't like that MyAnimeList has a sound catagory, because there's nothing to say about it. It's fine, not exactly memorable but not bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters are written pretty flatly with a generic-ish backstory following them around, besides Kotoura who can get annoying at times but can also come off as very charming. Her dynamic with Manabe really shines, but you could argue that's not exactly because of their personalities and it's more because of their \"quirks\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWhere this anime shines is completely through its comedy and how far they're willing to push its premise. The premise of a girl who can see what other people think, who's only friend is a complete pervert has a lot of comedic mileage, and Kotoura-San does its best to do all it can with it. That being said if you don't find the premise interesting or you don't enjoy the shows brand of comedy, you will not enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you enjoy the shows brand of humor and think its premise is quirky enough to ignore its shortcomings, this show is really great. However, its pitfalls make it really hard to enjoy the show as anything more than a comedy.",

            "content": "Kotoura-san: She Already Knows What I'm Going To Say\r\nGoing into this series, I thought we had another generic, cheaply animated AIC comedy on our hands. However, this series really throws you for a loop as soon as you watch the first 15 minutes. It has the start of a tragedy series with some rather heart-wrenching moments as you watch a little girl's family collapse all around her.\r\nThe story of this series revolves around a girl named Haruka Kotoura who has ESP, the ability to read minds. She discovers this gift at an early age, although her family, friends, and peers have difficulty adjusting to it.Kotoura usually says what others are thinking aloud which causes several problems as well as causes marital problems between her mother and father. After taking her to several specialists and being run through many difficult troubles, Haruka's mother abandons her, leaving her in the care of her grandfather. After moving from school-to-school and isolating herself from making friends, she encounters a boy at her new school named Manabe that sees her power differently from her peers. He immediately befriends Kotoura and stands up for her when she is in trouble. The series revolves around Kotoura meeting new friends at her new school and overcoming even more hardships. She decides to join the ESP Research Society Club, a rather strange club at her school where she meets another character that had to overcome a difficult past.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some people might have found the tone of this series to be rather herky jerky, I found the tonal shifts of this series to be a pleasant surprise and the biggest strength of this series. Kotoura is really not what you'd expect it to be. It turns from tragedy to comedy on a whim and I found it to be a refreshing take on the comedy genre. There were several aspects of this series I found to be endearing. While there are plenty of animes out there that stress the power of friendship, I don't think there are many as powerful as this series in regards to how much of an impact it can really have. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters played a big role in that regard and I'd consider it one of the strengths of this series. Manabe was genuinely one of my favorite friend/potential love interest characters I've seen in an anime. Kotoura wasn't the strongest of leads, but she had her redeeming qualities. I found it easy to sympathize with her character due to her past experiences going into this series. The ESP Research Club members were certainly interesting to say the least with Mifune the club president who's goal is to prove ESP exists to avenge her mother (who had ESP) and Muroto the vice president, the quietly quirky childhood friend of Mifune. There is one other main character named Moritani who will play an intricate role in the series as it progresses and her roles in the series become more and more interesting. I found every character that was introduced to be interesting in their own ways, especially the Kotoura family members.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this series was a pleasant surprise, it still had pretty obvious weaknesses. The biggest in regards to the story was that this series seemed to take a rather strange turn toward the middle-latter half of the series. The story became less about Kotoura and her power and more about the club trying to solve a mystery about an assailant that's been attacking high school girls. To be honest, this mini-arc seemed really out-of-place and didn't do much in the grand scheme of the series. It did have subtle moments with Manabe and Moritani that sort of helped in regards to character development...but didn't do much to progress the story. It didn't seem very well written and watered down the series as a whole. To be honest, I found it boring. Let's just say if there's a 3-4 episode stretch in a 12 episode anime that bores me, that doesn't bode well. I thought they probably should've tried to put a little more focus on Kotoura's relationship development with her friends and family since I found that to be the strongest aspect of the series. I also found some of the logic applied to the series to be a little strange and off-putting. It just took some strange approaches toward addressing certain issues in the series. I won't go into detail as to what they are for spoiler reasons, but they aren't very hard to pick up on. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is definitely not one of the stronger suits either. There isn't anything remarkable about the animation as the character models are rather bland and don't have much detail. It seems a little strange at first since this series starts off on rather tragic events. That is one of the problems with a series like this. It has comedy and tragedy elements so the animation style only suits one of the styles in particular. Still, I felt the animators should've tried to find a happier medium.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did find this to be one of AIC's better works of late. After the disappointment that was Seitokai no Ichizon Lv 2 and the simplistic zero plot comedy that was Acchi Kocchi, it was nice to see AIC try something a little different with Kotoura-san. This series is sort of a difficult one to recommend because it really seems like one of those series you're either going to really love or really hate. I wouldn't call Kotoura-san a groundbreaking comedy in regards to mixing and matching genres, but it was a really nice attempt. If you liked a series like Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, you might want to give Kotoura-san a chance. I wouldn't quite put Kotoura-san on Chuunibyou's level, but I did feel its comedy was slightly better and it's drama to be a bit worse. All-in-all, Kotoura-san is like an exotic food. You're either going to really like it or really dislike it...but it is at least worth a try if you're into the comedy/romance/tragedy genre.",

            "content": "I am a fan of the romantic comedy genre, despite the many flaws that plague it, and hence I started watching Kotoura-san absolutely ready to like it without setting expectations too high. The first episode started out promising, and it seemed like Kotoura-san could be a really heartwarming story at the beginning.....\r\n......Yeah, you've probably guessed it. Barely 3 episodes into the series (probably even before that), Kotoura-san starts rolling downhill. Fast. And it never really recovers.\r\nDon't get me wrong. Kotoura-san had a lot of potential and there are moments when it really delivers as a rom-com. Unfortunately, these blink-and-you-miss moments make up a very smallfraction of the show, and before you know it we are back to a lumbering narrative which really seems unsure of where it is going, grates upon your nerves and only succeeds in making the show an ordeal to watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory:6\\n\r\nTo be honest, this part of the show probably deserved a 4 or a 5, the only reason I award it a 6 because the original premise was rather novel. A story about love and friendship centering around a girl who is shunned because of her ability to read minds.....that can't be too bad, right?\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Kotoura-san suffers from innumerable plotholes. Permit me to refine that metaphor: Kotoura-san seems bent on creating artificial plotholes and dragging itself into them.  Cliches basically litter the storyline, the drama is overdone even for  romantic comedy, and it repeats itself far too often. The writing ranges from mediocre to downright atrocious, and the end result is a storyline that downgrades itself from potentially fun to positively meh. Kotoura-san labours through 12 episodes with a plotline that could have been completed in four.\\n\\n\r\nArt:6\\n\r\nI'm not sure about the art aspect: I personally thought it was okay and it seemed to go well with the storyline of the show, though I would say this art style isn't for everyone, especially not for those who prefer gorgeously detailed, visually pleasing anime. Animation is fairly average throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nGood enough for the show. Voice acting was above average and actually managed to freshen up an otherwise flagging plot on more than one occasion. While the opening theme is not bad, I liked the ending theme more. It is, overall, one of the better aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:6\\n\r\nAnother big problem for Kotoura-san is the treatment of its characters, especially the show's namesake Haruka Kotoura. With the (admittedly good) intention of making her a touching character, they try to accentuate her loneliness and her tendency of blaming herself when others get hurt because of her ability to read minds. That in itself is not bad, but there is a very, very fine line between well executed drama and melodrama. And unfotunately, both the show and its protagonist grossly overshoot the mark. The result: Kotoura-san basically drones on the same theme in 11 out of 12 episodes, and it's hardly pleasant.\\n\r\nThe other characters in the main cast vary in quality: Yoshihisa Manabe is a stereotypical male lead complete with exaggerated stupidity, erotic fantasies, and the 'I'll always protect you' vibe, Chizuru Mifune is funny and likeable in parts, although her motivations and the reason behind them are testimony to the lack of quality in the writing department, Daichi Muroto is not very often noticeable, but he is good in the times he does get to talk, however his motives and decisions are also questionable. Hiyori Moritani is initially the bad guy( I mean girl), who midway through the series does a complete one-eighty (no surprises there). Overall a very average character.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is small and mediocre. Kotoura's grandpa tries to be funny but isn't really so, and is positively creepy in parts. Kotoura's mother is actually present in only about four episodes, and her exaggerated indifference and hatred is predictable and boring. The monk guy is there for some reason which I still haven't figured out, I'm pretty sure the story would have been pretty much the same without him. One or two characters appear here and there, but there isn't really much to say about them \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nI actually regret giving this a 6...there were parts of the show that were enjoyable and without all the plotholes and drama, the score here could have easily been an 8.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nWould I recommend Kotoura-san to you? That's a hard one to answer. Watch it if you can, but try not to pay too much attention to the story and you might end up enjoying it for what it manages to do right. It won't take a Sherlock Holmes to find far better series in the rom-com genre than this, though.",

            "content": "Although not a perfect anime, it should deserve the 9 rating. It has a lot of good storytelling and some memorable characters with a good light-hearted comedy. The characters are memorable as well people like Kotoura who is the main female protagonist and Manabe, the main male protagonist. The people in the ESP club like Mifune and Muroto have some of the most funny interactions ever and so have the main two protagonists. This show is not without it flaws, however. The show started to become a slice of life comedy by the end of episode four. Although later it picks up in episode 9and ends until the end of the serials. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe Story of Kotoura-san is about this girl who was born with the ability to read people's minds. Unable to differentiate between what humans' thoughts are and what speech is, she would  often say things that are really people thoughts. Because of this, she didn't make a lot of friends because they would outright reject her after she would say their secret. It was not until she meets Manabe, a perverted yet light-hearted person who eventuality becomes her first friend that accepts her for what she is even though that means she may read his perverted thoughts. And also the club of ESP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nMost of the characters of this series had major character development and were all interesting and memorable. I thought they could have show the background of Manabe because we don't know what his family background. Other than that, the characters all changed throughout the series as it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nNothing really to say but just beautiful and amazing. It fit show greatly and nothing too stylish as it may even damage the animation and it overall tone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nVery enjoyable with the slice of life parts and latter parts but it was hard to watch the first 10 minutes of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was great with music able to fit perfectly with the tone of the setting with both melancholic to dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIt's a great supernatural show with a mixed bag of slice of life, comedy and drama. The characters are great and each bring their own to the table and overall of the story. There are no useless characters within the story.",

Who wouldn't want to read a teacher's mind and get all the answers to a test or be able to fight another person while knowing what they are going to do next? You might not want to after watching Kotoura-San, because the basis of this anime is about how a young girl must deal with a power which she can't control and which ruins her life.\r\nStory-\r\n  Enjoyable story and pretty dramatic at times. Some of the things which happen to Kotoura makes you want to thank the god of your choice that you are not in her situation, while othertimes you wish that you could smack the people that mistreat her so much. But is only enjoyable. It will not be winning the Oscars anytime soon so don't expect too much from the story when you watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\n Art was pretty good. It really captured the emotions of the different characters, whether they be embarrassed, happy, or sad. I thought that the artwork was perfect for this anime and I couldn't ask for anything else because it just seemed to fit. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\n The characters included a very colorful cast of people. From the extremely perverted Manabe to the Katsuragi Keiima copycat Muroto, the characters were interesting and each had a very unique personality. I felt that Korouto's character developement was very enjoyable to watch, because it showed her journey from the abused and lonely child that she was to a more confident person who finally had people who were by her side and would not leave her. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nI loved it. That's all i can really say. I loved the comedy and character interactions. It really made me laugh out loud when Manabe or some other character made fun of Kotoura. And the way she responded to them was too funny and cute. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\n  Watch Kotoura-san expecting to feel something. Watch it expecting to feel say or happy because you will, laugh, groan, or cry at the situations that the characters get into. I found myself disregarding the story most of the time just to watch a specific scene again and again because it was really cute, so gut wretchingly sad, or so ridiculously funny that i couldn't go on without seeing it again.",

Most likely one of my favorite shoujo so far, and i'm not even all that interested in that kind of stuff normally.\r\nThough it is short, it's lovable in that sense, not ever dragging on (and on and on and on...) like other anime.\r\nMy favorite part if the series would have to be the character-focused story arc that inherently comes with deep character development, especially involving Kotoura herself, whom i found to be quite engaging and watching her personal growth throughout the brief time given.\r\nTrying not to indulge too much into spoilers, i found that she started with atragic story about loss, but it ended in a perfect way, giving good closure to most of her problems.\\n\r\nI have only one criticism: the story could be a bit more focused. Around the beginning it's a sound solid plot, but begins to drift a bit when a random detective mystery is crow-barred into it (may i add that Muroto-kun would be a perfect detective Conan) and the ending, although giving closure, does it by rushing a bit, trying to fix all of her problems in one fell swoop.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, this is a terrific anime and i would definitely recommend it",

            "content": "So much lost potential... It makes the show almost unbearable to watch!\r\nI see so many people liking this, but honestly, it's a bigger disappointment than Tokyo ESP (and that's no easy feat). Like Tokyo ESP which offers us a first episode of mindless violent badassness, Kotoura-san starts by telling the story of... You guessed it, Kotoura! The girl was born with the ability to read minds, except she didn't know she was differnet to begin with, which led to a lot of complications. She is called a freak, everyone hates her, her parents get divorced after she accidentally reveals that they had been cheating oneach other,  her mother (who was in charge of her)grows to hate her (and show that in no unclear terms) and abandons her too, the one pet she finds (kinda) to keep her company is taken away from her and all the while she can hear everyone both physically and mentally blaming her. The coloring is done brilliantly, starting from colorful at her first days, gradually becoming darker and darker. Mere words cannot describe how amazing a villain set this is. In less than 12 minutes the show has created the background for one of the best psychotic monsters in media history. The girl had amazing potential for evil incarnate, one of those creatures beyond hope, wearing the shell of a human, wanting nothing but watch the world burn, utterly consumed by the pain inside.\\n\\n\r\nWell, apparently she wasn't \"beyond help\" after all and in fact hadn't yet developed any psychotic tendancies. In all that self-isolation she apparently kept hidden a very loving and caring character instead of deep all-consuming hatred for everything that is humanity. After the first 12 minutes of holy-s#%t-hardcore drama the show throws at us, Kotoura (now 15), rerolls at her new school where she meets a MORON who apparently doesn't care about her mind reading abilities and starts thinking \"funny\" goofy things that cheer her up and make her a happier person. By all means male lead, go jump off a cliff. After that the whole show turns into a comedy and Kotoura's background is gradually explored. Kotoura also starts developing feelings for the retard that stopped what could have been abyssely evil. Sorry but I just cann't let it go! He's like a cockblocker for psychos!\\n\\n\r\nThe show goes full cliche after this. In fact it annoyes me a loooot that Kotoura doesn't have any major traumas. She does have occasional awkard moments but nothing serious.(Spoilers alert) At some point she even finds her mother (who was a total bi#%^ to her) and forgives her without a second thought. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. Or more importantly, you can't do that show! You just can't! You can't just write off what you have shown be to be completely horrible and dark experiences that would drive anyone insane in a month, let alone 15 F%$@ING YEARS.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is incredibly cutesy, especially for Kotoura-san (who's more or less a loli) but makes the males seem somewhat silly. The music fits and with the exception of the main male lead which I would like to choke the voice acting fits good.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show had started as a comedy I propably would really like it, but by the gods, you can't throw so much hardcore drama at us and then go full comedy/slice of life.",

So they were forced to make 8 more episodes of useless filler and pandering.\r\nI'll be rating the series separately based on this\r\nThe first part is a 9/10\r\nThe animation is amazing, at first glance I thought it kind of looked generic and bland, but Kotoura-san shows that even simple animation can become great if done correctly. Soundtrack is also excellent, it fits the theme of the show and a lot of the songs give that heartwarming vibe whichmakes a series so fun to watch. There's more character development in these first few episodes than the entire rest of the series. Even minor characters aren't ignored and get so much development they practically change character. The story is great and the main draw of the show. An roller coaster of emotions which is enough to even make a grown man cry.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the series is a 2/10\\n\r\n1 point for the soundtrack\\n\r\n1 point for Kotoura-chan\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever want to see a perfect example of how to ruin a great series, watch Kotoura-san.",

Honestly u would expect a decent plotline coming out of it, but you really just get ateen's boy sexualizing kotoura in almost every way possible.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7) - good, but far from amazing\\n\\n\r\nSound (5) - the sound in the show varies in effectiveness, sometimes it works RLLY well, and sometimes its completely random\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5) - i did say the story was killed for the characterization right, so it might be sad to know that the characters SUCK too!  The only character that i can possibly think change throughout the story is kotoura, and even then mildly.  If the story was better, maybe the characterization wouldnt have to be developed through direct stating of change by the characters.  This show should be given a 3 for character, but kotoura brings it up to a 5.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) - this may seem suprisingly high for the other reviews ive given it, but it would be a lie to put it any lower.  kotoura san makes sure to hit one place that keeps the viewers' attention forever: the heart.  This anime is FILLED with heartwarming scenes and the emotional climax in the last few episodes is pretty epic.  The club as a whole is pretty funny to watch, and even tho manabe is a hopeless pervert, he manages to make it up to kotoura.  this anime DEFINITELY has replay value, simply because the anime itself doesnt rely on a strong story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) - As i said, LARGELY based on enjoyment.  kotoura san is a load of shit when you think about it, but when you get past the ugly moments, u'll see an anime that not only brings out emotions, but becomes a heartwarming classic.",

In fact, most anime companies now have improved their animation quality to provide better quality. In fact, I really liked how they tackle with dealing with relationships especially family problems. eg. Kotoura and her mom's misunderstanding. I also like how they get to know one another and build relationships and understanding.\r\nHowever, my big problem with the show is the characters. The characters are very obnoxious and flat out stupid especially the main cast (Yoshihisa & Haruka). I really couldn'tinvest myself into the characters and their dilemma and what they are going through. Not only that the drama is hard to watch. The comedy wasn't that funny.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka has parents that abandoned her and treated her like garbage just like Rea Sanka from SankaRea. The difference is Rea Sanka picks up more courage and goes through better development than compared to Haruka. Haruka is just a crybaby who is always self-doubting herself about her ability to read people's minds. When Tsukino tried to attack Haruka, Haruka just cries in the corner and does nothing at all. (damsel in distress)\\n\\n\r\nHere is an advice to Haruka \"It is good to have the ability to read people's minds and in fact some of my favorite character have such an ability like you. I also feel sorry for you for having your mother abandoned you but that doesn't mean you can cry non-stop and always panic when you are in danger. Take a good look at Rea Sanka, she really can conquer her problems. In fact, I liked her determination. She is not a crybaby. You also have good friends who support you.\" \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, I forgot to mention Hachiman from Oregairu was bullied by others and nobody cares for him but he never complain and cry like Haruka.\\n\\n\r\nWow! This is going to be a dramatic story with lots of \"What kind of drugs are they on when they came up with this?\". Let me tell you, I have seen a lof of anime characters gone through way worse situations than any of the characters in this anime, and they never cry and complain.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really like this anime, good for you.

            "content": "When I wanted to add some list from last anime winter, I chose Kotoura-san with a lot of considering for the genre. I\u2019m the kind of anime watcher who don\u2019t want to disappoint because of genre\u2019s failure. So I think comedy, drama, romance, school are pretty safe for me to watch. At least these genres are written in the MAL page for this anime. Why did I select it? Aren\u2019t there another genre? No, it\u2019s because of the title. You know, there\u2019re just few of anime that take someone\u2019s name as the single title. And usually these kind of animes have a wonderful story. Ofcourse they\u2019ll tell about the main character\u2019s life story with some adventures and chronicles maybe. It\u2019s really interesting because someone\u2019s life always has something special and different with the others. The main character will have a lot of dilemma and problem until they solve it and reach meaningful psychological changing even a powerful technique evolution in the action genre. We already know other anime titled someone\u2019s name like the story of fabulous ninja Naruto that never gives up for a ton of matters in his life. That\u2019s masterpiece. Or there\u2019s the story of half demon Inuyasha that tells about great romance between two different world and path. And then there\u2019s Chihayafuru which tells about pretty and energetic girl with superb animation. So, what\u2019s about Kotoura? It\u2019s girl\u2019s name, isn\u2019t it? Does she have interesting story in her life? I hoped so. Then I tried to watch this Kotoura-san at first episode.\\n\\n\r\nWow, what a story. First episode of this anime is really awesome. You have known it from other reviews? But it\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m really impressed because of first episode. Let me tell you special synopsis for the first episode.  So, this Kotoura-san is a daughter of certain rich family. She\u2019s a single daughter exactly and she doesn\u2019t have another sister neither brother. So, she\u2019s like godsend for her parents. Godsend huh? It seems The God sends other gift to Kotoura\u2019s family besides herself. Actually, she is an esper. I mean, someone with particular special ability. For real. She can read not only book but also mind. So she can easily understand about somebody\u2019s thinking. It means she\u2019s a walking lie detector. She started demolishing someone\u2019s lie and first victims of course are her parent. She told about her father\u2019s dishonest words. Then her mother\u2019s getting mad to him. Not different from her father, a lot of her mother\u2019s lie were also revealed by her. As the result, her parents are divorced. It makes Kotoura really sad and her mother started hating her. Actually, that isn\u2019t she wants. She is just trying to make someone be honest. But the fact is human beings are too cruel.  They prefer to do a lie than honest. They\u2019re happy with their dishonest and acting look like nothing happened. Something that can\u2019t be accepted by Kotoura since she knows the truth. She\u2019s abandoned by her mom. All of her family hates her a lot except her grandpa. Her grandpa\u2019s really gentle and nice person. He accepts Kotoura something in common and never blames her for a single matter that she has. But she can\u2019t stop her special ability because she thinks that she\u2019s not wrong to reveal someone\u2019s lie. She was bullied a lot when she was in the school because of her abnormality. Like I said before that humans are to cruel. They will deny their lie even it\u2019s true.  Kotoura become a sorrowful girl and no one wants to be her friend. They\u2019re too scared if Kotoura reveals their dishonest. They think she\u2019s monster. She has spent whole of her life without something meaningful and she assumes it\u2019ll be like this for her entire life remaining. Fortunately, Kotoura\u2019s patience is not for nothing. Finally, she meets with a strange perverted boy named Manabe. Why is he so strange? Well, he is the kind of person who always tells everything in his mind without any addition. Ya, it means he\u2019s really honest man. And it\u2019s so strange in Kotoura\u2019s eyes because she never meets with someone like this before. Terrible isn\u2019t it? When honest people became so rare. Even Kotoura almost doesn\u2019t believe this kind of person exist. The dark life of Kotoura alters to brighter little by little. The hope that she always wishes is slowly getting real.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I think that\u2019s pretty good for starting of an anime especially in the first episode. What\u2019s about next episode until end? It\u2019s like water and oil. You\u2019ll get something really really different after watching it. Suddenly this anime alters into four-coma anime that serves not more than kiddy jokes. It\u2019s true than the character of Kotoura develops a lot during the story\u2019s shown. But the executions of this anime are very bad. Hey, Japanese story is well known as perfect combination between serious and gag things right? So agree with it. But not this one. I think this anime can be better if there aren\u2019t some kind of kiddy jokes. I mean, we want something more dramatic in this story. There\u2019s an arc which tells she had a conflict with her other classmate named Moritani. Moritani was so envy with her because she get so much attention and affection from her beloved friend, Manabe. Moritani ordered some her people to teach Kotoura about who\u2019s the boss here. Unfortunately they had a mistake about the target. The innocent Manabe became a victim. They have some serious fight and the result is Manabe was hospitalized. Since Kotoura can read people\u2019s mind she blames herself because all of this and then ran away into her private mansion in the far away place. I guess it\u2019ll be a serious conflict. But the way out of this arc is unbelievably poor. This arc\u2019s just ended by Moritani\u2019s apology to Kotoura without any dramatically problem solving. Is this strange if someone wants to apologize to the other? Absolutely no. But I think it\u2019ll be a hundred times better if there\u2019re some final clash between Kotoura and Moritani. At least let Kotoura makes Moritani accept her fault and then apologizing to her.\\n\\n\r\nHere some my opinion\\n\r\nPlus :\\n\r\n-\tGreat concept of story. You know people are basically evil and never want someone be special. This is general plot that has made other anime in the great success.\\n\r\n-\tGreat moral value. Never despair if you have bullied a lot because of your abnormality. Don\u2019t give up and you\u2019ll find something great on your life as a prize.\\n\r\nMinus :\\n\r\n-\tPoor executions of anime. Why should this Kotoura-san be so a cheap four-comma anime?\\n\r\n-\tBad jokes. Really unwise if anime with this rate of concept serves such as kiddy humor\\n\r\nSo, 1 great episode vs 11 fail episode. I should not give a high score for this anime. 6 is enough",

            "content": "Hello friends, today I am doing a review for the anime Kotoura-san :p\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe story is just your usual comedy/romance cliche except for the first part. It revolves around Kotoura and this club they call ESP club to prove that psychics exist. The story starts by revealing Kotoura's past, and then continues with a hilariously fast rate where in my opinion, it was like Kotoura forgot what her past was like. It was basically your happy go lucky anime.\r\nArt - 9/10\r\nI liked the character designs a lot. All the characters were good looking, especially while in Manabe's imagination (which was fun to watch).\r\nSound -6/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special here, nothing to say either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nYour characters are all cliched in this anime. Kotoura is the main heroine with a happy go lucky life and a horrible past, Manabe is the guy she meets and falls in love with, Moritani is your sub heroine, and Yuriko and that other guy are your typical sub characters. I didn't like any of them too much except for Kotoura's grandfather. Yuriko's goal of using Kotoura just ended up being forced, and even Kotoura's interactions with her mom were too forced. It was just all too forced to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, I really enjoyed the first few episodes, but then it just became boring and cliched, the finale was boring as fuck, and Kotoura's interactions with her mom were forced. And the anime is too cliche, so I didn't enjoy the rest of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm only giving this a 7/10 because of Kotoura's grandfather, he was just so awesome and manly, Manabe is just a clone :",

If you don't care about cliche, like me, you can just sit back and enjoy it.\r\nThe art is simple, nothing special. At least it is not like Clannad with those big alien eyes.\r\nSound is not as bad as MC's singing.\r\nThe anime ends in a badway, too fast and without much resolution. \\n\\n\r\nA note about the sad backstory: I almost tear, but the backstory was really rushed and seemed like nothing more than a mere hook. Something should have gone on to tie it in with more of the rest of the comedy..\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kotoura-san is an anime that I stepped across for pure chance and I ended up staying and watching it until the end. \r\nLet`s say... for the story there are positive and negative points. \r\nDrama and comedy is a thing that well done ends up being a good mix. \r\nAnd the animators and writters, in fact, had done that transicion pretty well in my opinion. \r\nI found it a bit strange at first but it was not a so bad chock. \r\nNo, no, the problem is with the drama itself and with the comedy itself, not with the transicion. \r\nThe drama part is very good ingetting us, viwers, emotional. But if you watch with more attention, we can decide that is too much. \\n\r\nEven so, it is tolerable.\\n\r\nThe perverted Manabe always joking about Kotoura sexuality. It was a good ideia, but it was overused. \\n\r\nAlso there is something that annoys me... all that forgiveness and talk about the friendshipness ends up being a bit unrealistic. \\n\r\nEveryone forgives everyone too easily. Kotoura`s mother, that police officer,... \\n\r\nAnd the joke of grandfather getting arousal because of Kotoura was not funny. \\n\r\nNow, in other hand... I loved the scene when Moritani confess her love for Manabe, is rejected and even knowing that starts crying. For personal reasons, I can say that it`s exactly how it happens. The thing falls over us like a bucket of cold water, it`s not desilusion, we already knew... but even so... we can`t help too feel helpless.\\n\r\nAnd Yuriko, that is constantly being friendzoned? That happens, that is realistic.\\n\r\nIt`s an anime where some couples go right, and some don`t work and I found it very positive. \\n\r\nSummarizing: the beggining was good, the middle \"eh\", the pre-end (criminal arc) was good, the end of the criminal arc was honestly bad, and the end was very good again. \\n\\n\r\nUps and downs aside, I give the story a 7 and the characters a 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, I don`t have much to point out, 8,5. \\n\r\nThe artistic visual effects are very good, I loved the transition between the dramatic part and comedy part visually spoken, that glass of black and white that broke into pieces. \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, I like the ending but I don`t like the opening.\\n\r\nThe sountrack is kinda awesome, especially in the begginning and ending of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is a 7, I`m glad I watched the anime. \\n\r\nStill not a favourite, but it was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nTotal score: 7,3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

He is the little one. His name is Daichi Muroto. I originally thought he was gonna be a small and really annoying know it all chick that has no likable point . I am thankfully wrong and he is actually a pretty good character.\r\nIn fact this story has no character i don't like. Not even the mother that abandoned the MC when she was little. They are all pretty enjoyable. \r\nThere isn't even anything ihave issues with this show. It's just a funny, Sad and awesome show to sit back and watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode alone got me feeling emotional within the first 5 minutes. While i do love the rest of the show how it is. I got to admit i kind of wish there was a separate show that was focused on a more serious tone with this. The way the first episode portrays how the MC now lives life and is ostracized by society is amazing. I do wish it continued like this while still having the MC slowly opening up to the friends again. I feel like that would have been amazing. But the show is pretty amazing as it is now. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an awesome show and i am actually kind of bummed out that there isn't going to be a 2nd season most likely. Really wish there was and i am without a doubt gonna read the",

            "content": "After watching all 12 episodes of this anime in a marathon style I can confidently say I enjoyed this anime very much. While this anime doesn\u2019t redefine or become completely outstanding but it excels at what it aims to do, taking a \u201cwhat if\u201d premise (in this scenario telepathy) and setting a story behind what a persons life would be like in that scenario. My initial expectations were some what low expecting a \u201cpoor man\u2019s\u201d Kokoro Connect\", I was however pleasantly surprised. Just keep in mind this review is my personal opinion and you will probably have a different experience watching it yourself.\r\nStory: Set ina familiar high school teenager setting like many other anime, the anime tries to follow a similar slice of life style where although there are technically antagonists in the story, this is a tale of the struggles of daily life and acceptance for a young girl given telepathy. The sci fi / fantasy element is used quite well and is the primary motivator for all major events in the plot. Although generally about enduring hardships there are a few main plot lines with open being a romance, another mystery and the last major one about fixing the past. The story can be somewhat predictable and often takes a melodramatic approach towards events that shouldn\u2019t be as significant as they are but if you can place yourself in the place of the characters you can understand how the story events are meaningful to them. Hopefully you\u2019ll enjoy comedy as well since it is often placed numerously throughout the episodes and generally halts or decelerates the story line in favor of character development, patience is required and although not always funny there are plenty of funny moments. Just don\u2019t be surprised if a few episodes feel like filler for comedic purposes (similar to Teen Titans episodes of plot and filler). When drama does get serious however you will get deeply invested as I did, the First episode especially is very dramatic and depressing that you\u2019ll devote yourself to see the resolution. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: I\u2019ve decided to lump this category since I gave both the same rating and didn\u2019t have any problems. While some of the characters are intentionally drawn weirdly (such as Daichi) most characters look consistent to other high school anime. I\u2019d say the art style is very similar to Kokoro Connect (character bonding also). Sounds were clear and volume was never a problem. Voice actors sounded passionate and emotional while bantering. This category I enjoyed for what it was and didn\u2019t devote the majority of my attention to it. While its not the best art and animation I\u2019ve seen and not the best vocal performances it was better than my initial expectations.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is where this show truly shines. Even with a somewhat generic plot, you will fall in love with these characters and this is especially true for Haruka. This anime explores the pain, fear and joys of being a special person. Like any attribute this anime demonstrates that anything with its blessings and curses. The main stage of 5 characters all banter and interact very well. The other characters aren\u2019t quite as developed but add to the experience quite well. Manabe being such a sweet guy that\u2019s a slave to his own wild imagination, he\u2019s very lovable and trusting despite the power Haruka could have over him, his altruistic personality is not over the top and believable. The other 3 main characters are essential to the plot and banter and without them the show wouldn't have the same charm to it. Although they could use more development in comparison to the 2 main protagonists you will get to see each of their personalities, weaknesses, strengths and past.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The characters will suck you into this anime and should your primary reason for watching this anime. If you like humor (I\u2019m more of a serious / dramatic guy myself) you\u2019ll love it even more. The drama isn\u2019t up to par with drama focused anime but it has its tear jerking moments and you\u2019ll definitely enjoy it. The romance in this anime is also pretty well done, it\u2019s not a harem anime and character relations begin to develop early on. If you go in not expecting to see the next ghost in the shell / FMA brotherhood / Kokoro Connect and watch it for its premise and character interactions you will love this anime.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime was quite good but it just missed the mark in terms of being a incredible. Some personal gripes would be the over abundance and reliance on comedy and ecchi, they are important but just used a little too much. While comedy adds to the plot line some of the same jokes are overused and inserted in awkward places during periods of tension. The ecchi also has good reason to be involved since were looking into peoples minds and sexual fantasies are normality. However there were many deeper questions to be answered such as, is it ok to have private thoughts when others are aware? Is it ethically right for someone to read your mind and judge you for it afterwards? Could such an ability be used for good or will in the end someone always use it just to exploit that person? Should Haruka be able to call Manabe a pervert and punish him for what he freely thinks expecting privacy just as anyone else would? This was my biggest concern the entire series. However as far as exploring the life with telepathy and the quest of finding people who will except you no matter how dangerous or weird you are make this a heart warming and sad journey with many laughs thrown in, if you can make it through this anime you\u2019ll enjoy it.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time and energy to read this review. I hope it helps you determine if you want to watch this anime.\\n",

            "content": "This should be without a doubt the must watch of 2013! Why? It's absolutely amazing!\r\nThe story follows a girl who can read minds. It is a story of considerable heartbreak, especially in the first episode. I was already crying! While there is this heartbreak, there is a fabulous contrast of amazing humour! I don't think Kotoura-san has made me laugh and cry so much at the same time! The elements within Kotoura-san are all fantastic. You will really enjoy what goes on. There is a degree of uncertainty within the story too! You just don't know what will happen next and that is an outstandingthing! It adds dynamicism and makes for a very fun watch. Expect the unexpected in Kotoura-san, but I promise you, you will love it! It also ends how it should. It made me burst into tears. Simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be simple here. The art and animation is fantastic. That's all that I can say. There is nothing I can go into detail about, just watch it and you'll get my vibe. It's amazing and does the programme justice!\\n\\n\r\nKotoura-san has perhaps the best OP and ED ever! I couldn't stop singing along to it. In fact I love the ED so much I created a cover version of \"Kibou No Hana\" on Clarinet! The voices of the characters are fantastic, and totally befit who they should be. Again, outstanding job.\\n\\n\r\nKotoura-san probably plays it's killer blow with the characters. My word are they stunning! Kotoura's shyness, Moritani's Moe side, Yuriko's determination and willpower, Muroto's Resilience and knowledge, and most importantly, Manabe. I love him so much! He is stupid and perverse but incredibly charming and heart warming at the same time. There are times where he seems to be your standard pervert, but then suddenly comes in to save the day. There were times where I was literally screaming and jumping out of my seat when he did something heroic. Nothing but Kotoura-san has made me do that. That just goes to show how amazing Kotoura-san is!\\n\\n\r\nSo what does all of that prove? It's outstandingly enjoyable to watch! I can't say how much fun I had watching it and how much anticipation I had for each episode, not knowing what could happen! Now it's finished I'm not sad, because I enjoyed it so much, hopefully others did, there could be more to the story. Some might be disappointed it ended how it did, but there's always a second series for that...\\n\\n\r\nPLEEEEEASE! I BEG YOU! MAKE A SECOND SERIES! \\n\\n\r\nThat's Kotoura-san. It's incredible. 10/10",

Before I actually watched it I never had big expectsions for it but OMG did I take it back. Most of us thought this anime's just going to be about another girl who had a physic ability and fights with it! BlahBlahBlah etc. But No when the first episode aired I have to say it was my most favourite episode in all of Winter! It was so Dramatic and sad and Amazing! It'sso hard to make a truly sad story but I had tears dribbling down my checks every now and then! Most fo us have seen this anime but those who haven't don't leave YET! Because I' going to tell you the little bad parts of Kotoura-san. First of all as it reached y'know episode 5 and 6 people just fell behind because no more really good interesting stuff was happening. It was as though it was just a stupid comedy school. It had became chliche until.... Episode 8! Episode 8's ending was pretty much the same as episode 1's middle part! you were just so desperate to see the next episode but sadly by that time I had caught uo with Kotoura-san so I had to wait a week for episode 9. Episode 9 ,10 , parts of 11 (apart from end) were like a bit Boring. But as it came to the end of our best anime of 2013 Winter Anime people were informing others about there may being a change of a Season 2! For those who have seen it don't get your hopes up! This information is just a rumor for now ! But because some part for me were a bit boring my overall score was a 9! But guys if you haven't seen it I still would Highly recommended it!",

This part of the story gave the characters some form of development and worth, It brought them all together to try a find who this Mystery attacker is, I liked the sense of danger this brought to the show and to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is the synopsis for this show was rather \"deep\" \\n\\n\r\nKotoura-san follows a girl who's in pain, emotionally. Her abilities had alienated her from every person in her life including her own mother. During the \"Murder Mystery\" part it truly spoke to me how important friends can be, They can help you feel like you have a sense of belonging and worth to this world, These deep views are left very hidden in this show which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nIf they made this plot the whole series, then it could of been good.\\n\r\nThat leaves me feeling frustrated with it, A show that starts very poor and picks up quite a bit, still only manages to reach the scores of around 6/6.5 out of 10 in my eyes, I shudder to think what this COULD of been.\\n\\n\r\nA series where i enjoyed ONE Aspect from the whole show, Would i recommend this to you? Not really, If you try and bypass the early episode and get to the sub-plot of the Mystery, then its \"Decent\" at best and maybe worth your time.",

There would be some who would be amazed, some who would call it creepy, or some who wouldn't believe in such fantasies at all.

So I decided to watch it and it really amaze me. Took me 3 days to finish since I have a lot of anime shows to watch.\r\nStory: 8/10 - It begins with how Haruka began her miserable life in early stages which she hasn't realise until she hurt her friends and family. And the flow of it continue smoothly until the end of the episode. Reading minds are really disturbing. Also, introducing a detective with split personalitylet us know how this effect happen to us, just by bullying. Anyway, I would have scored this 10/10 but, well ecchi scene makes me drop to 8. Don't judge me, I may watch ****** but not too much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 - the artwork are decent, I don't really have much to say about it, no complains\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 - The ED song are touching\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 - Haruka, the main character of the show, introduced as a character who suffered having reading mind.

            "content": "Kotoura-san Review:\r\nKotoura-san is not an anime you would expect (in a bad way). The beginning of this show is misleading, so if you guys expect a fresh engaging drama anime from this show than I suggest you guys not to watch this show.\r\nThe show starts off strong, sad, and a very well executed drama with a great visual representation about Kotoura\u2019s past. When Kotoura was still a child she was able to read people minds, because she\u2019s still a child that still doesn\u2019t understand anything she keeps revealing people deepest secret, which makes other people to hate her, all of her friends left her, peoplecalling her monster, she\u2019s being bullied nonstop, and the most painful one is when her parents abandon her. Somehow she managed to live through all that painful memories and just keeps on living, alone. One day she founded an abandon cat which she decided to care for it, but in the end the cat was taken away leaving her alone again. What happens next is probably the most memorable scene in anime, she finally breaks and just screams, screams and screams. What makes this scene great is that after all that painful turmoil that being buildup, somehow she managed to live through all that, finally she just couldn\u2019t take it anymore and she just let it all out. But these aren\u2019t the only reason why this scene is great, the scene goes something like this; it was raining, she was told that the cat was taken away, she just stands there in the rain motionless, the camera slowly zooming in on Kotoura\u2019s eyes, her pupils getting smaller making her eyes all white, and finally she lets out a soundless scream (this is where the music drops in), screaming and screaming she\u2019s even stop for a brief second but then she continues screaming. This scene is sad and its freaking amazing, I will never forget this scene.\\n\\n\r\nNow here\u2019s the disappointment of this series. From dark and psychological approach, the show suddenly change after a happy moe upbeat OP starts playing. This is probably the most painful thing that an anime ever done to me. guagdisudusif (my forehead wrote that) all of those dark, sad, dramatic, and psychological theme just gone, and suddenly the anime turns into this typical clich\u00e9 moe romance slice of life show, WHAT THE HELL!!!\\n\\n\r\nWell that\u2019s enough about my rant, now let\u2019s talk about this anime\u2019s slice of life, is it good? Well surprisingly it is. The show is surprisingly fun, hilarious and very enjoyable. Watching Kotoura\u2019s growth overcoming her sadness is great, with the help of her friends supporting her is really heartwarming to watch. The romance is also great, it wasn\u2019t force and there\u2019s an actual great romantic development between Kotoura and Manabe. The comedy is hilarious, with Kotoura\u2019s mind reading ability it makes the comedy fresh and fun to watch. But there are also some episodes that are clich\u00e9, corny and boring (beach episode), and at episode 9 \u2013 11 the show suddenly changes into mystery, detective genre which turns out bad and then in episode 12 it returns into slice of life again, what\u2019s with these inconsistent genre?\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters, Kotoura is definitely an interesting character especially after that prologue. Manabe is this idiotic character who always thinking about perverted stuff (this is where the gags come from), but he is a really funny and likable character. Yuriko is the president of ESP club, at first she just wants to use Kotoura as a tool to prove the existence of ESP but over time however, she recognizes how selfish she is being, and instead befriends Kotoura and the others. Moritani is the character that I hate, because her character is just forceful, she\u2019s one of those character that you should hate at the beginning but later on they become a likable character. But it just doesn\u2019t work with her character because all she did was feeling jealous with Kotoura and Manabe relationship, felt guilty and ask Kotoura forgiveness for what she did to her, that\u2019s it. Kotoura\u2019s mother also has the same case as Moritani, but her character are done much better than Moritani\u2019s, and Kotoura\u2019s mother only have short screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is pretty standard nothing stands out, the OP is pretty average compared to the ED, the ED is much better because the tone is right and it\u2019s emotional. The only soundtrack that I\u2019m impressed with is the prologue, the prologue runs about 10 minutes long and it only uses one track for that whole 10 minutes, impressive. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty average but its fitting for moe show like this. But then again this is not the case for the prologue, the visual is really creative, unique and memorable and the usage of color pellets for the prologue really fits the tone.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, Kotoura - san is a great slice of life show but it\u2019s a letdown after what we\u2019ve seen in the prologue. It makes you wonder how the show would be if they keep using that dark and sad tone for the whole show. I would recommend this a watch for those people who loves moe romantic slice of life comedy show but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this show for those people who expected something new and fresh. \\n",

The story has elements to create a movie with real actors.\r\nMore than a comedy in my opinion  this anime is a strong drama because despite the big amount of funny moments to laugh you always feel something sad and sometimes you  want to cry which isvery common in films where the actor catch the attention. In this part the creator of the anime achieved to get my attention with the character.  Definitely  I strongly recommend this anime  and I hope for a second season.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

But soon the standard RomCom makes its appearance and the drama takes a slight backseat. While it permeates throughout the story, I think the director could have done more with the backstory and build upon a strong story line. Personally I felt that the quick move to RomCom was bad, not saying that the comedy wasn't good, only the rapid decline in the dramawas not for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound style is good, if not a bit generic moe. The difference between past and present, sad and happy events were well implemented. Colouring and shading set the mood nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development has its moments good and bad. Seeing Kotoura learn to trust her friends and experience the things that she couldn't as a child, her dramatic backstory playing part in her recovery. Going through bullying, jealousy and the memories of her past, Kotoura and her friends develop a strong bond with each other. Only a few things were left to be desired, Kotoura's parents: her mom was forgotten for most of the series and her dad sort of just disappeared. Given their relationship I would have liked to see more resolve in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall an excellent premise and a good execution, even if there are a few plot holes. HOWEVER. I do think this anime suffers from way too many sub plots and blowing its drama way too early.",

After those first 10 minutes you will only see as something that could be a good drama anime is wasted in the form of a Romantic Comedy where abounding perverts and unrequited love.\r\nThe art is good, the characters and scenarios are acceptably designed and the facial expressions of the characters in the comic scenes are well done, probably the best of this anime.\r\nThe soundtrack is acceptable, has a sticky musical opening, the ending is also correctly set for the final situationof each episode, environmental sounds within the story are also correct for a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters are acceptable, they achieve their goal to make you laugh at some point and I think if it were not for them this anime would have ended up being a total disaster.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the bad that was used the few dramatic moments in this anime I get to enjoy it a bit, like the romantic comedy that was not boring me at any time but failed to meet my expectations, you really have to like school comedies a lot To fully enjoy this anime ....",

I still don't really feel like Haruka and Manabe are a great couple (like didn't feel they had chemistry), but I think it was nice he helped her get outta her gray/bleak mindset and I think his role for that was right. But I think it'd have been better as just good friends :thinking: \r\nI think there could have been some better aspects like I think if the show had developed more of the characters earlier/less rushed for her tragic past then it'd have hit harder. Butit wasn't terribly done. Wish there was also some better development between mother and daughter. Again, not bad, just felt it could have been better. \\n\\n\r\nShow's good, but think it had more potential with a bit more details/time for things to actually develop/make things have more impact.",

This is not a serious anime, lets get that right out of the way, there will be little to no tension or unexpected turns. People say the writing is very poor which is a fair criticism but I think a misguided one. The anime has a powerful connection to your feelings which I appreciate greatly. If you are looking for a light hearted anime then this will probably work for you but be warned early onit will devastate your sensibilities. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode on its own could be a great introduction for a very serious plot-heavy anime with strong character development and I would even like to see a spin off like that. However, it goes the other route as expected being described as a school romance comedy, and dives straight into the relaxed tone it maintains throughout the rest of the series. I think this 'bait and switch' could turn a lot of people off but overall I enjoyed the anime as I expected it to be a bit cheesy and light.\\n\\n\r\nNine enjoyment for the feels but very low scores in terms of individuality, storytelling, and art. Nothing feels particularly new or interesting.",

Despite its origins as a four panel strips, story content was taken and could say, 'remastered' into an enjoyable series.  \r\nIt dives deep into a darken past painful vivid memories; where it can be one of most scarring moments of a child's life. As a child enduring bullying, I can thoroughly sympathize with what Kotoura Haruka grew up with and how she developed into a shy, low-confident character. \r\nThe animation is represented with colors that depict events.Expressive characters - each with their roles to fill, I was pleased that here was the male lead who was vital in changing the other character's life. (usually boys in these shows have little plot meaning.) and every character has their own purpose and helps timid Kotoura to open up to friends.  \\n\\n\r\nEvents that shows both comical goofiness, or even touching sad moments together.

I didn't mean to shout. \r\nThis anime really was something else.\r\nStory: 9/10:\r\nOk, I'm giving the story 9/10 because honestly, IT TRIES SO HARD TO MESS WITH YOU. At first it's sad, then it's cute, then it's hilarious, then it's romantic, then it's sad. It's a vicious cycle. I loved it so much, though, because every single episode was something new. Every single episode, you had to brace yourself. Was it going to be tragic? Was it going to be comedic? Wasit going to be a mix of feeling that left you rolling in the floor in a puddle of tears--half happy hears, half tears of depression? YOU HAD NO IDEA. I also love how this story goes all over the place, and it's never scared to do so. They go to school, they go to Kotoura's perverted grandfather's mansion, they go the jail, etc. The only thing I sort of didn't like, was the break in consistency. Half of the episodes were sort of \"stand alone,\" where they didn't really connect to each other in such a way that was vital to the plot (you still had to watch the episodes in order, since Kotoura and Manabe's feelings toward each other developed and the clubs friendships evolved, but they episodes weren't like an ongoing story) and the other half if the episodes were very consistent and not at all stand alone. I guess they probably did this in order to circumvent a slump in the second half of the season, but it was really the only thing I could pick out that bothered me.\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation of this series was really wonderful. I took about a million screenshots while watching (not even kidding) and as I look back, I admire the beautiful artwork over and over again. It's one of those anime where the actually art is usually better than the fan art, which is really nice. Also, Kotoura's hair. Just...her hair. Is beautiful.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, the soundtrack didn't really stand out. Every time I try to think back to it, I just keep singing the opening. \\n\r\n\"Sonna ni koshi koshi shicha dame yo (Koshi koshi koshi!) \\n\r\nHAATO no nioi ga tsuichau wa (Demo demo demo!)\" \\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI give character 9/10 because the personalities and tendencies of the characters were all fully fleshed out, and the backstories of each and every character are explained...EXCEPT FOR MANABE. I would give it an even lower score because of this, but honestly, Manabe's pretty much an open book. I think he was meant to be the only \"normal\" character, without a tragic or dramatic past at all.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nLike I've mentioned above, the plot is enough to make this anime enjoyable, the seer sense of uncertainty and the great humor make this series a definite favorite of mine.\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\n( OH MY GOD!!!! Good pronunciation! )\\n\r\nGo watch this. Now. Just kidding, you don't have to listen to me. Make the decision yourself. But seriously, if you give it a try, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Just make sure to secure your seat belt.",

How many animes are about somebody reading people minds? No seriously please tell, because I have seen none other than this one. To me it make it a unique anime. \r\nArt (10): The best part of this anime to me is the facial expressions. I love any anime with hilarious facial expressions. And character designwas amazing for the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9): The OP didn't really stick out to me and I did really stick around for the ending either. What going on with all this sticky stuff, I think I'm in a sticky situation. Hahaha. Tried to make a funny. But seriously I loved the voice actors in the anime. The voices went with body perfectly. Even Muroto-san.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): I loved every character in this anime even her Mother. I mean don't like how she walked out on Kotoura, but she try to make an omelet for her daughter. But I really like how Manabe-san and her grandpa can be so openly perverted. I laughed so hard I cried most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): To be honest, this is actually my third time watching this anime. That's how enjoyable it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9): I loved this anime, but not to much to get in my top 10. I wished they would had slowed it down a bit, to let more of the character developed. Most episode had 4 days in the first ten minutes of each episode. But I loved it.",

            "content": "It is quite shocking to me to overview briefly the wide range of emotions this particular show has evoked from the people of MAL. I am seeing everything from tens to twos for this particular piece, and honestly, as with most issues, these two ends of the spectrum find truth in their judgements somewhat in the middle of things. Kotoura-san is an average show. It is not, as one user described, \u201clike rubbing lemon in your eyes\u201d. But on the other hand, it isn\u2019t the hard-hitting emotional piece that the writers clearly think that it is. Unfortunately, this is one of those shows that hasa very interesting concept, and therefore, the writers think that they can slack a bit in the plot department. And while this shortcoming isn\u2019t immediately obvious, by the third or fourth episode, you will no doubt be scratching your head and wondering what exactly happened. \\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off emotionally powerful. Many reviews complained about how Kotoura\u2019s life was just one negative event after the other\u2026but that\u2019s kind of the point! Plus, to the writers\u2019 credit, the pacing of what was basically blatant exposition is excellent. The juxtaposition of Kotoura twirling around in a cute pink backpack and her mother shoving her makes this first episode work well. It forces the viewer to see themselves in Kotoura\u2019s shoes as we follow her from childhood to high school, and it\u2019s this first episode that convinced me to binge on this particular show to begin with. Sadly, everything from here on out goes downhill quickly. The show\u2019s first episode seems to establish itself firmly as an anime that\u2019s going to contrast slice-of-life-esque fluff with serious emotion \u2013 a pattern confirmed by the second episode, where we see Kotoura making friends with a blue-haired sempai in the same breath we see said friend\u2019s mother hanging from the rafters. But halfway through the writers sort of shrugged their shoulders and said \u201cfuck it\u201d and tackled fan service more in what was probably a pathetic attempt to market Kotoura to a more otaku-oriented audience. Either they realized their mistake or they were just running out of ideas, because this style of writing randomly comes back around episode ten when Kotoura and company try to locate a criminal in what becomes one of the most unnecessary \u201cplot twists\u201d I\u2019ve seen in my life. Now, I\u2019m a relatively easy girl to please. If I become invested in a character, I usually don\u2019t realize how bad the show I\u2019m watching is until I really get the time to think about it. But even I, in my Kotoura-adoring glory, could see how pitiful the \u201cdrama\u201d of introducing a character for two episodes for the sake of showing \u201cjust how far out little Kotoura has come since she has friends!!!\u201d was. \\n\\n\r\nKotoura herself is a standard character. Believable, sure, but nothing that the anime field hasn\u2019t seen before. She\u2019s kind of like a mix-and-match toy of anime tropes \u2013 we\u2019ve got our tragic backstory, our special ability, our \u201cmoe\u201d appeal, our aversion to sex and therefore being preyed upon by a sultry male character\u2026she\u2019s cute, sure, but that\u2019s about it. Manabe, as many have pointed out, is one punchline. Perverted but honest. Which is strange, because in the first episode, we see that Manabe is capable of some freaking weird thoughts. The fact that the writers passed on expanding on that joke (it could have been something along the lines of mini Nichijou sketches!) in favor of showing how much of a \u201cpervert\u201d he can be is a national tragedy. And this makes his character suffer greatly, because it makes him look like more of a jerk than Kotoura\u2019s \u201cwhite knight\u201d. I get it. He\u2019s a teenage boy. But when Kotoura nearly drowns and all you can think about her small breasts pushing against your chest, what does that say about you as a person? Add this on the fact that Kotoura\u2019s grandfather also sexualizes his own kin beyond belief (especially because you know how every joke involving him and Kotoura is going to end, completely reducing whatever element of surprise that this show had left) makes it almost unbearable. I don\u2019t think that I have to explain why that little fact greatly detracts from his dramatic role in the first episode. It all really comes back to the first episode, have you noticed?\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we get to my real problem with the show. The mother. God almighty, do I hate what this show did to the mother. I\u2019ll take an overly perverted Manabe. I\u2019ll take a weak willed Kotoura. What they did to this mother character is unacceptable. I\u2019ll spare you the gory details, but basically, her and Kotoura\u2019s entire arc can be explained by this simple imitation: \u201cI know that I mentally abused you for your entire natural life, but I made you shitty eggs, so we\u2019re on good terms again.\u201d It is sloppy. It comes out of left field (well, you knew she had to come around because of her inclusion in the OS, but still). And most unforgivingly? It takes so long for them to resolve their conflict that we get a whooping three minutes left for Kotoura\u2019s confession to Manabe. And let\u2019s face it, if you\u2019re still watching this show, it\u2019s for their relationship, and not any of the other shit. \\n\r\nSo how exactly can I claim that this show is average at best with all of my criticism? Because it\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t seen before. These same condemnations can be applied to anime in the same vein of Kotoura across the board. It is not spectacularly bad, and it is not outstandingly good. It\u2019s something to fill up time between the wait for better anime. This show is very easy to get into. Whether or not you want to watch this knowing what\u2019s wrong with it, well, that\u2019s really up to you. Ultimately, Kotoura is little more than a convenient time killer.\\n",

            "content": "Comedy and drama are hard to write. No surprise, it's even harder to strike a balance between the two, especially if it turns out that you're not so hot at either. At the very least, if you are going to incorporate both, you should know how to set one aside so you can give the other a chance to flex its muscles. Kotoura-san completely disregards the dynamic. In fact, it takes the masks of Sock and Buskin and tries to piece them together through aggressive reckless force with galvanized nails.\r\nFor Futurama fans out there, remember the episode when Zoidberg's uncle came out of retirement andmade a movie out of his screenplay \"The Magnificent Three\", G-Grade melodrama with out-of-place humor shoehorned into every scene? Now you know what it's like if you bothered to watch past the first episode, where they give you the impression of a heavily dramatic series about a mind-reader who is abandoned by everyone she loved, only for it to perk up by the end. While misleading, it's not entirely a \"bait-and-switch\" debut since it still tries its hand at drama, but that leads to a new problem: It's bad at comedy, but it's even worse at drama.\\n\\n\r\nEven late into the series where it becomes more dramatic, we are still treated to pervy jokes while in the MIDDLE of dramatic scenes. Even if it was done straight-faced, it would not pardon the gaping plotholes and the unsatisfying last-minute epilogues. It squanders too much time on recycling gags for any sort of story to develop, and the way it puts lead-ins into the next episode after the ED makes the series a massive Ham at best or gives it an air of pretension at worst.\\n\\n\r\nIf it stayed the drama route, Kotoura-san could have been a pretty average, albeit forgettable, series. If it ran out the gates as a slice of life, then it would have been just another sub par high school comedy. Instead, it marriages both together with a relationship as healthy as The Lockhorns'. The result is like that of multiplying fractions >1: you ultimately get a smaller number.",

You'll need to be more reliant on the character's dialogue rather than their facial expressions in order to understand the dramatic moments. For the bits of banter between the characters though, it's especially well done and really makes their personalities come alive, but otherwise it's forgettable.\r\nSound 8/10\r\nPersonally, the only song I find to be memorable is the ED. While I never skipped the OP, it's lyrics are a tad generic. What I would have liked is a plot synopsis similar to Kotoura's backstory present in the ED. I'll however haveto deduct some marks on the BGM being overly formulaic. You'll have a sad and plot heavy episode, yet the creators insist on playing the omnipresent happy teaser music to the next episode when it's the same as this one.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nWhat seems to turn people off is the complete 180 degree shift the story takes from Korean drama to slice of life comedy within the first episode. Afterwards though, it tends to be more balanced, though lacking in some domestic drama in favor of school based ones. Albeit, Kotoura's mind reading ability does come with some creative moral lessons to be learned.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nIronically, it's when the characters were being their harshest that they were the most realistic. Each of their unique critic, conflict resolutions and rebukes is how you'll be able to tell them apart for the most part. Otherwise, I feel the creators of this anime decide to give overly happy resolutions due to this frequently dabbling in various genres (slice of life, drama, mystery, romance, school, etc.) and as a result, some may react unrealistically, if only for a moment. Though sometimes, the anime straight up tells you what's wrong with the characters instead of showing it through their actions, but again that's only sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nIf you're tired of watching the typical moe anime, then this one's right for you. \\n\r\nI personally wasn't bothered with the occurrences of deux ex machina and plot convenience, but if you want a more logic based story rather than an emotion based one, then you should look elsewhere. Otherwise, it's a nice break from all the shows that treat every conflict as if it were the end of the world, where here it works on a more small town personal scale.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a nice short love story anime, with sprinkles of character-focused drama here and there, then this show's right for you. However, if you come into this series with high expectations of deep psychological studies of the nature of Telepathy then you'll be sorrily disappointed.",

            "content": "At one point in our lives, we have all stumbled upon a work of fiction that tries too hard to be inspirational or depressing. These works are the media equivalent of the weird kid in the back of the classroom who tries too hard to be all edgy. Kotoura-san is a prime example of such a work of fiction, as it tries far too much to take itself seriously and ultimately fails at trying to resonate with its audience.\r\nLet's first start with Kotoura-san's greatest sin: its piss poor writing. Good gracious Madoka, was the writing terrible for this show! As I've mentioned in the beginningparagraph, the show tries to take itself too seriously. Basically, the show is centered around the life of the titular character, Haruka Kotoura, who can read minds, and is endlessly suffering because of how her powers alienate her from her peers who are pretty freaked out by her ability. Now, this premise isn't too bad by itself - the show's execution and direction of it is, however.\\n\r\nFirst, there is the first half of the first episode. In the first nine minutes alone, we are forced to endure Haruka's painful childhood, which is basically just such unnecessary sympathy fodder for the sake of making the audience pity the heroine.  I will admit that these few minutes were what initially drew me into the show, and therein lies the problem. As soon as you pick it up, Kotoura-san immediately tries to lure you into its nonexistent story with forced angst and melancholy. Throughout each and every episode, drama is forced on an annoyingly constant basis. While it was intriguing the first few times around, it sure got old by episode three. There was also an abundance of what I call \"plot twist abuse\". The plot twists in Kotoura-san were only included just for the sake of having plot twists. In other words, they were only written into the story as feeble attempts at finding a hook for the viewers, and boy, did it fail.\\n\r\nBy the way, what the actual hell was up with that brief pseudo-murder-mystery arc near the series' end? The entire arc and introduction of its characters was completely unnecessary to the overall plot, and was only put there to create more stupid drama. I especially hate how it was resolved. This arc was a prime example of \"plot twist abuse\", and was ultimately, the worst part of the plot.\\n\r\nNow, let's move on to the characters. I couldn't find myself to care about them as much as I would have liked, and ended up hating half of them. Let's talk about the main characters first.\\n\r\nHaruka's whining about her mind-reading and being a burden on her friends became more annoying with the story's progression, and I found myself caring less for her boyfriend, Yoshihisa Manabe, who I used to like as a character. I did find Yoshihisa to be an amusing character at the beginning, but soon saw him for what he actually was: a cardboard, two-dimensional anime love interest who has no real personality beyond his \"nice guy\" demeanor and perverted sex fantasies about his lady love. (Oh boy, what an original personality for a character!) Muroto Daichi (one of our protagonists' friends) was probably the character I hated the most. He was one of those oh-I-wear-glasses-and-I'm-really-quiet-and-cool boys that you'd find in cheap romantic shoujo manga. (Thank fucking Monika this series wasn't centered around him.) He's incredibly boring to watch, and is unforgivably oblivious to how his childhood best friend (Yuriko Mifune) totally has the hots for him. (I personally think that she should have better taste.) How is it even possible for a human being (even one in an anime) to be so dense!? (Reminds me of my sixth grade crush, but that's a story for another time.) Speaking of Yuriko, she was rather slow to develop as a character. She doesn't exactly feel or show any sort of remorse for what she does with Haruka at first until the very end, but I felt as though it was just too late to pull off such a big change in such a small amount of time. There is also Hiyori Moritani, who serves as the antagonist of the first few episodes and basically resents Haruka for how close she is with Yoshihisa, her childhood crush. (Damn, this anime really loves playing on the \"unrequited childhood crush\" trope.) She does eventually befriend the others after some apologizing and all that fluffy crap. To be honest, I rather enjoyed her character slightly more than the others, but she still comes off as rather flat to me, especially with that sudden 180 in being one of the most horrible characters in the anime to suddenly being Haruka's BFF.\\n\r\nLastly, there are the secondary characters, who were the characters that I hated the most. There is Aki Tsukino, who I utterly despise for creating an entire useless and needlessly dark story arc (I'm referring to the pseudo-murder-mystery arc, of course). Then there is Haruka's creepy grandpa who pervs on her relentlessly, and for some reason, Haruka doesn't call Child Protective Services. (What is it with anime and incest?) Oddly enough, I didn't hate Haruka's mom as much as I thought I would. Don't get me wrong, she still needed better development when it came to reconciling with her daughter at the very end, but she didn't annoy me as much as everyone else. (Really enjoyed that scene of her kicking Yoshihisa, to be honest. Maybe that's why she's my favorite.)\\n\r\nMoving on from the show's main issues, I also have a few more qualms with the series. Much was left to be desired in the shows' music and art. The soundtrack of Kotoura-san was fairly adequate. It wasn't horrible, but it was just generic and ultimately forgettable. The same could be said for its art style. At best, the artwork is mediocre and derivative of other works in the genre. These visual and musical factors are also great flaws that bring down the show as a whole, since none of it was able to make Kotoura-san stand out from similar titles.\\n\r\nI had high hopes for this anime, I really did! But unfortunately, it just failed on so many levels and barely left an impact on me as a casual fan of anime. Long story short, Kotoura-san is uninteresting, emotionally manipulative, and not worth much consideration.",

They seemed the cram everything in to 12 episodes which ruins the pace of the story, especially the last episode where every crucial question you were asking your self through the anime is answered, which in a way is good thing I suppose as your not still having to deal with those lingering questions however you left with WHAT IT CAN'T END HERE!?!?!?  \r\nI'm not saying this anime isn't enjoyable as it was; especially the interactions between the characters, it definitely made me laugh, the main Male lead isalso a character I was easily able to get behind and root for, and the interactions between him and the main female lead are fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nRomance plays a big part in this anime yet I felt as though it was there more for extra comedic value then actual romance but then again that's probably because the anime wasn't long enough and until the final episode nothing really happens which is really annoying. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this anime is great if your looking for a pick me up comedy with some romance aspects. However if your looking for a top notch story this isn't for you as felt like it didn't explore the characters relationships or even the ability as much as they could of.",

It's one of the more unique ones I've seen even though i haven't seen many animes, this has to be one of my favourites of all time. The plot, to me, was one-of-a-kind and I think it was thought over quite carefully. \r\nART: \r\nTheart was amazing, one of the best I've seen. Enough said. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe sound, like the art, was good. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: \\n\r\nI loved the characters in this anime, it shows different types of people and I think the main characters send out quite a big message; to not judge someone so quickly. Now, I don't want to spoil the anime but I will tell you that the characters actually taught me quite a lot in that everyone has their own background and not to judge from it. Anyway, the characters were amazing, they were funny as well as kind and so on. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI loved it. My family was out of the day and I spent the time watching this anime and I had curled up on my couch and just sat there, laughing and crying (from sadness / happiness)..happiness because the characters were so damn funny and I had kept my focus on the anime instead of other things and sadness because, damn, this anime is quite upsetting (to me anyway). \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nNow as I said at the start, this anime may not be for everyone as the reviews I've seen, they've pretty much hated the anime, now, I think y'all just should watch it and see how it goes seeing as I only watched this anime because I was bored, I also was hesitant to watch it because of the reviews but I actually loved it and it quickly became one of my favourite anime, so I guess it up to you.\\n\\n\r\n- Aya :)",

She befriends several high school students who accept her psychic ability and she learns to gradually move on from the scars of her past, including settling tensions with her mother.\r\nKotoura-san as a whole is kind of a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, the character development within theseries is rather solid as Kotoura's character gradually changes for the better as she learns to move on from her traumatic past, reconnect with her mother and others among her new circle of friends also get fleshed out. ESP Club President Yuriko has her own parallels to Kotoura in both share a tragic past due to psychic abilities leading them to be ostracized by others and negatively have their family relationships affected. There's also a solid arc in the second half of the series where the ESP Club gets entangled in a mystery involving a series of assaults being committed on high school girls by a mysterious assailant.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the show's comedy and elements to its storytelling do have their bumps for me. For the most part, the comedy to Kotoura-san is used to lighten the mood on the show's more serious themes. While I don't mind the comedy being used to lighten the mood, much of it misses its mark for me since it relies on some of the more obnoxious quirks of the major characters (the perversion of Kotoura's grandpa and Manabe, Daichi's indifference, Yuriko's obsession of using Kotoura's powers for her club's gain) to carry it along at many points and I did feel there were points where it disrupted the serious mood that complimented the show's more dramatic points.\\n\\n\r\nEven the show's serious side does have some issues. Kotoura-san is rather blatant in depicting the serious moments it portrays throughout its run with little in the way of subtlety in doing so. This is rather apparent in the opening half of the show's first episode where it depicts the growing problems in Kotoura's life that lead her to become an outcast due to her psychic powers. The prolonged time focused on building up on her problems is a bit overboard and does make it kind of hard to take seriously in spite of any intentions that the show's creators had to make it a serious one. The blatant approach Kotoura-san takes to exploring the pathos of its cast won't be for everyone, especially for those that prefer drama that is a bit more subdued.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of its flaws, Kotoura-san was still a mostly solid series exploring our female lead's recovery from a traumatic past she had no control over through making friends who accepted her and moving on from the past she suffered from. It is still worth a look if you are into high school dramedy.",

All my friends who watch Anime when I said to them 'Guys! You should watch Kotoura-San it is adorable and epic!' They just shrugged their shoulders... This aside I am a fan of romance and Comedy as a duo. They seem to go hand in hand very well. And Kotoura-San does this very well indeed.\r\nAs for the story it is a very good one, Filled with the (Hilariously) Perverted mind of Manabe and the wishful love thoughts of Kotoura. This story wasanother which Brought a tear to my eye. I could not stop thinking about it for a long time. It made me ponder the Value of love and what it can do to someone. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the Art style I'd say I like it... That would be because I like things that are cute and Cuteness is in abundance here. The only downside was that compared to others, The art was fairly basic, But it did not take a whole lot away. And the music... Well considering I was still listening to the Ending song about 2 Months after I finished it on my Lonely walks home from school it is very good indeed. \\n\\n\r\nFinally the characters. As it only focuses mainly on the few characters in the Society it puts all its effort into them and more into Kotoura and Manabe than the others. Which is to be understood I guess... It just slightly harmed its score when it tried to bring other people into the equation during the Police arc etc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved this Anime. It tugged my Heartstrings and really was very Enjoyable. And this was also the First Anime I watched... You could say it was a gateway :P",

I found the characters were well done and we can see their development throughout the show, the art was also consistent. The show only had those dark moments for a bit and the rest was the group interacting and changing. The humor was funny and you really grew to care for the characters. Kotoura-san is a fun and enjoyable anime by the end of the show you feel that all plot points have beencovered and that it was a fun. The running gag between Kotoura-san and and Manabe is his perverted fantasies and I enjoyed them because we now see Kotoura-san opening up again. I find that Kotoura-san is not supposed to be taken seriously it is a feel good anime where we see a sad girls' life change for the better. This review may be biased in the case of me being a softy for these things, but I liked the show and I recommend you watch it if you thought the show sounds interesting. \\n\r\n\"Have Fun.\"",

            "content": "The first few minutes of this show is surely enough to make a grown man cry. It is one of the most powerful few minutes of anime i've ever seen.\r\nThe show itself focuses on alienation, childhood trauma, and the problems which persist after the events pass. It deals with this in the form of comedy with a bit of drama in between, but mostly comedy. Sadly the show as a whole pitters out at the end where all of the Kotoura's problems simply cease being a problem, and every other conflict along the way gets glossed over with comedy.\r\nto sum it all up though itwas still fun to watch, though you'll have to have a certain taste for bad jokes. However despite it's lack luster state, i would still recommend that everyone give this show a try if only for the first few minutes of the first episode. It is so detached in style and of such weight that it feels as if they swapped writer and director.",

            "content": "May contain minor spoilers. \r\nWhen the premise of the show revolves around something as dark as the reality of mind-reading abilities, you kind of expect it to go somewhere, somewhere far. And Kotoura-san tries to do that, but... it just... it doesn't go that far.\r\nKotoura-san starts out with this incredibly morbid and foreboding foundation of how the character suffers and is traumatized for life and is basically ostracized from all of society. I suppose that the show wanted to maintain the level of seriousness that it chose to slap the viewer's faces with in the beginning of the show, but does that really happen? Notreally.\\n\\n\r\nYikes. Okay then. That's quite dark. That's quite a dark and deep story and something that, with the right plot movements, can become a worth-while show. And I can't say I wasn't interested. I wanted to see more of Kotoura. I had grown fond of this cute little thing who everyone hates and doesn't want to be friends with. \"I'll be your friend,\" I thought to myself, smiling, unaware of how unpredictable (or predictable) the show would become.\\n\\n\r\nI'll move on to the characters, and boy do I have very little to say about them. The biggest thing, really, is that Manabe, the second main character, is a true disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Manabe. In the first episode. Only. You have this girl who suffers terribly and then.... you have a perverted, absent minded fool as, I guess, sort of the \"savior\" of her social life. Now, I completely understand that Kotoura's love interest would have to deviate quite substantially from everyone else she's known in her life. And yes, that character must have some strange quality that \"negates\" Kotoura's abilities, allowing her to live her life normally around said person. But even if that were the case, could the character Manabe have been any more pathetic? I mean, he just has no depth. No relateable background, no real ability (his ability to produce perverted images doesn't count), just some random guy doing random things and just happening to find the attention of Kotoura. No merit to his relationship with Kotoura. I might be nit picking, maybe, but it just feels so unfair to Kotoura, who is infinitely more intricate in terms of background than Manabe, when she has to rely on... that guy. Now one might say, \"Manabe's real ability is his ability to make friends with anyone, and doesn't afraid of getting his mind read, because he's honest and a good person and friendly.\" Then I say to that that that is a cop out, and a terrible way to finish a potential-filled show on the second episode. The author had an amazing chance to make an excellent couple, and chose the \"normal\" guy route. But anyways...\\n\\n\r\nThe art looked somewhat blurred at times, but for the most part it got the job done and delivered a good experience. The sound wasn't too bad either, and I did enjoy the music. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the problems, I did choose to stick around till the end and see how Kotoura's issues become resolved. While there definitely were moments when I felt bored and thought to myself, \"Get it over with,\" (Even skipping a few parts because of how predictable the dialogue and plot was), There were some quite humorous moments that allowed this show to break even. Break even. And if you're done watching and re-watching some of the better shows, then I do ask that you give Kotoura-san a try. But no one will blame you if you don't like it. \\n",

            "content": "Kotoura-san has a lot going for it. Good art style, very good voice acting, the male lead has a personality and some good moments. However, i feel as though Kotoura-san isn't good at figuring out it's tone. \r\nNot saying you can't mix angst and comedy, because you can, but you should pick when in a scene is a funny moment okay. A sad moment will happen and a perverted based joke will happen in the same scene. I feel like maybe they should have put the funnier moments after the sad scene to try and lighten up the mood instead of the middle of it.\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that often these sad moments contain heavy subjects for some people and you go and try to lighten it up in the middle of it? That feels very conflicting to me. A lot of the jokes don't really preform well as every joke is based on perverted humor and not maybe a clever pun or something else. \\n\r\nI would say the biggest mishandling is the main character as what's set up about her doesn't match what goes on in the anime. Yes it is beautiful that a girl like her finally makes friends but the way her personality is doesn't match up her backstory at all. I would still recommend it because when the sadder moments happen it's VERY well written but the comedy moments and everything else isn't written very good.",

            "content": "Kotoura-san is one of the firsts shoujos I've watched. I thought the anime overall was poor on its story until I read the manga from where it came from. After reading the 9 chapters published I realized how amazing this anime actually is, and it could have been one of the best animes ever made if they had payed attention to some things. Few spoilers ahead.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe plot for Kotoura-san attracted me for showing a problematic girl as the protagonist. Being born in a rich family, plus with the gift of reading minds, Kotoura lived a happy life with her family. That until her abilitystarted to trouble everyone around - including her own parents, who got divorced because of the divergency their daughter caused. She carries the burden of the blame everyday and, afraid of hurting more people, she becomes a lone soul, wandering around and hearing other people's thoughts.\\n\r\nHowever, her plan of excluding herself of society didn't work out since she gets the attention of Manabe, a charismatic but pervy boy that's willing to be by her side on every situation. Because of him, Kotoura is able to meet a part of the world she didn't knew it existed, while she tries to make peace with her family and her own self.\\n\r\nNow, are you gonna be surprised if I say this story is focused on comedy?\\n\r\nYes. To leave all the drama aside, they show Kotoura and her friends living different and funny situations, things that an ordinary girl should deal, because that's all Kotoura ever wanted. She never asked for an ability, and the purpose of the anime is to show this teenage girl finally accepting herself.\\n\r\nThe story for Kotoura-san is very, very limited in the manga, so in here they really tried to explore the struggle with her ability and her relationships to put in the drama, so as the elements of action and romance. This is one of the few anime adaptions that made the right decision on adding fillers, because the manga itself literally doesn't show any development. It's only comedy, so I really love that they went throught exploring her past and everything, just to make a more pleasant story. They left everything on balance. However, 12 episodes aren't enough to develop an excentric theme like this, so there's a still a lack of things, like the focus on the other characters beside Kotoura and Manabe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is fine. Funny and cute as it should be. Nothing too worthy mentioning.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI like the opening. The dubbing was nice. Nothing really special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWe don't have the cliche group of friends in here. All the 5 characters appearing on the story are very peculiar and, different from the manga, they all have a background, some more longer than others. Kotoura is actually a cliche shoujo protagonist: insecure, shy and fragile, but as they show her past and development, you get affection for her and it's like watching a child grow. I love Muroto's design.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI remember really enjoying watching this. I sang the opening in an exciting way, thought about it during class, stuff you do when you like a certain anime. Some may not believe, I even cried during one episode. You can think Kotoura's life is a forced drama, but I really felt her feelings because I myself have my problems with my family. I related to her in various aspects, and it's amazing when you find a story similar to yours. Kotoura-san showed me that even the most precious gifts, things people envy from others, - because Kotoura is from a rich family AND can read minds, who wouldn't want that?! - those things can't complete someone, they can't fill a heart, you know? Ah, I'm really considering rewatching this show someday.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nDoesn't it had the potential to be a freaking amazing story? Yes, it did. But then, they decided focus on the comic side of it. That's what basically ruined it for me. Kotoura had a rough life, and adding perverted jokes or fanservice won't make it more pleasant. What makes a story pleasant is watching an unhappy character becoming a lively, powerful, grown-up one. If the author had an mature mind, she/him could have made one of the best stories ever.\\n\\n\r\nFor the slice of life genre, this is amazing. But, for me, it would be perfect if it were... Actually a serious story. Still, is a great show to have fun and kill time.",

            "content": "I've been reading a lot of mixed reviews for this show so here I am wanting to add in my two cents.\r\nOverall, I  personally would give this show about a 7.5/10 but since MAL likes their whole numbers, I will round it up to an 8.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe story was heart-warming to say the least. Although there was definitely some plot-holes left, and I felt that 12 episodes wasn't enough to unfold the story for all the characters. The story itself was focused on finding your own identity - your place in the world, and also about friendship, with a little bit of romance.This was very well done for the main character, Kotoura, but weaker for the other characters. I think the story would have been better adapted into arcs if we wanted to get a better sense of the own character's story and self-identity builds. Instead, their backgrounds were only glimpsed at from Kotoura's mind-reading. Overall, I was satisfied with the story, but I wish to have seen better endings for the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was well-done for the most part. Kotoura's \"moe\" portrayal worked really well for this anime. It gave her the cute/innocent vibe and helped draw the attention to her. However, the other character's designs were not as rich/expressive for their personality to shine through (note: I feel that a good score should have art being complementary to the personality of the characters, as well as the setting). One of the worst examples was Manabe; he had a bland character design, and I was not drawn to him at all -- only his personality was kept me somewhat interested in him. I also found Moritani to not be particularly done well either. She should have been drawn a little more intimidating to match her background for my liking -- she appeared really weak/frail, and almost like her personality changed from the antagonist to protagonist was as if two different people actually switched. Overall, I really enjoyed Kotoura's art, and the portrayal of comedy scenes (e.g. Manabe's perversion). \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the opening, and the various ending themes. It had more of a cheerful disposition which gave me some hope that Kotoura's tragic backstory would result in a better ending for her. I also liked how the different endings matched for certain episodes to help get you in the mood when continuing to the next episode. Lastly, I am pleased to see that the opening and ending themes are not major spoilers to the anime itself -- I have seen some animes where this has been the case. Overall, I found the sound the themes appropriate for the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\r\nI am giving this an 8 solely on the character development of Kotoura throughout the show. I really liked her, and I felt pity and happiness throughout the different episodes. When I am moved by a character from a short anime like this, it is a good sign. However, as I expressed within the story rating, I found the other character's to be much weaker and wish I knew more about them, and that they had a better ending. I also had difficulty believing the character change on Moritani. She originally was portrayed as an initial antagonist but suddenly became friendly (I won't get into spoilers), and I felt her addition to the rest of the cast was random. I wish she wouldn't have became so 2D later, and acted as the show's cheerleader. One other character that I did enjoy was Mifune, although I wish I saw a better ending for her. Overall, Kotoura was done well, but the other characters were weaker in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI felt moved by this series, and I really enjoyed the slice of life element to it. Some of the transitions between tragic, and happy were done too fast which felt a bit chunky and unbelievable at times. I am a sucker for animes that involve friendship conquering all which was a nice element to have in here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.5/10 rounded to 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this series if you are interested in slice of life, romance, and comedy. It had a nice mix of in between. Although if you really want a deep development in different types of characters, this anime isn't for you. The story focuses on Kotoura, and it becomes apparent throughout the series. If you like moe as well, Kotoura-san gives you plenty of it!\\n\\n\r\n...This also makes my first written review!!",

            "content": "\"Oh boy, some random chump has come to our site thinking he can write anime reviews.  Better get our torches and pitchforks.\"  Seriously though, this is my first review ever, so expect it to be a bit rough.  I did take a media criticism class in school though, so that might help a little bit.  Of course, this is all assuming this equates to more than a shout in the void, which might be unlikely.  Regardless, after seeing ratings for this show ranging from a 3 to a 10, I was itching to put in my 2 cents.  IfI get people to read it along the way, so much the better.\\n\\n\r\nFirst things first: the story.  It is worth mentioning that I came into this anime well aware of one of it's shortcomings, that being the fact that it starts to get weaker around the fifth episode.  Due to this fact, I came in knowing that I had to keep my expectations in check.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons I came out enjoying it more than a lot of people seem to.  Something to keep in mind as I go over some of the main points of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets props for having quite an interesting concept.  We've all seen mind reading used as a plot point in fiction, but I don't think I've ever seen it explored in this kind of way before.  It's interesting to see something that seems so useful on paper being deconstructed like that, and showing how it ends up being little more than a burden for the titular character.  The subject matter was an interesting twist that kept the show from seeming like an ordinary slice of life type show with nothing unique going for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has a tone that is all over the place.  At times it's comedic while at others it is very dramatic.  While I think it does drama better than comedy, I don't hold the opinion that the show should have kept going with what it was doing in the first 10 minutes.  There is a show that focuses primarily on being a \"forever alone\" drama, and that is Watamote.  Honestly, I got bored with Watamote after awhile.  I empathized with the main character, but I got tired of the show never getting passed showing her misfortune and social awkwardness.  If Kotoura-san went in the same direction, I probably would have gotten bored with it as well.  I would take a little of drama and comedy over that option any day.  Plus, I like arks that have a character start with nothing and slowly gather a circle of friends.  That is one of the reasons I like Gaara as a character (oh no, he mentioned Naruto!  Minus one hundred trillion credibility points!). \\n\\n\r\nThe beginning was undeniably the best part of the show as it did the best job keeping a good tonal balance keeping it from being too melodramatic or hammy, exploring the nature of Kotoura's power and its effects on relationships, and also had the best character interactions (Moritani was a great love to hate antagonist in the early part of the show). Unfortunately the middle was undoubtedly a step down in quality.  While some seem to hold the opinion that the detective ark was one of the main weak points of the show, while I hold the view that it was a breath of fresh air compared to what came directly before it.  Yes, the unique condition of the criminal seemed to be a cop out in a lot of ways, the identity of the crook was easy to determine, and the storyline as a whole seemed way too familiar to Persona 4.  Despite this, I feel like more effort was put into it than the episodes that directly preceded it, primarily due to the fact that those episodes seemed to just be generic anime material to me.  It had a beach episode!  Beach episodes are one of the poster children of cliched tropes in anime.  Additionally, some of the humor in the middle of the series just seemed in bad taste to me (I point to incestuous Grandpa and the time that Moritani and Manabe were hallucinating as examples of what I think count as this shows humor going too far).  The last ark did a much better job of presenting comedy that didn't go beyond my personal comfort zone.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the ending is concerned, I thought it did it's job well.  I will agree that some things came off as rushed, but I feel that is to be expected to some extent considering we're talking about condensing volumes of a manga into 12 episodes.  There was no plot point left open at the end of the day, and nothing that happened in the last episodes appeared to me to come from left field (yes, that includes the character development of Kumiko).  The show tied up it's loose ends and ended in a way that didn't leave much in the way of lingering questions.  I think the ending did it's job well.  In short, the show started great, stumbled on the half way mark, and picked itself up near the end, though I'll admit it never reached the levels of quality it began with.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the art and sound, which won't take up nearly as much time (I promise).  The art past the first few minutes of the show was very moe (not a huge fan of that term, but it fits).  Seriously, it seems like all of the female characters have a noticeable flush in their face throughout the entire story, and it would be a lie to say it wasn't a bit distracting.  Other than that, I don't have a ton of things to say about the art.  It did its job, but it didn't blow my mind.  Same can be said for sound, as I struggle to remember songs outside of the opening theme.  Little stuck out, but nothing got in the way.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there is the issue of the characters.  On the one hand, they can be a little archeytipical (there is the shy one, the pervy one, the smart one, the tomboyish one...), the vast majority of the cast gets some manner of character development, so you don't get the feeling that they are in stasis.  I can only say I hated one of the characters when all was said and done (that being the grandfather).  Even Manabe with his overly emphasized sexual mind comes off as ultimately being a likable character.  The characters, while not anything that hasn't been seen before, were for the most part treated well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the show delivered on presenting us with the familiar supernatural power of mind reading and putting it in a unique context.  \\n\r\nWhile some of the more comedic points are groan worthy, I think I ultimately got more out of the show with them there than I would have without them.  The show certainly had its shortcomings, but I walked away satisfied with the show in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's the end of that.  If someone  reads this and feels like they could point me in the right direction with writing these things, feel free to critique me.  \\n",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nWell it\u2019s finally over. I hate to say it but I had such high hopes for this show after seeing the opening episode but while Kotoura-san is energetic, beautiful to look at, and full of interesting characters, it falls far short of what I feel it was striving for.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThis anime takes many steps forward in trying to make this drama/slice of life interesting but unfortunately falls down the stairs one too many times. The show opens up in such an amazing fashion; Haruka is a very young girl who was born with the ability to read peoples thoughts. Unknowinglyshe spreads out everyone\u2019s feelings and soon finds herself all alone at a very vulnerable stage. She also in the process ruins her parents\u2019 marriage by babbling out their personal plans with some not so ok people. She ends up at rock bottom with no one to turn to except her grandfather. Flash-forward a couple years to high school and she is still very shy and scared of reading people\u2019s thoughts. Just when she is about to give up all hope, she is introduced to Yoshihisa who takes a liking to Haruka despite her ability to see and hear every one of his thoughts. So this premise is freaking awesome right!? The first three episodes had me completely hooked because the premise was interesting and it felt like it was going to be a semi-serious high school drama. Well though luck kids because this show runs down stale lane after about the fifth episode. What the show turns into is your typical \u201cThis is what our club (the ESP society) did today\u201d which don\u2019t get me wrong isn\u2019t a bad thing for some shows. Why it doesn\u2019t work in Kotoura-san is because there was this big whole setup to make me think this show could be more than a romantic comedy. Speaking of comedy, the slapstick style humor and running gags in this show were funny the first time they were introduced but when the main gag of a show is the main character thinking of really pervy stuff and getting slapped for it\u2026like every episode, it gets a little boring. With crap airing right now like Da Capo III and Little Busters, I was really hoping this was going to be that somewhat awesome drama that Maoyuu Maou Yuusha also could have been (I found out that show was just all about boobs). After revising all the airing anime this season, I have to unfortunately agree with the rest of the internet in saying that there was just way too much moe stuff this season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.9/10\\n\\n\r\nGrr this is a tough thing to talk about because the animation in this show is both really basic looking but also fantastic\u2026all at the same time. There really isn\u2019t a lot of work done on the character models and in typical anime fashion when a comedic scene pops up, the facial expressions on the characters turn extremely basic looking for an added effect. Why I also fit in fantastic as an adjective is because the lighting, quality of the backdrops, and how the eyes were animated was just so\u2026awesome. \u201cWhat this guy is giving a good score based on eye animation?\u201d Yes, yes I am because like I said in my Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo review the show has a \u201cnormal\u201d feeling towards it but the little elements make it shine. The animation while a little too cartoony for my tastes was still unique and very pretty to look at. It would have scored even higher but I didn\u2019t find some of the character models very appealing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design was in my opinion pretty average in this anime. I did enjoy the opening theme quite a lot as it was both catchy and the instrumentation was to my liking. The voice actors also did a pretty good job but I got so fu#$ing annoyed with Haruka saying in her high pitched voice \u201cEwww Manabe!\u201d over\u2026and over\u2026and over again. Also the music used during the show was very generic and just not very appealing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters in Kotoura-san is that the ones that are interesting and unique don\u2019t give you a reason to like them and the main characters (Haruka and Yoshihisa) annoy the fu#$ out of you. So see the problem here? Yuriko and Daichi are both interesting but Yuriko\u2019s hidden agenda and true feelings just make her feel no remorse on my end and Hiyori is just an annoying tomboy third wheel. I do have to say that all the characters had good chemistry and created some funny and interesting moments throughout the season but as individuals not one of them stood out to me in an overly positive way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.4/10\\n\\n\r\nYeah a 6.4 sounds just about right for this show. The only noteworthy things I can praise this anime for was the amazing opening episode, catchy opening theme, and the unique art style. Believe me I REALLY wanted to like this show but it really did fail on me. God I really hope there is some new unique anime coming out soon because while I like a romantic comedy just as much as the next person, I don\u2019t want like five of them like this season. Go watch this though if you get bored because\u2026well it\u2019s better than watching School Days right?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",
