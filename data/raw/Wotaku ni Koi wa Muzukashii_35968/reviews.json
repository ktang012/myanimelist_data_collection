            "content": "Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I\u2019m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it\u2019s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won\u2019t forget.\r\nThe English translation title is \u201cIt\u2019s Difficult to Love an Otaku\u201d and \u201cLove is Hard of Otaku\u201d. Literally, those words mushed up together alreadyfeels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it\u2019s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there\u2019s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What\u2019s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don\u2019t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it\u2019s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn\u2019t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it\u2019s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you\u2019re probably thinking\u2026is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it\u2019s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it\u2019s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn\u2019t hide the fact that they care for each other. It\u2019s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn\u2019t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters\u2019 small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It\u2019s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There\u2019s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.\\n\\n\r\nNo fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it\u2019s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song \u201cFiction\u201d by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements. \\n\\n\r\nWith 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it\u2019s intended and that\u2019s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that\u2019s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it\u2019s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone. A show like this deserves more attention, seriously.\\n",

            "content": "I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 if my memory doesn't fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it's obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it's entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I thinkyou know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it's cute, but because it's unique, it's fun, and of course, it's got everything else going for it. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, look at it's competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it's cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it's second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can't compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, it's a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can't find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I'm sure it'll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it's watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it's because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you're single or with your partner. Even though it's centered on Otakus, it's biggest feature is that there's something for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I'm just talking about the normies here, if you're a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There's lots to list and I don't have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don't think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it's dance and there's been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that's not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it's an excellent example of a testament to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd we've barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven't seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn't get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn't overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn't a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn't at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way. \\n\\n\r\nI might be sounding like I'm fanboying like crazy but let's just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you're left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I'd call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It's got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don't have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don't want another group to come after me so I won't give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They're dating from the first episode itself and they're adults and they're Otakus. Reasons enough for why it's so fantastic? \\n\\n\r\nStill not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven't even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She's cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they're very much main characters as well since they're a main focus of the anime too! And that's not to mention the other supporting cast too, they're cute too and the biggest part is that even though they're a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can't find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute. \\n\\n\r\nSTILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it's synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those \u201conce in a blue baboon\u201d situations where they turned out to be good, and I'm talking from the perspective of people who don't like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1\u2019s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun. \\n\r\nComing back to the topic, it's artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you're watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it's artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had. \\n\\n\r\nIt's very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it's comedy didn't hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week\u2019s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you're a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn't too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :P\\n\\n\r\nYou and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I'm sure you'll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you'll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we're all Otakus aren't we?\\n\\n\r\nP.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it's inclusive despite it's otaku centered focus.

            "content": "Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.\r\nThe romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it ishardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes is this anime only rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are not really outstanding. There's no traits or moments that i feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples' relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is one problem i have with this anime. Maybe it's just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, i don't think those tracks could fit anywhere).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching daily lives of otaku couples. And that's it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture.",

            "content": "Welcome to the latest \"what if a bunch of generic teenagers were adults\" anime. Let\u2019s see what Japan has served up this time\u2026 Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku. Well, at least it has an interesting name, it\u2019d be even more interesting if the show had stayed true to it for at least a single episode. It didn\u2019t, and by the end of the first episode, the main characters are already dating.\r\nOkay, that one misgiving aside, Wotakoi is a decent workplace romantic comedy with plenty of good qualities but is ultimately weighed down by poor comedic timing. Let\u2019s first discuss what the show does wellbefore diving into the issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all fairly likable, while I never found any one of them to be great, their chemistry with one another is enjoyably infectious. With a premise like otakus falling in love, characterizing it\u2019s cast in a believable and relatable way is where the show\u2019s main success lies. For example, the lead character Narumi is a fujoshi and likely the most otaku of the four lead characters, yet she\u2019s never made into a caricature. Cutesy mannerism and a little pigeon-toed running aside, her hobbies seem realistic and aren\u2019t at the butt end of jokes. It\u2019s the same with her co-worker Koyanagi, she\u2019s a reasonably restrained fujo in public, but a well-known cosplayer at conventions. In the first few episodes, she and Narumi slowly learn about their hobbies because you can\u2019t just dive headlong into the subject of BL with your co-workers unless you want to get a permanent side-eye from them. And Wotakoi handles this extremely well, otaku being sort of oddballs have to exercise self-restraint when talking about their hobbies. When they meet other otakus with similar tastes, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve finally found people who speak their own language. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an ideal foundation for a rom-com about otakus dating, but the lead pairing Narumi and Hirotaka already have known each other for years before they start working together, so it feels like it's not such a struggle for them to be in love. Unless if you consider the 'love is hard' to be referring to the glacial progression of the romance then I suppose it's faithful to the title. \\n\r\nAbout half of the show\u2019s screen time is spent in the office space like a typical work comedy, and the other half is on dates and drinking parties just to keep it fresh, but it's a romcom so a threadbare story structure is inevitable. What's really important is the characters, not story, but that doesn't excuse Wotakoi's stagnant narrative, which we'll discuss more in depth after the positives.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's cast being otakus makes them better, rather than being cringely portrayed like you may expect from its ilk, it's well done and relatable. The game otaku Hirotaka (and Narumi\u2019s childhood friend) plays and references plenty of games without it feeling forced or tacked on. If the group is going to play Mario Kart, the scene isn\u2019t about slamming the viewer over the head with Mario jokes, but the people playing the game. Good otaku representation is always ideal in a series like this because it helps the characters to feel relatable and fills in the gaps in their characterization. And that brings us to the issues. Aside from the characters being portrayed well for the archetypes that they fill, there is very little to them as people. It feels like they selected standard romcom archetypes, mixed them with otaku archetypes, then left the characters then forgot to add much depth leaving them as placeholders for actual people. We know the bare minimum about their personalities for them to function in a romcom. There the cutesy but occasionally oblivious Narumi, the stoic deadpan Hirotaka, as well as Koyonogi's air of confidence and cleverness, and the abrasive tsundere dude Kabakura. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much great character development at all. When the show gets into backstories and motivates it only goes skin deep then backs off as if it\u2019s afraid to tell us too much about the cast. Like the scene with Hirotaka telling Narumi about his ear piercing because the guy she was dating at the time had pierced ears as well. It was kindhearted and subtle flirting like Hirotaka tends to do throughout most of the series, with Narumi being typically oblivious or sometimes considering maybe she does love the guy she\u2019s dating. Hirotaka and Narumi flirting is comparable to trying to carve an ice sculpture with a pencil, there\u2019s barely any momentum and the characters hardly grow by the end. It doesn\u2019t help that the show is still adding characters by the tenth episode to digress from the lead couple. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are still quite watchable despite these flaws because the show's writing doesn't travel far outside of its comfort zone to create a well-rounded experience. It's a series with no noticeably bad moments, just plenty of meh ones. Wotakoi is sadly an example of; succeeding only because it did not try hard enough to risk failure. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, the characters are at least well designed, passionately voiced, and their hobbies are realistically detailed, and they do have chemistry. Seeing arguments that Kyabakura and Koyanagi have over BL and yuri feels like they understand their own opinions greatly like the author was pulling from real people\u2019s experience. If only the joke delivery capitalized on the chemistry\u2019s potential, it could have been better. The romance between the two main characters is quite stagnant, but sadly the comedy is also affected by its own pacing problems. The pacing is slow and the jokes don\u2019t hit with much impact. Looking at how the manga delivers jokes, it's much funnier and flows better. This adaptation just feels like a moving manga, there is no consideration for pacing or how it will animate. What likely caused this is a lacking budget and a director not talented enough to improve the source material in any way. \\n\\n\r\nFor example; sometimes we\u2019re slapped with an intentionally unfunny joke from the po-faced Hirotaka and they just hang on screen for a painful few seconds that feel more like an hour, grinding the scene\u2019s pace to a halt. That\u2019s the pace of a majority of the jokes, with very little animation aside from funny reaction faces (taken from the manga). Every joke is presented with a slow lethargic pace that makes the director seem like he has no concept of how to time a joke properly. That brings us to the show\u2019s production issues. Ok, to be fair, the op is really well done. It\u2019s dynamic, well edited, and offers plenty of details on the character\u2019s personalities. \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast having anime colored hair to help them stand out from the background is a bit jarring considering the blandness of their work environment. Speaking of which, often times it seems like the four leads are the only ones who work at the company. It\u2019s partially excusable when they\u2019re in a relatively small 6 cubicle office space. When wacky hijinks ensue and the four of them are running all throughout the building I can\u2019t help but wonder if A-1 couldn\u2019t spare the animation or if the writer couldn\u2019t make the jokes funny enough without having to unrealistically remove all of the background characters. I suppose it\u2019s better than the CGI crowds the show regularly uses. The end result is still somewhat funny if a bit unrealistic if only it didn\u2019t bend the audience\u2019s suspension of disbelief to get to the comedy. It\u2019s scenes like this that make you wonder if the show would have been better if it were adapted by a different studio. \\n\\n\r\nAh, if you noticed that I skipped over Kabakura when talking about what I liked about the characters, that was intentional. I think he\u2019s a jerk who treats Hanako like an asshole then occasionally makes it up to her by doing one nice thing. The friction between him and Hanako actually gave the show a chance to explore that theme of love being hard for otaku, but instead, the conflict is reduced to: they\u2019re together because they always have been. That itself is a message, that otaku don\u2019t have many options, but it\u2019s not a dynamic that you can just sweep under the rug. It should have been discussed because relationships like that do have negative effects on those involved, but like I mentioned there\u2019s no discussion it\u2019s just \"oh I\u2019m sorry, have this gift and we\u2019ll go back to normal\". They had some nicer scenes in the later half of the show, with them discussing yaoi versus yuri, and it\u2019s genuinely nice. But it needed to be more than just moderately pleasant, there needed to be more substance or at least effective comedy. \\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 6/10] Nice themes, very little progression.\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10] Great character designs, lackluster direction.\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10] Vivid opening, passionate performances.\\n\r\n[Character: 6/10] Likable and well portrayed, lacking characterization.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 6/10] Funny reaction faces, poorly timed jokes.\\n\r\n[Love Hardness Level: Easy]\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 6.4/10]\\n\r\nHaving relatable and uplifting themes is great, but a show should still be compelling on its own and that\u2019s where Wotakoi disappoints. The characters are likable for their strong personalities and in-depth hobbies, but they lack the development needed to be truly memorable. Even if the jokes weren't timed so poorly, this series is still lacking, but it sure could have helped if they hired a director with a better understanding of comedic timing.",

Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don't acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don't even hug or share a kiss? I don't know about you, but I have had enough!\r\nI tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.\r\nIn the beginning, I tried watching the firstepisode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard! \\n\\n\r\nA confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn't dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full. \\n\\n\r\nI grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two 'otaku' couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it's the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a very wholesome anime. It doesn't have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre.\\n",

            "content": "Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.  \r\nWotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their 'hardships' and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation. \\n\\n\r\nNow before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated. As a 10/10 that Ive given, this is one of the shows that I think will undoubtedly be enjoyable for all, a very simple story, very likable characters and catchy OP/ED, all adds up to a great show overall. This is one of the shows that ill anticipate for every week, like how when youre 6 and eagerly waiting for the ice cream truck to come by every weekend. Even if rom-com isnt your taste, by all means give it a try, maybe youll poke into a region youve never experienced before too.",

            "content": "I'm surprised there aren't more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark. \r\nStarting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn't require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces.The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people's eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.\\n\\n\r\nJokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn't funny or sweet purely through the \"nerd-culture\" content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There's so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you're looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume's anime walks all over this.",

            "content": "Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren't very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to \"yes, I am a vegan\" meme. Pretty cool. \r\nThere are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don't hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don't spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memesthat feel very accurate to 90's kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters don't feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show.",

            "content": "Do you know why conventions are so wonderful? Because you\u2019ll be surrounded by those who love the same things you love, the way you love them. But that isn\u2019t the whole picture here. You\u2019re also surrounded by people who love things you don\u2019t even know about, but you love your respective things in the same way, so you get to love your thing enthusiastically, completely, unironically, without fear of judgement. Being an otaku or a geek is not about what you love; it\u2019s about how you love it. In society, many like this tend to masquerade as a \u201cnormie\u201d in fear of not being accepted,especially when it comes to loving someone\u2014which is why Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi: Love Is Hard For Otaku) is so relatable and extends to all facets of the geekdom culture, it\u2019s a heartwarming rom-com series with a firm message to convey in that love is difficult\u2014not just for otaku but for everyone. Being avoided by people because they judge you based on your hobbies isn\u2019t right and Wotakoi does its best to show you the great times you can have when the people around you do accept and understand you.\\n\\n\r\nWotakoi takes on a rather interesting and refreshing spin on your typical rom-com series, it follows the lives of four adults in their 20\u2019s whom all work an office job together. What is so unique about it is that it begins where most other rom-com stories typically end\u2014with our protagonists actually in a relationship. Rather than simply end up in one, the story is about awkward people trying to maintain their relationships and explores the personal and interpersonal obstacles that come with it. They also handle these things like adults, that makes it an enjoyable take and it\u2019s like a breath of fresh air in this saturated genre. The show puts a magnifying glass on a couple of couples as they work, drink and play together. It begins with closeted fujoshi Narumi Momose who is an out-going and socially confident person, she gets a new job after a bad break-up and the reveal of her secret. It just so happens that one of her new co-workers is a childhood friend, Hirotaka Nifuji who is a stoic handsome gaming otaku. After a night of drinking and lamenting the scarcity of good men in her life, Narumi and Hirotaka begin dating. The two seem like the perfect match, but as the title says, love is hard for otaku. With the help of otaku couple and co-workers Hanako Koyanagi (cosplayer and boy love fanatic) and Tarou Kabakura (shoujo fanatic), they begin to work at their new relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the characters and for each couple is infectious and incredibly relatable, the scenarios are realistic, and the characters make every interaction entertaining. The focus is on the relationship itself rather than the journey towards starting a relationship and that is very important here. All characters have their own opinions in regards to their hobbies, decisions and just life in general and it's hilarious when they debate around these topics but at the end of the day they accept and respect each other for it. Their problems are much more grounded, not some free-for-all showdown on who gets senpai first or how couples easily break due to a simple misunderstanding and the like. Watakoi successfully handles realistic moments with larger-than-life interactions, from the romantic beats to the character's passion for their fandoms. Adults will be able to watch this show and laugh knowing that they have been through similar situations, especially if they are otaku as well. Another element it has is the ability to bring up conflicts and resolve them within the same episode which is something similar anime seem to stretch out over several, which can be exhausting and irritating. If Hanako is mad at Tarou for the millionth time, you can bet that Tarou will confront the issue and find a way to resolve it to make her feel better. This makes them feel real and human, they don\u2019t want to draw out conflicts too long.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe that\u2019s why the relationships in this series feel so realistic because they are about real problems faced by nerds and otakus everywhere and by real people in real relationships. Like the time Narumi is invited for a drink over at Hirotaka\u2019s apartment and her first thought was what underwear she\u2019s wearing. It\u2019s a very simple, everyday moment that probably every girl has faced in a new relationship\u2014like when does it become ok to fart in front of your significant other and not die from embarrassment etc. Then there\u2019s the larger theme of how much of yourself you reveal to other people, especially the person you\u2019re in a relationship with. It\u2019s another way this series is so relatable, dissecting the ways in which people present themselves to each other. Watakoi presents these themes in a hilarious way and while the comedy is great, it\u2019s a hit or miss generally speaking, because a lot of it is self-referential and often the main focus\u2014a lot of inside jokes about otaku culture. The characters interactions with each other are very heart-warming, but that alone doesn\u2019t give you quite enough substance if you don\u2019t click with the humour.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures did a good job visually, as to be expected, the accurately adapt the artwork and choose the right colour scheme for the setting of Watakoi, colourful and vibrant but not too over-the-top. The show had that seinen element to it and each character was designed to, not only look uniquely distinctive but to also accurately represent their personalities. Just through their designs alone, you could feel what each and every character was like. The Opening to this series is outstanding! You really get a sense for both the series and its characters. Their likes and dislikes are clearly expressed on screen as well as their relationships to one another. We see Narumi scribbling furiously while creating a doujinshi, Hirotaka playing video games, Hanako cosplaying and Tarou reading yuri manga as the scenes shift back and forth between how they appear at work and they really are being an otaku. It highlights a theme that resonates throughout the series, the balance between professional and personal lives, the person we display to the outside world versus the person we are on the inside. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is standard but it does make every cue hit. The song for opening \u201cFiction\u201d by Sumika, really helps set the tone for the series and was a perfect choice, worthy of being in your playlist. All strong performances with the voice acting, this series is heavy with dialogue and they make everything believable and use their range to make the jokes land more effectively. Every episode feels special and while the show isn\u2019t throwing many curveballs, it executes everything it set out to do perfectly. The references are integrated organically and the relationships don\u2019t feel superficial and that makes every moment feel much more significant. Watakoi\u2019s recipe for success is breathing new life into the genre, a risk that paid off, something that differs from the usual high-school setting while talking and connecting directly to its demographic, making it a much more fun and relatable experience.",

            "content": "Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That's it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010's sparking a big genre called ''School''.\r\nYet Im not talking about the ''School'' genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say ''How in the world does this four havea partner with their attitudes?''. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our ''in-real-life'' adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I'm not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.\\n\\n\r\nEvery anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don't need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material.",

            "content": "What makes a good romcom anime?\r\nCharacters\r\nComedy\r\nNarrative\r\nRelationships\r\nDrama\r\nRomance\r\nTheses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these\u00a0elements\u00a0that I just listed to make theses respective\u00a0shows better but yet only one of them was good though.\r\n3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had\u00a0characters\u00a0would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like aromcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal\u00a0of Otaku culture as well the characterization\u00a0and relationships\u00a0were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully its\u00a0competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.\\n\\n\r\nSo what made this romcom so great you may ask?\\n\\n\r\nYou gonna to find out soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nHello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the story for\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.\u00a0 Unlike\u00a03D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to\u00a0establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear\u00a0Narumi\u00a0inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed.\u00a0Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku's but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there\u2019s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don\u2019t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.\\n\r\nLike with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that's goes along.\\n\r\nThe show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture\u00a0where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it's references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,\u00a0 JoJo etc\\n\r\nThe one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn't take place at high school. Don't get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.\u00a0 I know this doesn\u2019t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.\\n\r\nOur female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she\u2019s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn't tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won't do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.\\n\r\nHirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn\u2019t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he\u2019s not a shamed of it.\\n\r\nThe character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act\u2019s outside of work life.\\n\r\nHanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.\\n\r\nOverall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nFor a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it's nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing\u00a0designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it's not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nOverall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.\\n\r\nThe story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.\\n\r\nDespite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of\u00a0Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.\\n\r\nFinal Score 8.5/10",

            "content": "TL;DR It's a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn't recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don't think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don't like Romantic-Comedies.\r\nWotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I'm just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplaymaking people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...\\n\\n\r\nBUT THAT'S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff. \\n\\n\r\nThose who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn't mean they aren't nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending. \\n\\n\r\nIs this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don't think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It's an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows.",

            "content": "Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver. \r\nIt has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you\u2019ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku\u2019s.You get a peek into the lives of otaku\u2019s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nStill don\u2019t believe me this isn\u2019t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it\u2019s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it\u2019s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it\u2019s treated more like a joke. There\u2019s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It\u2019s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple. \\n\\n\r\nI will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It\u2019s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn\u2019t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "A workplace romance comedy about otaku's going into a relationship?..LA's in!\r\nTo be absolutely honest, LA didn't think too much of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii but after watching the anime, heck from the FIRST episode alone, the anime resonated with LA, both in it's romance and comedic elements but especially with it's characters of course.\r\nWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii a character-centric, but to be precise a relationship-centric anime and for it being a rom-com about otaku couples, this is a given. It follows Narumi Momose voiced by Arisa Date who has gotten a new job however she bumps into her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji voicedby Kento Itou and blurts out that she's an otaku to her superiors, the thing is Narumi shifted jobs because of her obsession with anime and manga and being a fujoshi and kept it hidden to her normie boyfriends. Here's another thing, Hirotaka's and Narumi's superiors, well they are otaku's as well, Tarou Kabakura voiced by Di- Tomokazu Sugita, Hirotaka's superior and friend at work who is a huge manga fan, while Hanako Koyanagi voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro is Narumi's and a somewhat famous cosplayer and massive BL fan. Anyways with Narumi depressed that her secret's out, Hirotaka ventured that maybe he could be her boyfriend and support Narumi with her hobby and her in turn as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then and there, LA could already root for Hirotaka and Narumi's relationship with how many things they can relate with one another whilst having very different personalities, whilst Kabakura and Hanako's relationship is the polar opposite, yes they fight ALOT within the anime but them like Hirotaka and Narumi being childhood friends, their fighting subsides and they look at the bigger picture for both themselves as well as Hirotaka and Narumi and because of this, LA rooted for both of their relationships to work out and not many animes have LA rooting for BOTH beta and main couples but Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii did it!\\n\\n\r\nIt's the character chemistry with Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii that just clicks with you and ALSO relatable at that. LA being very much similar to Hirotaka in a ways (but with anime instead of games) and LA's favorite character being Narumi so there was that, but seeing the four main characters just talking, having fun and helping each other with games, Comiket, watching anime, MMORPG's and with their love life out just made each of the core cast very solid, both individually and with their relationships as well, you know that they're friends and their actions bloody shows it and the factor of the entire otaku element is just icing in the cake for LA.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the comedy does have the typical character jabbing at times, but it also goes into anime references ALOT (especially with A1-Pictures previous works) as well as gaming and some of the comedy does involve observational jokes but they have all the great reaction timing and great voice acting that applies towards it that LA laughed ALOT in this anime and you know what LA says about comedies...it's all subjective, but the second one being if it'll make you laugh, it's done it's job.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by A1-Pictures, well LA has to give A1-Pictures props towards it's character designs, being distinguishable and distinct but even for such a minimalistic cast, A1-Pictures did great on the backgrounding work even if it's mainly work, Hirotaka's house and the gaming world but nonetheless, without needing the characters to say it you know what's what...even if the surtitles give it away anyways but semantics. \\n\\n\r\nFor voice acting, well we have mostly veteran voice actors like Celt- Miyuki Sawashiro, Di- Tomokazu Sugita, Ere- Yuki Kaji as Hirotaka's younger brother and Hibi- Aoi Yuuki so typically it would be a great cast, but our two main couple of Hirotaka and Narumi are some fresh new voices, that of Kento Itou and Arisa Date, Kento Itou has been in iDOLM@STER SideM as Michio Hazama, but as Hirotaka he's does a great job in portraying the laid back, stoic gaming otaku even if he's pretty deadpan most of the time but nonetheless. The obvious standout the the best til last...goes to Arisa Date and LA actually knows of Arisa because she was casted in iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls (Huh, Arisa and Kento were both in iDOLM@STER spinoffs before doing this anime...coincidence?) as Emi Namba, the comedienne idol and now Arisa is flexing her chops as Narumi and LA just loved her acting throughout the anime, what's the best way of saying her vocal range was like, like a higher pitched (but controlled) and EVEN MORE HYPER Ayane Sakura and her overreactions were priceless to say the least, maybe some bias towards LA liking Narumi but still LA will MVP to Arisa Date nonetheless for her brilliant reactionary range, she was not only a perfect fit for Emi Namba but Narumi as well, hope she'll get more roles!\\n\\n\r\n*ahem* Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a brilliant down to earth, hilariously funny romcom about otaku's for otaku's like us with a solid cast and characters with some decent production value and a brilliant voice cast. \\n\\n\r\nLove doesn't seem hard for these otaku..LA is jealous.",

Its a real slice of life anime that I enjoyed watching.  It was mellow, realistic, sweet and funny.\r\nArt: The art was decent! The designs of characters are important for me in a show and all ofthe characters in this show looked good as did the places they went to.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing that really stood out or disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  All the characters were good! They all worked well off each other and i really didn't have a problem with anyone! Usually in a romance anime, there will be that one person you can't stand that tries to get in between a couple but I'm glad i didn't have to worry about that for this.  Everyone was chill.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Overall: I had a good time watching this show!  If anything, I wish there were more episodes so we could see the relationships progress more than it did but hey maybe there will be a season 2 or ova!  I highly recommend it to people who want to see a real chill, funny slice of life that is somewhat romantic that doesn't have pointless petty drama that doesn't make sense:)",

            "content": "Once again, I found another reason why A-1 Pictures should focus on making romance comedy anime rather than action anime. One reason is with this anime, A-1 Pictures crews proofed themselves that they excel in writing short plots or building a character within those plots. Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii or Wotakoi, if you don't like to stumble your tongue, is an anime about love story and friendship between otakus in a working environment. The premise itself is very enough to drag me into watching this anime as I am an otaku who will enter the working society very soon.\r\nFrom many romance anime I haveever watched, this anime maybe the closest one to reality as I really know that many people resent otaku for some unknown reason and dating another otaku maybe the only solution if you do not want to stay single. Enter the life of a fujoshi who just switched to a new job after her true nature as a fujoshi discovered by her ex-boyfriend who resent her for being one. She eventually surrounded by other otakus in her new job starting from her childhood friend game otaku, to a cross-dressing cosplayer otaku, and to an Evangelion loving otaku. What makes the story special to me is how we could relate to the situations happen in this anime making this anime so much immersive on its own especially if you are a hardcore otaku.\\n\\n\r\nI love how they depict each of their character as different kinds of otaku stereotypes. It gave us a more real perspective on otaku since nobody love everything. In the real anime community, we have different kinds of opinion and genre we love personally. Not rare that we fought each other just because our opinion over a genre or even over a best girl and I think that makes Wotakoi attached to me. This different spectrum in their characters makes us easier to relate and enjoy the plot even more.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I really love how they slip otaku references here and there. Somehow reference jokes are always making me laugh and Wotakoi really did their job by making a good punchline for each of that reference joke. For you who really loves to pick many easter eggs along your way, this anime is perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah! You definitely should check the opening song. I really love that opening song that being sung by sumika. It is catchy and really sticks to the romance comedy vibe that this anime offers to us.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime really made me attached as I could relate to many things happened in this anime and every instances in this anime felt real and could happen anywhere and anytime in the real time. I would really like to see more of this potential as I hope they roll another season for this anime.",

            "content": "Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii: The King of Rom Com anime has arrived\r\nHonestly, I think the only thing I could criticize about Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is that it had only 11 episodes. What a great series!\r\nIn my first impressions I already said that this series could be the revelation of the season; however, I must say that I was wrong. Why? Because I was too short. This series came to fight the top in the top of best romantic comedy anime.\r\nWhen a series has good characters, is daring to establish the plot, manages to create great and fun scripts from the setting, isable to develop its characters without having a defined core plot, shows the couple's relationship realistically, has a very good soundtrack; and has a direction that manages to blend all of the above in a brilliant way, how will not you fight for the top?\\n\\n\r\nAnd I am leaving out many other points in favor of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii, or Wotakoi as it is known in the community. I could have added that the series has lots of references to other works or products of anime, manga, cinema, theater and even advertisements; or that this anime did not hesitate to start from the get-go with its two main couples already established.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, to further subvert that legendary clich\u00e9 that the leading couple must be established in the epilogue; the setting established that Hanako and Tarou had been dating together for years before the beginning of the series. What happens is that it was overshadowed by the fact that Narumi and Hirotaka started dating right at the end of the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, here it is necessary to point out that all this argument comes from the original material. The manga created by Fujita already has the couples perfectly built, so the great merit of Yoshimasa Hiraike in directing the anime and writing the scripts was to achieve an excellent adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, those who saw this series witnessed a masterful development that included several key aspects: 1) A humor that feels fresh and natural. Gone are those formulas of forced scenes, of sexual jokes for elementary school children, of exploitation of the child from the beginning or of the genre of the false Japanese harem.\\n\\n\r\nAnd many could say that this was because the protagonists were adults; However, in others they also have adult protagonists and yet the creators make them behave worse than a teenager. In fact, in many series (including several), one of the main criticisms is that it seems that the fact that the protagonist is an adult is something nominal because you never see it in his behavior.\\n\\n\r\n2) An exploitation without fear of the fact that the two couples were counted since the go. Within the few series that established the protagonists as a couple from the beginning or in the first exchange, not all the others are done afterwards and that is something that often ends up weighing.\\n\\n\r\nIn some cases, the establishment itself is a liar because the classics are the parameters where a girl who looks promising for the protagonist arrives, but in reality there is nothing between them; in others, it is true that the couple establishes themselves, but then they delay it to show us basic things such as a date, a handshake and a kiss story.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, in Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii they had no qualms about showing us Narumi and Hirotaka, learning to be a couple at a logical and credible rhythm. Gentlemen, this is very important. If already with adolescents it is totally unreal to see them spend tons of episodes so they have the courage to hold hands; with adults that results in an abomination.\\n\\n\r\nIt was wonderful to see both Momose and Nifuji grow as a couple through experiences, thanks to the support of their friends and especially to decisions taken as a result of maturity according to their age.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the couple of Hanako and Tarou presented to the audience a very little-seen dynamic within the anime. Let's do a mental exercise, how many protagonic couples do you remember that for the beginning of the series they have been dating for years? And I do not mean those couples who live apart despite having years together. What's more, how many couples in the anime do you know that they have years together at the beginning of the series?\\n\\n\r\nAt the most, you can tell me the parents of the protagonists or some adult couple over there; however, these couples mostly do not have any relevance except to be plot points at some moment (sometimes, not even that). Therefore, the case of Hanako and Tarou is almost unprecedented not only in romantic comedy but in anime in general.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, that generated a lot of expectation because developing both characters was a challenge; however, after seeing the series it was clear that the execution was simply fantastic. Seeing Koyanagi and Kabakura it was easy to identify them with our own experiences or with those of people in our environment (whether otaku or not)\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the great secret of this series. Its naturalness and realism in developing the plot and the characters generated that the audience could identify fully with everything that happened. Much more, when the otaku world was a main part of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nI do not want to reveal anything of the plot because those who have not seen this series deserve to be able to enjoy it without spoilers; But I will say that each of the situations shown was hilarious, very creative and extremely realistic.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the references seen in the series were all great. First, because of the enormous quantity, but second, and more importantly, because of the creativity in making them. In addition, this posed an additional challenge for the audience because it was very difficult to identify them all.\\n\\n\r\nIs that within the opening itself is a great reference to musically, and that was already a statement of intent. Card Captor Sakura, Castlevania, Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, Evangelion, Mahou Tsukai no Yome, Asahi Super Dry beer, Mario Kart, Donkey Kong Country and Jo Jo, were just some of the works and / or products referenced in the anime. Even the acclaimed Japanese female theater company, Takarazuka Revue, was mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, the animation was competent with pointed peaks and valleys, the design of characters was attractive within the generic; and the management did a great job adapting the original work.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack, it was interesting that they looked for themes that would remind us of video games because that complemented very well with the visual resources used; In addition, the opening \"Fiction\" interpreted by Sumika was a fun theme that brilliantly managed to get us into the environment to enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a great anime that did virtually everything right and whose only palpable flaw was to have only 11 episodes (although despite this it managed to cover almost everything that has been published in the manga). It was amazing how quickly it made its way and hopefully we can have a second season soon. Definitely, \"The King left the building\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii came to show how to make a good romantic comedy anime without having to resort to the already insufferable formulas of the genre. 9.5/10.",

            "content": "Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku is very descriptive, bringing up the romance genre game another notch and problem to fix: romance is hard enough, so being an otaku, involved with love, does it make things complicated? Despite its circumstances, A-1 Pictures is a no brainer when it comes to the romance genre, coming from Your Lie In April a few years back, and consistently having ups and downs, but always to the degree where it's still good to watch and be satisfied with the end product.\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, Wotakoi illustrates the lives of four working-class otaku:\r\nHirotaka Nifuji and NarumiMomose, once schoolmates but their surprising encounter at their workplace immediately raises death flags, but yet continuity ensues that they have a working-class relationship on top of their presence as otaku: Hirotaka always attached to his games (esp Monster Hunter on the Switch as presented) and Narumi into comics (recommended by her next-in-line cosplay colleague and BL lover Koyanagi), and I must say, they pair off as a typical couple, but learning the ways while being otaku.\\n\r\nBoss-cum-colleagues Hanako Koyanaga, whom is a famous cosplay and an absolute BL lover (and couldn't stop fantasizing on Hirotaka and Kabakura) and Kabakura Tarou who doesn't give a shit ton about Koyanagi's whelms, despite the fact that the both of them ARE LEGIT couple-status, realming from their high school days to the working environment.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, it's enjoyable to see romance taken to the next level in terms of creativity and realism, for the fact that love can be subdued, torn down and patched-up. Wotakoi went the opposite route, by making the romance mix in with sliced moments of comedy mixed in with real game techniques (like the text bars and the game-like graphics) that add up to the excitement that is Wotakoi as a whole. The last time we saw this was with Pine Jam's Gamers!, and while that is a total misunderstanding of love against gaming, Wotakoi added the functionality of love, potentially seeing the main characters through and through with the struggle of love and their otaku preferences. Great job.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from A-1 Pictures, the art and animation is lively, detailed across the board, and everything looks and feels great that is a blissful watch to the eye. The manga adaptation itself is incomplete, but what was shown here was well deserving and more than enough to earn praises for it being comedic-focus while engaging at the very same time. It's not as much as Hinamatsuri (in the same season), but it's enjoyable nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST delivered beautifully with one of the best OSTs you could have this season. Especially the OP, \"Fiction\" by Sumika does give the hefty feel of what to come to expect from the show, and it truly did its job. \"Kimi no Tonari\" by Halca for the ED is also the nice roundabout way to end the episodes, and since the EDs always get the backlight, I will go to say that both tracks are excellent on its own, and I'm never disappointed each and everytime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it: Wotakoi, the season's top romance show. The rom-com shows of past glories have been stale for quite some time, and this series brought a heap of fresh air onto the table. Excellent job A-1 Pictures, and worthy of the rom-com recommendation each and everytime.",

            "content": "Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I\u2019m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it\u2019s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won\u2019t forget.\r\nThe English translation title is \u201cIt\u2019s Difficult to Love an Otaku\u201d and \u201cLove is Hard of Otaku\u201d. Literally, those words mushed up together alreadyfeels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it\u2019s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there\u2019s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What\u2019s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don\u2019t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it\u2019s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn\u2019t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it\u2019s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you\u2019re probably thinking\u2026is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it\u2019s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it\u2019s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn\u2019t hide the fact that they care for each other. It\u2019s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn\u2019t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters\u2019 small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It\u2019s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There\u2019s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.\\n\\n\r\nNo fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it\u2019s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song \u201cFiction\u201d by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements. \\n\\n\r\nWith 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it\u2019s intended and that\u2019s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that\u2019s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it\u2019s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone. A show like this deserves more attention, seriously.\\n",

            "content": "I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 if my memory doesn't fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it's obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it's entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I thinkyou know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it's cute, but because it's unique, it's fun, and of course, it's got everything else going for it. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, look at it's competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it's cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it's second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can't compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, it's a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can't find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I'm sure it'll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it's watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it's because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you're single or with your partner. Even though it's centered on Otakus, it's biggest feature is that there's something for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I'm just talking about the normies here, if you're a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There's lots to list and I don't have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don't think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it's dance and there's been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that's not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it's an excellent example of a testament to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd we've barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven't seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn't get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn't overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn't a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn't at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way. \\n\\n\r\nI might be sounding like I'm fanboying like crazy but let's just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you're left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I'd call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It's got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don't have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don't want another group to come after me so I won't give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They're dating from the first episode itself and they're adults and they're Otakus. Reasons enough for why it's so fantastic? \\n\\n\r\nStill not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven't even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She's cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they're very much main characters as well since they're a main focus of the anime too! And that's not to mention the other supporting cast too, they're cute too and the biggest part is that even though they're a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can't find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute. \\n\\n\r\nSTILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it's synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those \u201conce in a blue baboon\u201d situations where they turned out to be good, and I'm talking from the perspective of people who don't like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1\u2019s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun. \\n\r\nComing back to the topic, it's artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you're watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it's artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had. \\n\\n\r\nIt's very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it's comedy didn't hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week\u2019s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you're a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn't too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :P\\n\\n\r\nYou and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I'm sure you'll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you'll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we're all Otakus aren't we?\\n\\n\r\nP.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it's inclusive despite it's otaku centered focus.

            "content": "Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.\r\nThe romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it ishardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes is this anime only rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are not really outstanding. There's no traits or moments that i feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples' relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is one problem i have with this anime. Maybe it's just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, i don't think those tracks could fit anywhere).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching daily lives of otaku couples. And that's it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture.",

            "content": "Welcome to the latest \"what if a bunch of generic teenagers were adults\" anime. Let\u2019s see what Japan has served up this time\u2026 Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku. Well, at least it has an interesting name, it\u2019d be even more interesting if the show had stayed true to it for at least a single episode. It didn\u2019t, and by the end of the first episode, the main characters are already dating.\r\nOkay, that one misgiving aside, Wotakoi is a decent workplace romantic comedy with plenty of good qualities but is ultimately weighed down by poor comedic timing. Let\u2019s first discuss what the show does wellbefore diving into the issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all fairly likable, while I never found any one of them to be great, their chemistry with one another is enjoyably infectious. With a premise like otakus falling in love, characterizing it\u2019s cast in a believable and relatable way is where the show\u2019s main success lies. For example, the lead character Narumi is a fujoshi and likely the most otaku of the four lead characters, yet she\u2019s never made into a caricature. Cutesy mannerism and a little pigeon-toed running aside, her hobbies seem realistic and aren\u2019t at the butt end of jokes. It\u2019s the same with her co-worker Koyanagi, she\u2019s a reasonably restrained fujo in public, but a well-known cosplayer at conventions. In the first few episodes, she and Narumi slowly learn about their hobbies because you can\u2019t just dive headlong into the subject of BL with your co-workers unless you want to get a permanent side-eye from them. And Wotakoi handles this extremely well, otaku being sort of oddballs have to exercise self-restraint when talking about their hobbies. When they meet other otakus with similar tastes, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve finally found people who speak their own language. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an ideal foundation for a rom-com about otakus dating, but the lead pairing Narumi and Hirotaka already have known each other for years before they start working together, so it feels like it's not such a struggle for them to be in love. Unless if you consider the 'love is hard' to be referring to the glacial progression of the romance then I suppose it's faithful to the title. \\n\r\nAbout half of the show\u2019s screen time is spent in the office space like a typical work comedy, and the other half is on dates and drinking parties just to keep it fresh, but it's a romcom so a threadbare story structure is inevitable. What's really important is the characters, not story, but that doesn't excuse Wotakoi's stagnant narrative, which we'll discuss more in depth after the positives.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's cast being otakus makes them better, rather than being cringely portrayed like you may expect from its ilk, it's well done and relatable. The game otaku Hirotaka (and Narumi\u2019s childhood friend) plays and references plenty of games without it feeling forced or tacked on. If the group is going to play Mario Kart, the scene isn\u2019t about slamming the viewer over the head with Mario jokes, but the people playing the game. Good otaku representation is always ideal in a series like this because it helps the characters to feel relatable and fills in the gaps in their characterization. And that brings us to the issues. Aside from the characters being portrayed well for the archetypes that they fill, there is very little to them as people. It feels like they selected standard romcom archetypes, mixed them with otaku archetypes, then left the characters then forgot to add much depth leaving them as placeholders for actual people. We know the bare minimum about their personalities for them to function in a romcom. There the cutesy but occasionally oblivious Narumi, the stoic deadpan Hirotaka, as well as Koyonogi's air of confidence and cleverness, and the abrasive tsundere dude Kabakura. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much great character development at all. When the show gets into backstories and motivates it only goes skin deep then backs off as if it\u2019s afraid to tell us too much about the cast. Like the scene with Hirotaka telling Narumi about his ear piercing because the guy she was dating at the time had pierced ears as well. It was kindhearted and subtle flirting like Hirotaka tends to do throughout most of the series, with Narumi being typically oblivious or sometimes considering maybe she does love the guy she\u2019s dating. Hirotaka and Narumi flirting is comparable to trying to carve an ice sculpture with a pencil, there\u2019s barely any momentum and the characters hardly grow by the end. It doesn\u2019t help that the show is still adding characters by the tenth episode to digress from the lead couple. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are still quite watchable despite these flaws because the show's writing doesn't travel far outside of its comfort zone to create a well-rounded experience. It's a series with no noticeably bad moments, just plenty of meh ones. Wotakoi is sadly an example of; succeeding only because it did not try hard enough to risk failure. \\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, the characters are at least well designed, passionately voiced, and their hobbies are realistically detailed, and they do have chemistry. Seeing arguments that Kyabakura and Koyanagi have over BL and yuri feels like they understand their own opinions greatly like the author was pulling from real people\u2019s experience. If only the joke delivery capitalized on the chemistry\u2019s potential, it could have been better. The romance between the two main characters is quite stagnant, but sadly the comedy is also affected by its own pacing problems. The pacing is slow and the jokes don\u2019t hit with much impact. Looking at how the manga delivers jokes, it's much funnier and flows better. This adaptation just feels like a moving manga, there is no consideration for pacing or how it will animate. What likely caused this is a lacking budget and a director not talented enough to improve the source material in any way. \\n\\n\r\nFor example; sometimes we\u2019re slapped with an intentionally unfunny joke from the po-faced Hirotaka and they just hang on screen for a painful few seconds that feel more like an hour, grinding the scene\u2019s pace to a halt. That\u2019s the pace of a majority of the jokes, with very little animation aside from funny reaction faces (taken from the manga). Every joke is presented with a slow lethargic pace that makes the director seem like he has no concept of how to time a joke properly. That brings us to the show\u2019s production issues. Ok, to be fair, the op is really well done. It\u2019s dynamic, well edited, and offers plenty of details on the character\u2019s personalities. \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast having anime colored hair to help them stand out from the background is a bit jarring considering the blandness of their work environment. Speaking of which, often times it seems like the four leads are the only ones who work at the company. It\u2019s partially excusable when they\u2019re in a relatively small 6 cubicle office space. When wacky hijinks ensue and the four of them are running all throughout the building I can\u2019t help but wonder if A-1 couldn\u2019t spare the animation or if the writer couldn\u2019t make the jokes funny enough without having to unrealistically remove all of the background characters. I suppose it\u2019s better than the CGI crowds the show regularly uses. The end result is still somewhat funny if a bit unrealistic if only it didn\u2019t bend the audience\u2019s suspension of disbelief to get to the comedy. It\u2019s scenes like this that make you wonder if the show would have been better if it were adapted by a different studio. \\n\\n\r\nAh, if you noticed that I skipped over Kabakura when talking about what I liked about the characters, that was intentional. I think he\u2019s a jerk who treats Hanako like an asshole then occasionally makes it up to her by doing one nice thing. The friction between him and Hanako actually gave the show a chance to explore that theme of love being hard for otaku, but instead, the conflict is reduced to: they\u2019re together because they always have been. That itself is a message, that otaku don\u2019t have many options, but it\u2019s not a dynamic that you can just sweep under the rug. It should have been discussed because relationships like that do have negative effects on those involved, but like I mentioned there\u2019s no discussion it\u2019s just \"oh I\u2019m sorry, have this gift and we\u2019ll go back to normal\". They had some nicer scenes in the later half of the show, with them discussing yaoi versus yuri, and it\u2019s genuinely nice. But it needed to be more than just moderately pleasant, there needed to be more substance or at least effective comedy. \\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 6/10] Nice themes, very little progression.\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10] Great character designs, lackluster direction.\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10] Vivid opening, passionate performances.\\n\r\n[Character: 6/10] Likable and well portrayed, lacking characterization.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 6/10] Funny reaction faces, poorly timed jokes.\\n\r\n[Love Hardness Level: Easy]\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 6.4/10]\\n\r\nHaving relatable and uplifting themes is great, but a show should still be compelling on its own and that\u2019s where Wotakoi disappoints. The characters are likable for their strong personalities and in-depth hobbies, but they lack the development needed to be truly memorable. Even if the jokes weren't timed so poorly, this series is still lacking, but it sure could have helped if they hired a director with a better understanding of comedic timing.",

Anyways! The relationships between the mc\u2019s are developing as they get to know each other more and more and I am truly enjoying that journey, especially the little fights between Hanako andTarou.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something laid back yet cute and funny (and at times relatable), then I\u2019d really recommend watching this. This is definitely my favourite out of the new anime airing this season.\\n\\n\r\nps: I rated this with a 10 because I mainly rate anime based on how much I enjoy watching it so there's that!\\n",

Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don't acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don't even hug or share a kiss? I don't know about you, but I have had enough!\r\nI tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.\r\nIn the beginning, I tried watching the firstepisode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard! \\n\\n\r\nA confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn't dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full. \\n\\n\r\nI grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two 'otaku' couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it's the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a very wholesome anime. It doesn't have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre.\\n",

            "content": "Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.  \r\nWotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their 'hardships' and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation. \\n\\n\r\nNow before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated. As a 10/10 that Ive given, this is one of the shows that I think will undoubtedly be enjoyable for all, a very simple story, very likable characters and catchy OP/ED, all adds up to a great show overall. This is one of the shows that ill anticipate for every week, like how when youre 6 and eagerly waiting for the ice cream truck to come by every weekend. Even if rom-com isnt your taste, by all means give it a try, maybe youll poke into a region youve never experienced before too.",

            "content": "I'm surprised there aren't more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark. \r\nStarting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn't require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces.The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people's eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.\\n\\n\r\nJokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn't funny or sweet purely through the \"nerd-culture\" content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There's so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you're looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume's anime walks all over this.",

            "content": "Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren't very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to \"yes, I am a vegan\" meme. Pretty cool. \r\nThere are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don't hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don't spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memesthat feel very accurate to 90's kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters don't feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show.",

            "content": "Do you know why conventions are so wonderful? Because you\u2019ll be surrounded by those who love the same things you love, the way you love them. But that isn\u2019t the whole picture here. You\u2019re also surrounded by people who love things you don\u2019t even know about, but you love your respective things in the same way, so you get to love your thing enthusiastically, completely, unironically, without fear of judgement. Being an otaku or a geek is not about what you love; it\u2019s about how you love it. In society, many like this tend to masquerade as a \u201cnormie\u201d in fear of not being accepted,especially when it comes to loving someone\u2014which is why Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi: Love Is Hard For Otaku) is so relatable and extends to all facets of the geekdom culture, it\u2019s a heartwarming rom-com series with a firm message to convey in that love is difficult\u2014not just for otaku but for everyone. Being avoided by people because they judge you based on your hobbies isn\u2019t right and Wotakoi does its best to show you the great times you can have when the people around you do accept and understand you.\\n\\n\r\nWotakoi takes on a rather interesting and refreshing spin on your typical rom-com series, it follows the lives of four adults in their 20\u2019s whom all work an office job together. What is so unique about it is that it begins where most other rom-com stories typically end\u2014with our protagonists actually in a relationship. Rather than simply end up in one, the story is about awkward people trying to maintain their relationships and explores the personal and interpersonal obstacles that come with it. They also handle these things like adults, that makes it an enjoyable take and it\u2019s like a breath of fresh air in this saturated genre. The show puts a magnifying glass on a couple of couples as they work, drink and play together. It begins with closeted fujoshi Narumi Momose who is an out-going and socially confident person, she gets a new job after a bad break-up and the reveal of her secret. It just so happens that one of her new co-workers is a childhood friend, Hirotaka Nifuji who is a stoic handsome gaming otaku. After a night of drinking and lamenting the scarcity of good men in her life, Narumi and Hirotaka begin dating. The two seem like the perfect match, but as the title says, love is hard for otaku. With the help of otaku couple and co-workers Hanako Koyanagi (cosplayer and boy love fanatic) and Tarou Kabakura (shoujo fanatic), they begin to work at their new relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the characters and for each couple is infectious and incredibly relatable, the scenarios are realistic, and the characters make every interaction entertaining. The focus is on the relationship itself rather than the journey towards starting a relationship and that is very important here. All characters have their own opinions in regards to their hobbies, decisions and just life in general and it's hilarious when they debate around these topics but at the end of the day they accept and respect each other for it. Their problems are much more grounded, not some free-for-all showdown on who gets senpai first or how couples easily break due to a simple misunderstanding and the like. Watakoi successfully handles realistic moments with larger-than-life interactions, from the romantic beats to the character's passion for their fandoms. Adults will be able to watch this show and laugh knowing that they have been through similar situations, especially if they are otaku as well. Another element it has is the ability to bring up conflicts and resolve them within the same episode which is something similar anime seem to stretch out over several, which can be exhausting and irritating. If Hanako is mad at Tarou for the millionth time, you can bet that Tarou will confront the issue and find a way to resolve it to make her feel better. This makes them feel real and human, they don\u2019t want to draw out conflicts too long.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe that\u2019s why the relationships in this series feel so realistic because they are about real problems faced by nerds and otakus everywhere and by real people in real relationships. Like the time Narumi is invited for a drink over at Hirotaka\u2019s apartment and her first thought was what underwear she\u2019s wearing. It\u2019s a very simple, everyday moment that probably every girl has faced in a new relationship\u2014like when does it become ok to fart in front of your significant other and not die from embarrassment etc. Then there\u2019s the larger theme of how much of yourself you reveal to other people, especially the person you\u2019re in a relationship with. It\u2019s another way this series is so relatable, dissecting the ways in which people present themselves to each other. Watakoi presents these themes in a hilarious way and while the comedy is great, it\u2019s a hit or miss generally speaking, because a lot of it is self-referential and often the main focus\u2014a lot of inside jokes about otaku culture. The characters interactions with each other are very heart-warming, but that alone doesn\u2019t give you quite enough substance if you don\u2019t click with the humour.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures did a good job visually, as to be expected, the accurately adapt the artwork and choose the right colour scheme for the setting of Watakoi, colourful and vibrant but not too over-the-top. The show had that seinen element to it and each character was designed to, not only look uniquely distinctive but to also accurately represent their personalities. Just through their designs alone, you could feel what each and every character was like. The Opening to this series is outstanding! You really get a sense for both the series and its characters. Their likes and dislikes are clearly expressed on screen as well as their relationships to one another. We see Narumi scribbling furiously while creating a doujinshi, Hirotaka playing video games, Hanako cosplaying and Tarou reading yuri manga as the scenes shift back and forth between how they appear at work and they really are being an otaku. It highlights a theme that resonates throughout the series, the balance between professional and personal lives, the person we display to the outside world versus the person we are on the inside. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is standard but it does make every cue hit. The song for opening \u201cFiction\u201d by Sumika, really helps set the tone for the series and was a perfect choice, worthy of being in your playlist. All strong performances with the voice acting, this series is heavy with dialogue and they make everything believable and use their range to make the jokes land more effectively. Every episode feels special and while the show isn\u2019t throwing many curveballs, it executes everything it set out to do perfectly. The references are integrated organically and the relationships don\u2019t feel superficial and that makes every moment feel much more significant. Watakoi\u2019s recipe for success is breathing new life into the genre, a risk that paid off, something that differs from the usual high-school setting while talking and connecting directly to its demographic, making it a much more fun and relatable experience.",

            "content": "Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That's it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010's sparking a big genre called ''School''.\r\nYet Im not talking about the ''School'' genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say ''How in the world does this four havea partner with their attitudes?''. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our ''in-real-life'' adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I'm not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.\\n\\n\r\nEvery anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don't need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material.",

            "content": "What makes a good romcom anime?\r\nCharacters\r\nComedy\r\nNarrative\r\nRelationships\r\nDrama\r\nRomance\r\nTheses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these\u00a0elements\u00a0that I just listed to make theses respective\u00a0shows better but yet only one of them was good though.\r\n3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had\u00a0characters\u00a0would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like aromcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal\u00a0of Otaku culture as well the characterization\u00a0and relationships\u00a0were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully its\u00a0competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.\\n\\n\r\nSo what made this romcom so great you may ask?\\n\\n\r\nYou gonna to find out soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nHello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the story for\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.\u00a0 Unlike\u00a03D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to\u00a0establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear\u00a0Narumi\u00a0inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed.\u00a0Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku's but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there\u2019s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don\u2019t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.\\n\r\nLike with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that's goes along.\\n\r\nThe show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture\u00a0where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it's references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,\u00a0 JoJo etc\\n\r\nThe one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn't take place at high school. Don't get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.\u00a0 I know this doesn\u2019t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.\\n\r\nOur female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she\u2019s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn't tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won't do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.\\n\r\nHirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn\u2019t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he\u2019s not a shamed of it.\\n\r\nThe character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act\u2019s outside of work life.\\n\r\nHanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.\\n\r\nOverall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nFor a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it's nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing\u00a0designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it's not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that\u2019s that.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in\u00a0WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nOverall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.\\n\r\nThe story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.\\n\r\nDespite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of\u00a0Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.\\n\r\nFinal Score 8.5/10",

            "content": "TL;DR It's a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn't recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don't think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don't like Romantic-Comedies.\r\nWotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I'm just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplaymaking people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...\\n\\n\r\nBUT THAT'S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff. \\n\\n\r\nThose who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn't mean they aren't nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending. \\n\\n\r\nIs this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don't think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It's an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows.",

            "content": "Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver. \r\nIt has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you\u2019ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku\u2019s.You get a peek into the lives of otaku\u2019s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nStill don\u2019t believe me this isn\u2019t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it\u2019s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it\u2019s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it\u2019s treated more like a joke. There\u2019s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It\u2019s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple. \\n\\n\r\nI will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It\u2019s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn\u2019t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "A workplace romance comedy about otaku's going into a relationship?..LA's in!\r\nTo be absolutely honest, LA didn't think too much of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii but after watching the anime, heck from the FIRST episode alone, the anime resonated with LA, both in it's romance and comedic elements but especially with it's characters of course.\r\nWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii a character-centric, but to be precise a relationship-centric anime and for it being a rom-com about otaku couples, this is a given. It follows Narumi Momose voiced by Arisa Date who has gotten a new job however she bumps into her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji voicedby Kento Itou and blurts out that she's an otaku to her superiors, the thing is Narumi shifted jobs because of her obsession with anime and manga and being a fujoshi and kept it hidden to her normie boyfriends. Here's another thing, Hirotaka's and Narumi's superiors, well they are otaku's as well, Tarou Kabakura voiced by Di- Tomokazu Sugita, Hirotaka's superior and friend at work who is a huge manga fan, while Hanako Koyanagi voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro is Narumi's and a somewhat famous cosplayer and massive BL fan. Anyways with Narumi depressed that her secret's out, Hirotaka ventured that maybe he could be her boyfriend and support Narumi with her hobby and her in turn as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then and there, LA could already root for Hirotaka and Narumi's relationship with how many things they can relate with one another whilst having very different personalities, whilst Kabakura and Hanako's relationship is the polar opposite, yes they fight ALOT within the anime but them like Hirotaka and Narumi being childhood friends, their fighting subsides and they look at the bigger picture for both themselves as well as Hirotaka and Narumi and because of this, LA rooted for both of their relationships to work out and not many animes have LA rooting for BOTH beta and main couples but Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii did it!\\n\\n\r\nIt's the character chemistry with Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii that just clicks with you and ALSO relatable at that. LA being very much similar to Hirotaka in a ways (but with anime instead of games) and LA's favorite character being Narumi so there was that, but seeing the four main characters just talking, having fun and helping each other with games, Comiket, watching anime, MMORPG's and with their love life out just made each of the core cast very solid, both individually and with their relationships as well, you know that they're friends and their actions bloody shows it and the factor of the entire otaku element is just icing in the cake for LA.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the comedy does have the typical character jabbing at times, but it also goes into anime references ALOT (especially with A1-Pictures previous works) as well as gaming and some of the comedy does involve observational jokes but they have all the great reaction timing and great voice acting that applies towards it that LA laughed ALOT in this anime and you know what LA says about comedies...it's all subjective, but the second one being if it'll make you laugh, it's done it's job.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by A1-Pictures, well LA has to give A1-Pictures props towards it's character designs, being distinguishable and distinct but even for such a minimalistic cast, A1-Pictures did great on the backgrounding work even if it's mainly work, Hirotaka's house and the gaming world but nonetheless, without needing the characters to say it you know what's what...even if the surtitles give it away anyways but semantics. \\n\\n\r\nFor voice acting, well we have mostly veteran voice actors like Celt- Miyuki Sawashiro, Di- Tomokazu Sugita, Ere- Yuki Kaji as Hirotaka's younger brother and Hibi- Aoi Yuuki so typically it would be a great cast, but our two main couple of Hirotaka and Narumi are some fresh new voices, that of Kento Itou and Arisa Date, Kento Itou has been in iDOLM@STER SideM as Michio Hazama, but as Hirotaka he's does a great job in portraying the laid back, stoic gaming otaku even if he's pretty deadpan most of the time but nonetheless. The obvious standout the the best til last...goes to Arisa Date and LA actually knows of Arisa because she was casted in iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls (Huh, Arisa and Kento were both in iDOLM@STER spinoffs before doing this anime...coincidence?) as Emi Namba, the comedienne idol and now Arisa is flexing her chops as Narumi and LA just loved her acting throughout the anime, what's the best way of saying her vocal range was like, like a higher pitched (but controlled) and EVEN MORE HYPER Ayane Sakura and her overreactions were priceless to say the least, maybe some bias towards LA liking Narumi but still LA will MVP to Arisa Date nonetheless for her brilliant reactionary range, she was not only a perfect fit for Emi Namba but Narumi as well, hope she'll get more roles!\\n\\n\r\n*ahem* Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a brilliant down to earth, hilariously funny romcom about otaku's for otaku's like us with a solid cast and characters with some decent production value and a brilliant voice cast. \\n\\n\r\nLove doesn't seem hard for these otaku..LA is jealous.",

Its a real slice of life anime that I enjoyed watching.  It was mellow, realistic, sweet and funny.\r\nArt: The art was decent!

If anything, I wish there were more episodes so we could see the relationships progress more than it did but hey maybe there will be a season 2 or ova!  I highly recommend it to people who want to see a real chill, funny slice of life that is somewhat romantic that doesn't have pointless petty drama that doesn't make sense:)",

            "content": "Once again, I found another reason why A-1 Pictures should focus on making romance comedy anime rather than action anime. One reason is with this anime, A-1 Pictures crews proofed themselves that they excel in writing short plots or building a character within those plots. Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii or Wotakoi, if you don't like to stumble your tongue, is an anime about love story and friendship between otakus in a working environment. The premise itself is very enough to drag me into watching this anime as I am an otaku who will enter the working society very soon.\r\nFrom many romance anime I haveever watched, this anime maybe the closest one to reality as I really know that many people resent otaku for some unknown reason and dating another otaku maybe the only solution if you do not want to stay single. Enter the life of a fujoshi who just switched to a new job after her true nature as a fujoshi discovered by her ex-boyfriend who resent her for being one. She eventually surrounded by other otakus in her new job starting from her childhood friend game otaku, to a cross-dressing cosplayer otaku, and to an Evangelion loving otaku. What makes the story special to me is how we could relate to the situations happen in this anime making this anime so much immersive on its own especially if you are a hardcore otaku.\\n\\n\r\nI love how they depict each of their character as different kinds of otaku stereotypes. It gave us a more real perspective on otaku since nobody love everything. In the real anime community, we have different kinds of opinion and genre we love personally. Not rare that we fought each other just because our opinion over a genre or even over a best girl and I think that makes Wotakoi attached to me. This different spectrum in their characters makes us easier to relate and enjoy the plot even more.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I really love how they slip otaku references here and there. Somehow reference jokes are always making me laugh and Wotakoi really did their job by making a good punchline for each of that reference joke. For you who really loves to pick many easter eggs along your way, this anime is perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah! You definitely should check the opening song. I really love that opening song that being sung by sumika. It is catchy and really sticks to the romance comedy vibe that this anime offers to us.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime really made me attached as I could relate to many things happened in this anime and every instances in this anime felt real and could happen anywhere and anytime in the real time. I would really like to see more of this potential as I hope they roll another season for this anime.",

            "content": "Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii: The King of Rom Com anime has arrived\r\nHonestly, I think the only thing I could criticize about Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is that it had only 11 episodes. What a great series!\r\nIn my first impressions I already said that this series could be the revelation of the season; however, I must say that I was wrong. Why? Because I was too short. This series came to fight the top in the top of best romantic comedy anime.\r\nWhen a series has good characters, is daring to establish the plot, manages to create great and fun scripts from the setting, isable to develop its characters without having a defined core plot, shows the couple's relationship realistically, has a very good soundtrack; and has a direction that manages to blend all of the above in a brilliant way, how will not you fight for the top?\\n\\n\r\nAnd I am leaving out many other points in favor of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii, or Wotakoi as it is known in the community. I could have added that the series has lots of references to other works or products of anime, manga, cinema, theater and even advertisements; or that this anime did not hesitate to start from the get-go with its two main couples already established.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, to further subvert that legendary clich\u00e9 that the leading couple must be established in the epilogue; the setting established that Hanako and Tarou had been dating together for years before the beginning of the series. What happens is that it was overshadowed by the fact that Narumi and Hirotaka started dating right at the end of the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, here it is necessary to point out that all this argument comes from the original material. The manga created by Fujita already has the couples perfectly built, so the great merit of Yoshimasa Hiraike in directing the anime and writing the scripts was to achieve an excellent adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, those who saw this series witnessed a masterful development that included several key aspects: 1) A humor that feels fresh and natural. Gone are those formulas of forced scenes, of sexual jokes for elementary school children, of exploitation of the child from the beginning or of the genre of the false Japanese harem.\\n\\n\r\nAnd many could say that this was because the protagonists were adults; However, in others they also have adult protagonists and yet the creators make them behave worse than a teenager. In fact, in many series (including several), one of the main criticisms is that it seems that the fact that the protagonist is an adult is something nominal because you never see it in his behavior.\\n\\n\r\n2) An exploitation without fear of the fact that the two couples were counted since the go. Within the few series that established the protagonists as a couple from the beginning or in the first exchange, not all the others are done afterwards and that is something that often ends up weighing.\\n\\n\r\nIn some cases, the establishment itself is a liar because the classics are the parameters where a girl who looks promising for the protagonist arrives, but in reality there is nothing between them; in others, it is true that the couple establishes themselves, but then they delay it to show us basic things such as a date, a handshake and a kiss story.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, in Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii they had no qualms about showing us Narumi and Hirotaka, learning to be a couple at a logical and credible rhythm. Gentlemen, this is very important. If already with adolescents it is totally unreal to see them spend tons of episodes so they have the courage to hold hands; with adults that results in an abomination.\\n\\n\r\nIt was wonderful to see both Momose and Nifuji grow as a couple through experiences, thanks to the support of their friends and especially to decisions taken as a result of maturity according to their age.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the couple of Hanako and Tarou presented to the audience a very little-seen dynamic within the anime. Let's do a mental exercise, how many protagonic couples do you remember that for the beginning of the series they have been dating for years? And I do not mean those couples who live apart despite having years together. What's more, how many couples in the anime do you know that they have years together at the beginning of the series?\\n\\n\r\nAt the most, you can tell me the parents of the protagonists or some adult couple over there; however, these couples mostly do not have any relevance except to be plot points at some moment (sometimes, not even that). Therefore, the case of Hanako and Tarou is almost unprecedented not only in romantic comedy but in anime in general.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, that generated a lot of expectation because developing both characters was a challenge; however, after seeing the series it was clear that the execution was simply fantastic. Seeing Koyanagi and Kabakura it was easy to identify them with our own experiences or with those of people in our environment (whether otaku or not)\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the great secret of this series. Its naturalness and realism in developing the plot and the characters generated that the audience could identify fully with everything that happened. Much more, when the otaku world was a main part of the setting.\\n\\n\r\nI do not want to reveal anything of the plot because those who have not seen this series deserve to be able to enjoy it without spoilers; But I will say that each of the situations shown was hilarious, very creative and extremely realistic.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the references seen in the series were all great. First, because of the enormous quantity, but second, and more importantly, because of the creativity in making them. In addition, this posed an additional challenge for the audience because it was very difficult to identify them all.\\n\\n\r\nIs that within the opening itself is a great reference to musically, and that was already a statement of intent. Card Captor Sakura, Castlevania, Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, Evangelion, Mahou Tsukai no Yome, Asahi Super Dry beer, Mario Kart, Donkey Kong Country and Jo Jo, were just some of the works and / or products referenced in the anime. Even the acclaimed Japanese female theater company, Takarazuka Revue, was mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section, the animation was competent with pointed peaks and valleys, the design of characters was attractive within the generic; and the management did a great job adapting the original work.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the soundtrack, it was interesting that they looked for themes that would remind us of video games because that complemented very well with the visual resources used; In addition, the opening \"Fiction\" interpreted by Sumika was a fun theme that brilliantly managed to get us into the environment to enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a great anime that did virtually everything right and whose only palpable flaw was to have only 11 episodes (although despite this it managed to cover almost everything that has been published in the manga). It was amazing how quickly it made its way and hopefully we can have a second season soon. Definitely, \"The King left the building\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii came to show how to make a good romantic comedy anime without having to resort to the already insufferable formulas of the genre. 9.5/10.",

            "content": "Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku is very descriptive, bringing up the romance genre game another notch and problem to fix: romance is hard enough, so being an otaku, involved with love, does it make things complicated? Despite its circumstances, A-1 Pictures is a no brainer when it comes to the romance genre, coming from Your Lie In April a few years back, and consistently having ups and downs, but always to the degree where it's still good to watch and be satisfied with the end product.\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, Wotakoi illustrates the lives of four working-class otaku:\r\nHirotaka Nifuji and NarumiMomose, once schoolmates but their surprising encounter at their workplace immediately raises death flags, but yet continuity ensues that they have a working-class relationship on top of their presence as otaku: Hirotaka always attached to his games (esp Monster Hunter on the Switch as presented) and Narumi into comics (recommended by her next-in-line cosplay colleague and BL lover Koyanagi), and I must say, they pair off as a typical couple, but learning the ways while being otaku.\\n\r\nBoss-cum-colleagues Hanako Koyanaga, whom is a famous cosplay and an absolute BL lover (and couldn't stop fantasizing on Hirotaka and Kabakura) and Kabakura Tarou who doesn't give a shit ton about Koyanagi's whelms, despite the fact that the both of them ARE LEGIT couple-status, realming from their high school days to the working environment.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, it's enjoyable to see romance taken to the next level in terms of creativity and realism, for the fact that love can be subdued, torn down and patched-up. Wotakoi went the opposite route, by making the romance mix in with sliced moments of comedy mixed in with real game techniques (like the text bars and the game-like graphics) that add up to the excitement that is Wotakoi as a whole. The last time we saw this was with Pine Jam's Gamers!, and while that is a total misunderstanding of love against gaming, Wotakoi added the functionality of love, potentially seeing the main characters through and through with the struggle of love and their otaku preferences. Great job.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from A-1 Pictures, the art and animation is lively, detailed across the board, and everything looks and feels great that is a blissful watch to the eye. The manga adaptation itself is incomplete, but what was shown here was well deserving and more than enough to earn praises for it being comedic-focus while engaging at the very same time. It's not as much as Hinamatsuri (in the same season), but it's enjoyable nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST delivered beautifully with one of the best OSTs you could have this season. Especially the OP, \"Fiction\" by Sumika does give the hefty feel of what to come to expect from the show, and it truly did its job. \"Kimi no Tonari\" by Halca for the ED is also the nice roundabout way to end the episodes, and since the EDs always get the backlight, I will go to say that both tracks are excellent on its own, and I'm never disappointed each and everytime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it: Wotakoi, the season's top romance show. The rom-com shows of past glories have been stale for quite some time, and this series brought a heap of fresh air onto the table. Excellent job A-1 Pictures, and worthy of the rom-com recommendation each and everytime.",

            "content": "Wotakoi is probably one of the best rom comedy that I watched. It has a simple plot but is well done. Instead of the typical high school romance setting, this is set in a typical Japan office workplace with otaku adults. It mainly focuses on two couples and what they do after work. The main couple is Narumi, a closet otaku and then Hirotaka, a big gamer who doesn't really try to hide that fact. The other couple is Koyanagi and Kabakura, and they are sport otaku who tend to argue a lot. I love the scenes where they game, go out to drink, andjust share their bond for anime/manga. This makes it more relatable for me at least. The show touches up on the struggles in their relationships but has a lot of cute moments as well as the characters try to change and improve their relationship. There's not much drama and the comedy blends in really nice! It's so cute too and I love the game references. (ex. mario kart!!) There's nothing unique about the show, but the fact that it's so relatable makes it so much fun to watch. Who doesn't play games after work or watch anime?! \\n\\n\r\nOP and ED are very good and I can't stop listening to the ED. This show was probably my favorite this season excluding the long shonen anime.",

            "content": "Wotakoi exudes the refreshing confidence of a story that deals with working adults rather than high schoolers.  When dealing with amatory matters, Wotakoi is a damn sight more graceful and insightful than anime treatments of romance tend to be, the result of following characters with greater maturity, perspective, and experience than the standard oblivious teenagers.  Nonetheless, while it establishes its central relationships with frank efficiency, the show doesn\u2019t always convey the depth and warmth in those relationships that would make the statement in the title resonate.  Love is hard for Love is Hard for Otaku.\r\nWith the youngest of the four protagonistsbeing Narumi and Hirotaka at 26, Wotakoi\u2019s quartet is comfortably lodged in adulthood already.  These characters are settled into their hobbies and are well-invested in them; Koyanagi has an established reputation as a cosplayer, and Narumi enjoys some success as a doujinshi creator.  They have inveterate tastes that they exhibit with the ease of people who have been otaku for the better part of two decades instead of just a couple of years, with Narumi functioning as the fujoshi, Hirotaka the gamer, Koyanagi the cosplayer, and Kabakura the guy who is deluded into thinking that he is comparatively normal but still loves Yuru Yuri at the age of 28.  They all have regular office jobs (the same one, apparently) and can financially support themselves and their extracurricular activities.  The lack of classrooms and uniforms and homework is, if only replaced by offices and business attire and overtime, a breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nKoyanagi has a self-possessed coolness that frequently rings hollow in younger characters, Kabakura\u2019s seniority grants him some measure of actual authority, and Narumi\u2019s infectious fangirl passions can drive her into 18+ territory without, as we might find in high school anime, vague suspicions that this might be inappropriate content for the characters.  Even Hirotaka, a familiarly nondescript and inexpressive character, comes off as a purposeful recluse who does take note of himself and his environment to a greater degree than we might think, whereas a traditional high school context might have made him more of a caricature.  No one is safe from miscommunication, self-deception, oblivious behavior, and petty disputes, but Wotakoi\u2019s characters can handle themselves and their issues more adroitly than the usual cast of inexperienced adolescents.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the \u201cadult\u201d side of its characters, Wotakoi grasps the \u201cotaku\u201d side with understanding and aplomb usually absent from attempts to capture the quirks and feelings of a particular subculture in media (even if it\u2019s that medium\u2019s own subculture, there\u2019s no guarantee of success).  The games that Narumi has to play to sniff out fellow otaku at work, Kabakura\u2019s stubbornness in maintaining his preferential integrity, Hirotaka\u2019s uncharacteristically playful text-speak with Narumi, the jarring gravity well of encountering a regular person after too much time in the esoteric hobbyist sun, and the freeing therapy of having friends around whom you can express your true self are all true-to-life by my reckoning, and the numerous scenarios pulled from everyday life as a nerd, as well as references to properties like Evangelion and Cardcaptor Sakura, demonstrate some firsthand knowledge and love on the part of the creator(s).  With each of the four leads representing a different subsubculture, as mentioned above, Wotakoi has plenty of opportunities to explore the habits and proclivities of its audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Wotakoi falters is in its amorous aspects.  It\u2019s true that Hirotaka and Narumi have excellent chemistry: they open up to each other right away and from then on become an inseparable and complementary duo.  Likewise, though Koyanagi and Kabakura launch into shouting matches at the drop of a hat, their underlying affection never evaporates.  What we don\u2019t see are the big questions, the real fights, and the serious romance, which are only hinted at or glossed over in the show and need some presence if Wotakoi wants to distinguish itself as \u201cLove is Hard for Otaku\u201d instead of \u201cFriendship is Easy for Otaku.\u201d  The title of episode two asks, \u201cAre We Now Dating?\u201d, and that\u2019s a question whose circumspect response only approaches closure at the end of the series.  In a pair of pairings that seem to have formed out of convenience \u2013 convenience for the characters, not for the story, which is a good thing \u2013 questions arise regarding the exact nature and future of these relationships.  \\n\\n\r\nLove really IS hard for otaku: in the case of Koyanagi and Kabakura, each party has made compromises to maintain a relationship with someone who can put up with their hobbies, and in the case of Narumi and Hirotaka, the two seem to hang out because they support each other\u2019s pursuits and can facilitate the other\u2019s professional success, as if it were an expedient business practice (Hirotaka\u2019s first-episode \u201cconfession\u201d was certainly more of a business proposal than anything else).  Being part of such an active, obsessive subculture can make relating to outsiders difficult, or at least tiresome, so it\u2019s not unrealistic that people would gravitate towards each other based on these superficial similarities.  Those connections make for great friendships, though not necessarily lasting relationships.  I wish that the characters displayed a bit more interest in each other as partners rather than pals.  \\n\\n\r\nKoyanagi and Kabakura, a veteran couple whom we know have been dating for about a decade now, don\u2019t have much problem being affectionate with each other, relatively speaking; we see Koyanagi stealing kisses, Kabakura making clumsy but well-meaning gestures, and the two of them spending a lot of time together in the quiet manner attributable to couples who feel at home simply doing nothing in the same place.  They\u2019re clearly comfortable enough to trade vitriol when they\u2019ve wheedled or casually insulted each other too much (with Koyanagi cutely shouting \u201cBAKAKURA!\u201d), and they know where to hit to make it hurt and how to placate the other side when it\u2019s all over.  But the show passes up many opportunities to look beyond the surface level and explore what makes this a fundamentally stable, loving partnership. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode 4, a distraught Koyanagi tearfully demands to know if Kabakura has \u201csettled\u201d for her; knowing that she isn't his \u201ctype,\u201d she harbors doubts about whether their relationship has any firm foundation.  Showing her in such an uncharacteristically vulnerable state, Wotakoi proves itself willing to ditch its often contented perspective to dig into some problems unique to the premise.  Yet as Koyanagi breaks down, venting these insecurities that have apparently plagued her for a long time, Kabakura keeps his lips sealed.  He gently chastises her for causing a scene, essentially dismissing her frustrations as drunk talk \u2013 not that he\u2019s mean to her, because he is clearly sympathetic, but he totally whiffs on demonstrating his love for his long-term girlfriend.  We don\u2019t get the heart-to-heart where they express how they actually FEEL about each other.  We don\u2019t see them acknowledge that they\u2019re together because of mutual love, not just mutual pastimes.  Maybe the two of them have been through this before, but the audience hasn\u2019t.  To let Koyanagi\u2019s entreaties go unanswered is to leave us wondering if she has stumbled upon an unfortunate truth that sours the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNarumi and Hirotaka have a different sort of relationship: one that leans toward platonic companionship.  We almost never see the two of them in any kind of romantic context; they\u2019re always joined by Koyanagi and Kabakura, or they\u2019re playing video games like they did as kids, or they\u2019re sabotaging through their own awkwardness the rare personal moments they do find.  The shared interest in otaku culture, even broadly, is a big part of their chemistry \u2013 Narumi and Hirotaka can be themselves while they\u2019re around each other, they understand each other\u2019s peculiarities, and they can support each other\u2019s dungeon crawling and Comiket preparations \u2013 and these things are very important, but where does the \u201clove\u201d in \u201cLove is Hard for Otaku\u201d come in?  Narumi might get jealous of Hirotaka\u2019s popularity or flustered by his occasional forwardness, but such scenes feel like obligatory reactions, not reflective of Narumi personally; she did walk into this relationship unexpectedly, it\u2019s true, so this might be a lot to ask, but I had hoped that an anime about adults would be a little less anime about everything.\\n\\n\r\nHirotaka has been crushing on Narumi for years, as a few melancholy flashbacks establish, so his feelings are reasonably clear.  Narumi has a few affectionately shaded moments, but little to suggest that she returns Hirotaka\u2019s feelings.  It feels like the two of them are masquerading as boyfriend and girlfriend because they each need someone to fill that role and they get along well, rather than because they\u2019ve found legitimate life partners in each other.  Sure, that\u2019s how some relationships are in real life, and that\u2019s really how the first episode presents it, and it\u2019s not as though a close friendship itself is insignificant \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to watch a romantic comedy about people who will hang out for a while because they\u2019re good company and go their separate ways once the fun has been had.  I want to see Hirotaka de-unrequite his love.  Narumi has found someone who accepts her for who she truly is, and now I want to see something greater come from that.  If we\u2019re meant to believe that, however hard it may be, love \u2013 not brotherhood \u2013 between otaku is ultimately sustainable, I want to see evidence of a future in this relationship.  I want to hear one character say the words \u201cI love you\u201d to another.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too much to ask.  Hirotaka is 26 and he can\u2019t hold his girlfriend\u2019s hand.  Maybe this is set in high school after all.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Wotakoi does throw us a bone now and then.  The characters go on dates, they buy each other gifts, they spend quality time together, they acknowledge each other as girlfriend and boyfriend...  I wish that things could be clearer and more satisfying, but as I opened this review by saying, this show still has a serious leg up on most of its competition.  Overall, I\u2019m thrilled with the easy companionship these characters have with each other and the fun that they share.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Wotakoi has middling production values: generally good, with nothing that stands out as being egregiously under-animated; the episodes vary in quality and some scenes are just a little off-model or bare-bones.  Nothing matches the OP in terms of quality, though it is an unusually great OP, with some very fluid (and infectiously adorable) dance routines from the starring couples set to a cool, catchy, relaxing tune that matches the tone of the show.  The color scheme of pink, blue, green, and orange is a little weird at first, but it works well for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn a cast that includes Miyuki Sawashiro, Tomokazu Sugita, and Yuuki Kaji, it\u2019s Arisa Date who steals the spotlight as Narumi.  Her eccentric, spirited delivery spans all the rapid tonal shifts and quirky affectations that would be characteristic of an energetic girl like Narumi, especially when gushing about her passions to her close friends.  Taking a very close second is Aoi Yuuki, whose clipped, husky reading of Kou\u2019s lines makes for the most painfully accurate expression of social anxiety I\u2019ve seen this side of WataMote.  Kou is hands-down my favorite character and it is a true shame that she only gets introduced in the second-to-last episode.  I am ready for my three-cour spin-off anime about Kou\u2019s daily life.  I want to see a Kou-On! that\u2019s just about Kou sitting around, playing video games, and drinking tea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Wotakoi is a great series, and in spite of a few unengaging story lines, some potential for better production, and how long I\u2019ve spent bemoaning what I perceive to be its shortcomings, it offers an all-too-rare alternative to the billions of cookie-cutter high school romance anime that for all intents and purposes characterize the medium of anime in its present form better than almost anything else.\\n",

This story is based upon Otaku gaining love, and holds true to the end of the story. That is the whole purpose of this story, and the characters achieve that through finding other Otaku to interact with, in this case being in the workplace. The characters kind of stumble upon each other and through a series of bold moves interact with each other for what would be described as an incredible experience.\r\nI guess life ismore fun when we gather the courage to do something crazy, eh?\\n\\n\r\nFour main characters are the bases of character development with a fifth/sixth joining temporarily along the way. Each character is given a distinct personality and have many flaws because of it. This is exciting, as we are all humans, and as well it's great to see the strengths of our characters in situations such as pissing off another character and then trying to make it up to them. Totally normal situation, ya? \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this whole anime is full of normal experiences and it's hilarious to see them back in action. We ourselves have probably been in many of these awkward situations or would like to be... how do I feel? How do they feel? What should we do next? Alright. Here I go! (being in the mindset of a guy interacting with a girl). \\n\\n\r\nAlright, ratings time:\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8 - In terms of a slice of life, this anime does a good job of building up the experience for the viewer and the main characters along the way. There is story progression.\\n\r\nGraphics - 9 - Very modern and well done. There are even times when they incorporate an additional graphics engine to render games that they play within the anime itself. Super cool.\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 8 - Nice to listen to. Fits the mood well.\\n\r\nCharacters personas - 8 - I felt that the characters expressed themselves very well and showed fault and strengths, and were consistent with their nature.\\n\r\nVoice acting - 10 - Absolutely awesome Japanese voice acting. Really spot on and my favorite thing about this anime, if that can be said for voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8 - Lovely experience, that.\\n\r\nRecommended - Yes, for all Otaku out there looking for love, or for ones with girlfriends now or more (you make me proud), and the two of you need something to watch together.",

Their relationships to one another are astounding in the way they are written, but each of the central cast is one-dimensional on their own.Case-in-point, there was a pre-opening-credits scene with the male-lead, exploring his morning. He got up. He played his game. He went to work. That was it. No, seriously, that was it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime about adults (not high schoolers), about game-otaku, and about a relationship with complexity, might I recommend 'Recovery of an MMO Junkie / Net-juu no Susume'... despite the controversy surrounding the director of that anime, it is far more worthy of your time.",

I'm assuming they're made up for the sake of theshow. But I did actually see a bunch of Yuri novels that looked real and good. I'd actually want to read them if they were real.\\n\\n\r\nI do like how the younger brother is hinted at getting a girlfriend in the future.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think the romance between the Younger brother and the girl would be nice.

            "content": "I'm wondering what's happening with slice of life shows lately.\r\nIt's as if anime producers had a secret consensus, and on it they decided they'll sneak in non-existent plot into shows, and focus on making money with as little effort as possible. News flash: just because a show has slice of life genre in it, it doesn't allow it to be boring to the point of being a comatose-inducing drug.\r\nI can give you endless examples of other shows being super interesting regardless of main theme simply tracking a character or characters' lives or other barely existing plot examples. Wotakoi went off rails with plot less thanmid-way through, and decided to show filler episodes instead.\\n\r\nNow, I haven't read the manga and perhaps it's different in it, but it doesn't excuse the poor, or rather, complete lack of pacing and direction, resulting in my lack of engagement.\\n\\n\r\nSlightly annoying factor is that the shows such as this one somehow get passed by average person's critique and are now considered quality shows, when they are not. I get that by making the setting as least complicated as possible, you know, just a regular present day, no supernatural circumstances, or no deep psychological battle mysteries like known to all Death Note, no melodrama or different harem routes, none of that shit, it's guaranteed to avoid pretty much any illogical executions, events, inconsistencies or plot holes, like many action series suffer from for example, but there's no excuse for having a lack of guidance altogether and just call it quits.\\n\\n\r\nAtmosphere is great, characters are sympathetic, it's bundled in nice, shiny wrappings, the overall presentation is great, yet it ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion, it's too tedious and lacks life. I'm sorry but this will not go unnoticed by some people, myself included.\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate this show by a long shot, but I don't know how and/or why does it always leave a bad taste in my mouth.",

            "content": "Wotaku no Koi wa Muzukashii is a rom-com anime that all otakus can relate to. It is an anime adaptation of a manga of the same name. This review contains as little spoilers as it can,\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nWotaku dosen't really have a deep story line (just ike every other rom-com) however it handles the theme really well. The story is properly paced and very much relatable to any adult otaku who tries his best to fit in with the society and his struggle to find other otakus who share the same tastes as him. The story however dosen't dig deep into the romance as much asit should. Questions are raised on why otakus tend to date other otakus and I would like more such questions to be raised. \\n\r\nThe story has followed the manga without deviating till now.\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nWotaku dosen't have any better art than the story needs. The art is pretty neat but could be better. Considering the art budget of a not very demanding series such as this, the art gets a 7.\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music used in this series is mild just like it should be. The OST is good but would have played out better if it was a bit more catchy.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nWhat I love about Wotaku are its characters. In a series such as this one, characters probably play the most important role. The manga has done a pretty good job on the characters which has been properly followed in the anime. The development of characters is a bit shallow but you can't really complain much about that in a comedy oriented rom-com.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can't guarantee anyone reading this review the same 10/10 in this category. I have given a solid 10 here just because of the season in which it aired. In a season that contains some of the most anticipated series, Wotaku serves as relief from all the other heated story lines. Though there are two other series of the same caliber: Hinamatsuri and Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai, in my opinion Wotaku does it best. The series has me waiting for an episode every week.\\n\r\nWotaku is certainly the best rom-com this season and probably one my all time favourites. I rate this anime 8 out of 10 overall.\\n\r\nNote:This is my first detailed review on MAL. Suggestions are welcome!",

            "content": "I'll preface this by saying that I have not read any of the manga for this series. \r\nYou don't necessarily expect much to happen in a slice of life type show, but with Wotakoi, there is very little payoff. It all ends up feeling incredibly flat; each episode follows its own structure and there isn\u2019t much of an overarching story being built. Everything is just enjoyable enough to keep you strung along hoping that something will eventually happen. And, it\u2019s not to say that the characters don\u2019t sometimes have their moments. There are cute interactions or jokes that land here and there, but the frequencyisn\u2019t high enough to warrant a higher rating than a 5/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is absolutely subdued here, and it doesn't really feel like much of a focus at all most of the time. Essentially, it just feels as though the show doesn't really know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a slice of life about 4 otaku nerds working in the same office? Or does the series want to try to explore a clumsy nerdy romance between two childhood friends? The show never seems to extend very far beyond: \u201cThese MCs are nerds! Wow aren\u2019t they awkward and relatable? They\u2019re so interested in vidya, manga and anime, perhaps like you, the viewer?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, where this particular anime struggles is the character development. The characters are likable, but don't expect them to change much at all from the first episode to the last. Other romance anime do a better job of developing the relationship between the primary protagonists. However, this show really likes to emphasize that otaku lack social skills, which accomplishes about as much as you might think. This show truly is a slice of life at its core, and going in expecting more than that may leave you disappointed. \\n\r\nA personal gripe for me was that a side character, Kou, is introduced far too late into the series. I really would have loved to see more of her, but there simply wasn\u2019t enough time in an 11 episode timeframe. It was cute, and a romance could have easily bloomed there.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a very average anime, propped up by largely forgettable, bland characters. But hey, the characters are nice to look at, and most of the voice acting is well done. At least it\u2019s cute! \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n",

It really comes down to the intentions of the original work, whether it was supposed to be a more slice-of-life style or a romantic story type. From the theme of the opening though, I think they wanted to lean towards the story side, but it feltlike it didn't deliver. That's fine with me, but others might find it off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very fluid and nice, and the songs were quite catchy. Well, I guess this as expected of Aniplex. it was very well done. The characters designs were anything but special. There was the typical shojou anime style with the stereotypical narrow eyed tall cool guy and the large round-eyed, girlish and cutesy heroine, but it depends on how significant you find that to be in your viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fundamentally uninteresting because of how stereotypical this genre is, but the 'otaku gamer/watcher' stuff does somewhat keep the character dynamic afloat. It's a shame that nothing significant really happens throughout the anime, but if you're watching just to sit back and have a couple laughs, it should suffice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was enjoyable for what it's worth. I wasn't too concerned about the story in the first place and animation was stellar. The anime was decently funny and didn't try to get too serious.",

            "content": "One of the charming things about this comedic \"Slice of Life\" is that it appeals to a different generation by way of the age of the characters. Many popular shows feature 12~17 years old's (who are impossibly mature) to drive the plot; which is not inherently bad or surprising considering the consumer base for this and similar mediums of entertainment. The main characters here however are all late 20's and \"struggling\" with the fact that they don't really want to entirely grow up. Investing a lot of their time and money pursuing otherwise \"childish\" interests such as buying and playing computer games, reading/watching cartoons (manga/anime),\"dressing up\" (cosplay) and collecting dolls (figurines). This is the part that is relatable, being of similar age and also having similar interests/hobbies.\\n\\n\r\nI say \"struggling\" with quotations because their struggles aren't exactly complex or even necessarily that hard. They all work sufficiently paid jobs that afford them to live relatively normal and adequate lives and you couldn't honestly call them anything close to dysfunctional, the struggle is more about their social standing than anything else on account of the negative opinion of \"Otaku's\" in society at large. That being said, the relative tameness of their Otaku quirks/eccentricities does make them more broadly relatable. It would probably be more entertaining and deep in the long run to deal with less functional characters, but the wholesome-ness of the show is still rather pleasant and it wouldn't be fair to judge a show and it's end goal by something it may never have set out to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a slight culture difference here where these struggles don't entirely translate to the West where there's not as much focus on work ethic (relatively speaking that is, i don't want to imply people in the West don't work hard; but Japan has a word specifically for people who work themselves to death (\"Karoshi\")) and a much more liberal stance on sociological elements thanks to the evolution and spread of sub cultures that afford people today more freedom in their interests without as much judgement. So some impact might be lost on a non-Asian audience.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part though the show is just a general pleasure to watch with amusing and relatable gags based around how nerdy they are and at the age they are. The only things that are really feel out of place is how conveniently everything typically works out. There's no real sense of friction or resistance, with almost every challenge resolving almost as fast as it appears; that and the male protagonist is something of a Mary Sue. Being highly reliable, highly competent (despite how little effort he is shown putting in) and extremely attractive; with multiple scenes both inside the office work space and out in public of groups of girls swooning over him (much to the ignorance of the female lead). In a show that is largely exploiting Otaku stereotypes this is one they seem to have taken liberty with.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, with several amusing meta references to shows like JoJo's B.A. and Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji (along with some other name drops). The characters are so-so (but do feature some really good voice acting), being quite average, yet charmingly so in some ways. The show really becomes better than the sum of its otherwise remarkably average parts; but i should say that there is definitely some subjective bias involved in that conclusion.",

Once you get around the fact that you were slightly misled it's a very enjoyable anime. The characters are spot on as realistic yet likeable people doing things which I would expect them to do (more or less, it is stillan anime!).

Close to no character / romance development though.\r\n_______________\r\nWhile it was pretty entertaining to watch and very well done, I can still \"only\" give this anime a 8/10 score.\r\nThat's for 2 reasons; \r\n- The characters basically don't develop at all. And neither does their romance. They get together in the first episode and it stays as that throughout the whole show. There are some romantic scenes between them, but overall they still act like two otaku-friends rather than a couple. It would've been great to at least see them grow closer over time. I would've expected morecharacter / romance development over time. I would even go that far that you could arbitrarily shuffle the episodes and you wouldn't notice a difference (apart from those introducing new characters of course).\\n\r\n- The show doesn't have a real ending. I didn't know how many episodes it has while I watched it, so after watching the last episode I was pretty baffled.. \"wait.. that's it?\" No development in either of both couples, and the relationship between Nao and that otaku tomboy was left pretty much as is too. After all, the final episode could've just been an episode like any other.\\n\\n\r\nEven with those two huge flaws I still decided to rate it 8, as I can't deny that I enjoyed watching it a lot. It covers a lot of otaku stuff, as each character is an otaku in their way.",

All the characters are pretty good, would husbando Hirotaka.

Every episode has its own short story, and honestly, you could skip around episodes and still be fine. Thus, the story and art for this anime didn't need to be exceptional, but it's still good.\r\nHowever, \"Wotakoi\" was definitely enjoyable, and perhaps the reason I personally found it so enjoyable was that I immediately fell in love with the4 main characters. They are funny to watch as they go on with their days. They are all unique in their own ways, despite their similarities. Others may not like them at first, but they are bound to like at least one character by the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend \"Wotakoi\" to anyone who is looking for a short rom-com/sitcom.

This review will show my personal opinion of the anime.\r\nFirst of all the Story: (8/10), if you're reading this review you'll definitely relate to the anime because it's about each and everyone of us (anime lovers) the story begins with the girl Narumi who's hiding the fact that she's an otaku and when her workmates found out about it she had to quit and find another job where she finds her childhood friend who's also an otaku which means (They're perfect for each other) but love is hard for otaku this anime explains it well andshow us a literal life experience of it, its really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10), I can't really say much about Art style because it is A1-Pictures after all xD amazing art style as usual. Pretty and visually amusing\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10), I'm not quite sure about the sound it's obviously great but I noticed that the voice acting is a little bit cheesy but still pretty amazing and it shows us the characters personality the loudness and the weirdness in the voices are pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10), The most important factor when it comes to characters is the development through the show, now when it comes to me I always focus on these things it was pretty fair, to be honest. Narumi and Hirotaka (The main characters) had their spot in the anime obviously, however even the supporting characters had their chance to shine in the show which made me pretty happy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10), the anime was pure comedy and romance I'm pretty sure that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8/10), I had a great time watching it listening to one of the cutest anime openings ever and enjoying every second + I finished it in one sitting xD it is that GOOD.",

Its a cozy romantic comedy in everyday life. I recommend it if you want to enjoy something easy and slow while being very fun to watch. \r\n- The relationships here feels real, and there is development. You will adore the characters and enjoy things with them. Specially if you either enjoy games, manga and anime ofc :D. \r\n- I think the voice actinghere was wonderful, it was endearing and matched with their characters. \\n\\n\r\n- The animation was very nice and high quality.\\n\\n\r\n- Likewise, the voice and the characters , I adore them both. If you want to know why, go and check it out :D\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did not like:\\n\\n\r\n- There was nothing I did not like, except for how short the series is. I know its because the anime has caught up with the manga, which is a pity I rather call it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI usually rate a series overall on how much I enjoyed it. Sometimes it might not have a wonderful story or life lessons etc, but I might still enjoy the prosess. Whats important is how much it got me engaged and the enjoyment. Wotakoi was a fresh story for me, where it did nowhere touch something typical and cliche, thumps up for that. It was funny, cute and enjoyable. It might not have a drama where it keeps you wanting answers. But it is able to keep you wanting more, you get that feeling of \" just one more ep\".",

Because well, we can say that one adult know much more than other adult. I'm sorry if what I'm saying is not clear. \r\nWhat I want to declare here is, maybe some of you feel it too maybe some not, but what i feel towards theme like this, its always has a different view than common anime. Well, maybe I'm too exaggerating, but for me, it is always anime like this that makesme confuse when will I watching it. Anime like this is like gambling, sometimes it is really good, and sometimes not really that good.\\n\r\nIn this case wotaku has give me a really really good enjoyment from such theme. Because in this anime, the writer not only gives the enjoyment, and the feeling, towards the character of the story, but to us too, the watcher. \\n\r\nWhat can beat such a relatable moment when watching anime that maybe we know about, we like about, and we favorite about?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a really balance story progression, character development, and good romance which makes us wanna cuddle with our partner. The story is told with no rush, but with slow progression that makes the show feels has a fast paced story, but it is not. The character is told balancely alongside the story which makes the show even awesome. And the reference that makes us the watcher feels so relatable with the character of the story is what makes this anime even outstanding.\\n\r\nBut even every good story has a flaw. And the flaw in this anime is, it has an ending.",

            "content": "Romance generally boils down to one of two things: A shoujo or a shonen romance.\u00a0 The two differ in both style and content with the latter of which being more varied in the sorts of topics (as well as being more perverted) than its twin sister.\u00a0 But despite this, very few shows actually manage to pull off the 'relationship' part of a romance, a key aspect that these genres brush to the side in favor for an idealized relationship.\u00a0 And that's precisely where Wotaku shines.\r\nStory:\r\nAs a new employee, Momose Narumi finds herself getting a fresh start at a different company far away from the previousplace that she was at.\u00a0 Unbeknownst to her, an old classmate of hers, Hirotaka Nifuji, works at the same company and the two rekindle their friendship.\u00a0 But on one night of drinking, Momose reveals why she switched workplaces in the first place, leading Nifuji to ask her if she would be willing to date him.\u00a0 A bit rocky, but hey, he's getting his feet wet.\\n\\n\r\nMixing the lifestyle of an otaku by surrounding the characters in their interests and going to large events with the ins and outs of a budding relationship, Wotaku is an interesting example of how to do a romance relationship right.\u00a0 None of the characters are portrayed as perfect beings as everyone comedically bickers with one another about various otaku-related topics, as well as poke at each other's shortcomings (most often their respective partners), making it so that even the slightest thing can potentially set something off and have the next five minutes be about a debate about which guy should be on top of the other.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, the show consistently has something to keep the audience engaged, as the very tiny cast of characters get all of the available screentime and utilize that to their advantage by slowly polishing their characteristics and personalities that has them feel more like people than characters.\u00a0 But the biggest reason why Wotaku deserves all of the praise it gets is because it portrays romance right.\\n\\n\r\nRelationships are messy, and hardly any if any are perfect.\u00a0 We see this here as every episode puts its main couple to the test on what it means to really be in a relationship.\u00a0 Things are awkward, usually someone has to put their foot forward first, and compromises have to be made.\u00a0 For a comedic show that's based around four adults who drown themselves in anime, manga, and various games, it's surreal to think that out of every romance I've seen, this is the one that portrays the 'in a relationship' status the best.\u00a0 With each episode, you see a gradual change with Momose and Hirotaka growing closer together, which is supplemented with the other main couple in the series having their own saga of a long-standing relationship and its problems/compromises that've had to be made.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having a cutesy and typically comedic exterior, Wotaku has a surprising amount of subtext behind its otaku-ridden exterior that makes it such a worthwhile romance to watch.\u00a0 I will say that the ending really could've been put together more thoroughly cause it feels like A-1 just sorta said \"We're done.\u00a0 It's ending here.\" cause nothing really feels complete as the show just sorta...ends.\u00a0 However the journey to said ending was very well-made and certainly one of the show's high points.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Very real portrayal of a relationship\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Comedy mixed well with more serious aspects\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Show just kinda...ends.\u00a0 Like a ball being dropped.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere're only six total characters.\u00a0 But in a way, you could argue that there's really only four that matter a whole lot, as they make up the show's two main couples and as such, let the show laser focus on the relationships that they spend the entire runtime building up and portraying.\\n\\n\r\nFor Narumi Momose and her partner, Hirotaka Nifuji, we're treated to a budding relationship between two people who...don't really hit it off that well at first.\u00a0 Which is honestly a first for me, as rather than a clear attraction between two individuals, it's just two people who decide they'd be an ok fit for each other and see how things go.\u00a0 Momose is a (for the most part), comedically bipolar character who can turn her voice and emotion at the drop of a hat, and Hirotaka is the game addict who stays calm no matter the situation.\u00a0 What we're privy to is two people who slowly fill in the roles of boyfriend and girlfriend while not really seeming like that in any stage in the show.\u00a0 It's this strange mix that gives the characters their identity, an unpredictable phenomenon that's enjoyable to watch because the developments aren't so clear cut from the start.\\n\\n\r\nKoyanagi and Kabakura, the two other 'main' characters that make up the other couple act more as the 'experienced' duo, being in a steady relationship for years that seems to be rocky at times.\u00a0 The two have dividing interests, as for example, one's a fan of yuri while the other is a yaoi fan (I'll leave you to guess who is who), and the two constantly fight and bicker over small things.\u00a0 Personally I like this relationship more than the main couple as comparatively, these two are more interesting cause the potential to tell a story with two individuals that're in such an on and off relationship from wanting to spend time together to never wanting to do anything with the other in a matter of minutes is an interesting story plot that you often never see without it becoming overbearing or annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Small cast with a lot of time devoted to them\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Secondary couple by comparison is more interesting\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by A-1...yeah, you know what they're capable of.\u00a0 Bearing bright colors that really stand out, Wotaku is a consistent piece that on an episode by episode basis, rarely disappoints.\u00a0 As well as using a variety of comedic faces to transition characters' expressions from normal to exaggeration at an instant, there's actually not much to say about the art cause it's not TOO standout, but still looks good enough to be pleasing to the eye without really doing anything to be anything beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSumika's 'Fiction' is a cheerful, upbeat song that screams 'catchy'.\u00a0 It doesn't really have any unique properties about it, yet somehow it's gripping enough to be one of those OP tracks that you really don't want to skip over.\u00a0 Haica's 'Kimi no Tonari' has this similar attribute too, as it's a poppy song that really shouldn't have any standout qualities, yet has this air about it that makes it worth listening to.\u00a0 I can't really put my finger on it, but for all intents and purposes, a 'It's good and worth listening to' should suffice.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWotaku interested me upon reading its synopsis and for sure was a show that didn't disappoint.\u00a0 It actually gave me more than I had originally thought was possible for the show since it touched upon a lot of things in a relationship that never actually get the time of day in a typical romance.\u00a0 Namely, what happens AFTER the confession.\\n\\n\r\nSure we don't really get a confession in the first place, but the fact that the show spent pretty much all of its runtime on exploring the couples' relationships and the rockiness and baggage that comes with one already gives it an attribute that very few shows can claim to have.\u00a0 Because of this, I really enjoyed the show, and the otaku-based comedy that came along with it because it felt fresh and no joke was really reused so everything felt like new material.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romance show that's more about the actual relationship than the crush and confession (which let's be honest, we're all kinda more or less tired of seeing by this point), Wotaku is the show that fits the bill.\u00a0 It's a surprising contender that showed up in the Spring 2018 season that proved to be more than first meets the eye, and definitely a show that's worth the watch.",

            "content": "Last season it was net juu susume and this season its wotakoi. This feels amazing. When the main characters of a slice of life anime are adults, it would definitely be a good watch. Wotakoi does not disappoint. It is the best. We as anime watchers or gamer or cos-players or as manga readers are thrilled when there is an anime that focuses on our plight as who we are and what we like. Wotakoi is about two otaku couples who are slowly easing into a relationship where they have common grounds. It makes us wonder what it is like when two ppl strike upa conversation that both of them are comfortable with especially when the topic is familiar to us. \\n\r\nThe character line up is fantastic. There are narumi and Hanako who are both fujoishi and they battle out ships the way way we yaoi fans do. The there are kabakura and hirotaka, the cute redhead who loves his manga and anime as much as the megane who cant stay away from his gaming console. There is also the extremely adorable naoya and his potential tomboy partner. \\n\r\nEvery episode is blush worthy. I love the kabakura-hinako couple more than hirotaka-narumi. The former is steadier with a long history while the latter is fumbling with their relationship goals. It is frustrating that hirotaka-narumi pair takes forever to make a move and we still dont see them kiss. That one time between kabakura and hinako is all we get.  Nevertheless its is adorable whether its narumi cooking for hirotaka or they going on a date and ending up taking about otaku stuff or even the constant banter of hinako and kabakura. I cant get enough of the 11 episodes. \\n\r\nMost importanytly it is great to crush on cute but grownup guys.",

            "content": "When I picked up Wotakoi this season, I didn't expect much. It appeared to be just another rom-com to add to the old \"completed\" list. To my surprise, however, Wotakoi ended up flooring me for one, extremely simple reason: it made me laugh. I'm not talking about the amused exhale out of the nose that many forms of comedic entertainment usually elicit, but laugh out loud kind of amusement. In and of itself, that's an impressive feat. Wotakoi joins the company of shows like Konosuba and Inferno Cop, to name a couple, that have really made me laugh like that.\r\nNow, you'd have to look fairlyhard to find something that Wotakoi does specially or differently from other rom-coms, besides just doing it better than most. The main place Wotakoi excels is in its lack of dependence on relationship drama. Not once does it hang on the tried and true romantic tension for longer than a single episode, which is extremely refreshing for a genre that seems to be synonymous with drama fueled by miscommunication, jealousy, etc. That isn't to say that Wotakoi never uses such tactics, but the fact that it doesn't use them as crutches makes Wotakoi a cut above the rest.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other positives to Wotakoi, of course, like its fantastically groovy opening, its small cast of lovable characters, each with very distinctive personalities and tastes, and, strangely enough, its hand animation. I'm not joking, Wotakoi's hand animation may be the best I've ever seen in any form of animation. Just watch the opening and pay attention to the character's hands. It's mindbogglingly good.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Wotakoi isn't exactly the perfect anime. I mean, it's only 11 episodes. Who decided that was a good idea? More seriously, if you don't understand the references that Wotakoi makes, you may have a hard time appreciating some of the humor involved, which can detract from Wotakoi's accessibility.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, there aren't many negatives to speak of regarding Wotakoi. It just won't be for everyone. Not everyone wants to watch a romantic comedy with far more comedy and slice of life than actual romance. And that's okay. Wotakoi can inhabit the nerdy rom-com niche and safely say that it does it best.",

            "content": "- Finally my review of Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku, beginning with the story, which soon enough I notice that it is extremely simple but expected of a romantic comedy anime; the story is rather simple but interesting, since it is a work of romantic comedy focused on adults something difficult to find nowadays, in general, there is not much to say about the story, it is a simple story with a proposal different but interesting.\r\n- Now on the technical side, this is the weakest point of Wotakoi, the technical part leaves much to be desired mainly in its visual as a whole, evenfor a romantic comedy; the animation is also very simple; the only thing that really stands out is the soundtrack; now about the direction, this is a complicated case, the direction in general is very weak also, although it manages to create a good scene of comedy from time to time, however surely the direction could have been better.\\n\\n\r\n- About the characters, all I have to say is that they are good characters, especially the protagonists, since the coadjuvants could certainly have been better developed, but the cast as a whole is yes very good, could have been better but still are good characters.\\n\\n\r\n- Conclusion, Wotakoi is a simple romantic comedy, but with a different proposal, has good characters, good story, but has an extremely weak technical part, as well as his direction; in general, I recommend yes Wotakoi, it is not the best romantic comedy of the spring season 2018, but still it is a good anime, I recommend it for sure !! \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc99 !!\\n\\n\r\n- My favorite song by Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku \ud83d\udc9b : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkGEOT7JhXw\\n\\n\r\n- My page about animes on facebook \ud83d\udc99 : https://www.facebook.com/pg/AnimeSpaceBR.050/posts/?ref=page_internal\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc99 !!",

If you're a working young adult who's still into games and anime then you'll definitely love the flow of this one... it's like, not because you're an adult means you have to give up what you like... and while you don't go around announcing you're an anime/game/BL otaku, you do have your clique where you can be yourself. \r\nIt's a love story but that's not the overbearing theme since there's also friendship and meeting new people and bonding and understanding even the people you've known for years. \r\nIt's really alight everyday scenario, a slice a life with characters that are lovable and situations that are so common. There are no moments of big reveals but each episode connects and slowly paints a picture of the characters growing/changing and you'll definitely find yourself routing for them XD  \\n\\n\r\nI'm very much looking forward to season 2.",

Wotakoi is unique, though, in that it begins where most other romantic dramadies typically end\u2014with our protagonists actually in a relationship.\r\nIt\u2019s apparent that there wasn\u2019t too much of a budget to work with here, but they get along well enough via cost/time cutting measures like shot selections that don\u2019t require a whole lot of actual animation.\r\nWotakoi is not the prettiest or most comical show in the world, but it is endearing in its own way.This is a good one either wind down or wake up with. You\u2019ll chuckle a couple of times, you maybe even hold your breath once or twice during a surprising moment of suspense, and ultimately, you\u2019ll feel good watching it.",

            "content": "This anime was very refreshing. Its storyline is among the most realistic out there which makes it very relatable and having something this relatable makes you soon grow attached to the characters. It covers many aspects of love being difficult for people with special interests. Finding it, maintaining it and growing through it. I also loved how it portrayed the insecurities of not just individuals in a relationship but also of average people in general- how we try to change ourselves to fit an image that is more acceptable in society. \r\nAmong the few downsides of this anime are:\r\n- The similarities in MC names (thiswas a personal peeve right from the first episode and confused me as a non-Japanese speaker. This is breaking a basal story rule of not having characters of similar sounding/spelt names in close association)\\n\r\n- The boyfriend, girlfriend titles seems to be just a formality at times to provide a connection between two characters even when at times the couple does not behave as so (But you feel this is intentional as the characters don't want to draw unnecessary attention to themselves and honestly it gets better towards the last few episodes)\\n\r\n- It gets better towards the end and has promise for the future. It should have been longer or had a second season.\\n\r\n- The mature relationship is not portrayed quite accurately. There doesn't seem to be enough going on between the pair to have kept them together 'unmarried' for as many years as is implied. \\n\r\n- Its target audience is narrow (enjoyable by those who can relate: various degrees of otakus).\\n\\n\\n\r\nMore positives:\\n\r\n- The animation tries to outdo its own sphere and it's not bad.\\n\r\n- The voice actors are perfect for their characters.\\n\r\n- The number of true-to-life moments that occur in this anime is very high. \\n\r\n- The opening and ending songs lyrically are on point for the story and the tunes as well are quite nice- like someone put the effort in.\\n\r\n- There are no tropes being abused here, nor employed. It's just anime characters who are so realistic you just might know someone (or be that someone) who shares their story.\\n\r\n- Being such a light-hearted anime while still being deep (with its various devices: dialogue, backstory, solid characters...) and able to elicit various emotions from you at just the right amounts so that it's not drama should be a huge reason for anyone to watch it (if you're an otaku)\\n\r\n- It is not swarming with aesthetically perfect characters. Most of them are average looking living average lives.\\n\r\n- No melodrama.\\n\\n",

As the setting of the Anime, so is for the people it caters to. \r\nAs I had mentioned, Wotakoi is an anime best suited for people who're although still obviously avid fans of Anime but can't make too much time because the Adult world is unforgiving and scary and bills, and bills, and bills. When you've got too much time OUT of your hand, Wotakoi is good enough to serve as little servings to just ease in. It's an anime that doesn'tdemand a binge watch. And that's good. We've already too much to think about, in the end, an Anime is just a sweet escape that we all could need.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance here is not as spicy as a Romeo and Juliet but just a little pinch of sugar just enough to satisfy, so don't expect heart wrenching, tear jerking moments happening anytime in the show. In fact, admittedly, the romance between the two MC, felt rushed, but as intended, since, the show was not about the happy ending but about what comes after that confession.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I do love about this anime is, forgive an old man for ranting, is that it reminds us that even Adults are still allowed a life outside their cubicles. That one can be a hardworking adult without giving too much of our lives away.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing technical to say about the Anime, since, for the most part, that's already been for me by the other critiques here. But heed my advice, take every review here with a grain of salt. You should be the one to judge your own enjoyment. We're nothing more than just MAL users like you here.",

It wasn't half bad. But somehow it kinda felt like watching newbie's creation. As expected Wotaku was author's first piece. And he does both of art and story, probably he gonna make better piece later. This is why i reviewing this anime.\r\nSeems like author studied on romance stories bit a lot. \r\nIt's about of office worker's love story but they're otaku. And there goes love story. Ifyou watched romance anime a lot, u'd probably bored in middle of it. Just force ur butt and finish it. It may can bore u a bit it's good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter's art good but background is not good. Also gaming scenes were irate me, that was maybe cute but i really disappointed of that. If someone puts gaming scenes into their piece they should work on them hard. Gaming scenes should be one of main event in this series NOT FILLER!.\\n\\n\r\nOp, ed, osts were normal. They should work on them. Voice actresses were good as usual. \\n\\n\r\nHirotaka just pulled this series to better way. In first sight Narumi seemed like b*tch in flashback stories. But it's not reason why i don't like Narumi character side. Maybe she has some good sides but she has to be unique side which one that made him shine. It made her like normal sh*t (btw she may can be otaku but f*ck that that's only base role...). In fact Hirotaka pulled him to shine, lol. \\n\r\nHanako x Tarou was normal cute couple. But felt like filler. \\n\r\nIf this story continues as anime in sequels Hirotaka's little brother and Kou-chan would make very very cute and good romance story line. \\n\r\nKou's appearance was good. In anime Naoya didn't regonized she's a girl. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed a bit. But i looking forward to sequel. Hope it goes well. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Looking for some filler that won't mess with your feelings from that last show you really liked but will give you something to enjoy a bit? Jackpot!!!\r\nThis one and Net-Juu no Susume both looked similar on my list and I expected something similar out of both. However, Net-Juu was the show I wanted, it had heart, soul, a cutesy story and left a strong, fun, meaningful impression despite its content. Wotaku was about what I expected by the cover art, but I was still hoping for more. \r\nThe key with this one is enjoying it for what it is without reading to much into thereality of it. Or if you like to analyze and contemplate things deeply, then the key is to do the exact opposite, but be warned if this is the kind of life you seek, there is no profundity explored in this one, or rather, there is no profundity TO explore. \\n\\n\r\nThe empty philosophy of the show is pretty sad the more you think about it, so it will really depend on your relation to the characters and your closet-sort-of-otaku level. If you're really diving into deep support of anime and characters, finding your life's meaning in digital self indulgence and merchandise consumption, then this one will leave you feeling justified! Did that line make you happy? If not, you will feel about like you just did while watching this. \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, I really liked Nao and that shy character and frankly I thought that was better than the entire rest of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are like really composed and pretty versions of those kids who seem a bit lost in fantasy worlds and who generally can't hold regular conversations. I think a lot of people here will have those they have trouble talking to for lack of skill, comfort, or common ground. However, anytime I've met people like this in real life, they were decidedly less amiable. If you tried to game with them they CRUSHED you mercilessly without regard, if you tried to talk to them they could ONLY talk about what they were extremely into at the moment. It seemed like these were the kinds of people the show tried to convey, but I've met them as adults and they aren't like this. At the same time, as a closet nerd for this and that I couldn't relate either. It expected too much of me: I couldn't both suspend my philosophy of life meaning while also trying to accept this fashionable 'otaku' representation as something legitimate. \\n\\n\r\nIts one thing to be really into things, its another to be a composed adult, and still another to develop a life of real meaning. Sure they can all relate and intertwine, but the show has this unwritten vibe that a life devoid of meaning is somehow fine and normal. Like these characters NEVER wen't to sleep wondering what the meaning of their life was, if they were wasting their time, if it was all worth it. That whole reality is completely ejected, it just doesn't exist in this world, and thats pretty sad to watch. They never find meaning either, they just sort of team up to indulge their fancies and then thats supposed to be satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nI guess my problem with this show is how non-self-aware it is. It really buys its own schtick. The interactions were fun and the show had many laughable moments but the authors apparent lack of understanding regarding why life has meaning and what is actually real and worth pursuing cast a dim tone on it. Naturally those who derive their entire identity and sense of worth from this kind of materialistic meandering might be breathing fire at this point, but thats just it. The void that they are trying to fill that yields the fire breathing upon challenging their worldview is what is missing from this show - I guess you could say its like its soul is gone. Its one thing to get passionate about being a nerd and to talk about the difficulties associating with 'normies' but thats a pretty 'small' plot. \\n\\n\r\nGetting along with people who can't relate to your interests or world is difficult, for 12 episodes. I get it, I've experienced it, I still do, this is not the be-all and end-all of life's meaning. The fact that absolutely NOTHING else is ever explored leaves this one in an odd and highly forgettable, if mildly amusing spot. Compare this to something like Yuru Camp which is up to its eyeballs in heart and soul while exploring simple life events and it gives a clear picture of this shows value or lack thereof. \\n",

            "content": "The reason I watched this:  I watched this because it was a romance anime. The other reason is that it was popping up on my YouTube recommendation and I was liking the small clips I was seeing. The concepts of otaku in love made me want to check it out.\r\nStory:  The story is about 2 friends, Hirotaka and Narumi, meeting up in a company when they haven't seen each other since middle school. They are both otaku and basically based on circumstance you learn why she moved to the new company and at the same time you learn why they start dating. Theshows follow them and two other co-workers, Hanako and Tarou, life in the company and main focus is on Hirotaka and Narumi relationship.\\n\\n\r\nMy Thoughts:  I'm a big sucker for romance, but what I really enjoyed were the hobbies that the characters were talking about were some of the things I like in real life. I also like the interaction between the two main character since it one cheery person and one kind of like no emotion like person. Yet the one with no emotion wants to release that emotion.\\n\\n\r\nRating time:\\n\\n\r\nPlot: The plot, yet simple, is something I like. The environment where we are dealing with adults is a nice fresh of air here. The character being otaku is interesting twist. With that knowledge the common comedy they do with it is great. And the romance is part of the show which is awesome. The rest of it is kind of like a slice of life sort of. I mean they make progression but I enjoy it. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The anime itself is not ecchi, except maybe for one or two scenes maybe, but overall animation is very nice. The anime is also new from the 2018. The animation shown for different emotions were done great, from cute moments to serious moments to I'm pissed moments lol. They bring in video game references (like RPG have attack escape) which I don't know if it under animation or not, but it cool. They also showed different animation when they were in a different environment. I think they did a really great job on it. 9.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I watch the anime in Japanese dub and I loved it. The voices were great for the character they were portraying. Even though music wasn't a thing even the opening theme was starting to get stuck in my head lol. Which is pretty big for something that not action pack I guess. I'll give it a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are all great. I love their introduction and how you figure out who is what and what do they specialize in. The character past sometimes looked at but not much. The progression is slowly there as well. Overall I would give it a 8 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall with Bias: I really enjoyed the anime and the concept what got me. I think my bias is really strong here but oh well. I give this anime a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: I would recommend it. If you like romance and comedy and if you like the concept of otaku and that the character are adult that are working.\\n",

            "content": "A slice-of-life romcom that started off as a comic on the Japanese online artists community Pixiv before being serialised as a web comic. 26 year old Narumi Momose seems like your average optimistic cheery girl but she has a secret. She doesn't want anyone to find out she's an Otaku (geek) because guys always dump her when they find out she's also a \"Fujoshi [rotting girl, word play that refers to women/girls]\" - a girl who is into \"Boys Love (explicitly illustrated fiction featuring gay men relations)\". After her last boyfriend left her, she decided to start afresh at a new company and tries tokeep her Otaku nature a secret but she soon finds out she wasn't the only Otaku there. Her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji who isn't a fairly socialable gaming Otaku also happened to be working there and there was also fellow Fujoshi, Hinako Koyanagi who cosplays as male characters and was a fan of her self-published BL. Hinako's rash, angry looking but considerate boyfriend Tarou Kabakura is also a bit of an Otaku too but hardly shows it.\\n\\n\r\nAs Narumi and Hirotaka catch up she reveals how she doesn't have any luck with guys. She never makes a mistake in dating sim games so she doesn't understand why it never works out but, doesn't want to date an Otaku who might be more accepting of her because she considers them disgusting. However, when Hirotaka points out he can be really accepting of her Otaku habits and always be with her like in an RPG, Narumi decides to give him a chance. And so, a new relation begins for the new Otaku couple but as they hang out together with Hinako and Tarou, they feel like something's not quite right.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you think of an Anime about Otaku you'd probably think of classics like Genshiken but this show feels quite different. Probably it's set pass the stage of uni clubs and right into working adulthood. It's a cute show with an opening that features a dance with fun hand gestures. Narumi has cute expressions and it's always entertaining when she's trying to help people around her. It's fun watching the couples get caught up in each other's little fights or just supporting each other too. Geeks watching this will probably be able to relate a lot to the show right away. It's filled with emoji since Hirotaka isn't very good at expressing himself. There's even features footage from Monster Hunter X on the Switch.\\n\\n\r\nActually, you'll see a lot of product placements in it, no parodies like the usual Anime and lots of references to other Anime shows like Macross, Evangelion, One Punch Man and Maison Ikkoku. Part of the fun is recognising them all so unless you've seen a lot of shows or played a lot of games then you'll probably miss a lot of the references. Some of them are actual phrases that were pretty much lost in translation with the subtitles I was watching such as Hanako saying \"yoroshii, naraba krieg da [Then krieg is what you shall have]\". This meant she was declaring war but is also a reference to a line used in Hellsing when a 13 page speech was given in the Manga - in other words, a fierce argument ahead.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a fair bit of Otaku lingo too which is interpreted fine but you kind of miss out on the fun lingo - a bit like the time when Densha Otoko was released and there had to be a glossary. Best one for me was probably \"imakita sangyo\" - short for \"I just got here, please summarise what's been going on\" on 2ch forum.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing too explicit in this show but since it stars two Fujoshis, there are times you hear and visually see what they're fantasising about men in gay relationships so you might not like it if you're a guy. Thankfully they rarely occur - I've only seen it happen once in the entire series. Show looks great, nice clean art like most of A-1 Pictures slice-of-life shows and the music's mostly cheery too.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're not bothered by the odd Fujoshi fantasy going wild, it's mostly a straight cute romcom that isn't overly mushy. Don't miss out on the extra scenes after the ending. The show just gets better as it progresses.\\n\\n\r\nLooking forward to a season two!",

            "content": "So far as of writing this I feel like this is less a romance anime and more a Otaku slice of life that just happens to be told from the view-point of 2 Otaku couples. I am using the term couples fairly lightly though since I feel like it's honestly closer to just 4 friends that just happen to be equal parts male and female and proclaim to be together when there's very little actual romance. So far I would say if you are looking for quality romance to probably look elsewhere, while this show does a very few really great moments, it's maybe 1every 3.5 episodes so far. \\n\\n\r\nBasically I went in expecting a slow but gradual romantic development or even a off the bat relationship that slowly explores the \"afterwards\" of getting up the courage to pop that question. It's just not really there. The last 3 episodes in particular have been fairly bland with no real plot developement at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pleasing and so is the sound. The Character's are all stereo-typical cardboard cut out's but at least they are done well.  The story started strong and held out for a bit but the last few episodes has me bored.\\n\\n\r\nIf things change after the series is finished I will either change or delete this review. Not sure how many episodes are left but if it's a standard 12 episode anime I imagine the last 5 better be gushing with content or my score will fall lower.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Finally finished this, and I have to say, the last 4 episodes had alot more romance packed in it but also tried to shoe horn in another trope couple and nothing at all got resolved or satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR This is one big Commercial for the Manga/ Light Novel. The anime will leave you fealing unfulfilled other than some of the stellar moments.",

Bright colors and clean.\r\nAnimation: 6/10 Pretty simple. No action scenes and is pretty much a shoujo. \r\nPlot: 6/10 Just a SoL romance. The daily lives of the main couples.\r\nDevelopment/Conclusion: 6/10 Open ended ending with some pretty good vibes. I like how the little brother has potential with the new girl they added. There were a couple cute scenes. A bit of character growth for the main dude. Not much development or backstory with the side couple. Sort of disappointing main couple development. \r\nMusic: 7/10 Catchy and cute. Nosound design to note. Bgm unnoticeable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 All the couples were cute. I liked their interactions. The main dude is sort of too bland for being a bland MC. I didn't particularly like any of the characters except for that new gamer girl they added in late. I just appreciated the cute couples.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 It was fine but I wouldn't consider this a stand-out among Shoujo. This is a pretty flexible translation of the manga. I actually find this better than the manga.",

The first episode eventually came out, and I was struck by how fresh, funny, and unpretentious the show was. I genuinely enjoyed the episode, and it maintained that quality throughout the other 10 episodes. The writing was clever and sharp, and the characters were relatable. Overall,I really like this show, and is one of the best in the genre in recent years.",

I think Narumi is pretty awesome. nice and sweet but also serious and angry at times XD the other characters were really nice but i thinkNarumi is my favorite out of them.\\n\\n\r\nthis anime had me laughing at times and I really enjoyed those moments. from subtle humor to the way their faces were expressed made me laugh. an example would be when Narumi and Hanako are talking about boys love stuff with Hirotaka and tarou. while i felt uncomfortable listening to this conversation i was laughing at how crazy serious the two were taking this.\\n\\n\r\noverall loved this anime. only thing i would change would make Hirotaka a little more expressive, not by much just a small bit.",

            "content": "Ok, so I tried so hard to like this show, I did. I fell in love with megane, (the show is so dreadful I only remember two people's names and they are side characters) at first but then he became so dull as a person, and not because of the cold-monotone personality they were trying to go for. He just was.\r\nPink Hair chick, Momose (I had to open the info tab to get their names), is annoying, loud, and on more than one occasion admits she isn't attracted to her boyfriend. Now they go over this in the show where it could be a relationshipof convenience, (yes, yes it is), but it doesn't get resolved. These two have known each other since childhood, yet this moron doesn't know enough about him to be considered an acquaintance. I had to watch this more than once in case I missed things, sadly, I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nNow Gingertoki (Kabakura) and Green Haired chick (Hanako) are like the worst example of a couple. Now, everyone has arguments here and there, especially when both people are stubborn, but f***ing dammit. Him calling her a hag is not cute. Her forcing him to do things isn't cute. They get into a fight and it doesn't even get resolved and it pisses me off. It's unhealthy this type of arguing. They only gave them a couple of good eps and even then it didn't last. Like before it became 100% established that they were dating they were better with each other, then it's made clear and they're at each other's throats just for breathing weird. There is so much they have to work on for a couple that's been together for a decade.\\n\\n\r\nIt was hard for me to believe that Hirotaka ever had a thing for this dumb chick since childhood. Like it all seemed forced. \\n\\n\r\nFor all those people that loved it for not being the high school show where it takes ages for the couple to admit their feelings, you have been tricked with this show. These two dated because \"why not we're both otakus\" (worst reason), and throughout the show they couldn't admit their feelings. He didn't tell her how long he liked her for, she was still uncertain of the whole relationship the whole damn time, she was still not attracted to him until he removed his glasses and other chicks wanted him. Saying she hadn't seen him like that. Honestly, I can barely see them as friends. It's not that they're going slow, there is no fucking chemistry, hell there was more chemistry with Momose  (I did it, I remembered a name without having to look back) and Naoya. This whole show was Momose wondering if she loved Megane. They are literally acting like those kids that think they should date because they have things in common, but they really shouldn't because they just don't mesh well. So it is another high school show where the lead couple won't admit their feelings or act on them. It's just been dressed up differently. \\n\\n\r\nNow the one thing that wasn't resolved and I fear it will be for  season 2 that this show doesn't deserve, is the relationship with Naoya and Kou. Now those two were believable as a potential couple. It's like the writers spent more time making those two likable. Those seriously are the only ones I'm rooting for and even like. If there is a season 2, I won't watch it,  but at least resolve something.\\n\\n\r\nI give Garbagetaku a 2/10 only bc I love Naoya and Kou.",

But hey, everybody is wrong sometimes!\r\nI was extremely pleasantly surprised by the pacing and humor of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii. A tale about two people entering adulthood while embracing their embarrassing, childhood interests, while ALSO falling in love, brought forth a completely heart warming feeling. The romance skips the unnecessary fan service and keeps the relationships growth slow and steady, showing both the better and worse moments of it. This makes for one of themost realistic romance anime I have personally seen so far, and is a large reason for why I enjoyed watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor largely incorporates references to other anime or video games, which is super fitting for a show following two otakus, and in my opinion is very charming. I often found myself having to control the volume of my laughter when I was watching this at ungodly hours (no regrets though).\\n\\n\r\nI would most definitely recommend Wotaku ni Koi was Muzukashii to anybody who enjoys a quirky, colorful, and overall fun show, and is tired of seeing the main couple fall in love within the first 10 minutes of the show (as I am).\\n\\n\r\nPlus, the \"falls in love with childhood friend later in life\" story line is something I will never get tired of.\\n\\n",

The male lead's performance in Wotakoi is a dead ringer for Hoshino's in the same drama: deadpan, at timescaught off guard, but very \"professional\" (even though Hoshino's character wasn't really an otaku). Additionally, the general musical style of the opening theme, \"Fiction\", was similar to Koi (without the erhu; the first five notes of the vocal melody are the same), and the \"seated selfie dance\" (that's why they're doing it one-armed, yo) was similar, if not directly inspired, by the choreography in Escapist. If I didn't know better, I'd say that this is almost a \"pakuri\".\\n\\n\r\nThe premise has a similar feel as well-- in Escapist a perennial part-timer enters into a contract to be the male lead's wife purely to have a place to stay, and in Wotakoi a diehard fujoshi decides to go out with her gamer otaku friend from childhood largely to form an otaku alliance. Romantic intentions were minimal at the start in both shows.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about where the similarities end. Naru and Hirotaka have fantastic chemistry from the get-go (and for that matter, Hanako and Taro... Oh no, I just realized the manga artist chose the Japanese equivalent of \"John and Jane Doe\" for the supporting characters' names >< ). Wotakoi is more of a \"what if a couple of otakus started going out\" sitcom rather than \"what if a man and woman marry as contractors\", and so the comedy and situations that evolve are very different.\\n\\n\r\nNaru's and Hirotaka's voice actors are unknown to me (I'm sure I've heard them elsewhere, I just don't recognize the names), but they deliver solid performances. The supporting couple is Tomokazu Sugita (well if it isn't Kyon Smith) and Miyuki \"Miyukichi\" Sawashiro. Last time I heard those voices together, they both were bit roles in a hilarious Charlotte scene. Sugita plays the irritable manga otaku office manager effectively, while Miyukichi's lovely alto is a perfect match for the cosplayer Hanako. The character designs are fairly standard fare, and Naru's/Taro's ever-changing facial expressions are some of the funnier running gags of the show.\\n\\n\r\nLater in the series we get to see Hirotaka's younger brother, Naoya, and a potential love interest, Ko. Unfortunately it's so late in the series that we'd need to wait for a second series/film before we see anything develop, and credit where it's due, they announced a series 2.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures' animation here is well-planned and executed, which makes me wonder why they accepted such a train wreck last season and slashed story quality in the process. I'm hearing a lot of harsh criticism of the studio itself, which leads me to believe they're just grabbing whatever productions as the lowest bidder. Sometimes it works, often times it's just asking for trouble. So for God's sake, A-1, do NOT use the same writing, production, and planning crew as Grancrest in series 2. Whoever was in charge did not care about the production or the audience, and it showed in spades.",

            "content": "This was without a single doubt my favorite anime this season. It helps that this was my most anticipated anime of the season. It ALSO helps that I\u2019m caught up on the manga and already love the series. From beginning to end, this was an extremely fun and lovable anime. It was also an amazingly accurate adaptation. \r\nWotakoi follows four adults all working in the same office. All of them happen to be Otaku. Hirotaka is a gaming Otaku, Narumi is a manga/anime Otaku, Kabakura is a manga Otaku, and Koyanagi is Cosplay/BL Otaku. As it turns out, Kabakura and Koyanagi have been dating forquite some time. Hirotaka and Narumi are actually childhood friends, but haven\u2019t seen each other in years. Soon, they start to date as well.\\n\r\nWotakoi is a romance/slice of life that follows actual working adults. All of these characters are in their 20\u2019s and some have prior dating knowledge. Due to this, there are almost NONE of the common romance troupes. There are no misunderstandings, miscommunications, love triangles, harems, dumb decisions, or anything like that. These are all adults, not drama filled high school students. This was a breath of fresh air. It still manages to be wholesome and adorable as hell at times. Since all of the cast are Otaku, viewers are treated to some genuine Otaku conversations and activities. You can tell they\u2019ve been Otaku for years now and it\u2019s just natural for them at this point. There are a few instances of drama, but even that feels fresh. When two Otaku start to date, they start to wonder if they really do like each other or if one (or both) of them are simply making a compromise with dating someone with similar interests because it\u2019d be easier. I love how a few episodes play with this dynamic and address it appropriately. Since the characters are all adults, they actually stop to talk about this with their partner instead of keeping it bottled inside. \\n\r\nThe humor is too notch in Wotakoi. While there are plenty of anime, manga, and video game references, the anime doesn\u2019t rely solely on them to be funny. I can appreciate the fact that the references can be noticed by all sorts of anime fans. It\u2019s not limited to certain genres or years. \\n\r\nThe main things holding back Wotakoi however are all production related. The animation isn\u2019t all that good, but it\u2019s not bad either. It\u2019s somewhere between \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cAdequate.\u201d The soundtrack kind of gets repetitive with the same 2-3 background tracks always playing. At least the OP and ED are phenomenal. This is a critique/comment from someone who\u2019s a huge fan of the manga, but I would\u2019ve loved to see the anime take more chances with anime-only material. It would\u2019ve been nice to see if the studio could make their own moments with the same character dynamics and humor as the manga material. Either way, Wotakoi was truly a gem to watch. I might rewatch it at some point this summer just because of how enjoyable it was. Without a doubt, I\u2019ll be playing the opening theme at least 4 times a week.\\n\r\n(Side Note: I doubt we\u2019ll be getting a 2nd season anytime soon. Maybe 3 years from now. The anime basically covered all of the manga chapters. It started relatively recently and it\u2019s a monthly updated manga, so there\u2019s not a lot of material out thus far and it\u2019ll be awhile before enough material for a 2nd season is available.)",

            "content": "There is very little to criticize about this anime at all except that I wish it were a little longer. \r\nTo begin with, the story is amazing. It's a romance, but it's not one of those shoujo schoolgirl romances with unnecessary blushfests, multiple misunderstandings, and 'romantic' touches nearing sexual assault. This is a tasteful romance that also forgoes the excessive passion in more erotic and sensual romantic anime/manga where the love is so bright and strong that it's hard to believe it can last like that for any time at all. Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a story about two adult couples with quiet,mundane love stories. It is responsible, plausible, understated, and strong that gains support in the couple sharing ground and understanding of each other instead of seeking to change each other-- it's a romance of normal people who are just happy the way they are. It's so rare to find such a realistic, mature romantic anime, and I'm so glad that I did. Especially since the plot has so many comedy and otaku elements-- being a certified fangirl, shipper, BL chick, otaku, and otome geek, I enjoyed all the references and found this to be refreshing and so enjoyable I could barely wait for the episode each week. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was phenomenal. Without making anything overly unrealistic (massive bouncing jello boobs for the chicks, sexy abs when the guys barely even work out, etc.) it just fit into a mundane, every day artstyle. It was clean, colorful, and  was very appealing to the eye. Not to mention the clothing designs (especially for Narumi) were quite adorable! They did a great job with her hair and a lot of the details.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't love the opening at first, but it really grew on me, as did the closing. They're not perfect songs or songs I would listen to on my own time, but whenever I hear the first few notes, I will immediately remember the adorable anime this was. :) \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the characters were amazing since they were in this mature, realistic romance. They retained enough faults (being addicted to BL/boobs, being angry little jerks, being teases for no good reason, being annoying drunks, getting mad for no good reason, etc.) to seem human, while also being good at things they did. They really seemed like real people, which was pretty great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was such a wholesome anime that I just adore it with all my heart. :) I'm praying there's gonna be more of it! \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like mature romances, like quiet romances without a lot of action, like Kiss Him Not Me, love otaku humor\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: like more 'passionate' romances, like the traditional shoujo romances, can't stand it if the main ship isn't making out most of the time, otaku humor isn't really your favorite \\n\\n\r\nHave great day everyone!",

            "content": "I always try to wait until I finish a show before I write a review, and this one was exceptionally hard to do so! In a season where it has to compete both with the end of Darling in the Franx, and the beginning of Steins;Gate 0, this series still stood out to me as something special.\r\nUpfront, I'll admit I have a bias to romances. However, the show uses different techniques, styles, and characterizations that seem to feel familiar while also remaining somewhat grounded. I'll go into mainly the story, the art, and the characters for this review.\r\nStory: The show (only having eleven episodes) startsright off the bat, showing that the season follows Hirotaka and Narumi as they navigate the ups and downs of their newly formed relationship. Unlike most anime with \"childhood friends,\" this one actually shows them being successful in courting their prospective partner accompanied with the aftermath. Rather than simply following their relationship however, it compares and contrasts their relationship with two others in the show. For the sake of spoilers, I'll not mention names. However, the contrasts can show the differences in familiarity, respect, and hobbies that one encounters in any relationship. Although the group of friends all bond of otaku culture, they simultaneously have other hobbies or interests that don't necessarily overlap. The show uses this to represent how just because a couple shares a common bond, doesn't mean they need to necessarily be the same person. The three relationships shown are thoughtful, insightful, and show us fears and insecurities just as much as the ups.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style for this show focuses much less on beautiful visuals and animations, and much more on small otaku or video game references. Even in the final episode, I was seeing other anime referenced in the background almost fully on display, as if to advertise it. While at first I thought it was distracting, I feel they actually were trying to bring a sense of depth and atmosphere to places outside of the workplace, the most common setting for the majority of the show. I think that the flares for the dramatic the art style had such as RPG popup menus, robotic voices, and background references went a long way in developing a style all on its own.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Finally, the best and brightest part of this show is the character developments. For a relationship show, I don't know if I could find another that actually follows the ups and downs of a relationship without trying to be as depressing as \"Scum's Wish\". The insecurities these characters have feel realistic, and while they might not be worrying about the infidelity of their partner, they might be wondering \"am I good enough?\" One of the most basic human fears, not being worth someone's time. Past that, characters don't immediately appear lovey dovey, but you can see and feel the affections the characters hold. They're used to each other, they're familiar to each other, thus things like kisses, sexual situations, and dates are handled with a mature mindset that can be hard to find in many anime.\\n\\n\r\nWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii bring a lot to the table in terms of character and story. Personally, if Darling in the Franxx or Steins;Gate 0 weren't airing this season it would probably be my anime of the season. Overall, I believe this show is worth your time, and I'll be holding out for a season 2.",

            "content": "Ok ok, maybe I'm biased. But let me start my review by saying this: I don't give away 10 stars so easily. I'm actually very picky. Most of my 10s are from a few shows from my childhood (nostalgia is a thing that affects all of us, don't you deny it!) and some are from shows that I actually, legitimately, truly loved.\r\nAnd boy oh boy, did I reeeeaaaally love Wotakoi.\r\nWhile it doesn't exactly have a linear plot (I guess it follows more of a \"slice of life episodic\" formula), the cast more than makes up for it. We have a fujoshi that doesn't want hersecret to come out to normies, a hardcore gamer who doesn't care what other people think of him 'cause he's pretty much antisocial, a cosplayer who's also a fujoshi and who mostly cosplays as male characters and a mild otaku who's not that into the weird spectrum of \"otakuness\" [except for lolis and yuri. he's VERY MUCH into that.]\\n\\n\r\nAnd those are just the 4 main characters, I could spoil a bit and talk about the others but I'll let you watch it and meet them yourselves instead ;)\\n\\n\r\nSo. These four work together in a firm and become really close friends and THAT'S where the story really begins. Two of them were already dating but the other two start dating at the beginning of the story and it's really cute and funny to compare these two couples and see how different their dynamics is.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime deals with the awkwardness of being an otaku and trying to date with someone who is/isn't a part of your circle of interest. It deals with the friendships that you can find if only you open up a little bit and show other people your interests and see what their interests are like, too. It deals with light themes (\"haha wouldn't it be funny if our boyfriends fucked each other? BUT MY BOYFRIEND IS TOTALLY A TOP! YOURS IS A BOTTOM!\") and dark themes (\"hmm i think i'm gonna get my ears pierced just so I can get the attention of my childhood friend who I have this major crush on\"). And so on...\\n\\n\r\nTrue, it does deliver more comedy than romance. If you're looking for kissing, romantic confessions and such... hmmm... maybe this isn't exactly the anime for you. But it will definitely melt your heart and put a smile on your face, for sure.\\n\\n\r\nAnother downside is that it's so SHORT. Only 11 episodes, 23 minutes each. But even so, I think it's a sweet, short ride that's worth getting on.",

In my opinion personally, using an office work environment setting in an Anime is quite unique, since not much anime have taken that kind of setting and not only that, this anime describes how love workout for otaku out there, so it is quite funny, you know what to expect when two otakus become a couple. This anime is an unique romcom, I really recommend this Anime for those who love romance comedy and light showto watch in your leisure time, this anime will put a smile on your face, your heart racing, and rise up the hope on tokimeki that maybe you have given up since you graduated from your high schooll.",

            "content": "The manga is one of my current top favourites, and when I heard it'll be adapted into an anime, I was nervous because I have high expectations naturally. Luckily I'm not disappointed thus far! It definitely doesn't look like a low budget anime adaptation (like Orange, ahem). \r\nI like WotaKoi for the slice-of-life, josei storyline and the characters are interesting yet believable. The story sticks very closely to its main theme of love and friendship between working adults. I like the pace of the story's development, it's subtle rather than dramatic and has an easygoing, effortless feeling to it, which is a lot more realisticand a breath of fresh air from dramatic incidents. This show is meant for the viewer to kick back and enjoy it for how it resonates with the viewer's daily life and hobbies. I can confirm this, because I'm also an otaku somewhat. ^^\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really close to the manga and the colour palette tastefully chosen (thank god there). Sound-wise, there's nothing much to shout about but it's understandable because of the type of story and setting (vs historical epics or sci-fi fantasies, for example). The ED song is quite catchy. I do like how pauses are employed to enhance the dead-pan humour in certain scenes, plus the robotic narration is hilarious and a pretty smart replacement to the original manga's footnotes.\\n\\n\r\nI just finished ep7 before writing this, so I hope the rest of the episodes will be just as enjoyable. This is good entertainment, especially if you are a working adult otaku!",

            "content": "Wotakoi is a series that will more hit home for viewers who have experience having very close friends or romantic partners who share interests in anything anime, manga, cosplaying, or video games.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nI came in with minimum expectations because romantic comedy is a bit iffy in my department and I am not the biggest fan of works by A-1 Pictures.  But for the first half, I found myself amused and laughing genuinely by the hilariously relatable situations of hiding your passions and interests from a society who wholeheartedly tends to think little of those involved in such activities.  It's not unusual for otakusto initially be ashamed to share their love for anime and manga openly or sometimes becoming socially awkward because it is not a common topic with other people around you.  But it pushes the message that you should never feel ashamed of them and just find people who will accept you for who you are whether you have common interests or not.\\n\r\nIt's a romantic comedy so there is not necessarily a need for a plot but it felt as it they developed the relationship between Narumi and Hirotaka nicely for 5 episodes in the beginning and then nothing much happens from then.  The comedy became more hit and miss and I wasn't enjoying the episode stories afterwards.  I also am not personally appealed by video game concept episodes so I wasn't intrigued by the RPG portions of the episodes and there were only 2 more episodes after episode 5 where they kept on further developing Narumi and Hirotaka's relationship.  So the story felt very lackluster in the 2nd half.  Not to mention the final episode did not feel like a finale and did not make for a fitting farewell unless they plan a 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nTalk about a diverse cast!  A yaoi fangirl, a gamer, a cross-dressing cosplayer, and a moe-loving manga reader.  The characters were very well portrayed in the funny yet serious hardships people can have when they are interested in different subtopics of the otaku industry.  They have their favorites but become very accepting of each others' hobbies which makes for a genuine group of friends that is very enjoyable to witness.  They have their moments when they argue and fight about their differences but they are aware that they all share the struggle of being in the minority in their work industry so they are practically all they have in terms of sharing interests.  The Hirotaka and Narumi relationship was more for starting and developing since they started uncomfortable for being childhood friends and then decided to date.  But their relationship felt real since they slowly became more comfortable with each other and slowly began to learn something new from each other every episode.  Hanako and Tarou's relationship was more real because they have personalities that clash much more volatilely and their devotion to one another despite the constant arguments was cuter and brought upon the most comedy for the time that this anime was good.\\n\r\nThe story began to take a turn for the worse when Hirotaka's brother was introduced.  Some can defend this saying that there are those who feel left out when their friends or siblings have a hobby they are dedicated to while they have nothing special about them.  I personally could not stand his presence.  The comedy was falling apart when he got introduced and I felt he was more of a nuisance towards the antics of the main cast.  I can see how this could have worked but I was not able to accept him as a useful character and found him more annoying and given more screentime than deserved.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7/10\\n\r\nI don't pay attention to art or animation unless it's grand or horrible so both sections were solid.  But the colors were bright and nice so it was able to stand out and look cute in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nNothing that stands out other than those 20 seconds of the opening that is just so adorable!!!  You know what I'm talking about. :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is not a series that will appeal to everyone.  As much as I loved the characters in this series, it felt as if the anime did enough for them to bring me anywhere.  The characters just went on with their lives as soon as Hirotaka and Narumi were settled but I was bored after Hirotaka's brother made his debut.  If a 2nd season ever gets announced, I don't see myself watching it.  The comedy was not strong enough to push the series without a story and that's a problem when the comedy is the center of said series such as this.  The comedy failed and the romance, the stronger the portion, could have been giving more (or better) attention.",

            "content": "Story: The Story was really simple. Just a couple of childhood friends who rekindle a friendship at work which ends up resulting in a relationship. Along with another couple who they work with the anime follows the daily lvies of these four Otaku and the struggles of dating an Otaku.\r\nArt and Animation: Very clear, clean, and crisp. This anime was very easy on the eyes. With A-1 producing it I did not expect anything less.\r\nSound and Music: The opening is probably the best of the season. the song is super catchy and you basically just want to get up and dance with the characters. Themusic throughout the series is not really noticeable which is not a bad thing. The voice actors did a tremendous job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The broke down the dynamic of anime fans pretty well minus our two female leads. They were even able to work in a \"Non-Otaku\" to make it feel more real in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nYou have your two fujoshi fan girls in Narumi and Koyonagi who at most times disagreed with who they \"ship\" in certain series.\\n\\n\r\nNarumi you find out right away is a Doujinshi Artist.\\n\r\nKoyonagi's hobby gets found out pretty quickly as well, as we find out she is a popular cosplayer. I would have liked if the anime went more into these two and their hobbies but they did enough in my eyes for how the anime turned out.\\n\\n\r\nWe then have Hirotaka who has a more laid back and chilled personality and focuses his time on games. IE the game Otaku. He and Narumi are dating.\\n\\n\r\nThen have Kabukura who is the boss at the office that they all work at. He is dating Koyonagi. \\n\r\nKabukura is basically your average Otaku. He prefers Yuri manga and anime. His clashes with Koyonagi can be pretty funny at times. There are some serious moments between them as well which really make the anime feel more realistic.\\n\\n\r\nBringing back the \"Non-Otaku\" we come to find out about Hirotaka's younger brother Naoya. Naoya works at a local coffee shop near the office that our main characters work at. He has absolutely no skills when it comes to playing video games or when it comes to watching anime. They even refer to him as a \"Normie\" in the anime which I found pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nHe eventually meet Kou Sakuragi a classmate of his and they form a friendship over a PC game.\\n\\n\r\nI was kind of upset that Kou was introduced so late because I liked the character a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I though the comedy was really well done and I love it when an anime makes references to other anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I thought this was one of the best anime in Spring 2018. However this anime is not for everyone. I feel like it's more for people who can relate being an Otaku. There's just certain references I feel like most anime watchers would not understand.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a great comedy though I would recommend it.",

Especially because while watching it at times I think thatsss sooo meee! xD Wotakoi didnt dissapoint me.\r\nIn Wotakoi we follow the story of 4 otaku friends. But whats really refreshing about it isss they are not in highschool but already in their late 20s and working!\r\nThe characters are all different and that makes it interesting. Hirotaka is a hardcore otaku kinda xD but he is also very cute. He defenetely wants to show his affection but sometimes its hard since Narumisees him more like a friend and misunderstands things he does.\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching it. And the opening music suits the anime quite well.^^\\n\\n\r\nNow my overeall score is 7 for the simple reason that since the MCs are adults and this is a romance anime you might asume that you see more relationship stuff happening than in highschool animes. But no... Ofcourse there were romantic moments and really cute ones that is but just not enough. I wanted to see more romance going on. And a lil bit more character developement. And also there was one little thing left open in the last episode :P\\n\r\nSo thats why I didnt give an 8. But Wotakoi was fun to watch and the story was simple but nice.^^",
