            "content": "Open up a light novel with a school setting with pretty girls and a protagonist standing in the middle. Then in the background, watch for signs of magical content like sparkles, circles, etc. I swear, almost every light novel adaptation these days has something similar in nature and it doesn\u2019t take a creative mind to write a story about them. Given the way Rokudenashi is written, there\u2019s no treasure you\u2019ll find in this series. Instead, you\u2019ll spend endless hours wondering why the characters\u2019 school uniforms look so ridiculous.\r\nAlso known as Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor, the series takes off in an academy life setting.From the first few episodes, the series doesn\u2019t hide the personality of the main protagonist, Glenn Radars. To put it straightforward, he is a bastard. His personality is very sarcastic, lazy, and seems to never be able to stand still. However, Glenn has shown that he is a capable instructor with a decent knowledge of magic. And in essence, he has a good heart to help his students. So I guess in a way, he is able to walk between the line of a lazy bastard and as a guy his students can rely on. Unfortunately, my early impression of Glenn is that he is very difficult to take seriously and is someone that can barely act his age.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the context of the series, the girls doesn\u2019t present a good impression of themselves either. The first time when Glenn interacts with Sistine, a promising student at school, he is literally blasted away by his awkward introduction. Her best friend Rumia seems to be more understanding although she seems to fit into the category of the classic damsel in distress. She is pretty, kind, has blonde hair with a cute smile but unfortunately never able to save herself. You ever see a horror movie where an innocent blonde girl is running for her life and desperately needs to be saved? That\u2019s how I picture Rumia throughout the show as many episodes seems to put her into such position. At some point, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if viewers label her as a hostage simulator.\\n\\n\r\nOn terms of character relationships, the series seems to jump from one to another although the core focus is still Glenn. I have to admit, his relationships with his students is pretty uninspiring. On paper, Glenn and Sistine has a rocky relationship ever since from their first encounter. Their relationship seems to warm up a bit although can hardly be memorable given their contrasting personalities. Let\u2019s face it, Sistine is a serious working student hoping to make her dreams come true while Glenn is a lazy bastard who seems to be taking life like a game. There\u2019s hardly any connection between the two except we learn that Sistine does remind him of another character in the past. Given the length of this adaptation, that territory is hardly explored which is pretty disheartening to be honest. In the meantime, there\u2019s Rumia and Glenn. They get along better and if I had to guess, she might have developed a girly crush on Glenn just because of how much times he\u2019s saved her. Beyond that, it\u2019s nothing home to write about. Oh and of course, there are some other characters we\u2019ll encounter like Re=L, Albert, and Celica. Between Glenn and them, it just feels like these characters are there and hardly stand out with their role. The only character on that list worth mentioning may be Re=L but she has the personality of a doll and a peculiar background story. And trust me, with a character like Re=L in this show, it feels like they are trying to bring in every type of generic character personality they can into one place.\\n\\n\r\nBy expectations, the series probably excels most when it takes a more serious approach at magic. Understandably, this show surprisingly does a neat job at explaining magic, or at least on a level that makes sense. Antagonists are able to utilize magic at a level that looks threatening while Glenn establishes himself as a capable instructor with his knowledge of magic. By storytelling standards, magic is also a core motivation for Sistine as she wishes to discover the secrets of the Flying Castle. So if any positive stands out about this show, I can safely say that magic adamantly stands out. It\u2019s even part of a tournament although the storytelling itself in that field is pretty underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nIf I was to talk about the art of the show, the first thing that pops to my head is the school uniforms. Somehow, the female characters finds no troubling wearing them despite their ridiculous design. Attached to a string and exposing the bellies, it makes me curious if this school even has a damn written dress code. Character designs look somewhat noticeable such as Sistine\u2019s cat ears, Re=L\u2019s blueish hair, or Celica\u2019s black dress. Character expressions for the main cast are somewhat entertaining to watch at times when the timing is appropriate. However, the antagonists in this show are very disappointing to look at. I mean, an evil maid? A guy that dresses like he works as a stagecoach driver? Can this show get any more awkward? On the other hand, I guess the academy itself looks normal or fits within the category of acceptable. The action sequences on most parts flows well. But again, it\u2019s mostly the magic doing the work.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say for the soundtrack or music as it feels rather blend. The OP and ED theme songs are pretty generic while the battle soundtrack is hardly original. My impressions of the voice acting also remains so-so. Glenn sounds too sarcastic for a guy of his age while Re=L is devoid of emotions. Sistine and her friend Rumia doesn\u2019t bring in any memorable lines and often makes comedic scenes look shameful.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, I can\u2019t say this is a good show. Or in fact, it\u2019s not even half decent. It fits more into the category of academy story with characters molded by the most generic personalities possible. The storytelling itself borders into the realm of gobbledygook as hardly any episodes are memorable. With cheesy character dialogues, weakly developed relationships, and attempts at crafting humor, the show doesn\u2019t do well at it selling whatever it intends to. Oh and school uniforms\u2026\\n\\n\r\nJust, why? \\n",

            "content": "Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is in my opinion the greatest disappointment of the spring season. Don't misunderstand me, I really enjoyed the show but after watching the first episodes my expectations were really high, this anime had a lot of potential and it got wasted, so this is why I feel let down.\r\nThe story, which seemed really good at the beginning, went to nowhere, there's no plot overall, the anime consists in Glenn (the MC) saving continuously the girls he's bound to because everyone of them is important for some reason or another and the storytelling towards the end was very rushed: Ifelt like it was lacking something so I read the manga (I know the LN is the original but I couldn't find it anywhere) and noticed that some details were left out of the anime adaptation. So, if you liked the show I recommend you to read the Light Novel or the manga.\\n\r\nI liked the characters and the comedy but I grew a bit annoyed at them with each passing episode because they lost their initial impact, I think the show needed to renew some gags, but it was funny nonetheless and I didn't get bored. \\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, the girls' chara design was beautiful, Rumia, Sistine and Re=l were extraordinarly cute. And I found the voice acting really good, I was most impressed by Sistine's VA,  it was perfect and I loved it. \\n\r\nSo, long story short: if you like the magic/school genre this is a piece of cake, it's entertaining and I had fun watching it, but don't make the same mistake as me, don't raise your expectations, because the anime starts off pretty well, but it becomes somewhat predictable afterwards.",

            "content": "If there is one trend I dislike more than anything over the past few years, it is the plethora and popularity of light novel adaptations. Now, of course, to clarify, I don't believe that just because an anime is adapted from a light novel, it is inherently bad. There have been plenty of light novel adaptations in the past that have actually been pretty good, but what I am referring to, in this case, are the light novel adaptations that feature some boring male protagonist with spiky hair that acts as a self insert for all of the filthy otaku, who goes to some randomhigh school that is usually one in which the students have superpowers (and for some reason it's always magic) as he becomes stronger and stronger while all of the female cast gets wet at his complete awesomeness! Most of these light novel adaptations follow the same basic elements, character archetypes and plot threads, and, if you've seen as many as I have, all begin to blend into one gigantic, horrible mess. I hate these types of light novel adaptations, because they're so lazy and so god damn unoriginal, yet, they still become widely popular; undeservingly so!  While I have seen a couple of them done decently well, such as Chivalry of a Failed Knight, which plays around and subverts some of the troupes found in these typical shows, Akashic Records is not decent... it's not even mediocre! It's terrible! Every one of these elements I have listed in this opening paragraph is present in this travesty, and the writing, characters, narrative and the world presented to us are so boring, generic and cookie-cutter that I feel like throwing up just thinking about them! While this is not the worst light novel adaptation I have ever seen (that honour would go to Absolute Duo or The Asterisk War) it baffles me why this show is receiving such praise from some people and why it has sat at a score of around seven on this website. As soon as I saw the words \"light novel\" and \"LIDENFILMS\" in the seasonal charts before the show started up, I think I died a little inside and, to this day, this studio still hasn't produced a single anime I would actually consider to be noteworthy with this being their minimus opus, if you will. With all that said and done, let's jump into the narrative (if you could even call it that) of this absolute train wreck! \\n\\n\r\nTo say that the story of Akashic Records is generic would be the understatement of the year. If anything, this narrative is incredibly linear and predictable every step of the way with glaring pacing issues while shoving down your throat as many stereotypically dull speeches about life as it can possibly muster in each episode. It's set in a world in which magic is a viable tool and is used often for war against other nations, and, of course, as typical of light novel stories, the teenagers in this world are able to use said magic and attend special high schools. Enter the Light Novel guy for this series; a lazy man with an indifferent attitude who also happens to be a shut-in, takes up a job teaching magic at some random magic high school after being forced to by the woman he lives with. This, however, is greeted by disdain by the students in the class he has to teach, in particular, by two female students, called Tsundere-chan (Sistine Febel) and Basic Bitch (Rumia Tingel). While this first greeting is met with hostility, this new teacher eventually warms up to the rest of the class and they begin to develop more of a bond with him over the course of the series! And that's it for a plot! If it sounds like I'm being incredibly vague with this plot synopsis, that's because nothing really happens in this show from a narrative standpoint. It feels like a sequence of events that just happen because the writer needed to fill in some time and they connect so loosely with each other and have no overall bearing or impact on the plot that the narrative feels weak and lacking emotion. None of the characters has any motivation or any clearly defined goals in this series and thus it is hard to actually get invested or engaged into this world at all, or to care for any of the characters. The narrative has no sense of direction, and a weak narrative isn't exactly a game breaker for me as long as the characters are good (which they're not, but I'll get into that in a bit) but I'd like to have some kind of story actually happening! There is an evil magic organisation of some sort but they barely play any part in the narrative and feel so tacked on and vague that half of the time I forget that they're even present or playing any part in this story. They do introduce a new villain in the show but it's WAY too late into the narrative in order to flesh him out and instead, they rush this character's introduction, his involvement and his back-story within only an episode or so.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the pacing, holy crap is this broken! The show tries to squeeze so much into its short twelve episode frame that it feels like a chore to watch since they're constantly throwing more and more things at you at every passing episode. It's also another kick to the nuts to realise that everything that does happen in the show is so inconsequential and boring to boot as well, which is also present in the setting for the show. The world of Akashic Records is one of the laziest thought out worlds I have ever seen. It's a world in which magic, goddamn MAGIC, is a part of everyday life but we barely have seen any examples of how people coexist with magic in the narrative in their daily lives outside of high school nor is the magic they use themselves all too great either. The great thing about setting your world in which features magic is that it allows you to be as creative as you could possibly want in regards to how the world operates and how its people live, while excusing it with the pretence that magic is an in-depth and intricate system that makes sense to the characters that live in this world, but, instead, they do nothing with it. For the sake of argument, let's compare it to the series Little Witch Academia, which aired alongside this show. Aside from doing everything better than Akashic Records, the world of Little Witch Academia is built around this idea of magic and is used in creative ways which bring the world to life. The world is interesting and alluring. Not only that but each of the characters have clearly defined goals which help to push the story forward and keep the audience immersed in the story; two things that Akashic Records doesn't have.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the time the narrative is just simply tasteless, making light jokes and comedy from molestation and rape of all things, especially from the second episode. The tonal shifts from watching a girl almost get raped to then making a stupid joke is painful and is almost as bad as the tonal shifts from Drifters. Speaking of the comedy, it feels so damn forced and trite as well as predictable that every attempt at a joke falls flat on its face and isn't funny in the slightest! The show also throws an insane amount of blood at the audience in a petty, pathetic attempt at seeming hardcore and edgy since the writing isn't strong enough to hold up by itself. Not only that, but the insane amount of blood half the time just feels silly, such as in episode nine, where Basic is lying unconscious in the floor with an insane amount of blood plastered on the bed, floor and curtains (enough that would kill a person), but her only wound is a slight wound on her stomach! How? Why? Who knows! \\n\\n\r\nThere actually is a tournament arc in the show, but just like everything else, it is terrible. Again, since this is a world full of magic, the writer could have written some very interesting fight scenes or competitions around the use of magic but all of them are just so boring and the show glosses over this arc so quickly that it feels entirely pointless. Some may argue that the true meat of this arc was, in fact, Basic's relationship with the queen and everything surrounding that, but, again, it feels so boring to watch, this is never brought up later again in the series and this scene is one of the worst cases of melodrama and bad writing I have seen in a very long time. And much of the show is forced with melodrama too, which, doesn't feel emotional since I don't care for a single one of these characters and all of these situations I've seen to much better effect somewhere else before. There is even a beach scene, thrown in just for some silly fan service, scenes that could have been used for character development and growth instead, but, nope, CLEARLY, the most important thing to do is show the audience what each girl would look like if they were in bloody swimsuits! The narrative is just so boring, predictable and unfocused that it's hard not to fall asleep whilst watching it and every single element in the story has been done elsewhere before in a better capacity. Even for Light Novels this story is generic and they use every cheap writing technique in the book to try and make you feel sorry and sympathetic for these characters when they have not been built from the ground up from victimisation, to the loss of a loved one in the past; this crap has it all! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just as bad and are essentially just all archetypes of previous anime character personality traits. Not a single one is interesting and none develop at all during the entire duration of the show; they're all stagnant. Glenn, as the main character of a light novel series, is a little bit more interesting than what I am accustomed to, however, not only in physical appearance but also in personality. He is an adult character, makes fun of people, is lazy and is just all around a twat. He doesn't get flustered when he sees girls naked (instead he actively tries to) like most light novel main guys either. Does this make his character good? No... not really. The main problem with Glenn as a character is that he is inconsistent and his back-story is both generic as hell and is very heavily underdeveloped to boot. He is made to be, at first, to be an incompetent idiot with no speciality for magic, but after episode three, he pretty much can do anything the plot demands from him because B U L L S H I T. While, at times, I did enjoy his random hijinks and ass-hole nature, I found him to be extremely boring and lacking when compared to the series Great Teacher Onozuka. The other main characters include Tsundere-chan, who begins to develop a crush on Glenn as the series goes along and GOD I wanted to smack this character in the face. She is constantly complaining, whining and nagging at every little thing and her character design, and personality has been done so much at this point, that every time I see a Tsundere character I want to slam my face into a wall. Basic Bitch, otherwise known as Rumia, is the only character with some emotional weight to her as her back-story is decently explored but is nothing to write home about. I refer to her as Basic Bitch because that is exactly what she is: basic. She acts as the good morale, angel type character which sickens me to death with how boring she is. The only other character who is given somewhat of a back-story is a character called Re-L, who assumes the deadpan loli archetype that has been done so many times up to this point, that every time she was on screen my mind sort of hazed out and lost interest straight away. While, sure, we do learn things about her character, it's, again, nothing all too great, boring and after her mini-arc is completed she is pretty much pushed to the sidelines afterwards and plays hardly any factor in the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is equally as generic, boring and underdeveloped, and it's giving me a migraine trying to refresh my memory of them. The only character who is SOMEWHAT likeable, and I stress that \"somewhat\" greatly is Celica, mainly because of her personality but this character is given so little screen time that I forgot about her entirely. When she is on screen, she is fairly interesting but is not enough to save the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall aesthetic and quality of the artwork were just fine, but the animation was just pretty lazy since they reuse the same shot of Tsundere-chan punching Glenn into the sky about twenty times, three within one episode sometimes. It's not the worst I have seen, and I do like some of the palettes as well, but it's overall just a very bland looking show. However, the character designs are some of the worst I have ever seen! While the boy's school uniform is fine and conventional, I have no clue what the hell happened to the girl's outfits. It looks like something you'd find straight out of a porno for god's sake! The skirt is about five millimetres in length, covering barely any flesh and they have these short tops, which exposes their stomachs, complete with garter belts and straps around from their skirts to their stomachs. How, in the holy mother of hell, was this allowed in a high school is way beyond me, and, as a result, it pretty much ruins every dramatic moment in the show since the uniforms are so silly, they end up distracting me from the emotional scenes. As for the music, it's perhaps the most stock and dull soundtrack I've heard in a while. Not a single one is memorable or even decently composed, and the opening and ending tracks are just generic pop music that you'll forget as soon as you listen to something else. The opening, in keeping up with the traditions set by the Gun Gale Arc from SAO, also spoils who the main villain is going to be!\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen any light novel adaptation about a group of kids with magic powers inside a high school then you've seen Akashic Records, because each one of these shows is fundamentally the exact same thing with only slight variations, and I'm done with this shit forever. Each one of these boring, insipid, shallow, vacuous light novel series can seriously just go fuck themselves for their insulting storytelling, awful characters and terrible pandering. These series are essentially the anime equivalence of the films made by Illumination Animation; they're both produced with no soul or intent at creating a piece of art or telling a story with a message that can resonate with an audience. I love both the medium of film, and the animation medium very much since they have provided some of the most heartfelt, and most impactful pieces of fiction I have seen. Film and animation can make you cry, make you laugh, they help shape you as a person, especially at a young age, and I honestly don't know where I'll be without them, for as corny as that sounds. But, these light novel adaptations offer nothing at all; no emotion, other than genuine anger and irritation, and hence, I am done forever with these boring shows. I'd rather digest cyanide than sit through another show like Hundred or Absolute Duo, and, especially Akashic Records ever again. Of course, if you like these shows, then that is completely fine. I'm glad you're able to enjoy something that I don't. After all the world would be a boring place if we all liked the exact same thing. But, to me, this show is awful in every sense of the word. It has nothing. I'd rather watch Hand Shakers on repeat than watch one of these shows ever again. Now, that's saying something...\\n",

            "content": "Highly underrated show that exeeded my expectations imo. I think some ppl need to be more open-minded. Some of the MAL reviews that quickly judge shows with a bad score just by looking at the 'genres:\u00a0Action,\u00a0Magic,\u00a0Fantasy,\u00a0School' and the 'LN adaptation' tag. Don't get me wrong, I have watched a lot of these type of light novel adaptation shows and I did not have high expectations at all when I started the show. And I was right, episode 1 was really bad, full of the usual clich\u00e9s and tropes. But if you look past that first episode, this show actually gets better exponentially. This show issurprisingly extremely entertaining, with intriguing characters. Though it still has some of the usual tropes and clich\u00e9s, there was something different about the plot and characters,  which are very welk done,  that kept me hooked throughout. It IS without a doubt one of the BETTER light novel adaptations of these past few months. The plot is not really predictable, abd characters are not shallow in the least. Actual lovable characters that are quite different from the usual clich\u00e9d ones. Great music, art and action overall. And the ending was satisfying and made me want to know more. I am honestly gonna be a little lenient and give this a 9/10 ^^  \\n\\n\r\nJust watch past episode 1 and you'll love this I think.  It's actually rare to see an okay light novel adaptation and LINDENFILMS did a great job at their second attempt. \\n\\n\r\nI HAD to write this because I felt that this show definitely deserves more positive reviews. \\n\r\nI know not everyone does this, but imo, when it comes to mindsets when going into a show, I don't think one should judge shows completely before even finishing it, or giving it a fair chance. Because that's something I did and it really made me miss out on a lot of enjoyment and ruined my experience. \\n\r\nDon't EXPECT it to be bad, give everything a chance, at least that's my philosophy.\\n\r\nThanks for reading. \\n\\n\r\n(My first review.. Might do more of this. This is fun)",

Just felt like it would be great to give you a short glimpse on this anime, since I'm that kind of person who needs to be reassured that an anime is worth watching, and that's usually by checking out trailers or reviews (mostly to see if there are any positive reviews, because I mostly watch non-popular anime). Either way, is it worth watching? Yeah, definitely. There are only 4 episodes at the moment and I will update the review once it finishes airing, but for now, jump in assoon as you can, so you keep up with the flow and don't need to do an all-nighter as I do all the time when watching anime (updates later below).\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't talk about people, yes you, who despise or dislike harem / ecchi genres. I, in particular, see no problem in watching these genres as long as it's not over the top or has actual plot. Maybe this show is a bit similar to a cliche, what is a strong MC; hides the powers; has a dark past; blah blah... But the execution itself and the kinda original spin of the cliche is what I like, because it reminds me of Konosuba, No Game No Life, Mondaiji-tachi, Gakushen Toshi Asterisk (even though it didn't have insane ratings) and such shows (ex. No Game No Life has an interesting plot to me, and it's good, further more it includes comedy, the MC doesn't strain / limit himself nor his character acting however he wishes, yet knows his abilities and thinks about them and proceeds knowing he can do this or that).  That is basically why, you should watch this show, since it reminds of those shows, yet it's original. The MC is similar to a one of NGNL / Mondaiji-tachi, yet it is original in ways, because he's not too OP, however has a lot of knowledge. The plot is growing around the place where he works, yet the story has a great flow, considering there's a lot of stuff happening and yet it all makes sense. It keeps me pumped waiting for the next episode, so I do recommend it to you.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, kawaii girls, what else do you need? \\n\r\nYou get shironeko (white cat), Rumia, the calmia and kawaiiaa (and nobleaaa, too, apparently), and a bunch of students who adore the teacher who didn't even want to work for the school in the first place (and was forced by the carelessly careful Celica. Seriously, they're close, I can tell that), but probably knows more than most of the teachers there considering the popularity he's gained.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind I have no idea what the show is like in LN, nor I have read it, because I love watching the animations rather than reading (probably due to my photogenic memory that prefers remembering animations, and not the pages), so I take no responsibility if it's worse, or whatsoever, in the LNs (I believe I've seen someone tell it's worse or better). \\n\\n\r\nShort scoring:\\n\r\n\u2022 Story - 8/10 (the flow is fine, fillers are fine, fan-service is fine, everything is preserved, nothing distracts you from the action and flow, maybe just not enough epic fights that give you those chills that I love)\\n\r\n\u2022 Art - 9/10 (it's fine, quality is truly amazing, although I disliked one moment in the episode about the quality at one part because of how the quality was sacrificed during fast-pace action in order to keep the animation smooth without letting the people to notice, however it's not possible to see it so easily so it's fine.)\\n\r\n\u2022 Sound - 10/10 (can't judge it, fine by me, I can hear even the birds, so it's goody goody for me, even objects falling have great sounds)\\n\r\n\u2022 Characters - 9/10 (don't expect much from a harem, this is a lot already because to me they seem unique in the sense of communication and their placement and such, but considering the main character, he has changed quite a lot compared to the start of the show)\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment - 10/10 (seriously, it's fun, it kept me watching, I liked it, and I wait for the next eps. same as for when Konosuba 1/2 aired)\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall - 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nUPDATE\\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nUPDATE\\n\\n\r\nIt's been a long time since I updated this review. I want you to know that it's really worth watching. I myself love when there's romance in anime, however I prefer it preserved. In this particular one, well it's a typical harem, except that the teacher doesn't actually let it to be a harem, he actually represents a teacher as the anime gets going, even though careless he would seem, he's a mastermind. \\n\r\nNo idea how about you, but I loved the ending. I had various ships throughout the anime, and I couldn't really decide. I myself like romance, but I really don't even mind if it's not there as long as the author doesn't tease me to nerves. I loved it, I personally was amazingly satisfied by the ending and what was the last conversation of the whole pinnacle. I wished to see more and to see the romance develop, but on the other hand I guess it would push out the action and mystery out of it then, unless it's kept to minimal. \\n\r\nI recommend you to watch it, no matter if the start or some parts feel like bore or unacceptable to you, I have no problem with harems and ecchi genres, and I fully advise you to watch this. It is completely not over the top and I ensure you will have both great time, and be satisfied. It has action, comedy and mystery in it, at least for me. I'm pretty sure it's a good one this year.\\n\r\nWhat are you doing?\\n\r\nStart watching, you bakaaaa!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCheers, enjoy!\\n\r\nPatrick",

            "content": "\"If the best thing I can say about your show is that the girls are hot, then your show is terrible!\" -some lazy jackass\r\n*Spoilers for Akashic Records*\r\nBefore I start the review proper, or rather, this dissertation about why this show is a generic and irritating fraud that actually manages to squander any potential it had for some lazy comedy and infuriating LN bullshit clich\u00e9s, I have two things I feel I must notify you of. First, a decent chunk of this review will be spent analyzing the ideas this series had and how with some major and minor tweaks, the series could've been better, atleast from a storytelling perspective. Secondly, I'm about to let out something I have to get out of my chest because while this insufferable mentality I\u2019m about to describe isn't truly widespread, I've still seen it a handful of times, and quite frankly, it's sickening. People who have this upcoming mentality infuriate me with their ignorance and sheer vindictiveness.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nIf a title is almost nothing but recycled content from shows prior, then to me at least, it has no excuse and little reason to both exist and be defended as a work of fiction. It seems like creativity isn't as valued as it should be and this has been a problem in every industry at almost every point in history for one reason or another. With the anime in the 80's/90's, it was schlock bloodbath OVAs and nowadays in anime, it's Light Novel School Battle and/or Harem anime. Titles that largely or even entirely fit these descriptions can still break the mold and achieve something greater.\\n\\n\r\nWe do not have some \"mythical, absurdly high, nigh-unachievable standard\" these assholes keep accusing us of having! I'm sick of ignorant pricks assuming that we do! We just want anime to actually have a sense of life, a sense of passion, and a reason to exist outside of making corporate money from people who have loved tons of shows borderline identical to what they're currently watching and fapping to. Even among school battle (usually harem) anime, there are some that go above and beyond, like the aforementioned Chivalry of a Failed Knight. In fact, even among the standards if these \"copy-paste\" anime, some manage to really sink below to almost creative levels of suck, like The Irregular at Magic High School, as if to prove that there is a standard to hold titles like this by and that even this kind of anime has its own hierarchy like all the rest.\\n\\n\r\nIn summation, we do not all have some absurd standard for anime, we just want these kinds of titles to die out (or rather to not be as widespread, which in fairness, is already happening somewhat over the past year) so that anime that actually have passion and creativity can more easily flourish, and even by the standards of the now incessant LN school battle harem anime, some can go beyond the expectations or fail to even meet such bottom of the barrel standards. If you enjoy these titles, that's fine, just at least have some standards regarding these things since not all of them are of equal quality and the ones with the least amount of effort put into making them worthwhile works of fiction do not deserve to be defended, at least to me. Again, like them if you want, just don't accuse us of bad standards or incorrect views since we dissented from your \"it's done before but that's fine because I like it\" viewpoint. Before we start, let me state that this mentality pisses me off about as bad as this show did, hence why my tone will sound insanely aggressive throughout, since, well, this show was offensively bad. Leave now if you're not ok with kind of atmosphere and tone, and/or if you're not ok with me bashing the show (assuming you didn't leave by that point since I'm showing it absolutely no mercy). With that tirade out of the way, let's start the review proper.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nMixing Konosuba humor and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is like mixing a liter of ghost pepper juice and white paint. You know, shit like this is why I invested in a tomato farm. Wait, I'm sorry, was that joke not predictable enough for you? My bad, let me try again: Ahem, \u201cThis show is cancer.\u201d Actually, my previous joke was funnier than both this one and every single joke here in this godforsaken show. Let me grab those tomatoes now.\\n\\n\r\nAkashic Records. For some reason, people thought this was actually funny and \u201ctotally not exactly like all of the other trash we hate because it has more comedy in its trashiest scenarios than those others shows that do the exact same thing but with a permanently straight face.\u201d This show isn't funny; it's predictable. It has no semblance of tact or actual self-awareness on how awful its writing and gaudy cheese-fest self-justification for subsequent action exposition dumps that last up to a minute are. You people call SAO terrible? At least it has more tact and worthwhile humor than this show ever did, as well as more originality, better music, a much more tolerable color pallet. Even with its bad pacing, at least it never showed off early events that feel like they should be coming in much later than they should, or give flashbacks to equally terrible and popular shows with specific plot points. This show thinks it can get away with being the trashiest LN garbage ever as long as it adds \u201churr-de-durr\u201d to everything and adding a funny face just to really make it even more obvious than it is. It thinks it's the Konosuba of school battle harem trash; it's not. It takes itself just as seriously for most part, so that doesn't work. Hell, it's even worse since those shows take horrible scenarios like attempted rape seriously when presenting them. This show doesn't. But enough rambling; what makes Akashic Records so awful to the point where I actually believe that The Asterisk War is a much better show than it? Well, let\u2019s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s address the elephant in the room before we really rip into the logic of this show: the female school uniforms. You know, I think it should be the woman\u2019s choice as to whether or not she\u2019ll be so scantily clad that not only are her midriffs and things exposed, but that she also has suspenders at the thighs and waist to make sure that two-piece outfit doesn't fall apart, not something that a school, let alone an \u201cesteemed private academy\u201d such as this one, should mandate. This kind of uniform that would make any real school principal revile in horror is, while sexy and appealing, downright disgusting in the fact that a school mandates women wear that as their official uniform. I get that this is a trash anime, but no successful school in their right mind would pull such a stunt without raising absolute hellfire from parents, true gentlemen, feminists, other schools and districts, and SJWs across the nation, especially when this show\u2019s one obviously hot and fanservicey character is more decently clad than the high school students (aka, generic archetype bitches) that are forced to wear this. I mean, the men wear regal and classy suits befitting of gentlemen (even Glenn wears something of decent clothing, and he\u2019s the lazy asshole pervert), so wouldn't it make sense to have the ladies wear something even more regal and classy, like Celica, the obviously hot fanservice character? You wouldn't believe how badly that made me lose hope in any logic found in the story. I mean, I am a teenage, straight male, and I like hot women like the rest of my kind, hell, I can ogle at Celica all day, but this is just ridiculous!Now, to everything else.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the series doesn't really have major plot holes, even despite a few minor ones (nor all of which I'll cover), but it does have many leaps in logic for the characters, bad pacing, and it manages to portray certain scenes horrendously. But there are decent moments, like the rare joke that hits, occasional (if not successful due to poor pacing) attempts at emotional scenes, and the scene where Glenn goes Grammar Nazi on students to show just how convoluted magic can really be. I'll start by going rapid fire on a few dumb things from episodes 1 and 2. Still, prepare to be here a while, the story segment takes up a vast majority of the review since there is a lot I need to say here.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does Celica threaten Glenn to get him to work at this school despite knowing that he is beyond unqualified and that he hates magic? Is it because she just wants him to get a job and if he a deadbeat regardless of whether or not he is remotely qualified, because if so, that's stupid (since she needs to make sure he is at least remotely qualified for his job). The series checks out one important trite bullshit (aka bad clich\u00e9) from the list really early with a scene where the flatter student (Sistine) helped the big-tits student (Rumia), but here, it's portrayed in such a sexual manner to the point where in other series, they are still sexual harassment despite teasing, this is easily a more blatantly disgusting and uncomfortable act of sexual harassment that sent out of its way to be as horrid as possible (partially since it made me hate the Sistine, one of the main characters, by the first episode, the episode where we are supposed to be sold on these characters). \\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of episode 2 felt like it should've been stretched out over multiple episodes given how here is a small time skip in the middle of episode 2 after Glenn reaches the importance of grammar in changing magic, and how much is packed into this episode story-wise. In order of appearance: Glenn starts the episode same as before, he goes so far into dissing magic that Sistine slaps him and leaves in tears, each character has an emotional moment before Glenn realizes how little students truly know about magic besides one particular method for each spell, he schools them, then his students like him, he has then made progress and is now infinitely more passionate about work, we go back and reaffirm that there is a moment in which Rumia was saved by presumably Glenn (we even see the hair color, and in episode 1, she looks familiar to him, but this isn't spaced or enough to feel organic or that it would take a little while for us to really explore this point without coming up with the answer so early into the show), and then terrorists. All of this should've been episodes 3, 4, and even 5. I mean it. We could've just done the same shenanigans and have episode 2 end on the moment where Sistine slaps Glenn and walks off in tears, then episode 3 have an emotional episode that shows us another side of our (at the time) 3 important characters while showing us that terrorists are soon to some before at the end, he busts out some knowledge on the students, then episode 4 not only shows us how much all of this is working out while at the same time showing us that he is actually becoming happier overall while doing this, but then the episode brings us back to that moment where we see him and Rumia interact before we learn that she was saved by someone who looks suspiciously like Glenn, and then it ends on terrorists moving in. Episodes 5 and 6 would be a bunch of terrorists raising hell in the school and then Glenn, and all students and teachers fight back in a mini war arc, by editing the final few minutes of episode 2 where terrorists show up and turning that into episode 5, and editing some of the intrusive comedy of episode 3 and making it episode 6.. There, I just vastly improved the show just by taking episode 2 stretching it out, and adding and editing parts as I went along,like making episode 3 episode 6. If only the writer was this capable.\\n\\n\r\nThe moment that made this show awful beyond redemption was the attempted rape scene. Let me set the scene. Terrorists have just captured Rumia who turned out to be a former princess but her family was killed and she escaped (hence why she said she was saved by someone before terrorists would've killed her). Sistine is alone in a room, and a terrorist walks in. He then begins to toy with her, saying that people like her are surprisingly and deliciously fragile while pinning her down and slowly undressing her. Then, Glenn walks in and it turns from trite to actively offensively terrible. In the midst of a scene of attempted rape, Glenn walks in, pays no mind, and lackadaisical comedy ensues for like 40 seconds! WHAT THE FLYING FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!?! A character is in the verge of getting rape, and the supposed \u201chero\u201d who busts in not only doesn't recognize the situation, but acts all lazy! Needless to say, this moment made this show practically impossible to redeem. When SAO can treat this kind of scene with infinitely more tact than this show can, in regards to content and tone, you know we have a problem here! Sure, eventually Glenn saves her, but then we get the rest of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nGlenn busts out this arcana card which nullifies all magic (especially opponents\u2019 and enemies\u201d magic). This is a very generic magic for an MC to have, and it's giving me Mahouka flashbacks as if the school terrorism thing didn't do that already. Glenn just busts out an arcana card unceremoniously and explains what it does in his usual lackadaisical tone (tired of me using that word yet?). This is the first time we see this kind of magic card in the series, adding to the already surpassingly convoluted magic system of this world, so at least the show could do is unveil it with grandeur. Even Mahouka did that right! Whatever, a badly animated curb stomp commences in which Glenn wins, and episode 2 ends. As you can no doubt tell, the rape attempt scene should've never happened and in my version above, it never would.\\n\\n\r\nActually, there are a few things in episode 3 I would alter, since it's not a great episode either (I mean, what did you expect from this show). I think the worst thing this episode does is prove that this crock of shit had potential, potential that it, predictably, squandered. I mean, Glenn was a mate killer, so that could've been explored and built up a bit better since before then, the only buildup was him saying magic kills people. In this episode, I would edit out the numerous and always monotonous self-justification for what someone is about to do exposition dumps there always last for around 30 seconds, some of the intrusive comedy of the first 6 minutes, and do one last crucial thing in the last few minutes of the episode. Remember how Professor Huey apparently left (hence why they have a sub) prior to the events of episode 1? Well, here he is again, but has no exposed motivations for being here, and he just stands there, saying that it's a game to see if Glenn can free Rumia from a bunch of magic circles, so, none of that makes any real sense. He needs a reason for doing this, and why he is treating this like a game. Also, at the end, they completely gloss over what Rumia\u2019s true name as princess was Eruminia, and I don't know why. This also confirms that yes, Glenn was the one that unknowingly saved her. It's a shame that one of the most potentially interesting hook questions about the series was dealt with only 3 episodes in out of 12.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to go or if my way to really break down the rest of the episodes since that would take fucking forever and I'm already spending a lot of time doing rapid fire on a few problems per episode while fixing the series as a whole. But now, we reach the tournament arc, starting with episode 4, so time for me to keep doing what I've been doing. The queen is still the mother of Rumia but apparently everyone was killed but her. Why did she pronounce her daughter dead after the terrorists came? What actually happened? Did terrorists simply kidnap her from everyone? Has the school heard nothing about the Queen? What about the dad/king? \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing is that we are suddenly introduced to what all of the students can do during the beginning of this tournament arc via a pep talk from Glenn. Want to know how to have made this moment work. Have it so that when the terrorists showed up, they all do what we would hear them being capable of, that what this moment would be actually gratifying since by then we would've known a bit about all the students and then have epic realization that Glenn was exactly right since that what they did in that hypothetical. This has been another round of me improving the series. In fact, the actual tournament section in episode 4 could've been 2, maybe even 3 whole episodes in order to make an interesting tournament arc up until the next episode (specifically, 7-9 on my version), since there are so many games that are glossed over since most students are not important. Hell, even before that, we saw a typical asshole vs underdog rivalry set up with Harley and his class vs Glenn and his, and then it would be gratifying and exciting to see both groups compete and Glenn\u2019s class do well on each of these events. This has been another round of me making a better series out of the pieces this one failed to put together. Also, the asspull of Rumia winning her round because the big buff guy suddenly blacked out for no reason was infuriating, and the fact that it came after a rushed and stupid bit of her teammates telling her to quit since they \u201ccare for her\u201d despite her being in no peril and her wanting to do this, is especially galling. When both The Asterisk War and Fairy Tail can make a better tournament arc, then your arc is shit, and by extension, you're shit!\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 5 and 6, barring a few really dumb moments (as per usual), are probably the best in the series, as little as that says about them. The comedy is still pretty miss for me but not only are there a few genuinely sweet moments like Glenn\u2019s conversation with Rumia I episode 5 and her true reunion with her mother at the end of episode 6, but also, the way Glenn defeats the villain of this arc is actually pretty intelligent and entertaining, reminding me of some of the most popular protagonists in anime like Lelouch from Code Geass, Light from Death Note, and Sora from No Game No Life. Still, time to fix \u2018em. I'll give this series a compliment when it deserves one; it's already like...96:0 in problems (and you get a cookie if you get where that reference came from). The way to make it better this time is simple, and it builds from the last fixing I did: actually juggle the rescue attempt and the tournament matches equally and flesh them both out, that way we have all of the emotional payoffs actually pay off (at least if you give each scene enough space), and so that we can actually enjoy the tournament side of the arc, and have that whole thing from episodes 5 and 6 take up 3 more episodes (10-12 in my version) while removing some of the fake out comedy, taking away the explosion speeches about \u201cme saying why I'm doing what I'm doing\u201d, removing the dere moments Sistine has with her teacher (I get that he is 19 but still it's sorta creepy for a student to have a hunted romantic interest in her teacher) and altering the ending where the students spend all his money to him actually treating them with some of his money, that way nothing about any of the arcs each character went through get cheapened upon rewatch and hindsight (namely Glenn\u2019s). Also, have more animation in the arc since this series doesn't really have much actual character animation. \\n\\n\r\nSee? It's simple. If we create a brand new episode 1 from scratch to replace this episode 1 and take all of the ideas I brought up that modify these episodes, we could've had an actually good series on our hands since despite all of the LN trope bullshit, awful comedy moments that ruin certain scenes, and a few other things, all the pieces were there for the first 6 episodes to be a good 1 cour series. The other 6 on the other hand...yeah, I haven't been really living up to my promise of tone, and these episodes are gonna change that; they are that bad...\\n\\n\r\n*sigh* Episode 7 is where things go back to being abysmal instead of just bad, partially due to almost half of it being a clich\u00e9 beach episode and the irritating comedy, partially due to the character Re=L (make your Ergo Proxy joke elsewhere). She is such a bad character, and it is the impetus of the arc and why it's horrible. Her heel turn is insanely telegraphed and still incredibly forced, being out of jealously in episode 7 about the fact that the deuteragonist females are quote unquote \u201cstealing Glenn away from her\u201d, and because she is just a double agent who likes her dead brother who she saw again (which means he was revived, which is a major plot point in the arc, revival) in episode 8, while the rest of episode 8 before that is just the introduction of revival, one of the villains of the previous arc showing up and being a crazy bitch, and Re=L moving around and being an insufferable bitch. Fuck this arc in its entirety. Oh, and she nearly kills Glenn because of this and badly injures Rumia. When you consider that up to this point, she had been trying to kill Glenn (or at least she attacks him as greeting and always wants to settle a score with him) and the fact that she genuinely talked of the fact that she had a lot of fun with the people she immediately afterwards hated) and the fact that she had just been a generic deadpan loli character, this sudden turn is infuriatingly stupid and forced. The 9th episode is just as bad honestly, and they rushed the shit out of a villain death and the backstory Re=L has can't redeem her in the slightest. Also, the main blue-haired villain of the arc was wasted in the fact that there is a malicious character named Reiner, but this guy was just some random who wasn't connected with anything and is just a \u201cbad person who does bad things because villain\u201d character. I literally have no way to really remotely fix this arc; it was dead on arrival.\\n\\n\r\nBut now, we finally reach the final arc. It is one of the stupidest story arcs I have ever seen in my life, if not the absolute dumbest and most wince-worthy of them all. Here is the main plot of arc 4: Some creepy teacher guy continually confesses to Sistine and after Glenn overheard him dissing her dream, he puts on this front about wanting to marry her for money, and it all becomes a pissing match, except between teachers over a student. Fucking creepy! It's beyond stupid a premise given the age ranges (adult and teenager), and given how this is the impetus on having another evil protagonist bent on using Rumia for some scheme, you'd think this wouldn't exist and that they'd find a less disgusting way for this to happen. The sub plot is about Glenn suddenly realizing that Sistine looks like Sera, a now dead girl he once loved before he left the Imperial Corps, and that now angel dusts addicts (I wish they meant the real life Angel Dust drug) are dying, even a year after that substance was said to have been eradicated. All of these have no right of intertwining with the main (disgusting and wince-worthy) plot of the arc. Also, Re=L is off scot free after the betrayal (did she not ever get arrested for treason for that whole thing in the previous arc?), just to add on to what an irredeemable crock of shit this final arc is! Then, the finale. Oh boy. It's probably the most generic episode in the entire show. Turns of there was another traitor that posed as Leo's after he killed him part-way into episode 11, and the only thing resolved is the immediately inserted grudge match between the two. I don't even have the energy to go into any depth with this one, it's just generic and bleh, as if the show is not even trying to hide it's true colors anymore. Serves it right.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, if the narrative wasn't so shit in the way that it was, Glenn might have been an actually good character. Think about it: a cynic gave up his pursuit of being a hero of justice after the lives he took and lost now teaches the very thing he hates against his will while growing attached to his students despite everything. Despite what a radical shift in personality he has from past to present, if the writing did how I laid out above, he could've been a pretty good character, assuming they toned down the perviness completely and just made him cynical and partially lazy instead of basically a cross of Archer from UBW and Kazuma from Konosuba. I also like how he is an LN protagonist who isn't very overpowered, but that's not enough to save him from this awful writing. Celica is a hot and haughty woman who is basically never capable of being there since she\u2019s so overpowered that the narrative wouldn't throw a challenge unless they restrain her or just keep her or entirely beforehand. What I like about her is some of her almost motherly nature towards Glenn, like how she threatens Harvey for dissing him in her presence, even if the whole blackmail job thing was nonsense. Now, for the actual named side-characters with relevance outside of just one arc since I'm not even gonna cover the antagonists (partially since I kinda already did in as much detail as they deserve, barring one who I'll get to), nor will I cover small characters like the queen mother or the annoying parents of Sistine.\\n\\n\r\nSistine is a nightmare for her archetype. She aggressively checks out all of the boxes of a bad and clich\u00e9 tsundere and does it in a way that makes her especially obnoxious. The fact that she has this dynamic with a teacher makes me even more grossed out (regardless of both the nonsensical age dynamic and partially because nothing about this is brought up). She's also absurdly useless, to the point that this is a legitimate plot point that carries throughout each arc until she finally does one thing right in the finale. Rumia is basically a typical dere-dere of the group who is basically the MacGuffin for all of the arcs in this show. I've already talked about why Re=L is such a shit character so I'll cover one more: Albert. He\u2019s the stoic badass of the bunch whose hunch is always right, so there\u2019s not much to say on him. Lastly, why don't we talk about Leos? He is such a shitty character. He apparently had been asking Sistine our since they were kids and not only has he not let go of that, he has gone pathetic over it despite coming off as a decent person (typical of this trope), but again, the whole teacher and student bit makes it worse, and the fact that ha managed to spend only a paltry evening to be able to decipher everything about Glenn, Re=L, and Rumia is absurd, though it turns out it was this Justine guy from episode 11 who is just another evil LN bad guy for LN bad guy sake villain, since literally every single antagonist in this show is the exact same. They turned a crap and generic character into something creepier and stupider and then replaced him with the exact same character as every other villain in this retarded ass show; how typical! So yeah, that's everyone relevant. What a shit cast, am I right? As if the wasted potential as generic characters weren't bad enough, they reuse the same bad guy personality and have some truly horrible characters thrown into the mix. Let\u2019s move on before I die of embarrassment.\\n\\n\r\nThe audiovisuals aren't much better than the writing, unfortunately. Part of the problem this time isn't that the show is badly animated per se, but that its animation insanely limited. Its own damn OP has about as much animation as a typical episode of this show, and there are plenty of reused clips, like the clip of Albert pulling Re=L\u2019s hair or Sistine blasting Glenn with wind, and the slew of reused clips are reused at an insane rate with no remote variation. Hell, even the fight scenes have little animation, especially the one in episode 2 when Glenn beats up the attempted rapist. I initially couldn't stand the color palette but I got used to it. I already mentioned how awful the uniforms are so no need to repeat that. There is minimal (albeit terribly some CGI though it's blink and you miss it), but did there also have to be minimal animation too? Oh well, at least I like the eyes (they remind me of the trademark Studio White Fox eyes) and some of the admittedly humorous facial expressions. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP, \"Blow out\" by Konomi Suzuki is a pretty generic (if somewhat catchy) OP that feels like it should be part of a generic fantasy adventure anime, not a generic school battle anime with fantasy elements thrown in there. The ED, \"Precious You\u2606\" by Sistine Fibel (Akane Fujita), Rumia Tingel (Yume Miyamoto), Re=L Rayford (Ari Ozawa) is absurdly MediocRE that I never bothered listening to the entire minute and thirty second ED. The OST is decent in its own right but honestly feels misplaced here in the same vein as the OP in terms of where it feels more suitable, even despite the darker tone the series boasts on about half of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is probably one of the worst dubs Funimation has produced in recent memory. Next to none of the voices even remotely fit the characters and sound like they'd fit completely different sounding roles, like Monica Rial as Rumia and Josh Grelle as Glenn, but the absolute worst offender here is Sistine, played by Rachael Messer, whose acting not only sounds miscast, but at times, bad in its own right. The tertiaries and antagonist roles aren't good either, and some of them were doomed to be inferior (like Re=L since it's much harder for a dub to pull off a loli voice), and the only voice I sort of see working is Morgan Garrett as Celica. Then again, dubs have been getting worse in recent years, so I guess this is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I hate this show. I hate it so damn much. I only found one joke funny since it was the only one that wasn't predictable as shit, and that was in the very first episode. Any potential the story or characters had ended up being squandered rather quickly, which is frustrating since the first 6 episodes could've actually been pretty good had they removed the bullshit elements and made it a 12 episode series that fleshed these episodes out, though the last 6 are beyond terrible and impossible to redeem. Then again, the show lost any path to actual redemption during the rape attempt scene where they treat it with so little tact that there is comedy in the already drawn out scene. The lack of animation made the fights pretty dull as well, and a lot of the characters, namely Sistine and Re=L were infuriating to no end. There are times when a show offends me with how terrible it is, but when it happens more than once, let alone up to 5 times, that's when we know that the show is dogshit and that I'm in for a terrible experience. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I wasn't aggravated to some degree, whether it be mild or insane, I was pretty bored since the action was mediocre and the comedy didn't stick with me at all, and a lot of the awful LN school battle harem tropes are here in full display, sometimes taken to the most disgusting degrees possible to the point where I almost wanted to vomit. Also, the final arc is one of the most wince-worthy pieces of animation I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing as if arc 3 didn't piss me off enough to the point where the show went back from being bad but salvageable to irredeemable and truly abysmal again. Shame really, since the second arc was actually somewhat enjoyable at times and has the most potential to be good. So yeah, I'm basically repeating myself at this point so let\u2019s just move on to the final thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, it's almost cute to know that this show thinks it can get away with being typical trash that gives LNs a bad name just by adding more comedy, disgusting elements, and an occasionally bleak tone and more blood. It pretends to not be exactly like its brethren but does all of the same awful things you'd expect a show like this to do, only with a tinge of extra putridness. When there's a good idea, it's gleefully ruined, and the comedy is more predictable than a generic shounen anime. I've already spoken ad nauseam about basically everything wrong with the show and I'm basically repeating myself, but yeah, suffice it to say, this is one of the worst anime I've seen all year. Hopefully, this is a lesson to all of you that even among shows like this, there are still standards that some of them can meet and surpass their contemporaries, and that we don't just have absurd standards that only value high art. Also, hopefully you realize why this show is such a trap that you shouldn't fall for. This show scores disgustingly low compared to its peers. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "I love Akashic Records of Bastard Magical Instructor.  Sure, it isn't a totally unique anime by any means, but I still believe that something doesn't have to be unique to be great.  Especially since almost everything can be average or close to it if everyone broke down every show to a simpler form.  I'm sure even acclaimed works can be average if you approach them with a mind set of breaking the story into simpler aspects.  Well, before I start rambling too much, I love Akashic Records.  I'm not sure if this or Re:Creators takes my top spot for theseason, but either way, they are my top 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't the most unique, but it was really fun to watch.  It's suppose to be that Sisitine discovering some of the mysteries about the floating sky castle,  or at least it sounded that way at first;  I realize after reading the description again  that what I assumed was never the case and I just misread it.  So, it's actually more of what you would expect from a magic school anime, with some unique parts mixed in together.  The students favorite teacher leaves and is replaced by Glenn Radars, a very lazy and sarcastic professor, yet capable at the same time.  He doesn't show his skills at first though and he actually beaten by Sistine when they dual in the first episode, I believe it was.  His students realize they don't know nearly as much as they think they do, once Glenn starts teaching them all the ways to alter a simple shock bolt spell that they never knew was possible.   Pretty quickly, dark forces/ people lurking within the empire they live start showing up Glenn, Sistine, Rumia, and the others start being caught in all these traps as they arise.  Rumia is the damsel in distress many times, but it's more due to her past than just being a pretty girl people capture in order to use for stupid reason;  it's not completely ok that her abilities and past lead to her having that role, but it seemed to serve more of a purpose than just we need a girl captured type of thing, to me anyway.   As Glenn's past, Rumia's, even a little bit of Sistine's, all get revealed, the story just got more and more interesting.  It will probably feel like a dull story if you're not more than an average/ are a below average fan of magic battle shows.  In addition to these elements,  I'd also say it's like a story of growth between Glenn and his students.  His students bring out his better side and vice versa.  There's also a ton of funny moments through the plot and you just need a good comedy sometimes.  I'll give a 9/10 here, but I'm also a huge fan of magic battle shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is probably the most controversial part of the anime.  I love the character designs, detailed background scenes, detailed magic circles and move displays, etc.  The animation was actually really fluid too for the most part with some pauses and re-start ups, but that could've just been due to my computer and the settings I had up on crunchyroll.  I personally find the designs to be extremely memorable.  The weird school outfits (the controversial part) definitely help with this.  I'll admit they are weird, but they do help the character designs stand out.  Another personal 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is rather great too.  The music scores just felt like they had a slightly different tune to them than other magic battle scores.  The same goes for the opening and ending themes.  They may seem typical, but I'd say that they sound different and actually stand out as great songs.  I consider them among some of the better ones I've heard and each of them is pretty high up on my favorites.  I'll give the sound a 9.5/10 since both theme songs are among the best ones of the genre, in my book.  Precious You is my favorite ending theme of the spring 2017 season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are more of the love them or hate them kind of group, or at the like them or don't like them kind.  I don't see there being many in between opinions.  Glenn may be there to almost always save the day, but he sure as hell doesn't feel like a self insert.  I don't think a self-insert would be so snarky, lazy, have a dark past, and mess around as much as he does.  His personality just doesn't fit the self insert criteria to me, and he's a great protagonist, in my book.  Sisitine is a tsundere, but she doesn't seem like the typical one that acts out all the time and tried really hard to hide their feelings for most of the show.  She does act out in the beginning, but she's grows more accepting of Glenn and lets her guard down a bit earlier than many tsunderes do.  She also has a pretty strong sense of responsible and the will to fulfill her dream without taking drastic measures to do so.  I'd rather just leave my thought focused on the main two, and let the readers see the others for themselves.  I found something to like and or love about every character in the series, especially Glenn and Sisitine.  I'll give another personal 9.  \\n\\n\r\nI'll make my thought on my enjoyment very short.  I loved every minute of the anime and actually find some of it's weird aspects that are considered stupid and appalling by others to be parts of the show that make it stand out and put it at a high place among shows in the genre.  I'm giving a 10 here.  I'm also sorry that my review doesn't seem convincing, but I'd rather write it more for people who like the genre and are only a little hesitant to watch it rather than  to convince people who generally don't like these types of shows.  I hope it's of at least help.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rokudenashi is an unfortunate case of \"what could have been\".\r\nI'll try to keep this relatively concise and straight-to-the-point: Rokudenashi had the potential to be a modern version of Great Teacher Onizuka. While it has an overused magic academy premise, unlike most battle harems, the protagonist here is actually the teacher of one of its classes, and he is also a huge troll. Just like Onizuka, Glenn Radars is largely incompetent at normal teacher duties, preferring to let his students have self-study sessions all the time instead of having to put any effort in. However, he also has a lot of talent in other areas, especiallyconcerning unorthodox magic usage. What Glenn lacks inside the classroom he makes up outside of it, and his trollish interactions with his students is the main selling point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the first episode or two of Rokudenashi are very funny and entertaining, and show a lot of promise for the show as a whole. But unfortunately, from there on out it slowly starts to decline. Starting in episode three, the anime starts introducing actual outside villains and a much more serious story starts taking over as the main focus of the show instead of the previously light-hearted comedy theme. And sadly this is a big loss, because the majority of the show ended up becoming a rather generic action/fantasy light novel adaptation mixed with some drama as a result, featuring a somewhat overpowered MC and his sidekick heroines fighting a bunch of cheap bad guys with some rather uninteresting ulterior motives. In other words, the kind of anime you've seen dozens of times over already. It's not terrible but it's just extremely average when it's doing this, and considering how promising the show seemed to be at first, it feels like such a huge waste of potential. Sure, the magic system in this universe is pretty interesting and well-designed, but that doesn't actually end up amounting for much when the overall plot itself is so uninspiring.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that is still pretty good about Rokudenashi in the end though is the character cast. As mentioned already, Glenn is a pretty huge troll on top of being a good magic duelist, and overall he is a pretty likable protagonist, especially by harem MC standards. And yes I do think Rokudenashi should be called a harem even if it isn't currently labeled as one on MAL; while there aren't any public romantic themes, the vast majority of the supporting cast is female and it's pretty clear that most of them are very attached to Glenn. This is especially clear in the case of Fibel Sistine, who I guess would have to be considered the main heroine if you have to pick one, and who is also a skilled and clever magician, albeit a bit na\u00efve and dishonest at times, and she's also extremely pretty if you ask me. Her verbal arguments with Glenn are always a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Rokudenashi is still a pretty decent anime with generally likable characters and good chemistry in-between them, but it's also unfortunately dragged down quite a bit by its bland and generic storyline. It's hard to not be bothered by the feeling that it could have been so much better still had it just gone down a different direction plot-wise. But compared to most magic academy battle harems out there, this is still probably one of the better ones all things considered, even though I doubt I'd go out of my way to actively recommend it to people in the future. Though if you don't care too much about the story and you just want to see a fun and intelligent protagonist goofing around with a bunch of cute and likable girls then you'll be hard-pressed to find anything better.\\n\\n\r\nOh and by the way, Rokudenashi probably has the best female school uniforms I've ever seen in anime. Say what you want about the show itself, but hot damn those exposed bellies, miniskirts and garter belts are sexy as hell. A+ clothing design; top tier fanservice at its finest.",

It's supposed to be subjective. not objective, so it's highly possible, that you will not agree with things that I wrote.\r\nIntroduction:\r\nI was really amazed after watching first episode, I thought that it would be one of the better shows at the moment, however episode by episode I was getting more and more disappointed.\r\nStory:\r\nFirst episode really hyped me about the serie, even though I do not like anime with fanservice elements this seemed to be decent one.\\n\r\nI got everything I could imagine, story as well. It looked like atleast avarage script: main storyline, a piece of mystery and unknown history of the characters.\\n\r\nIn the next episode I was feeling really sad about the development, the point of mystery has been revealed very fast - didn't have time to try and solve it by myself, storyline got worse - nothing more surprised me, new threads that has been introduced had less and less sense, it got dumber and some situations happened out of blue, without any backgrounds just appeared on the stage like a block of ice on a desert.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI can't say anything special about the art, it was nice, not bad. Just like one of those generic shows that are airied to just exist, without further purpose. I didn't pay big attention to details, but the art didn't delight me and didn't disappoint as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere weren't any tracks that would caught my curiousity, opening music seems mediacore to me as well. For me it's one of those shows that the only purpose is to watch and forgot after a week. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIt's one of those things that made me really sad about the whole.\\n\r\nAt the beggining we get a few characters that could be developed great...\\n\r\nBut they aren't.\\n\r\nAfter the second or thrid episode we realize that the main character is one of those pseudo badass characters, who is legitimately OP, everything that he's doing ends good, there is no bad ending for his actions.\\n\r\nAnother character is a grey haired (for the next few lines there might be a minor spoiler) tsundere girl, aka notice me pedophile senpai, the thing is that the senpai is not a pedophile.\\n\r\nSo yeah, she is just another \"person\", that is supposed to be a part of the background and support to main character, wasted opportunity to make this show better.\\n\r\nBlonde girl is pretty similar to previous one, just a character that needs a protection and needs being supervised by the hero 24/7. Nothing much to tell about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFirst episode really caught my attention and curiousity, however any further made me want to turn of the show and drop it as soon as possible.\\n\r\nJust another generic show that doesn't give me any joy at all, because of earlier overused jokes and clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR | Summary\\n\r\nFirst episode seemed to be great, the rest were generic poop.\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nPersonally, basing on my own feelings I would give this show 1/10, but on the other hand thanks to an avarage art and sound I'm giving it 3/10.",

            "content": "Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is your typical clich\u00e9 harem anime, with bits of comedy, action, magic, and of course high-school girls. Now,  bashing this anime for that would be very illogical, since the target audience is not the people that look for a good storyline, it's not the people that look for a lot of character development, and it's not the people that want to decode an anime in every single aspect. Therefore judging it on these factors does not make sense, so I will judge it based on it's intended audience, and based on the overall delivery. \r\nThis anime is forpeople that want to enjoy a bit of clich\u00e9, it is for the people that don't mind the slightly erotic schoolgirl uniforms and it is for the people that enjoy a bit of magical action thrown into the mix. Now don't get me wrong, it's not all fanservice, there is a plotline, there is some character development, but nothing that hasn't been done before, and like previously mentioned, these factors are irrelevant, due to the intended audience of this anime. The characters are likable, the MC is fairly unique in many aspects, with some character development, and decent backstory. We do explore a bit about the backgrounds of some of the students of the magic academy, and the characters that were previously associated with the MC, but obviously with there being only 12 episodes, you can't expect those to be very thorough or go into a lot of depth. The art is average, it is nothing that differentiates itself from the other anime, therefore it is not something I want to write about. The sound and music do help the story portray the different themes, and it does help the viewer understand the mood and the situation, although again, I'd say it's average.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I have enjoyed this anime for what it is, I think it has delivered what it aimed to deliver to it's intended audience, and in my opinion, it is a great anime to watch if you're looking for something to kill the time with. It also did well on keeping me intrigued, even though it's fairly predictable at times, at no point did I feel like not wanting to watch the next episode, probably due to the attachment I had to the characters, and the contrasting, complex character of Glenn's, the fact that he is not at all portrayed as a strong MC, and his creative solutions when it comes to problem-solving. So, I think if you do have some spare time, and you're looking for an anime that just wants to make you cheer up, laugh, and enjoy yourself, then do give Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, and personally, I would rate this anime as 7/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "In a world where students wear stripper-like uniforms:\r\nOne man--- a \u201cbastard\u201d of a teacher--- is called upon by a powerful and beautiful mage to teach those young stripper students the fundamentals of magic theory. ---Although in reality the powerful mage was just trying to get his lazy, isolated, moochingass out of the house. \r\nThus, the story begins\u2026\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAt first the main character, Glen Radars, appears to be a generic all-powerful MC at first, BUT WAIT! Is he really...? This anime has a knack for throwing in (kind of) unexpected plot twists for comedic purposes. Glen Radars has more depth to him than meets the eye.The story follows him and his interactions with his students as he builds his pseudoharem--- wait what? What I meant to say was, \u201cthe story (supposedly) follows him as he builds a relationship with his students and helps them reach their full potential through his unconventional teaching methods\u201d. However, you never know when tragedy might strike in this magical world, because there is always a hidden air of danger lurking in the shadows. Who is Glen Radars? Who are the students, really? Does any of that really matter? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this series.\\n\\n\r\nReading the previous paragraph may make you believe that show is relatively serious, but, while it does have some pretty serious aspects,  the bulk of the show is more focused on comedy and magic. Some of this anime\u2019s main selling points are largely related to its unexpected comedy. Often times this comedy happens between Glen Radars and the white haired girl, Sistine Fibel. It was a bit refreshing to see a pseudoharem rather than a real harem, which has overplayed over the past few years. Each of the main character students have their own hopes, dreams, and issues. Their issues are revealed more as the series progresses, and I believe that they were revealed at the proper pace. If you are not a fan of harem anime, you most likely won\u2019t like this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the weakest aspect of this show. Generic archetypal side characters, generic main characters, the only real exceptions are Glen Radars and perhaps ReEl, who also happened to be my fav char in this anime. Sistine is presented as a very intelligent, dedicated student who will not stand for any teacher that disrespects magic and her right to learn. However, Gled Radars, being the lazy bastard that earned this anime its title, will not be broken so easily and forced to teach stripper students. The clashes between their personalities creates an interesting dynamic as the series progresses. Rumia Tingel is basically of your generic warm character that isn\u2019t clumsy. ReEl comes off as kind of odd/aloof and ends up being all types of annoying/interesting in my opinion, but I\u2019ll leave that up to decide after you watch because I can\u2019t include any more information without spoilers~\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very basic. In comparison to more recent anime, the characters do not have a wide variety of facial expressions, the backgrounds aren\u2019t too detailed, and the special effects aren't exactly the greatest either. The art is pretty average for a professional studio. Still frames, few dramatic camera angles, relatively low frame-rate. The art is really nothing special. However, the character designs may be appealing to a lot of guys. Especially so if you like garter belts, crop tops, and mini skirts. Other than that there\u2019s really not much special about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6/10 \\n\r\nThe music sounds like music that you would hear in the background of old TV advertisements, you know the ones that go, \u201cBut wait\u2026 THERE\u2019S MORE! If you call now, we\u2019ll DOUBLE the offer.\u201d Yeah. It\u2019s a bit of a change from most other anime out there and it\u2019s kinda interesting. The characters were voiced pretty well. Though there wasn\u2019t really anything too special about the voice acting either. There wasn\u2019t a voice acting scene that stood out so much that it left an impact on its viewers. For example, if you search \u201cWhen Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace - I don't understand\u201d on youtube, the first result will be a great example of great voice acting. There was nothing like that here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nI thought it was pretty good. It was a slight change of pace from a shitty and generic harem anime. Good enough for me. I could see myself recommending this to some anime fans of comedy and harem anime though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6/10\\n\r\nIt had its moments, it had it\u2019s flaws. The story, at times, can actually be pretty serious. At other times relatively humorous and has some innuendos. It does a good job at balancing the comedy and humor, but the characters are pretty generic overall. That quality takes away from the story\u2019s potential quite a bit. The music was TV ad background music and the voice acting was pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to you personally? \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of harem anime, comedy, magic, romance, cute girls, ecchi, then go for it. It\u2019s pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something more serious, then you are definitely not in the right place buddy.",

It starts with a bang, delivering perfect episodes that balances out fresh Comedy with serious Action very well in a Magic Academy setting. Sadly, it can't end on the same note as new arcs with new characters are introduced late in the game that aren't given much exposition. Still they do a good job with explaining the magic of this world logically, making it sound both interesting and realistic. This is further supported by the shows focus on the studentsto NOT just become a bookworm, rather participate willingly to field work as well. However, I would have liked more explanation with the makeup of spells and their mana cooldowns. In addition, I would have liked more types of magic used during combat rather than the few we get to see. And the competition arc needed a bit more flare to it cause at certain parts they came close to mading me felt like I was in Hogwarts! And while the plot is nice, the storytelling is weak which is why some things go unexplained like what\u2019s the use of gems when casting strong magic or what\u2019s the secret behind Rumia being an 'Amplifier' or what is really an 'Amplifier' in this world? The current story arcs don't have a conclusion and they leave an open end to the series, so I would have liked more closure, who doesn't? Plus, the last few episodes felt rushed and I am not a fan of it! We also get to see a lot of blood in this show, but then again the anime isn\u2019t exactly 'Rated R' since it refrains from showing violent deaths. And while they couldn't get their storytelling right, they did a better job with their characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters all get fleshed out pretty well and have their moments to shine! But the spotlight wasn't consistent with the girls, since the show would focus on each individual while the others would remain more of a side character like Re=L for instance. She is a weird one who apparently has only 1 strategy on her mind, which is Attack! And I\u2019m afraid no matter how much our MC squeezes her brains out, she will remain a thickhead forever! However, she is scary and despite her deadpan look, her unpredictability can make you her enemy or a friend in a matter of seconds. Removing swords from the ground and stabbing people is all she knows! Rumia, on the other hand, is strongminded but comes across a bit na\u00efve as well as an optimist which is further explored by her insight and desire to help people with magic. Regrettably, she's also the unlucky one who finds herself in the 'damsel in distress' situation all the time which gets boring so I would have liked something else from her. Albert comes across cool and mysterious but turns out to be a good friend who apparently has a thing for cats! And 'White Cat', ahem, I mean Sistine has quite a temper, I particularly enjoyed her frame of inner struggle dilemma which she gladly overcomes. (Side Note: I found her parents funny!) While she comes off as a hardworking student from a prestigious background, her relationship with Glenn is the most interesting thing about her. The have a rocky start but they do warm up to each other eventually. I particularly liked this setup since the 2 are polar opposites of each other so we get to witness the classic romantic tale of Opposites Attract! (Though they still need a lot of work for us to take them seriously) Thankfully the MC is always at the centre of the story cause he's just amazing! I loved his quick remarks and his constant trolling nature despite being a lazy bastard as the title entails! He's very strong as well with a rich yet dark history that's moderately explored but it\u2019s his attitude and resolve as a magician and teacher that helps him in standing out! Radars is hella lot of fun to be around as he makes fun of his students and teachers. Thankfully this is just an outer layer, like a mask, to hide away his true self which is dark, gloomy and bloody. Constantly haunted by his past mistakes, he wants to erase all of that with something useful and positive. And lastly, Celica was left as a background character which sucked cause she\u2019s so powerful, but she seems to have more going on in the next season so I won't complain for now.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting is top notch across the board with Josh Grelle stealing the show once again! He just has so much fun with this role and it clearly shows with his Comedic line delivery like \u2018Later Nerds!\u2019 or \u2018You may now kiss my A**!\u2019 which always springs a smile to my face. Glenn's expressions are on point which helps in delivering his lines across and that makes him a fun Main Character. The smile of Rumia mirrored her mother\u2019s which was a nice touch. Sistine, voiced by Rachael Messer and Celica, voiced by Morgan Garrett had a certain flair to their accents which helped them in standing out. Sistine rages of fit or screams are well done and Celica\u2019s concern for Glenn is shown by the warmness emanating from her which further bands the Big Sis, Little Bro kinda relationship between them. The animation is simple but beautiful when it wants to be, especially the magic casting parts. I liked how healing spells represented bright colours with soothing sound effects while dangerous spells had sharp colours with quick and loud sound effects. The OP is catchy due to it\u2019s upbeat track that can easily be assigned as your ringtone, but I didn\u2019t like the ED very much as it sounded very generic.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favs from last year, it even ended up in my Top 5 Anime list of 2017! It\u2019s not perfect as it tries to cram around 4 arcs in just 12 episodes, so you can tell when details are omitted out. Still it's very good for it's 1st season and I have high expectations for S2. I hope they organize their storytelling better and improve the screentime for their characters along with some further development. Also, if they had refrained from rushing their story, this anime would have made a bigger impact with the audience. I also thought the costumes for the girls were too showy which didn't make sense and I absolutely adored the short theatre skits at the end of each episode. Overall this certainly made me laugh and care for the characters and I would love to see their next adventure in the coming season. (P.S. where's the Comedy tag cause this s*** is funny!)",

The cast is uninteresting and full of tropes, the motivation is stupid, the magic is mediocre to look at, the ecchi feels like it was included as an afterthought (yeah, yeah, just make all the girls in the school wear 50% less clothes for no reason) and the main character is pathetic at best... Until you get to the second episode. This is by far the best example of how NOT to start your show, but holy crap if it doesn't change its tune for episode two. I'm actually mad that the author undersoldhis own work so bad right off the bat. Especially since the approach this show takes to magic is actually really interesting once they dive into it.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode two feels like the beginning of something great. It cuts a lot of the bullshit and has some much darker (even somewhat disturbing) content, as well as a lot of hints and explanations for each character's motivation and attitude. The classic stuck up rich girl gets a logical and even somewhat heartwarming reason for why she takes magic and her education so seriously. The typical nice girl gets a darker albeit cliche past, and the teacher gets fleshed out into a real, likeable character. There's still a lot of show to go, and obviously there are some growing pains, but I genuinely think it will be worth keeping up with if the second episode is any indication of things to come.",

            "content": "What starts off as a setup with substantial potential in the first three establishing episodes of this series, rapidly devolves over the course of the next nine. Don't get me wrong -- a lot of the elements put in place for this anime are highly cliche and uninspired (and not in a satirical way); however, don't get me wrong in the other direction -- this anime is also not awful. In fact, I'd say the first three episodes led me to believe that it'd be significantly above average. \r\nEnter Glenn Radars -- deceptively versatile, but incorrigibly opportunistic and frustratingly dispassionate. Did this anime attempt tomake him an antihero but miss its mark? From the moments we meet him, showing absolutely no concern for his female students' right to privacy (and basking to their nakedness before him), to the final episodes, admitting harboring motivation that would see him wedlock out of shallow desire to never work another day in his life (through marrying up in caste), his lazy demeanor and sleazy treatment of other characters doesn't end up being integral to the primary plot (or his development as a character). (If we can even call this a plot -- it's mostly just a disjointed series of \"things happening\",  which doesn't define an actual plot.) An anti-hero is supposed to be someone who acts out of self-interest because of their nature, environment, past experiences, and other context, and that says something about the world around them. For example, Holden Caulfield from A Catcher in the Rye is a true anti-hero; he's disaffected, cynical, and sarcastic because he experiences the alienation and isolation associated with growing into an adult world full of hypocrisy and fakeness. Han Solo from A New Hope is another great example - he does things that advantage him in a galaxy ruled by forced order mixed with unattended lawlessness. And while this Glenn Radars main character has clearly-needed back-story to exposit why he's first shown to detest magic (I suspected it involved tragedy that would be tied directly to the forthcoming narrative), when all of this is revealed it still doesn't explain why he is how he is. Why is he so lazy and so scummy? It only explains why he \"doesn't like magic\" during the first two episodes of the anime; otherwise, the reasons for his attributes are weakly expounded. He also had clear room to grow as a dynamic character that could face his past in an increasingly mature way while learning from his new experiences in a new position of guiding, teaching, and protecting his students. This also didn't happen. Holden Caulfield remains jaded, but at least he learns things and tells his story with surprising honesty. Glenn Radars doesn't learn anything. Han Solo realizes that there's value in risking his life for a greater cause of liberty and autonomy, through developing connections with Luke and Leia. Glenn Radars always knew that risking his life is worth it (as evidenced by his back-story), so why attempt to make him an anti-hero? If they wanted to do something that made sense with his back-story, the writers should have explored his dealing with loss in a much different way, instead of making him lazy and contemptible. But it's hard to make things funny that way with levity, so they built him into a chauvinistic asshat with little regard of other human beings as people with feelings, even behind the bravado of protecting Sistine's prospects of applied magic, or safeguarding Rumia's life. This lends the anime to funny moments, but also fails to delve into real, human experience of love, loss, sacrifice, withdrawal. Revenge and acceptance. Depression vs drive. It never feels like Glenn is internally vulnerable; he's too sure of himself and the backstory feels too devisive. \\n\\n\r\nBut the main character isn't the only flaw. I've already referenced it, but the more egregious problem (which probably ruins the characters in terms of development), is the narrative. \\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica. Sakamichi no Apollon. Usagi Drop. If you think of short-form 12-episode anime that are *exceptional*, their compact form justifies their scope and reflects their pacing. Everything starts from a strong foundation of structured, deliberate form, as well as unique storytelling of smartly-crafted character-driven narrative. Characters change. Relationships between them are ephemeral. And, most importantly, the narrative tells a story, through those characters, that means something. Kids on the Slope brings very contrasting characters together through mutual appreciation for the language of jazz. Usagi Droppu explores the challenges associated with raising children. And Madoka Magica is about existentialist themes of dedication and creating meaning. But I'm confused what Akashic Records is about. Is it about finding meaning after loss? Is it about pursuing passion? Is it a critique about just vs unjust use of power? This leads me to the core fundamental problem with this series - it's unfocused. It turns into a rushed jumbled mess. It assaults the viewer with so much sensory resulting in too many unresolved threads, fails to fully address plot holes or tie up plot points, or fully flush out the back-stories so that we can actually care about the characters more than, say, a \"5, mediocre\" status. We get a main character whose true characteristics (underneath all of the \"lazy asshat\" facade) are unclear, faced by antagonistic forces whose motivations are under-developed, rushed into the story's plotpoints with little establishment, with arcs that are unnecessary or random. Imagine attempting to cram 25 episodes of some great anime (say, Spice and Wolf or Code Geass) into 12 episodes, but then remove two key episodes and add two filler episodes. That's what this feels like. \\n\\n\r\nIt borrows a lot from current hype trends in anime, but it still had definite potential that feels wasted because of poor planning and a rushed structure . But don't tell me that I need to read the manga or wait for another season to come out, in order to have a firmer understanding of this anime's purpose. This should stand on its own merits alone. In the end, it's not meaningful to me, but it's still a fun time. Sistine is a cute, if overdone, tsundere archetype, and Re-L is adorably clueless. I like the way magic is represented in the anime, and the action scenes are competently choreographed and animated. The dialogue is good in general, if you can look past the contextual plot problems. The voice acting is pretty good, as well as other elements of the production value, and it's entertaining even while I'm frustratingly trying to connect with the characters or themes of the show. I won't bother getting into many details about the revealing character designs, the fan service, or the minor inconsistencies and weird plot arcs - this anime had more fundamental issues (than just execution) that I wanted to address, like how they dealt with the anti-hero and how they structured the narrative, and I think other reviewers have talked about these various other problems sufficiently. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend this if:\\n\r\n* you want a new best-girl tsundere that's well animated and voice acted\\n\r\n* you don't mind a confused plot in an overdone magic high school setting\\n\r\n* you could use some light fun with moderately humorous scenes and dialogue\\n\r\n* I have to admit that it's a cute show, even if it's nonsensical - especially the preview cuts at the end of each episode, with this kind of self-referential humor, etc. that this anime doesn't take itself too seriously as an art form",

            "content": "Open up a light novel with a school setting with pretty girls and a protagonist standing in the middle. Then in the background, watch for signs of magical content like sparkles, circles, etc. I swear, almost every light novel adaptation these days has something similar in nature and it doesn\u2019t take a creative mind to write a story about them. Given the way Rokudenashi is written, there\u2019s no treasure you\u2019ll find in this series. Instead, you\u2019ll spend endless hours wondering why the characters\u2019 school uniforms look so ridiculous.\r\nAlso known as Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor, the series takes off in an academy life setting.From the first few episodes, the series doesn\u2019t hide the personality of the main protagonist, Glenn Radars. To put it straightforward, he is a bastard. His personality is very sarcastic, lazy, and seems to never be able to stand still. However, Glenn has shown that he is a capable instructor with a decent knowledge of magic. And in essence, he has a good heart to help his students. So I guess in a way, he is able to walk between the line of a lazy bastard and as a guy his students can rely on. Unfortunately, my early impression of Glenn is that he is very difficult to take seriously and is someone that can barely act his age.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the context of the series, the girls doesn\u2019t present a good impression of themselves either. The first time when Glenn interacts with Sistine, a promising student at school, he is literally blasted away by his awkward introduction. Her best friend Rumia seems to be more understanding although she seems to fit into the category of the classic damsel in distress. She is pretty, kind, has blonde hair with a cute smile but unfortunately never able to save herself. You ever see a horror movie where an innocent blonde girl is running for her life and desperately needs to be saved? That\u2019s how I picture Rumia throughout the show as many episodes seems to put her into such position. At some point, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if viewers label her as a hostage simulator.\\n\\n\r\nOn terms of character relationships, the series seems to jump from one to another although the core focus is still Glenn. I have to admit, his relationships with his students is pretty uninspiring. On paper, Glenn and Sistine has a rocky relationship ever since from their first encounter. Their relationship seems to warm up a bit although can hardly be memorable given their contrasting personalities. Let\u2019s face it, Sistine is a serious working student hoping to make her dreams come true while Glenn is a lazy bastard who seems to be taking life like a game. There\u2019s hardly any connection between the two except we learn that Sistine does remind him of another character in the past. Given the length of this adaptation, that territory is hardly explored which is pretty disheartening to be honest. In the meantime, there\u2019s Rumia and Glenn. They get along better and if I had to guess, she might have developed a girly crush on Glenn just because of how much times he\u2019s saved her. Beyond that, it\u2019s nothing home to write about. Oh and of course, there are some other characters we\u2019ll encounter like Re=L, Albert, and Celica. Between Glenn and them, it just feels like these characters are there and hardly stand out with their role. The only character on that list worth mentioning may be Re=L but she has the personality of a doll and a peculiar background story. And trust me, with a character like Re=L in this show, it feels like they are trying to bring in every type of generic character personality they can into one place.\\n\\n\r\nBy expectations, the series probably excels most when it takes a more serious approach at magic. Understandably, this show surprisingly does a neat job at explaining magic, or at least on a level that makes sense. Antagonists are able to utilize magic at a level that looks threatening while Glenn establishes himself as a capable instructor with his knowledge of magic. By storytelling standards, magic is also a core motivation for Sistine as she wishes to discover the secrets of the Flying Castle. So if any positive stands out about this show, I can safely say that magic adamantly stands out. It\u2019s even part of a tournament although the storytelling itself in that field is pretty underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nIf I was to talk about the art of the show, the first thing that pops to my head is the school uniforms. Somehow, the female characters finds no troubling wearing them despite their ridiculous design. Attached to a string and exposing the bellies, it makes me curious if this school even has a damn written dress code. Character designs look somewhat noticeable such as Sistine\u2019s cat ears, Re=L\u2019s blueish hair, or Celica\u2019s black dress. Character expressions for the main cast are somewhat entertaining to watch at times when the timing is appropriate. However, the antagonists in this show are very disappointing to look at. I mean, an evil maid? A guy that dresses like he works as a stagecoach driver? Can this show get any more awkward? On the other hand, I guess the academy itself looks normal or fits within the category of acceptable. The action sequences on most parts flows well. But again, it\u2019s mostly the magic doing the work.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say for the soundtrack or music as it feels rather blend. The OP and ED theme songs are pretty generic while the battle soundtrack is hardly original. My impressions of the voice acting also remains so-so. Glenn sounds too sarcastic for a guy of his age while Re=L is devoid of emotions. Sistine and her friend Rumia doesn\u2019t bring in any memorable lines and often makes comedic scenes look shameful.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, I can\u2019t say this is a good show. Or in fact, it\u2019s not even half decent. It fits more into the category of academy story with characters molded by the most generic personalities possible. The storytelling itself borders into the realm of gobbledygook as hardly any episodes are memorable. With cheesy character dialogues, weakly developed relationships, and attempts at crafting humor, the show doesn\u2019t do well at it selling whatever it intends to. Oh and school uniforms\u2026\\n\\n\r\nJust, why? \\n",

Don't misunderstand me, I really enjoyed the show but after watching the first episodes my expectations were really high, this anime had a lot of potential and it got wasted, so this is why I feel let down.\r\nThe story, which seemed really good at the beginning, went to nowhere, there's no plot overall, the anime consists in Glenn (the MC) saving continuously the girls he's bound to because everyone of them is important for some reason or another and the storytelling towards the end was very rushed: Ifelt like it was lacking something so I read the manga (I know the LN is the original but I couldn't find it anywhere) and noticed that some details were left out of the anime adaptation. So, if you liked the show I recommend you to read the Light Novel or the manga.\\n\r\nI liked the characters and the comedy but I grew a bit annoyed at them with each passing episode because they lost their initial impact, I think the show needed to renew some gags, but it was funny nonetheless and I didn't get bored. \\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, the girls' chara design was beautiful, Rumia, Sistine and Re=l were extraordinarly cute. And I found the voice acting really good, I was most impressed by Sistine's VA,  it was perfect and I loved it. \\n\r\nSo, long story short: if you like the magic/school genre this is a piece of cake, it's entertaining and I had fun watching it, but don't make the same mistake as me, don't raise your expectations, because the anime starts off pretty well, but it becomes somewhat predictable afterwards.",

            "content": "If there is one trend I dislike more than anything over the past few years, it is the plethora and popularity of light novel adaptations. Now, of course, to clarify, I don't believe that just because an anime is adapted from a light novel, it is inherently bad. There have been plenty of light novel adaptations in the past that have actually been pretty good, but what I am referring to, in this case, are the light novel adaptations that feature some boring male protagonist with spiky hair that acts as a self insert for all of the filthy otaku, who goes to some randomhigh school that is usually one in which the students have superpowers (and for some reason it's always magic) as he becomes stronger and stronger while all of the female cast gets wet at his complete awesomeness! Most of these light novel adaptations follow the same basic elements, character archetypes and plot threads, and, if you've seen as many as I have, all begin to blend into one gigantic, horrible mess. I hate these types of light novel adaptations, because they're so lazy and so god damn unoriginal, yet, they still become widely popular; undeservingly so!  While I have seen a couple of them done decently well, such as Chivalry of a Failed Knight, which plays around and subverts some of the troupes found in these typical shows, Akashic Records is not decent... it's not even mediocre! It's terrible! Every one of these elements I have listed in this opening paragraph is present in this travesty, and the writing, characters, narrative and the world presented to us are so boring, generic and cookie-cutter that I feel like throwing up just thinking about them! While this is not the worst light novel adaptation I have ever seen (that honour would go to Absolute Duo or The Asterisk War) it baffles me why this show is receiving such praise from some people and why it has sat at a score of around seven on this website. As soon as I saw the words \"light novel\" and \"LIDENFILMS\" in the seasonal charts before the show started up, I think I died a little inside and, to this day, this studio still hasn't produced a single anime I would actually consider to be noteworthy with this being their minimus opus, if you will. With all that said and done, let's jump into the narrative (if you could even call it that) of this absolute train wreck! \\n\\n\r\nTo say that the story of Akashic Records is generic would be the understatement of the year. If anything, this narrative is incredibly linear and predictable every step of the way with glaring pacing issues while shoving down your throat as many stereotypically dull speeches about life as it can possibly muster in each episode. It's set in a world in which magic is a viable tool and is used often for war against other nations, and, of course, as typical of light novel stories, the teenagers in this world are able to use said magic and attend special high schools. Enter the Light Novel guy for this series; a lazy man with an indifferent attitude who also happens to be a shut-in, takes up a job teaching magic at some random magic high school after being forced to by the woman he lives with. This, however, is greeted by disdain by the students in the class he has to teach, in particular, by two female students, called Tsundere-chan (Sistine Febel) and Basic Bitch (Rumia Tingel). While this first greeting is met with hostility, this new teacher eventually warms up to the rest of the class and they begin to develop more of a bond with him over the course of the series! And that's it for a plot! If it sounds like I'm being incredibly vague with this plot synopsis, that's because nothing really happens in this show from a narrative standpoint. It feels like a sequence of events that just happen because the writer needed to fill in some time and they connect so loosely with each other and have no overall bearing or impact on the plot that the narrative feels weak and lacking emotion. None of the characters has any motivation or any clearly defined goals in this series and thus it is hard to actually get invested or engaged into this world at all, or to care for any of the characters. The narrative has no sense of direction, and a weak narrative isn't exactly a game breaker for me as long as the characters are good (which they're not, but I'll get into that in a bit) but I'd like to have some kind of story actually happening! There is an evil magic organisation of some sort but they barely play any part in the narrative and feel so tacked on and vague that half of the time I forget that they're even present or playing any part in this story. They do introduce a new villain in the show but it's WAY too late into the narrative in order to flesh him out and instead, they rush this character's introduction, his involvement and his back-story within only an episode or so.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the pacing, holy crap is this broken! The show tries to squeeze so much into its short twelve episode frame that it feels like a chore to watch since they're constantly throwing more and more things at you at every passing episode. It's also another kick to the nuts to realise that everything that does happen in the show is so inconsequential and boring to boot as well, which is also present in the setting for the show. The world of Akashic Records is one of the laziest thought out worlds I have ever seen. It's a world in which magic, goddamn MAGIC, is a part of everyday life but we barely have seen any examples of how people coexist with magic in the narrative in their daily lives outside of high school nor is the magic they use themselves all too great either. The great thing about setting your world in which features magic is that it allows you to be as creative as you could possibly want in regards to how the world operates and how its people live, while excusing it with the pretence that magic is an in-depth and intricate system that makes sense to the characters that live in this world, but, instead, they do nothing with it. For the sake of argument, let's compare it to the series Little Witch Academia, which aired alongside this show. Aside from doing everything better than Akashic Records, the world of Little Witch Academia is built around this idea of magic and is used in creative ways which bring the world to life. The world is interesting and alluring. Not only that but each of the characters have clearly defined goals which help to push the story forward and keep the audience immersed in the story; two things that Akashic Records doesn't have.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the time the narrative is just simply tasteless, making light jokes and comedy from molestation and rape of all things, especially from the second episode. The tonal shifts from watching a girl almost get raped to then making a stupid joke is painful and is almost as bad as the tonal shifts from Drifters. Speaking of the comedy, it feels so damn forced and trite as well as predictable that every attempt at a joke falls flat on its face and isn't funny in the slightest! The show also throws an insane amount of blood at the audience in a petty, pathetic attempt at seeming hardcore and edgy since the writing isn't strong enough to hold up by itself. Not only that, but the insane amount of blood half the time just feels silly, such as in episode nine, where Basic is lying unconscious in the floor with an insane amount of blood plastered on the bed, floor and curtains (enough that would kill a person), but her only wound is a slight wound on her stomach! How? Why? Who knows! \\n\\n\r\nThere actually is a tournament arc in the show, but just like everything else, it is terrible. Again, since this is a world full of magic, the writer could have written some very interesting fight scenes or competitions around the use of magic but all of them are just so boring and the show glosses over this arc so quickly that it feels entirely pointless. Some may argue that the true meat of this arc was, in fact, Basic's relationship with the queen and everything surrounding that, but, again, it feels so boring to watch, this is never brought up later again in the series and this scene is one of the worst cases of melodrama and bad writing I have seen in a very long time. And much of the show is forced with melodrama too, which, doesn't feel emotional since I don't care for a single one of these characters and all of these situations I've seen to much better effect somewhere else before. There is even a beach scene, thrown in just for some silly fan service, scenes that could have been used for character development and growth instead, but, nope, CLEARLY, the most important thing to do is show the audience what each girl would look like if they were in bloody swimsuits! The narrative is just so boring, predictable and unfocused that it's hard not to fall asleep whilst watching it and every single element in the story has been done elsewhere before in a better capacity. Even for Light Novels this story is generic and they use every cheap writing technique in the book to try and make you feel sorry and sympathetic for these characters when they have not been built from the ground up from victimisation, to the loss of a loved one in the past; this crap has it all! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just as bad and are essentially just all archetypes of previous anime character personality traits. Not a single one is interesting and none develop at all during the entire duration of the show; they're all stagnant. Glenn, as the main character of a light novel series, is a little bit more interesting than what I am accustomed to, however, not only in physical appearance but also in personality. He is an adult character, makes fun of people, is lazy and is just all around a twat. He doesn't get flustered when he sees girls naked (instead he actively tries to) like most light novel main guys either. Does this make his character good? No... not really. The main problem with Glenn as a character is that he is inconsistent and his back-story is both generic as hell and is very heavily underdeveloped to boot. He is made to be, at first, to be an incompetent idiot with no speciality for magic, but after episode three, he pretty much can do anything the plot demands from him because B U L L S H I T. While, at times, I did enjoy his random hijinks and ass-hole nature, I found him to be extremely boring and lacking when compared to the series Great Teacher Onozuka. The other main characters include Tsundere-chan, who begins to develop a crush on Glenn as the series goes along and GOD I wanted to smack this character in the face. She is constantly complaining, whining and nagging at every little thing and her character design, and personality has been done so much at this point, that every time I see a Tsundere character I want to slam my face into a wall. Basic Bitch, otherwise known as Rumia, is the only character with some emotional weight to her as her back-story is decently explored but is nothing to write home about. I refer to her as Basic Bitch because that is exactly what she is: basic. She acts as the good morale, angel type character which sickens me to death with how boring she is. The only other character who is given somewhat of a back-story is a character called Re-L, who assumes the deadpan loli archetype that has been done so many times up to this point, that every time she was on screen my mind sort of hazed out and lost interest straight away. While, sure, we do learn things about her character, it's, again, nothing all too great, boring and after her mini-arc is completed she is pretty much pushed to the sidelines afterwards and plays hardly any factor in the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is equally as generic, boring and underdeveloped, and it's giving me a migraine trying to refresh my memory of them. The only character who is SOMEWHAT likeable, and I stress that \"somewhat\" greatly is Celica, mainly because of her personality but this character is given so little screen time that I forgot about her entirely. When she is on screen, she is fairly interesting but is not enough to save the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall aesthetic and quality of the artwork were just fine, but the animation was just pretty lazy since they reuse the same shot of Tsundere-chan punching Glenn into the sky about twenty times, three within one episode sometimes. It's not the worst I have seen, and I do like some of the palettes as well, but it's overall just a very bland looking show. However, the character designs are some of the worst I have ever seen! While the boy's school uniform is fine and conventional, I have no clue what the hell happened to the girl's outfits. It looks like something you'd find straight out of a porno for god's sake! The skirt is about five millimetres in length, covering barely any flesh and they have these short tops, which exposes their stomachs, complete with garter belts and straps around from their skirts to their stomachs. How, in the holy mother of hell, was this allowed in a high school is way beyond me, and, as a result, it pretty much ruins every dramatic moment in the show since the uniforms are so silly, they end up distracting me from the emotional scenes. As for the music, it's perhaps the most stock and dull soundtrack I've heard in a while. Not a single one is memorable or even decently composed, and the opening and ending tracks are just generic pop music that you'll forget as soon as you listen to something else. The opening, in keeping up with the traditions set by the Gun Gale Arc from SAO, also spoils who the main villain is going to be!\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen any light novel adaptation about a group of kids with magic powers inside a high school then you've seen Akashic Records, because each one of these shows is fundamentally the exact same thing with only slight variations, and I'm done with this shit forever. Each one of these boring, insipid, shallow, vacuous light novel series can seriously just go fuck themselves for their insulting storytelling, awful characters and terrible pandering. These series are essentially the anime equivalence of the films made by Illumination Animation; they're both produced with no soul or intent at creating a piece of art or telling a story with a message that can resonate with an audience. I love both the medium of film, and the animation medium very much since they have provided some of the most heartfelt, and most impactful pieces of fiction I have seen. Film and animation can make you cry, make you laugh, they help shape you as a person, especially at a young age, and I honestly don't know where I'll be without them, for as corny as that sounds. But, these light novel adaptations offer nothing at all; no emotion, other than genuine anger and irritation, and hence, I am done forever with these boring shows. I'd rather digest cyanide than sit through another show like Hundred or Absolute Duo, and, especially Akashic Records ever again. Of course, if you like these shows, then that is completely fine. I'm glad you're able to enjoy something that I don't. After all the world would be a boring place if we all liked the exact same thing. But, to me, this show is awful in every sense of the word. It has nothing. I'd rather watch Hand Shakers on repeat than watch one of these shows ever again. Now, that's saying something...\\n",

            "content": "Highly underrated show that exeeded my expectations imo. I think some ppl need to be more open-minded. Some of the MAL reviews that quickly judge shows with a bad score just by looking at the 'genres:\u00a0Action,\u00a0Magic,\u00a0Fantasy,\u00a0School' and the 'LN adaptation' tag. Don't get me wrong, I have watched a lot of these type of light novel adaptation shows and I did not have high expectations at all when I started the show. And I was right, episode 1 was really bad, full of the usual clich\u00e9s and tropes. But if you look past that first episode, this show actually gets better exponentially. This show issurprisingly extremely entertaining, with intriguing characters. Though it still has some of the usual tropes and clich\u00e9s, there was something different about the plot and characters,  which are very welk done,  that kept me hooked throughout. It IS without a doubt one of the BETTER light novel adaptations of these past few months. The plot is not really predictable, abd characters are not shallow in the least. Actual lovable characters that are quite different from the usual clich\u00e9d ones. Great music, art and action overall. And the ending was satisfying and made me want to know more. I am honestly gonna be a little lenient and give this a 9/10 ^^  \\n\\n\r\nJust watch past episode 1 and you'll love this I think.  It's actually rare to see an okay light novel adaptation and LINDENFILMS did a great job at their second attempt. \\n\\n\r\nI HAD to write this because I felt that this show definitely deserves more positive reviews. \\n\r\nI know not everyone does this, but imo, when it comes to mindsets when going into a show, I don't think one should judge shows completely before even finishing it, or giving it a fair chance. Because that's something I did and it really made me miss out on a lot of enjoyment and ruined my experience. \\n\r\nDon't EXPECT it to be bad, give everything a chance, at least that's my philosophy.\\n\r\nThanks for reading. \\n\\n\r\n(My first review.. Might do more of this. This is fun)",

            "content": "TL;DR at the bottom\r\nOkay, so it's none of the 'professional and long' reviews you see often. Just felt like it would be great to give you a short glimpse on this anime, since I'm that kind of person who needs to be reassured that an anime is worth watching, and that's usually by checking out trailers or reviews (mostly to see if there are any positive reviews, because I mostly watch non-popular anime). Either way, is it worth watching? Yeah, definitely. There are only 4 episodes at the moment and I will update the review once it finishes airing, but for now, jump in assoon as you can, so you keep up with the flow and don't need to do an all-nighter as I do all the time when watching anime (updates later below).\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't talk about people, yes you, who despise or dislike harem / ecchi genres. I, in particular, see no problem in watching these genres as long as it's not over the top or has actual plot. Maybe this show is a bit similar to a cliche, what is a strong MC; hides the powers; has a dark past; blah blah... But the execution itself and the kinda original spin of the cliche is what I like, because it reminds me of Konosuba, No Game No Life, Mondaiji-tachi, Gakushen Toshi Asterisk (even though it didn't have insane ratings) and such shows (ex. No Game No Life has an interesting plot to me, and it's good, further more it includes comedy, the MC doesn't strain / limit himself nor his character acting however he wishes, yet knows his abilities and thinks about them and proceeds knowing he can do this or that).  That is basically why, you should watch this show, since it reminds of those shows, yet it's original. The MC is similar to a one of NGNL / Mondaiji-tachi, yet it is original in ways, because he's not too OP, however has a lot of knowledge. The plot is growing around the place where he works, yet the story has a great flow, considering there's a lot of stuff happening and yet it all makes sense. It keeps me pumped waiting for the next episode, so I do recommend it to you.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, kawaii girls, what else do you need? \\n\r\nYou get shironeko (white cat), Rumia, the calmia and kawaiiaa (and nobleaaa, too, apparently), and a bunch of students who adore the teacher who didn't even want to work for the school in the first place (and was forced by the carelessly careful Celica. Seriously, they're close, I can tell that), but probably knows more than most of the teachers there considering the popularity he's gained.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind I have no idea what the show is like in LN, nor I have read it, because I love watching the animations rather than reading (probably due to my photogenic memory that prefers remembering animations, and not the pages), so I take no responsibility if it's worse, or whatsoever, in the LNs (I believe I've seen someone tell it's worse or better). \\n\\n\r\nShort scoring:\\n\r\n\u2022 Story - 8/10 (the flow is fine, fillers are fine, fan-service is fine, everything is preserved, nothing distracts you from the action and flow, maybe just not enough epic fights that give you those chills that I love)\\n\r\n\u2022 Art - 9/10 (it's fine, quality is truly amazing, although I disliked one moment in the episode about the quality at one part because of how the quality was sacrificed during fast-pace action in order to keep the animation smooth without letting the people to notice, however it's not possible to see it so easily so it's fine.)\\n\r\n\u2022 Sound - 10/10 (can't judge it, fine by me, I can hear even the birds, so it's goody goody for me, even objects falling have great sounds)\\n\r\n\u2022 Characters - 9/10 (don't expect much from a harem, this is a lot already because to me they seem unique in the sense of communication and their placement and such, but considering the main character, he has changed quite a lot compared to the start of the show)\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment - 10/10 (seriously, it's fun, it kept me watching, I liked it, and I wait for the next eps. same as for when Konosuba 1/2 aired)\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall - 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nUPDATE\\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nUPDATE\\n\\n\r\nIt's been a long time since I updated this review. I want you to know that it's really worth watching. I myself love when there's romance in anime, however I prefer it preserved. In this particular one, well it's a typical harem, except that the teacher doesn't actually let it to be a harem, he actually represents a teacher as the anime gets going, even though careless he would seem, he's a mastermind. \\n\r\nNo idea how about you, but I loved the ending. I had various ships throughout the anime, and I couldn't really decide. I myself like romance, but I really don't even mind if it's not there as long as the author doesn't tease me to nerves. I loved it, I personally was amazingly satisfied by the ending and what was the last conversation of the whole pinnacle. I wished to see more and to see the romance develop, but on the other hand I guess it would push out the action and mystery out of it then, unless it's kept to minimal. \\n\r\nI recommend you to watch it, no matter if the start or some parts feel like bore or unacceptable to you, I have no problem with harems and ecchi genres, and I fully advise you to watch this. It is completely not over the top and I ensure you will have both great time, and be satisfied. It has action, comedy and mystery in it, at least for me. I'm pretty sure it's a good one this year.\\n\r\nWhat are you doing?\\n\r\nStart watching, you bakaaaa!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCheers, enjoy!\\n\r\nPatrick",

            "content": "\"If the best thing I can say about your show is that the girls are hot, then your show is terrible!\" -some lazy jackass\r\n*Spoilers for Akashic Records*\r\nBefore I start the review proper, or rather, this dissertation about why this show is a generic and irritating fraud that actually manages to squander any potential it had for some lazy comedy and infuriating LN bullshit clich\u00e9s, I have two things I feel I must notify you of. First, a decent chunk of this review will be spent analyzing the ideas this series had and how with some major and minor tweaks, the series could've been better, atleast from a storytelling perspective. Secondly, I'm about to let out something I have to get out of my chest because while this insufferable mentality I\u2019m about to describe isn't truly widespread, I've still seen it a handful of times, and quite frankly, it's sickening. People who have this upcoming mentality infuriate me with their ignorance and sheer vindictiveness.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nIf a title is almost nothing but recycled content from shows prior, then to me at least, it has no excuse and little reason to both exist and be defended as a work of fiction. It seems like creativity isn't as valued as it should be and this has been a problem in every industry at almost every point in history for one reason or another. With the anime in the 80's/90's, it was schlock bloodbath OVAs and nowadays in anime, it's Light Novel School Battle and/or Harem anime. Titles that largely or even entirely fit these descriptions can still break the mold and achieve something greater.\\n\\n\r\nWe do not have some \"mythical, absurdly high, nigh-unachievable standard\" these assholes keep accusing us of having! I'm sick of ignorant pricks assuming that we do! We just want anime to actually have a sense of life, a sense of passion, and a reason to exist outside of making corporate money from people who have loved tons of shows borderline identical to what they're currently watching and fapping to. Even among school battle (usually harem) anime, there are some that go above and beyond, like the aforementioned Chivalry of a Failed Knight. In fact, even among the standards if these \"copy-paste\" anime, some manage to really sink below to almost creative levels of suck, like The Irregular at Magic High School, as if to prove that there is a standard to hold titles like this by and that even this kind of anime has its own hierarchy like all the rest.\\n\\n\r\nIn summation, we do not all have some absurd standard for anime, we just want these kinds of titles to die out (or rather to not be as widespread, which in fairness, is already happening somewhat over the past year) so that anime that actually have passion and creativity can more easily flourish, and even by the standards of the now incessant LN school battle harem anime, some can go beyond the expectations or fail to even meet such bottom of the barrel standards. If you enjoy these titles, that's fine, just at least have some standards regarding these things since not all of them are of equal quality and the ones with the least amount of effort put into making them worthwhile works of fiction do not deserve to be defended, at least to me. Again, like them if you want, just don't accuse us of bad standards or incorrect views since we dissented from your \"it's done before but that's fine because I like it\" viewpoint. Before we start, let me state that this mentality pisses me off about as bad as this show did, hence why my tone will sound insanely aggressive throughout, since, well, this show was offensively bad. Leave now if you're not ok with kind of atmosphere and tone, and/or if you're not ok with me bashing the show (assuming you didn't leave by that point since I'm showing it absolutely no mercy). With that tirade out of the way, let's start the review proper.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nMixing Konosuba humor and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is like mixing a liter of ghost pepper juice and white paint. You know, shit like this is why I invested in a tomato farm. Wait, I'm sorry, was that joke not predictable enough for you? My bad, let me try again: Ahem, \u201cThis show is cancer.\u201d Actually, my previous joke was funnier than both this one and every single joke here in this godforsaken show. Let me grab those tomatoes now.\\n\\n\r\nAkashic Records. For some reason, people thought this was actually funny and \u201ctotally not exactly like all of the other trash we hate because it has more comedy in its trashiest scenarios than those others shows that do the exact same thing but with a permanently straight face.\u201d This show isn't funny; it's predictable. It has no semblance of tact or actual self-awareness on how awful its writing and gaudy cheese-fest self-justification for subsequent action exposition dumps that last up to a minute are. You people call SAO terrible? At least it has more tact and worthwhile humor than this show ever did, as well as more originality, better music, a much more tolerable color pallet. Even with its bad pacing, at least it never showed off early events that feel like they should be coming in much later than they should, or give flashbacks to equally terrible and popular shows with specific plot points. This show thinks it can get away with being the trashiest LN garbage ever as long as it adds \u201churr-de-durr\u201d to everything and adding a funny face just to really make it even more obvious than it is. It thinks it's the Konosuba of school battle harem trash; it's not. It takes itself just as seriously for most part, so that doesn't work. Hell, it's even worse since those shows take horrible scenarios like attempted rape seriously when presenting them. This show doesn't. But enough rambling; what makes Akashic Records so awful to the point where I actually believe that The Asterisk War is a much better show than it? Well, let\u2019s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s address the elephant in the room before we really rip into the logic of this show: the female school uniforms. You know, I think it should be the woman\u2019s choice as to whether or not she\u2019ll be so scantily clad that not only are her midriffs and things exposed, but that she also has suspenders at the thighs and waist to make sure that two-piece outfit doesn't fall apart, not something that a school, let alone an \u201cesteemed private academy\u201d such as this one, should mandate. This kind of uniform that would make any real school principal revile in horror is, while sexy and appealing, downright disgusting in the fact that a school mandates women wear that as their official uniform. I get that this is a trash anime, but no successful school in their right mind would pull such a stunt without raising absolute hellfire from parents, true gentlemen, feminists, other schools and districts, and SJWs across the nation, especially when this show\u2019s one obviously hot and fanservicey character is more decently clad than the high school students (aka, generic archetype bitches) that are forced to wear this. I mean, the men wear regal and classy suits befitting of gentlemen (even Glenn wears something of decent clothing, and he\u2019s the lazy asshole pervert), so wouldn't it make sense to have the ladies wear something even more regal and classy, like Celica, the obviously hot fanservice character? You wouldn't believe how badly that made me lose hope in any logic found in the story. I mean, I am a teenage, straight male, and I like hot women like the rest of my kind, hell, I can ogle at Celica all day, but this is just ridiculous!Now, to everything else.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the series doesn't really have major plot holes, even despite a few minor ones (nor all of which I'll cover), but it does have many leaps in logic for the characters, bad pacing, and it manages to portray certain scenes horrendously. But there are decent moments, like the rare joke that hits, occasional (if not successful due to poor pacing) attempts at emotional scenes, and the scene where Glenn goes Grammar Nazi on students to show just how convoluted magic can really be. I'll start by going rapid fire on a few dumb things from episodes 1 and 2. Still, prepare to be here a while, the story segment takes up a vast majority of the review since there is a lot I need to say here.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does Celica threaten Glenn to get him to work at this school despite knowing that he is beyond unqualified and that he hates magic? Is it because she just wants him to get a job and if he a deadbeat regardless of whether or not he is remotely qualified, because if so, that's stupid (since she needs to make sure he is at least remotely qualified for his job). The series checks out one important trite bullshit (aka bad clich\u00e9) from the list really early with a scene where the flatter student (Sistine) helped the big-tits student (Rumia), but here, it's portrayed in such a sexual manner to the point where in other series, they are still sexual harassment despite teasing, this is easily a more blatantly disgusting and uncomfortable act of sexual harassment that sent out of its way to be as horrid as possible (partially since it made me hate the Sistine, one of the main characters, by the first episode, the episode where we are supposed to be sold on these characters). \\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of episode 2 felt like it should've been stretched out over multiple episodes given how here is a small time skip in the middle of episode 2 after Glenn reaches the importance of grammar in changing magic, and how much is packed into this episode story-wise. In order of appearance: Glenn starts the episode same as before, he goes so far into dissing magic that Sistine slaps him and leaves in tears, each character has an emotional moment before Glenn realizes how little students truly know about magic besides one particular method for each spell, he schools them, then his students like him, he has then made progress and is now infinitely more passionate about work, we go back and reaffirm that there is a moment in which Rumia was saved by presumably Glenn (we even see the hair color, and in episode 1, she looks familiar to him, but this isn't spaced or enough to feel organic or that it would take a little while for us to really explore this point without coming up with the answer so early into the show), and then terrorists. All of this should've been episodes 3, 4, and even 5. I mean it. We could've just done the same shenanigans and have episode 2 end on the moment where Sistine slaps Glenn and walks off in tears, then episode 3 have an emotional episode that shows us another side of our (at the time) 3 important characters while showing us that terrorists are soon to some before at the end, he busts out some knowledge on the students, then episode 4 not only shows us how much all of this is working out while at the same time showing us that he is actually becoming happier overall while doing this, but then the episode brings us back to that moment where we see him and Rumia interact before we learn that she was saved by someone who looks suspiciously like Glenn, and then it ends on terrorists moving in. Episodes 5 and 6 would be a bunch of terrorists raising hell in the school and then Glenn, and all students and teachers fight back in a mini war arc, by editing the final few minutes of episode 2 where terrorists show up and turning that into episode 5, and editing some of the intrusive comedy of episode 3 and making it episode 6.. There, I just vastly improved the show just by taking episode 2 stretching it out, and adding and editing parts as I went along,like making episode 3 episode 6. If only the writer was this capable.\\n\\n\r\nThe moment that made this show awful beyond redemption was the attempted rape scene. Let me set the scene. Terrorists have just captured Rumia who turned out to be a former princess but her family was killed and she escaped (hence why she said she was saved by someone before terrorists would've killed her). Sistine is alone in a room, and a terrorist walks in. He then begins to toy with her, saying that people like her are surprisingly and deliciously fragile while pinning her down and slowly undressing her. Then, Glenn walks in and it turns from trite to actively offensively terrible. In the midst of a scene of attempted rape, Glenn walks in, pays no mind, and lackadaisical comedy ensues for like 40 seconds! WHAT THE FLYING FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!?! A character is in the verge of getting rape, and the supposed \u201chero\u201d who busts in not only doesn't recognize the situation, but acts all lazy! Needless to say, this moment made this show practically impossible to redeem. When SAO can treat this kind of scene with infinitely more tact than this show can, in regards to content and tone, you know we have a problem here! Sure, eventually Glenn saves her, but then we get the rest of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nGlenn busts out this arcana card which nullifies all magic (especially opponents\u2019 and enemies\u201d magic). This is a very generic magic for an MC to have, and it's giving me Mahouka flashbacks as if the school terrorism thing didn't do that already. Glenn just busts out an arcana card unceremoniously and explains what it does in his usual lackadaisical tone (tired of me using that word yet?). This is the first time we see this kind of magic card in the series, adding to the already surpassingly convoluted magic system of this world, so at least the show could do is unveil it with grandeur. Even Mahouka did that right! Whatever, a badly animated curb stomp commences in which Glenn wins, and episode 2 ends. As you can no doubt tell, the rape attempt scene should've never happened and in my version above, it never would.\\n\\n\r\nActually, there are a few things in episode 3 I would alter, since it's not a great episode either (I mean, what did you expect from this show). I think the worst thing this episode does is prove that this crock of shit had potential, potential that it, predictably, squandered. I mean, Glenn was a mate killer, so that could've been explored and built up a bit better since before then, the only buildup was him saying magic kills people. In this episode, I would edit out the numerous and always monotonous self-justification for what someone is about to do exposition dumps there always last for around 30 seconds, some of the intrusive comedy of the first 6 minutes, and do one last crucial thing in the last few minutes of the episode. Remember how Professor Huey apparently left (hence why they have a sub) prior to the events of episode 1? Well, here he is again, but has no exposed motivations for being here, and he just stands there, saying that it's a game to see if Glenn can free Rumia from a bunch of magic circles, so, none of that makes any real sense. He needs a reason for doing this, and why he is treating this like a game. Also, at the end, they completely gloss over what Rumia\u2019s true name as princess was Eruminia, and I don't know why. This also confirms that yes, Glenn was the one that unknowingly saved her. It's a shame that one of the most potentially interesting hook questions about the series was dealt with only 3 episodes in out of 12.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to go or if my way to really break down the rest of the episodes since that would take fucking forever and I'm already spending a lot of time doing rapid fire on a few problems per episode while fixing the series as a whole. But now, we reach the tournament arc, starting with episode 4, so time for me to keep doing what I've been doing. The queen is still the mother of Rumia but apparently everyone was killed but her. Why did she pronounce her daughter dead after the terrorists came? What actually happened? Did terrorists simply kidnap her from everyone? Has the school heard nothing about the Queen? What about the dad/king? \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing is that we are suddenly introduced to what all of the students can do during the beginning of this tournament arc via a pep talk from Glenn. Want to know how to have made this moment work. Have it so that when the terrorists showed up, they all do what we would hear them being capable of, that what this moment would be actually gratifying since by then we would've known a bit about all the students and then have epic realization that Glenn was exactly right since that what they did in that hypothetical. This has been another round of me improving the series. In fact, the actual tournament section in episode 4 could've been 2, maybe even 3 whole episodes in order to make an interesting tournament arc up until the next episode (specifically, 7-9 on my version), since there are so many games that are glossed over since most students are not important. Hell, even before that, we saw a typical asshole vs underdog rivalry set up with Harley and his class vs Glenn and his, and then it would be gratifying and exciting to see both groups compete and Glenn\u2019s class do well on each of these events. This has been another round of me making a better series out of the pieces this one failed to put together. Also, the asspull of Rumia winning her round because the big buff guy suddenly blacked out for no reason was infuriating, and the fact that it came after a rushed and stupid bit of her teammates telling her to quit since they \u201ccare for her\u201d despite her being in no peril and her wanting to do this, is especially galling. When both The Asterisk War and Fairy Tail can make a better tournament arc, then your arc is shit, and by extension, you're shit!\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 5 and 6, barring a few really dumb moments (as per usual), are probably the best in the series, as little as that says about them. The comedy is still pretty miss for me but not only are there a few genuinely sweet moments like Glenn\u2019s conversation with Rumia I episode 5 and her true reunion with her mother at the end of episode 6, but also, the way Glenn defeats the villain of this arc is actually pretty intelligent and entertaining, reminding me of some of the most popular protagonists in anime like Lelouch from Code Geass, Light from Death Note, and Sora from No Game No Life. Still, time to fix \u2018em. I'll give this series a compliment when it deserves one; it's already like...96:0 in problems (and you get a cookie if you get where that reference came from). The way to make it better this time is simple, and it builds from the last fixing I did: actually juggle the rescue attempt and the tournament matches equally and flesh them both out, that way we have all of the emotional payoffs actually pay off (at least if you give each scene enough space), and so that we can actually enjoy the tournament side of the arc, and have that whole thing from episodes 5 and 6 take up 3 more episodes (10-12 in my version) while removing some of the fake out comedy, taking away the explosion speeches about \u201cme saying why I'm doing what I'm doing\u201d, removing the dere moments Sistine has with her teacher (I get that he is 19 but still it's sorta creepy for a student to have a hunted romantic interest in her teacher) and altering the ending where the students spend all his money to him actually treating them with some of his money, that way nothing about any of the arcs each character went through get cheapened upon rewatch and hindsight (namely Glenn\u2019s). Also, have more animation in the arc since this series doesn't really have much actual character animation. \\n\\n\r\nSee? It's simple. If we create a brand new episode 1 from scratch to replace this episode 1 and take all of the ideas I brought up that modify these episodes, we could've had an actually good series on our hands since despite all of the LN trope bullshit, awful comedy moments that ruin certain scenes, and a few other things, all the pieces were there for the first 6 episodes to be a good 1 cour series. The other 6 on the other hand...yeah, I haven't been really living up to my promise of tone, and these episodes are gonna change that; they are that bad...\\n\\n\r\n*sigh* Episode 7 is where things go back to being abysmal instead of just bad, partially due to almost half of it being a clich\u00e9 beach episode and the irritating comedy, partially due to the character Re=L (make your Ergo Proxy joke elsewhere). She is such a bad character, and it is the impetus of the arc and why it's horrible. Her heel turn is insanely telegraphed and still incredibly forced, being out of jealously in episode 7 about the fact that the deuteragonist females are quote unquote \u201cstealing Glenn away from her\u201d, and because she is just a double agent who likes her dead brother who she saw again (which means he was revived, which is a major plot point in the arc, revival) in episode 8, while the rest of episode 8 before that is just the introduction of revival, one of the villains of the previous arc showing up and being a crazy bitch, and Re=L moving around and being an insufferable bitch. Fuck this arc in its entirety. Oh, and she nearly kills Glenn because of this and badly injures Rumia. When you consider that up to this point, she had been trying to kill Glenn (or at least she attacks him as greeting and always wants to settle a score with him) and the fact that she genuinely talked of the fact that she had a lot of fun with the people she immediately afterwards hated) and the fact that she had just been a generic deadpan loli character, this sudden turn is infuriatingly stupid and forced. The 9th episode is just as bad honestly, and they rushed the shit out of a villain death and the backstory Re=L has can't redeem her in the slightest. Also, the main blue-haired villain of the arc was wasted in the fact that there is a malicious character named Reiner, but this guy was just some random who wasn't connected with anything and is just a \u201cbad person who does bad things because villain\u201d character. I literally have no way to really remotely fix this arc; it was dead on arrival.\\n\\n\r\nBut now, we finally reach the final arc. It is one of the stupidest story arcs I have ever seen in my life, if not the absolute dumbest and most wince-worthy of them all. Here is the main plot of arc 4: Some creepy teacher guy continually confesses to Sistine and after Glenn overheard him dissing her dream, he puts on this front about wanting to marry her for money, and it all becomes a pissing match, except between teachers over a student. Fucking creepy! It's beyond stupid a premise given the age ranges (adult and teenager), and given how this is the impetus on having another evil protagonist bent on using Rumia for some scheme, you'd think this wouldn't exist and that they'd find a less disgusting way for this to happen. The sub plot is about Glenn suddenly realizing that Sistine looks like Sera, a now dead girl he once loved before he left the Imperial Corps, and that now angel dusts addicts (I wish they meant the real life Angel Dust drug) are dying, even a year after that substance was said to have been eradicated. All of these have no right of intertwining with the main (disgusting and wince-worthy) plot of the arc. Also, Re=L is off scot free after the betrayal (did she not ever get arrested for treason for that whole thing in the previous arc?), just to add on to what an irredeemable crock of shit this final arc is! Then, the finale. Oh boy. It's probably the most generic episode in the entire show. Turns of there was another traitor that posed as Leo's after he killed him part-way into episode 11, and the only thing resolved is the immediately inserted grudge match between the two. I don't even have the energy to go into any depth with this one, it's just generic and bleh, as if the show is not even trying to hide it's true colors anymore. Serves it right.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, if the narrative wasn't so shit in the way that it was, Glenn might have been an actually good character. Think about it: a cynic gave up his pursuit of being a hero of justice after the lives he took and lost now teaches the very thing he hates against his will while growing attached to his students despite everything. Despite what a radical shift in personality he has from past to present, if the writing did how I laid out above, he could've been a pretty good character, assuming they toned down the perviness completely and just made him cynical and partially lazy instead of basically a cross of Archer from UBW and Kazuma from Konosuba. I also like how he is an LN protagonist who isn't very overpowered, but that's not enough to save him from this awful writing. Celica is a hot and haughty woman who is basically never capable of being there since she\u2019s so overpowered that the narrative wouldn't throw a challenge unless they restrain her or just keep her or entirely beforehand. What I like about her is some of her almost motherly nature towards Glenn, like how she threatens Harvey for dissing him in her presence, even if the whole blackmail job thing was nonsense. Now, for the actual named side-characters with relevance outside of just one arc since I'm not even gonna cover the antagonists (partially since I kinda already did in as much detail as they deserve, barring one who I'll get to), nor will I cover small characters like the queen mother or the annoying parents of Sistine.\\n\\n\r\nSistine is a nightmare for her archetype. She aggressively checks out all of the boxes of a bad and clich\u00e9 tsundere and does it in a way that makes her especially obnoxious. The fact that she has this dynamic with a teacher makes me even more grossed out (regardless of both the nonsensical age dynamic and partially because nothing about this is brought up). She's also absurdly useless, to the point that this is a legitimate plot point that carries throughout each arc until she finally does one thing right in the finale. Rumia is basically a typical dere-dere of the group who is basically the MacGuffin for all of the arcs in this show. I've already talked about why Re=L is such a shit character so I'll cover one more: Albert. He\u2019s the stoic badass of the bunch whose hunch is always right, so there\u2019s not much to say on him. Lastly, why don't we talk about Leos? He is such a shitty character. He apparently had been asking Sistine our since they were kids and not only has he not let go of that, he has gone pathetic over it despite coming off as a decent person (typical of this trope), but again, the whole teacher and student bit makes it worse, and the fact that ha managed to spend only a paltry evening to be able to decipher everything about Glenn, Re=L, and Rumia is absurd, though it turns out it was this Justine guy from episode 11 who is just another evil LN bad guy for LN bad guy sake villain, since literally every single antagonist in this show is the exact same. They turned a crap and generic character into something creepier and stupider and then replaced him with the exact same character as every other villain in this retarded ass show; how typical! So yeah, that's everyone relevant. What a shit cast, am I right? As if the wasted potential as generic characters weren't bad enough, they reuse the same bad guy personality and have some truly horrible characters thrown into the mix. Let\u2019s move on before I die of embarrassment.\\n\\n\r\nThe audiovisuals aren't much better than the writing, unfortunately. Part of the problem this time isn't that the show is badly animated per se, but that its animation insanely limited. Its own damn OP has about as much animation as a typical episode of this show, and there are plenty of reused clips, like the clip of Albert pulling Re=L\u2019s hair or Sistine blasting Glenn with wind, and the slew of reused clips are reused at an insane rate with no remote variation. Hell, even the fight scenes have little animation, especially the one in episode 2 when Glenn beats up the attempted rapist. I initially couldn't stand the color palette but I got used to it. I already mentioned how awful the uniforms are so no need to repeat that. There is minimal (albeit terribly some CGI though it's blink and you miss it), but did there also have to be minimal animation too? Oh well, at least I like the eyes (they remind me of the trademark Studio White Fox eyes) and some of the admittedly humorous facial expressions. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP, \"Blow out\" by Konomi Suzuki is a pretty generic (if somewhat catchy) OP that feels like it should be part of a generic fantasy adventure anime, not a generic school battle anime with fantasy elements thrown in there. The ED, \"Precious You\u2606\" by Sistine Fibel (Akane Fujita), Rumia Tingel (Yume Miyamoto), Re=L Rayford (Ari Ozawa) is absurdly MediocRE that I never bothered listening to the entire minute and thirty second ED. The OST is decent in its own right but honestly feels misplaced here in the same vein as the OP in terms of where it feels more suitable, even despite the darker tone the series boasts on about half of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is probably one of the worst dubs Funimation has produced in recent memory. Next to none of the voices even remotely fit the characters and sound like they'd fit completely different sounding roles, like Monica Rial as Rumia and Josh Grelle as Glenn, but the absolute worst offender here is Sistine, played by Rachael Messer, whose acting not only sounds miscast, but at times, bad in its own right. The tertiaries and antagonist roles aren't good either, and some of them were doomed to be inferior (like Re=L since it's much harder for a dub to pull off a loli voice), and the only voice I sort of see working is Morgan Garrett as Celica. Then again, dubs have been getting worse in recent years, so I guess this is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I hate this show. I hate it so damn much. I only found one joke funny since it was the only one that wasn't predictable as shit, and that was in the very first episode. Any potential the story or characters had ended up being squandered rather quickly, which is frustrating since the first 6 episodes could've actually been pretty good had they removed the bullshit elements and made it a 12 episode series that fleshed these episodes out, though the last 6 are beyond terrible and impossible to redeem. Then again, the show lost any path to actual redemption during the rape attempt scene where they treat it with so little tact that there is comedy in the already drawn out scene. The lack of animation made the fights pretty dull as well, and a lot of the characters, namely Sistine and Re=L were infuriating to no end. There are times when a show offends me with how terrible it is, but when it happens more than once, let alone up to 5 times, that's when we know that the show is dogshit and that I'm in for a terrible experience. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I wasn't aggravated to some degree, whether it be mild or insane, I was pretty bored since the action was mediocre and the comedy didn't stick with me at all, and a lot of the awful LN school battle harem tropes are here in full display, sometimes taken to the most disgusting degrees possible to the point where I almost wanted to vomit. Also, the final arc is one of the most wince-worthy pieces of animation I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing as if arc 3 didn't piss me off enough to the point where the show went back from being bad but salvageable to irredeemable and truly abysmal again. Shame really, since the second arc was actually somewhat enjoyable at times and has the most potential to be good. So yeah, I'm basically repeating myself at this point so let\u2019s just move on to the final thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, it's almost cute to know that this show thinks it can get away with being typical trash that gives LNs a bad name just by adding more comedy, disgusting elements, and an occasionally bleak tone and more blood. It pretends to not be exactly like its brethren but does all of the same awful things you'd expect a show like this to do, only with a tinge of extra putridness. When there's a good idea, it's gleefully ruined, and the comedy is more predictable than a generic shounen anime. I've already spoken ad nauseam about basically everything wrong with the show and I'm basically repeating myself, but yeah, suffice it to say, this is one of the worst anime I've seen all year. Hopefully, this is a lesson to all of you that even among shows like this, there are still standards that some of them can meet and surpass their contemporaries, and that we don't just have absurd standards that only value high art. Also, hopefully you realize why this show is such a trap that you shouldn't fall for. This show scores disgustingly low compared to its peers. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "I love Akashic Records of Bastard Magical Instructor.  Sure, it isn't a totally unique anime by any means, but I still believe that something doesn't have to be unique to be great.  Especially since almost everything can be average or close to it if everyone broke down every show to a simpler form.  I'm sure even acclaimed works can be average if you approach them with a mind set of breaking the story into simpler aspects.  Well, before I start rambling too much, I love Akashic Records.  I'm not sure if this or Re:Creators takes my top spot for theseason, but either way, they are my top 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't the most unique, but it was really fun to watch.  It's suppose to be that Sisitine discovering some of the mysteries about the floating sky castle,  or at least it sounded that way at first;  I realize after reading the description again  that what I assumed was never the case and I just misread it.  So, it's actually more of what you would expect from a magic school anime, with some unique parts mixed in together.  The students favorite teacher leaves and is replaced by Glenn Radars, a very lazy and sarcastic professor, yet capable at the same time.  He doesn't show his skills at first though and he actually beaten by Sistine when they dual in the first episode, I believe it was.  His students realize they don't know nearly as much as they think they do, once Glenn starts teaching them all the ways to alter a simple shock bolt spell that they never knew was possible.   Pretty quickly, dark forces/ people lurking within the empire they live start showing up Glenn, Sistine, Rumia, and the others start being caught in all these traps as they arise.  Rumia is the damsel in distress many times, but it's more due to her past than just being a pretty girl people capture in order to use for stupid reason;  it's not completely ok that her abilities and past lead to her having that role, but it seemed to serve more of a purpose than just we need a girl captured type of thing, to me anyway.   As Glenn's past, Rumia's, even a little bit of Sistine's, all get revealed, the story just got more and more interesting.  It will probably feel like a dull story if you're not more than an average/ are a below average fan of magic battle shows.  In addition to these elements,  I'd also say it's like a story of growth between Glenn and his students.  His students bring out his better side and vice versa.  There's also a ton of funny moments through the plot and you just need a good comedy sometimes.  I'll give a 9/10 here, but I'm also a huge fan of magic battle shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is probably the most controversial part of the anime.  I love the character designs, detailed background scenes, detailed magic circles and move displays, etc.  The animation was actually really fluid too for the most part with some pauses and re-start ups, but that could've just been due to my computer and the settings I had up on crunchyroll.  I personally find the designs to be extremely memorable.  The weird school outfits (the controversial part) definitely help with this.  I'll admit they are weird, but they do help the character designs stand out.  Another personal 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is rather great too.  The music scores just felt like they had a slightly different tune to them than other magic battle scores.  The same goes for the opening and ending themes.  They may seem typical, but I'd say that they sound different and actually stand out as great songs.  I consider them among some of the better ones I've heard and each of them is pretty high up on my favorites.  I'll give the sound a 9.5/10 since both theme songs are among the best ones of the genre, in my book.  Precious You is my favorite ending theme of the spring 2017 season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are more of the love them or hate them kind of group, or at the like them or don't like them kind.  I don't see there being many in between opinions.  Glenn may be there to almost always save the day, but he sure as hell doesn't feel like a self insert.  I don't think a self-insert would be so snarky, lazy, have a dark past, and mess around as much as he does.  His personality just doesn't fit the self insert criteria to me, and he's a great protagonist, in my book.  Sisitine is a tsundere, but she doesn't seem like the typical one that acts out all the time and tried really hard to hide their feelings for most of the show.  She does act out in the beginning, but she's grows more accepting of Glenn and lets her guard down a bit earlier than many tsunderes do.  She also has a pretty strong sense of responsible and the will to fulfill her dream without taking drastic measures to do so.  I'd rather just leave my thought focused on the main two, and let the readers see the others for themselves.  I found something to like and or love about every character in the series, especially Glenn and Sisitine.  I'll give another personal 9.  \\n\\n\r\nI'll make my thought on my enjoyment very short.  I loved every minute of the anime and actually find some of it's weird aspects that are considered stupid and appalling by others to be parts of the show that make it stand out and put it at a high place among shows in the genre.  I'm giving a 10 here.  I'm also sorry that my review doesn't seem convincing, but I'd rather write it more for people who like the genre and are only a little hesitant to watch it rather than  to convince people who generally don't like these types of shows.  I hope it's of at least help.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rokudenashi is an unfortunate case of \"what could have been\".\r\nI'll try to keep this relatively concise and straight-to-the-point: Rokudenashi had the potential to be a modern version of Great Teacher Onizuka. While it has an overused magic academy premise, unlike most battle harems, the protagonist here is actually the teacher of one of its classes, and he is also a huge troll. Just like Onizuka, Glenn Radars is largely incompetent at normal teacher duties, preferring to let his students have self-study sessions all the time instead of having to put any effort in. However, he also has a lot of talent in other areas, especiallyconcerning unorthodox magic usage. What Glenn lacks inside the classroom he makes up outside of it, and his trollish interactions with his students is the main selling point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the first episode or two of Rokudenashi are very funny and entertaining, and show a lot of promise for the show as a whole. But unfortunately, from there on out it slowly starts to decline. Starting in episode three, the anime starts introducing actual outside villains and a much more serious story starts taking over as the main focus of the show instead of the previously light-hearted comedy theme. And sadly this is a big loss, because the majority of the show ended up becoming a rather generic action/fantasy light novel adaptation mixed with some drama as a result, featuring a somewhat overpowered MC and his sidekick heroines fighting a bunch of cheap bad guys with some rather uninteresting ulterior motives. In other words, the kind of anime you've seen dozens of times over already. It's not terrible but it's just extremely average when it's doing this, and considering how promising the show seemed to be at first, it feels like such a huge waste of potential. Sure, the magic system in this universe is pretty interesting and well-designed, but that doesn't actually end up amounting for much when the overall plot itself is so uninspiring.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that is still pretty good about Rokudenashi in the end though is the character cast. As mentioned already, Glenn is a pretty huge troll on top of being a good magic duelist, and overall he is a pretty likable protagonist, especially by harem MC standards. And yes I do think Rokudenashi should be called a harem even if it isn't currently labeled as one on MAL; while there aren't any public romantic themes, the vast majority of the supporting cast is female and it's pretty clear that most of them are very attached to Glenn. This is especially clear in the case of Fibel Sistine, who I guess would have to be considered the main heroine if you have to pick one, and who is also a skilled and clever magician, albeit a bit na\u00efve and dishonest at times, and she's also extremely pretty if you ask me. Her verbal arguments with Glenn are always a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Rokudenashi is still a pretty decent anime with generally likable characters and good chemistry in-between them, but it's also unfortunately dragged down quite a bit by its bland and generic storyline. It's hard to not be bothered by the feeling that it could have been so much better still had it just gone down a different direction plot-wise. But compared to most magic academy battle harems out there, this is still probably one of the better ones all things considered, even though I doubt I'd go out of my way to actively recommend it to people in the future. Though if you don't care too much about the story and you just want to see a fun and intelligent protagonist goofing around with a bunch of cute and likable girls then you'll be hard-pressed to find anything better.\\n\\n\r\nOh and by the way, Rokudenashi probably has the best female school uniforms I've ever seen in anime. Say what you want about the show itself, but hot damn those exposed bellies, miniskirts and garter belts are sexy as hell. A+ clothing design; top tier fanservice at its finest.",

(there's even a line by glenn that really stuck to me)\r\nand then the latest arc happened and im like.....why. i even enjoyed the chibi preview more than the actual episode itself. cliche af, ridiculous reactions, sistine is reduced to one of those \"oh MC is dying and i need to do cpr buT oHmE??? Do cPR?? LiPs TouCH??\" kinda girl and there are other flaws that make you go ?????, especially if the rationale part of your mind can't switch off\\n\\n\r\nit just becomes really lame and boring imo, especially compared to the first few eps. should probably give it one more chance since there are only 3 more eps to the end but ugh idk",

            "content": "This is my first review, I got an urge desire to write it as soon as I completed 6th episode. I will try to avoid or warn about spoilers that will be included in the review. It's supposed to be subjective. not objective, so it's highly possible, that you will not agree with things that I wrote.\r\nIntroduction:\r\nI was really amazed after watching first episode, I thought that it would be one of the better shows at the moment, however episode by episode I was getting more and more disappointed.\r\nStory:\r\nFirst episode really hyped me about the serie, even though I do not like anime with fanservice elements this seemed to be decent one.\\n\r\nI got everything I could imagine, story as well. It looked like atleast avarage script: main storyline, a piece of mystery and unknown history of the characters.\\n\r\nIn the next episode I was feeling really sad about the development, the point of mystery has been revealed very fast - didn't have time to try and solve it by myself, storyline got worse - nothing more surprised me, new threads that has been introduced had less and less sense, it got dumber and some situations happened out of blue, without any backgrounds just appeared on the stage like a block of ice on a desert.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI can't say anything special about the art, it was nice, not bad. Just like one of those generic shows that are airied to just exist, without further purpose. I didn't pay big attention to details, but the art didn't delight me and didn't disappoint as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere weren't any tracks that would caught my curiousity, opening music seems mediacore to me as well. For me it's one of those shows that the only purpose is to watch and forgot after a week. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIt's one of those things that made me really sad about the whole.\\n\r\nAt the beggining we get a few characters that could be developed great...\\n\r\nBut they aren't.\\n\r\nAfter the second or thrid episode we realize that the main character is one of those pseudo badass characters, who is legitimately OP, everything that he's doing ends good, there is no bad ending for his actions.\\n\r\nAnother character is a grey haired (for the next few lines there might be a minor spoiler) tsundere girl, aka notice me pedophile senpai, the thing is that the senpai is not a pedophile.\\n\r\nSo yeah, she is just another \"person\", that is supposed to be a part of the background and support to main character, wasted opportunity to make this show better.\\n\r\nBlonde girl is pretty similar to previous one, just a character that needs a protection and needs being supervised by the hero 24/7. Nothing much to tell about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFirst episode really caught my attention and curiousity, however any further made me want to turn of the show and drop it as soon as possible.\\n\r\nJust another generic show that doesn't give me any joy at all, because of earlier overused jokes and clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR | Summary\\n\r\nFirst episode seemed to be great, the rest were generic poop.\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nPersonally, basing on my own feelings I would give this show 1/10, but on the other hand thanks to an avarage art and sound I'm giving it 3/10.",

            "content": "Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is your typical clich\u00e9 harem anime, with bits of comedy, action, magic, and of course high-school girls. Now,  bashing this anime for that would be very illogical, since the target audience is not the people that look for a good storyline, it's not the people that look for a lot of character development, and it's not the people that want to decode an anime in every single aspect. Therefore judging it on these factors does not make sense, so I will judge it based on it's intended audience, and based on the overall delivery. \r\nThis anime is forpeople that want to enjoy a bit of clich\u00e9, it is for the people that don't mind the slightly erotic schoolgirl uniforms and it is for the people that enjoy a bit of magical action thrown into the mix. Now don't get me wrong, it's not all fanservice, there is a plotline, there is some character development, but nothing that hasn't been done before, and like previously mentioned, these factors are irrelevant, due to the intended audience of this anime. The characters are likable, the MC is fairly unique in many aspects, with some character development, and decent backstory. We do explore a bit about the backgrounds of some of the students of the magic academy, and the characters that were previously associated with the MC, but obviously with there being only 12 episodes, you can't expect those to be very thorough or go into a lot of depth. The art is average, it is nothing that differentiates itself from the other anime, therefore it is not something I want to write about. The sound and music do help the story portray the different themes, and it does help the viewer understand the mood and the situation, although again, I'd say it's average.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I have enjoyed this anime for what it is, I think it has delivered what it aimed to deliver to it's intended audience, and in my opinion, it is a great anime to watch if you're looking for something to kill the time with. It also did well on keeping me intrigued, even though it's fairly predictable at times, at no point did I feel like not wanting to watch the next episode, probably due to the attachment I had to the characters, and the contrasting, complex character of Glenn's, the fact that he is not at all portrayed as a strong MC, and his creative solutions when it comes to problem-solving. So, I think if you do have some spare time, and you're looking for an anime that just wants to make you cheer up, laugh, and enjoy yourself, then do give Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, and personally, I would rate this anime as 7/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "In a world where students wear stripper-like uniforms:\r\nOne man--- a \u201cbastard\u201d of a teacher--- is called upon by a powerful and beautiful mage to teach those young stripper students the fundamentals of magic theory. ---Although in reality the powerful mage was just trying to get his lazy, isolated, moochingass out of the house. \r\nThus, the story begins\u2026\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAt first the main character, Glen Radars, appears to be a generic all-powerful MC at first, BUT WAIT! Is he really...? This anime has a knack for throwing in (kind of) unexpected plot twists for comedic purposes. Glen Radars has more depth to him than meets the eye.The story follows him and his interactions with his students as he builds his pseudoharem--- wait what? What I meant to say was, \u201cthe story (supposedly) follows him as he builds a relationship with his students and helps them reach their full potential through his unconventional teaching methods\u201d. However, you never know when tragedy might strike in this magical world, because there is always a hidden air of danger lurking in the shadows. Who is Glen Radars? Who are the students, really? Does any of that really matter? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this series.\\n\\n\r\nReading the previous paragraph may make you believe that show is relatively serious, but, while it does have some pretty serious aspects,  the bulk of the show is more focused on comedy and magic. Some of this anime\u2019s main selling points are largely related to its unexpected comedy. Often times this comedy happens between Glen Radars and the white haired girl, Sistine Fibel. It was a bit refreshing to see a pseudoharem rather than a real harem, which has overplayed over the past few years. Each of the main character students have their own hopes, dreams, and issues. Their issues are revealed more as the series progresses, and I believe that they were revealed at the proper pace. If you are not a fan of harem anime, you most likely won\u2019t like this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the weakest aspect of this show. Generic archetypal side characters, generic main characters, the only real exceptions are Glen Radars and perhaps ReEl, who also happened to be my fav char in this anime. Sistine is presented as a very intelligent, dedicated student who will not stand for any teacher that disrespects magic and her right to learn. However, Gled Radars, being the lazy bastard that earned this anime its title, will not be broken so easily and forced to teach stripper students. The clashes between their personalities creates an interesting dynamic as the series progresses. Rumia Tingel is basically of your generic warm character that isn\u2019t clumsy. ReEl comes off as kind of odd/aloof and ends up being all types of annoying/interesting in my opinion, but I\u2019ll leave that up to decide after you watch because I can\u2019t include any more information without spoilers~\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very basic. In comparison to more recent anime, the characters do not have a wide variety of facial expressions, the backgrounds aren\u2019t too detailed, and the special effects aren't exactly the greatest either. The art is pretty average for a professional studio. Still frames, few dramatic camera angles, relatively low frame-rate. The art is really nothing special. However, the character designs may be appealing to a lot of guys. Especially so if you like garter belts, crop tops, and mini skirts. Other than that there\u2019s really not much special about the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6/10 \\n\r\nThe music sounds like music that you would hear in the background of old TV advertisements, you know the ones that go, \u201cBut wait\u2026 THERE\u2019S MORE! If you call now, we\u2019ll DOUBLE the offer.\u201d Yeah. It\u2019s a bit of a change from most other anime out there and it\u2019s kinda interesting. The characters were voiced pretty well. Though there wasn\u2019t really anything too special about the voice acting either. There wasn\u2019t a voice acting scene that stood out so much that it left an impact on its viewers. For example, if you search \u201cWhen Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace - I don't understand\u201d on youtube, the first result will be a great example of great voice acting. There was nothing like that here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nI thought it was pretty good. It was a slight change of pace from a shitty and generic harem anime. Good enough for me. I could see myself recommending this to some anime fans of comedy and harem anime though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6/10\\n\r\nIt had its moments, it had it\u2019s flaws. The story, at times, can actually be pretty serious. At other times relatively humorous and has some innuendos. It does a good job at balancing the comedy and humor, but the characters are pretty generic overall. That quality takes away from the story\u2019s potential quite a bit. The music was TV ad background music and the voice acting was pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to you personally? \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of harem anime, comedy, magic, romance, cute girls, ecchi, then go for it. It\u2019s pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something more serious, then you are definitely not in the right place buddy.",

The comedy in this is almost on par with that main protagonist in Steins;Gate.

Would recommend even as one not overly obsessed with anime. :)",

It starts with a bang, delivering perfect episodes that balances out fresh Comedy with serious Action very well in a Magic Academy setting. Sadly, it can't end on the same note as new arcs with new characters are introduced late in the game that aren't given much exposition. Still they do a good job with explaining the magic of this world logically, making it sound both interesting and realistic. This is further supported by the shows focus on the studentsto NOT just become a bookworm, rather participate willingly to field work as well. However, I would have liked more explanation with the makeup of spells and their mana cooldowns. In addition, I would have liked more types of magic used during combat rather than the few we get to see. And the competition arc needed a bit more flare to it cause at certain parts they came close to mading me felt like I was in Hogwarts! And while the plot is nice, the storytelling is weak which is why some things go unexplained like what\u2019s the use of gems when casting strong magic or what\u2019s the secret behind Rumia being an 'Amplifier' or what is really an 'Amplifier' in this world? The current story arcs don't have a conclusion and they leave an open end to the series, so I would have liked more closure, who doesn't? Plus, the last few episodes felt rushed and I am not a fan of it! We also get to see a lot of blood in this show, but then again the anime isn\u2019t exactly 'Rated R' since it refrains from showing violent deaths. And while they couldn't get their storytelling right, they did a better job with their characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters all get fleshed out pretty well and have their moments to shine! But the spotlight wasn't consistent with the girls, since the show would focus on each individual while the others would remain more of a side character like Re=L for instance. She is a weird one who apparently has only 1 strategy on her mind, which is Attack! And I\u2019m afraid no matter how much our MC squeezes her brains out, she will remain a thickhead forever! However, she is scary and despite her deadpan look, her unpredictability can make you her enemy or a friend in a matter of seconds. Removing swords from the ground and stabbing people is all she knows! Rumia, on the other hand, is strongminded but comes across a bit na\u00efve as well as an optimist which is further explored by her insight and desire to help people with magic. Regrettably, she's also the unlucky one who finds herself in the 'damsel in distress' situation all the time which gets boring so I would have liked something else from her. Albert comes across cool and mysterious but turns out to be a good friend who apparently has a thing for cats! And 'White Cat', ahem, I mean Sistine has quite a temper, I particularly enjoyed her frame of inner struggle dilemma which she gladly overcomes. (Side Note: I found her parents funny!) While she comes off as a hardworking student from a prestigious background, her relationship with Glenn is the most interesting thing about her. The have a rocky start but they do warm up to each other eventually. I particularly liked this setup since the 2 are polar opposites of each other so we get to witness the classic romantic tale of Opposites Attract! (Though they still need a lot of work for us to take them seriously) Thankfully the MC is always at the centre of the story cause he's just amazing! I loved his quick remarks and his constant trolling nature despite being a lazy bastard as the title entails! He's very strong as well with a rich yet dark history that's moderately explored but it\u2019s his attitude and resolve as a magician and teacher that helps him in standing out! Radars is hella lot of fun to be around as he makes fun of his students and teachers. Thankfully this is just an outer layer, like a mask, to hide away his true self which is dark, gloomy and bloody. Constantly haunted by his past mistakes, he wants to erase all of that with something useful and positive. And lastly, Celica was left as a background character which sucked cause she\u2019s so powerful, but she seems to have more going on in the next season so I won't complain for now.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting is top notch across the board with Josh Grelle stealing the show once again! He just has so much fun with this role and it clearly shows with his Comedic line delivery like \u2018Later Nerds!\u2019 or \u2018You may now kiss my A**!\u2019 which always springs a smile to my face. Glenn's expressions are on point which helps in delivering his lines across and that makes him a fun Main Character. The smile of Rumia mirrored her mother\u2019s which was a nice touch. Sistine, voiced by Rachael Messer and Celica, voiced by Morgan Garrett had a certain flair to their accents which helped them in standing out. Sistine rages of fit or screams are well done and Celica\u2019s concern for Glenn is shown by the warmness emanating from her which further bands the Big Sis, Little Bro kinda relationship between them. The animation is simple but beautiful when it wants to be, especially the magic casting parts. I liked how healing spells represented bright colours with soothing sound effects while dangerous spells had sharp colours with quick and loud sound effects. The OP is catchy due to it\u2019s upbeat track that can easily be assigned as your ringtone, but I didn\u2019t like the ED very much as it sounded very generic.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favs from last year, it even ended up in my Top 5 Anime list of 2017! It\u2019s not perfect as it tries to cram around 4 arcs in just 12 episodes, so you can tell when details are omitted out. Still it's very good for it's 1st season and I have high expectations for S2. I hope they organize their storytelling better and improve the screentime for their characters along with some further development. Also, if they had refrained from rushing their story, this anime would have made a bigger impact with the audience. I also thought the costumes for the girls were too showy which didn't make sense and I absolutely adored the short theatre skits at the end of each episode. Overall this certainly made me laugh and care for the characters and I would love to see their next adventure in the coming season. (P.S. where's the Comedy tag cause this s*** is funny!)",

            "content": "Because do not be fooled, the first episode is absolutely AWFUL. The cast is uninteresting and full of tropes, the motivation is stupid, the magic is mediocre to look at, the ecchi feels like it was included as an afterthought (yeah, yeah, just make all the girls in the school wear 50% less clothes for no reason) and the main character is pathetic at best... Until you get to the second episode. This is by far the best example of how NOT to start your show, but holy crap if it doesn't change its tune for episode two. I'm actually mad that the author undersoldhis own work so bad right off the bat. Especially since the approach this show takes to magic is actually really interesting once they dive into it.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode two feels like the beginning of something great. It cuts a lot of the bullshit and has some much darker (even somewhat disturbing) content, as well as a lot of hints and explanations for each character's motivation and attitude. The classic stuck up rich girl gets a logical and even somewhat heartwarming reason for why she takes magic and her education so seriously. The typical nice girl gets a darker albeit cliche past, and the teacher gets fleshed out into a real, likeable character. There's still a lot of show to go, and obviously there are some growing pains, but I genuinely think it will be worth keeping up with if the second episode is any indication of things to come.",

            "content": "What starts off as a setup with substantial potential in the first three establishing episodes of this series, rapidly devolves over the course of the next nine. Don't get me wrong -- a lot of the elements put in place for this anime are highly cliche and uninspired (and not in a satirical way); however, don't get me wrong in the other direction -- this anime is also not awful. In fact, I'd say the first three episodes led me to believe that it'd be significantly above average. \r\nEnter Glenn Radars -- deceptively versatile, but incorrigibly opportunistic and frustratingly dispassionate. Did this anime attempt tomake him an antihero but miss its mark? From the moments we meet him, showing absolutely no concern for his female students' right to privacy (and basking to their nakedness before him), to the final episodes, admitting harboring motivation that would see him wedlock out of shallow desire to never work another day in his life (through marrying up in caste), his lazy demeanor and sleazy treatment of other characters doesn't end up being integral to the primary plot (or his development as a character). (If we can even call this a plot -- it's mostly just a disjointed series of \"things happening\",  which doesn't define an actual plot.) An anti-hero is supposed to be someone who acts out of self-interest because of their nature, environment, past experiences, and other context, and that says something about the world around them. For example, Holden Caulfield from A Catcher in the Rye is a true anti-hero; he's disaffected, cynical, and sarcastic because he experiences the alienation and isolation associated with growing into an adult world full of hypocrisy and fakeness. Han Solo from A New Hope is another great example - he does things that advantage him in a galaxy ruled by forced order mixed with unattended lawlessness. And while this Glenn Radars main character has clearly-needed back-story to exposit why he's first shown to detest magic (I suspected it involved tragedy that would be tied directly to the forthcoming narrative), when all of this is revealed it still doesn't explain why he is how he is. Why is he so lazy and so scummy? It only explains why he \"doesn't like magic\" during the first two episodes of the anime; otherwise, the reasons for his attributes are weakly expounded. He also had clear room to grow as a dynamic character that could face his past in an increasingly mature way while learning from his new experiences in a new position of guiding, teaching, and protecting his students. This also didn't happen. Holden Caulfield remains jaded, but at least he learns things and tells his story with surprising honesty. Glenn Radars doesn't learn anything. Han Solo realizes that there's value in risking his life for a greater cause of liberty and autonomy, through developing connections with Luke and Leia. Glenn Radars always knew that risking his life is worth it (as evidenced by his back-story), so why attempt to make him an anti-hero? If they wanted to do something that made sense with his back-story, the writers should have explored his dealing with loss in a much different way, instead of making him lazy and contemptible. But it's hard to make things funny that way with levity, so they built him into a chauvinistic asshat with little regard of other human beings as people with feelings, even behind the bravado of protecting Sistine's prospects of applied magic, or safeguarding Rumia's life. This lends the anime to funny moments, but also fails to delve into real, human experience of love, loss, sacrifice, withdrawal. Revenge and acceptance. Depression vs drive. It never feels like Glenn is internally vulnerable; he's too sure of himself and the backstory feels too devisive. \\n\\n\r\nBut the main character isn't the only flaw. I've already referenced it, but the more egregious problem (which probably ruins the characters in terms of development), is the narrative. \\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica. Sakamichi no Apollon. Usagi Drop. If you think of short-form 12-episode anime that are *exceptional*, their compact form justifies their scope and reflects their pacing. Everything starts from a strong foundation of structured, deliberate form, as well as unique storytelling of smartly-crafted character-driven narrative. Characters change. Relationships between them are ephemeral. And, most importantly, the narrative tells a story, through those characters, that means something. Kids on the Slope brings very contrasting characters together through mutual appreciation for the language of jazz. Usagi Droppu explores the challenges associated with raising children. And Madoka Magica is about existentialist themes of dedication and creating meaning. But I'm confused what Akashic Records is about. Is it about finding meaning after loss? Is it about pursuing passion? Is it a critique about just vs unjust use of power? This leads me to the core fundamental problem with this series - it's unfocused. It turns into a rushed jumbled mess. It assaults the viewer with so much sensory resulting in too many unresolved threads, fails to fully address plot holes or tie up plot points, or fully flush out the back-stories so that we can actually care about the characters more than, say, a \"5, mediocre\" status. We get a main character whose true characteristics (underneath all of the \"lazy asshat\" facade) are unclear, faced by antagonistic forces whose motivations are under-developed, rushed into the story's plotpoints with little establishment, with arcs that are unnecessary or random. Imagine attempting to cram 25 episodes of some great anime (say, Spice and Wolf or Code Geass) into 12 episodes, but then remove two key episodes and add two filler episodes. That's what this feels like. \\n\\n\r\nIt borrows a lot from current hype trends in anime, but it still had definite potential that feels wasted because of poor planning and a rushed structure . But don't tell me that I need to read the manga or wait for another season to come out, in order to have a firmer understanding of this anime's purpose. This should stand on its own merits alone. In the end, it's not meaningful to me, but it's still a fun time. Sistine is a cute, if overdone, tsundere archetype, and Re-L is adorably clueless. I like the way magic is represented in the anime, and the action scenes are competently choreographed and animated. The dialogue is good in general, if you can look past the contextual plot problems. The voice acting is pretty good, as well as other elements of the production value, and it's entertaining even while I'm frustratingly trying to connect with the characters or themes of the show. I won't bother getting into many details about the revealing character designs, the fan service, or the minor inconsistencies and weird plot arcs - this anime had more fundamental issues (than just execution) that I wanted to address, like how they dealt with the anti-hero and how they structured the narrative, and I think other reviewers have talked about these various other problems sufficiently. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend this if:\\n\r\n* you want a new best-girl tsundere that's well animated and voice acted\\n\r\n* you don't mind a confused plot in an overdone magic high school setting\\n\r\n* you could use some light fun with moderately humorous scenes and dialogue\\n\r\n* I have to admit that it's a cute show, even if it's nonsensical - especially the preview cuts at the end of each episode, with this kind of self-referential humor, etc. that this anime doesn't take itself too seriously as an art form",

May they be a classmate, work colleague or a friend of a friend, a certain someone will just appear out of nowhere and make you instantly despise them. It's an unspoken rule that we can't like everyone we meet, but the individuals that grind your gears to a state of disrepair are the unforgivable worst of the worst.\r\nAkashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor is pretty much about the second half of the title. A new teacher joins Alzano Imperial Magic Academy, and he's a bastard. Big surprise. You'dexpect a kind of School Comedy with maybe some Action thrown in since they are learning Magic, but Akashic Records decides to give us much more. Too much. The story jumps from arc to arc, which all follow the same boring predictable formula. Obvious villain appears, (like come on could you be any more conspicuous?) pull out some cliches, Glenn and co proclaim their friendship and love as teacher and students, defeat villain. Sure the try and explore some of the main characters and add some suspense inducing drama, but they just fail at keeping us invested or entertained most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Glenn, is a bastard, or at least he tries to be. His act is so forced due to the fact that he's actually a decent person, he just chooses to hide behind his trope shield so the premise of the anime doesn't become irrelevant. The other two mains, Sistine Fibel and Rumia Tingel. aren't much better. One is a tsundere and the other has a heart of gold. That's it. All they're there for is to be damsels in distress so Glenn can save the day. Although we see a couple of times where they help their teacher defeat the bad guy, it just comes down as plot convenience instead of \"strong female characters\" that can hold their own. Looking past other characters, a sword-wielding kuudere who's also a damsel in distress and an old buddy of Glenn's who helps provide us with exposition and battle support, everyone else is pretty empty. You have an entire class of students, a few teachers, and some more friends of Glenn's, but barely any of them get a hint of exploration. At most, they're all just props for the generic comedy skits the show puts on. (Although I can't deny that I did chuckle at parts of the show)\\n\\n\r\nNow you could say the action is nice. At first, it was pretty amusing watching Glenn use his limited skills to defeat others, but soon it just went downhill. You already know Glenn will defeat them after overcoming a small obstacle, (Power of Friendship everybody!) and the anime makes no effort to try and compensate for that. It just becomes another layer added onto the show as it tries to make up for its run of the mill story.\\n\\n\r\nThe title also mentions an \"Akashic Records\" in it's first half. What is this record you ask? I don't know. They mention it once or twice and just kinda forget about it, and that's how most of the plot points go. We don't find out much about The Researchers of Divine Wisdom, or the Alzano Empire Royal Family, or the Imperial Court Mage Corps. They're just thrown in during different arcs to keep shit interesting. This anime had a decent amount of material they could explore, but it decided to just screw it and hope what they do present is acceptable. (It's not)\\n\\n\r\nAkashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor is not an enjoyable show. It had its fun moments but they were overshadowed by everything else Akashic did wrong. Maybe if you don't mind all the predictability and cliches, you could probably have fun with this mess, but if you perhaps want some that doesn't dig itself so deep into the norm that it becomes unbearable, avoid this show. Don't be a Fool.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Just wanna rant about the uniforms the girls wear. Why do they show their lower body for all the world to see? And those skirts. Might as well just force them to dress in nothing but their panties cause you're gonna use them for fanservice either way. What kinda bullshit school lets their students dress like this? What the fuck?\\n\\n\r\nEnd Rant",

            "content": "Because magic is such a foreign concept grounded in the limits of one's imagination, the possibilities for stories based around magic are virtually limitless.  So what happens when you combine the concept of magic with an arcic harem setup?  Well you get this show.  Whoever thought this was a good show idea is a bastard for sure.  \r\nStory: Glenn Radars is a man without any motivation for anything.  With his guardian, Celica, threatening him and forcing him to get off his ass to do something with his life, he ends up at the magic school that also serves as Celica'sworkplace, and ultimately becomes a magic teacher much to his chagrin.  \\n\\n\r\nAkashic Records is a very arc-heavy (or as I refer to as arcic) show.  The series itself is split into 4 arcs spanning roughly 3 episodes each, with the general focus of each episode being Glenn saving and involving himself with one of the three main girls in the series: Rumia, Re=L, and Sistina in that order.  General arc flow involves something evil plot relating to each of the three girls, things get dire, and Glenn saves the day.  Rinse, repeat, do it again.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the story for Akashic Records becomes monotonous and quite predictable.  It's not bad per-say, as the presentation for each arc gives the audience some more world building and a better look into the mysterious past life of our main protagonist, but because each arc is just another rehash of a story setup done countless times, it's very hard to be invested in it, especially since each arc is so short and there's very little buildup before we end and move onto the next girl.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I find is exposition.  In order to educate the audience about aspects of the magic concepts that they didn't know before, the show inputs heaps of exposition in various parts of the series from character introductions to new magic studies and research.  As a result, the flow of the series feels slightly choppy because we're given what's essentially a wall of text to tell us who this person is or what kind of magic that's being put at the forefront right now.  Doing this makes it clear that it's important to this section of the story (and nowhere else), so it just makes it all the more easier to know what's coming the audience's way.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Akashic Records's story is average at best.  With a predictable arc-heavy setup as the formula for its story telling, the story ends up becoming very easy to guess and as such, relieves a lot of the built up tension the show attempt to create.  Not only that, but the 'Akashic Records' that's in the title is barely even mentioned. Pretty sure it's the end-all be-all of the series, but since we only got a small bit of the whole story, the fact that we're led on that it plays a part kinda sucks.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Worldbuilding through exposition\\n\r\n+/- Arc heavy storytelling\\n\r\n-  Extremely predictable \\n\r\n-  Very little tension despite alluding to it\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: You're either Glenn or the 3 main girls.  If you're not, you're unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nGlenn Radars is a cocky, selfish, self-congratulating bastard of a teacher.  (I mean the show is called 'Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor' in translation after all.)  As a character, Glenn plays the duality of roles of being the series's main asshole, as well as the show's secret badass.  Haunted by a past that he doesn't like talking about (Cause everyone has one of those), Glenn's character changes as the series goes along from a jerkface to someone who genuinely thinks positively of being a magic instructor while at the same time, fixing all of the series's conflicts because \"I'M THE MAIN PROTAGONIST\" and because he wants to be a 'mage of justice'.  (Archer would like to talk to you btw.)  While the characterization is nice, it's how easy all of the problems are solved which is the problem.  As mentioned before, Glenn solves literally all of the conflicts that this series has, and as a result, makes the show very predictable and kinda lackluster.  There's not any serious loss that the series shows us on-screen, so any potential weight that the show might have dissipates because the main character is always there to say the day.\\n\\n\r\nThen there're the three girls: Rumia, Re=L, and Sistina, better known as the kind, understanding girl, the kuudere loli, and your typical tsundere.  As far as personalities go, this is about the extent that these girls have.  While true we do get a better idea of them and their past as a result of the show devoting an entire arc of equal length and time to each of them beyond their devoted arc, they don't really do or get anything.  If anything, they sink back into the background while the one currently in front gets the spotlight and their respective damsel in distress story.  Oh yeah, they also really like making at least Rumia a damsel in distress.  It's actually really annoying considering she's the only girl of the 3 that's even slightly annoying sometimes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast involves members of the imperial mage corps (who barely get any screentime), some other teachers in the magic school, one-off villains who you won't really remember cause they get defeated so quickly that we're already on the next arc, and the rest of Glenn's class who're only there to...be a class of students.  These characters are only there to make some kind of meaning or worth to the conflicts that the series presents or 'expand' the world in a way that it feels like there're more people that're important than there really are.  Also, the evil organization known as the 'Researchers of Divine Wisdom' that the show says are scary, really aren't?  I mean obviously they're just building their resources or knowledge up for the series finale, but the lack of tension really makes it hard to see them, frankly anyone, as a threat.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Some characterization for the main cast\\n\r\n-  Main girls really are just tropes beyond their arc\\n\r\n-  Side characters are just screen fodder\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Lidenfilms, the art for Akashic Records is...standard.  The art itself doesn't stand out that much, as everything looks like a brightly colored show that's slightly muted in its color palette.  Action is semi-fluid only because of the varying shots they use to choreograph the fights, but most of it is just magic blasting out of their hands after they spend 5 second chanting.  The magic circles however are nice and detailed, so that's a nice little detail they do consistently.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint with the art however is the design of the school uniforms, particularly the female uniforms.  I know it's there for fanservice, but dear lord the girls look more like strippers than students of a magic academy.  With skirts shorter than hotpants, straps just wrapping their abdomen and lower body, and different gloves on each hand, the design for the female uniform in particular is just a clunky, incohesive design that's only there to make up for the lack of bath scenes or other classic fanservice moments that the show lacks.  I just...don't like it.  (And it doesn't help when the male uniform is completely covered and everything.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Art is standard fare\\n\r\n-  Terrible, terrible uniform design.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for Akashic Records is nothing special.  The OP, \"Blow Out\" is an action song that starts out sounding interesting, but quickly turns into any other high energy song that many other shows have.  It's honestly quite good, but it just doesn't have anything unique about it to make it neither special nor memorable in the sense that you'd want to listen to it over and over again.  \\n\\n\r\nIts ED, \"Precious You\" shares the same problem.  Sung by the girls' seiyuus, the song is a cheerful and bright song that while sounds good, really has nothing great going for it.  Its only real draw is the fact that it's the seiyuus singing it, but that's about it.  Overall, the soundtrack just suffers by not being anything special or unique, resulting in a decent, but not fantastic OST.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Average soundtrack that's not really memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: While currently at the time of this review, Akashic records is one of the more popular anime this season, this show just...doesn't really do a lot for me.  I've seen this plot, this concept, and many aspects of it time and time again, and seeing it again with another coat of paint on is just really, really dull.  I don't hate this show, as nothing about it is really aggravating, but nothing about it makes me want to give a damn.  Oh, there's a conspiracy...oh no...a hidden fianc\u00e9 we didn't know about appears...oh dear...what're we gonna do...  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nNot...particularly.  I read some of the source material, so I ended up watching this.  There're far worse things out there, but I didn't really find any specific enjoyment while watching this.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, it's the fact that Rumia was a damsel in distress character.  She doesn't come off as one, but since the series knows that she's super important, they relegate her to that role.  It's not fun seeing a character become a damsel, so if anything, that'd be something about this show I hate.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking to kill time or for a magic show without much investment, than Akashic Records suits the bill.  The show itself knows what it is, and doesn't really aspire to be more than what it presents us in the first couple episodes.  As a result, while the show may be kinda dull, it's consistent, and if you're looking for something with consistency and a really heavy status quo after every couple episodes, than this is probably something that you're looking for.",

That's why cliches become a thing. \r\nNow, let's talk a bit about the show itself. Well, I do have to say that this show is based upon cliched ideas - but that provides a good foundation for the show.

If you feel disgusted or i've scared you off from watching the show then please for the love of god bear with me\\n\\n\r\nthe thing is that despite the fact that it's really generic, it's generic done well. The MC's personality is snarky and entertaining and steals the show every time he's on-screen. Despite his trump card he rarely actually gets shit done and is more of a fuck-up than anything. At first glance it might seem like the show is going one direction but then throws a huge fuck you and does something you didn't expect to happen. The show is self aware to the point where it almost parodies shows similar to itself. Yes there's action in the show, but there's also comedy and usually a punchline somewhere in said action to let the viewer know that the show doesn't take itself too seriously. It's sad that most people will merely write this off as some generic garbage after one episode and call it a day.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of numbered ratings, since it's so vague what you really mean by said number, people who really enjoy a show might just drop a 10 and not think things through enough and that's that. so before you write my 7 off as some fence-sitting middle-of-the-road review know this.

            "content": "*Note: There are no spoilers in this review.*\r\nI saw this anime recently, and at the time this review was written it had a score of 7.54, which is not incredibly high, but it was new so I wanted to try it out. This anime honestly surprised me, and I think this is one of the best anime of the year, if not the last few years. This review may seem like \"Oh, he rated all 10's so this is biased\" or whatever, but honestly, I have to admit this is one of the best action-comedy anime I have seen.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is about a lazymage who starts teaching at the school. The first few episodes do a great job of introducing the characters and making them feel relatable and lovable. But the last few really develop the story well and make this world more interesting. Honestly, this anime is both one of the most epic I've seen and one of the most hilarious. Definitely recommended if you are into action or comedy. The story is not developed well enough in 12 episodes, though, and\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art style, as seen from previews or the poster art, is very modern, but sleek. The characters look cool, and the background is nice. But most importantly, the animation for the fights is amazing. The fights are so epic, I could watch them for days. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe battle music is epic, the opening is epic, the sounds of the swords clashing and the spells being cast is epic. All of the sounds in this anime contribute to the epicness of this anime. All I can say is that sometimes the ending music does not really fit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are super relatable and very fitting. They are very unique, and they contribute to the comedy but also to the action in some scenes. Overall, not much to say,\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the most enjoyable anime. I would recommend binge watching, as it is so epic you don't want to stop watching it. This anime gave me some of the best laughs, but also some of the most epic action I have seen. All I have to complain about is the story is not developed enough, but that does not reduce the enjoyment one bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime. It's one of the best of the season and of all time in its genre.\\n\\n",

            "content": "There's always that anime that seems like it's good but when it's over, the reviews change from giving it an 8 to a 5. This is one of those cases.\r\nWhen you watch the first episode, it does feel a little underwhelming because if i'm being completely honest...it was pretty irritating. However, after you watch more and more episodes, it begins to get better and better. It has the right amount of suspense that would make you want to watch more but also have some comedy mixed here and there, to not make you completely bored.\r\nThe only problem with the anime is it's lack of originality.The characters have their own tropes and their personality doesn't really go beyond that. The only one that feels fleshed out is Glenn Sensei. He was probably one of the more better characters in this Spring Season. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, despite the whole cliche thing, the anime itself was still a fun show to watch and really, you shouldn't have any high expectations when watching this. From reading the synopsis alone, you can already guess that this was going to be generic. Doesn't mean it's bad though.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like fanservice, comedy, fun characters, and an overall pretty good time then watch this. If you want something more \"deeper\" then go watch something else as this isn't going to be your cup of tea.",

Seeing Gleen Radars as a teacher is definitely interesting with his out-of-the-book teaching style, but it such a waste to see it ended up like usual anime that belongs in the same genre in the end. \r\n7.5/10.

            "content": "Akashic Records is a trope and cliche ridden series with very few original ideas, however, those original ideas shine bright. As someone on reddit put it, this is the perfect definition of a 7/10 anime. Our main character, Glenn, is a lovable asshole who is a rare competent protag. (Mostly.) Our heroine, Sistine, is a very cute tsundere done right. It takes place in a magical academy where the show shines, showcasing an original and interesting magic system. In fact, one of the early episodes spends the entire time explaining the magic, and it was fantastic. However, what brought this show down was the story.It wasn't bad per say, but I wouldn't write home about it either.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes spend a ton of time goofing around with your typical SoL stuff, while the last episodes go to a gritty and dark place. Its jarring really, with the sudden tonal shift in between episodes. Art wise, it is a very beautiful show, magical effects are fantastic, characters are cute, and environments are your typical medieval fantasy, but they still look good. Near the end of each episode, a small little chibi short is played as well as a beautifully drawn end card. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound department did not do as well however. The opening and ending are forgettable, and only a few songs in the OST really stick out to me. Overall, not very good.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters can both be a high and low point of the show. Glenn and Sistine are high points, while Halley (bet it took you a second to remember who that was) and Rumia are low points. Glenn and Sistine are good, complex characters with their own motivations. Halley is literally just a joke character, while Rumia had potential but ultimately fell flat because she was little more than a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was an enjoyable look into a magical world that had potential but ultimately fell flat due to business decisions (haha go read the light novel if you want to know what happened!) and a poorly paced plot. Had this been a two cour show, this could've been fantastic. Unfortunately, we do not live in that alternate reality. Still though, it is a fairly interesting anime with enough pros that it outweighs the bad things.",

            "content": "Despite decent rating for this anime on MAL, I tried to keep my expectation low. But even so, I am still disappointed. The story is average and unoriginal. Filled with dozens of cliche moments, this one is far from impressive.\r\nAfter episode 10, I'm still wondering what the big idea actually is, where this series is going to, and if it even has an actual plot. The story lacks coherence with no central line whatsoever. They just keep adding new enemies one after another. I was just hoping they had brought up the actual premise much sooner, if there is even one. There's mention about Sistinesearching for some kind of magical secret or whatever, the rest is still unknown. There are also Rumia and Re:L, two other main girls from this anime who have their own troublesome family and background. My question is: What is the bigger picture? This is the kind of series that can't do without.\\n\\n\r\nAll characters especially these three girls seem forgettable. They are too plain and passive, none of them really stands out. They tend to stay helpless until it's time for MC to save them. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of MC which is for me the worst part of this show, I find him detestable.\\n\r\nAn apathetic, good-for-nothing MC suddenly starts changing his character drastically just after episode 2. He looked extremely weak and incompetent at first, but that's not what he really is. He actually is a skilled magician, who is also a compassionate person deep inside his heart. But I just don't buy it. It looks like a cheap way to make MC likable, and it doesn't work. \\n\\n\r\nThey tried too hard to make MC stand out and as the result MC becomes annoying as hell. Don't you hate it when a loser suddenly pops up conveniently at the right time and steals the show. He is a show-off, put it that way. A self-conceited hero wannabe who comes to save the day, spouting some shallow moral-enhancing speech forgetting that he is a crook himself. He must be the most hypocrite bastard I've ever seen. I just want to see him gets beaten to a pulp, but sadly that won't happen. He can defeat his enemies easily, not because he is too strong but because all of them are brain-dead weaklings who would fall for the most simple trick and get knocked out with a single punch.\\n\\n\r\nI also hate it when they add those ridiculous \"touching moments\" in the end of every episode where MC gets recognition for his works, which make me wanna throw up so badly. I just had a good time badmouthing this abominable MC, but even he has some good points. His outfit looks simple yet cool. I like the character design. The same can be said about the girls. Their uniforms look cute on them. \\n\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nThe last two episodes are no different. They get to the final showdown where MC and his girl confront the main villain. It's cliche af and you know which side will win in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThen finally it's finished, leaving too many questions unanswered. Hell, there's not even ONE answered question. Maybe they save it for season 2.. or 3, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the art, animation, and sound are decent. The rest is really bad.\\n\r\nI hate this anime, but sometimes it's good to have something to hate. I can't wait for season 2.",

I'm not going to talk about how deep everything is, because that's for other series. This should be seen as something entertaining by itself, not to break it down in search of secret keys.\r\nTo be a light Japanese version of Harry Potter, they are doing very well. They do not abuse the absurd humor and although some scenes are veryclich\u00e9s, it makes them look natural, or they give a twist of it.\\n\r\nThe MC is a jerk, but a nice jerk with a grey heart, that although has power is not a character of \"WAAAAAAAAH I ONLY KILL ME ALL\". The other pupils, although their characters are stereotyped (there is the pupil ready, the pupil popular, the pupil tsundere, the one who is good with all, the fat one, the muscular one) do not become heavy nor exaggerate its defining characteristic too much.\\n\r\nI hope to see more and make it equally fun.",

            "content": "Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records by studio LIDENFILMS is based on a Light Novel of the same title as well as a manga, both of which are still publishing.\r\nSetting/Plot/Story 7\r\nThe show takes place in a fantasy world, where magic is a thing and primarily taught and used due to its military strength.\r\nThe story so far has taken place at the best magic academy of the kingdom, where our MC is just about to teach a class of students to become the best of the best in terms of magi.. that's not how it begins though - since our MC starts of as a verylaid back guy.\\n\r\nThe way magic looks and works in this world is pretty similar to many other shows in that it's magic circle, a chant and a boom. However the difference this show has is that they put a twist on the chants themselves - For a student in magic, casting a spell using a slightly different set of words or versing will cause the spell to have some kind of side effect, and at the same time, a master of magic can cast a spell with only a single word achieving its' full effect. We learn that magic is something that isn't created by the chant itself, rather that the chant is what makes you focus on the \"correct..things\" to cast the spell.\\n\r\nOur MC has some kind of special magic called \"original magic\", which is a sort of magic he himself has created that can only be used by him. Original magic is described as something very complicated, however our MC tells us that the magic that they call elementary was also once called original magic,  someone had also come up with the spells after all.\\n\r\nWe also get to see a castle floating in the sky, but we have no idea what it implies to the story so far, more than that sistine wants to go there.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 7\\n\r\nThe art in this show falls in the generic category, much thanks to its setting  and the colors used. That is not to say that the art is bad. It is easy to see that most of the effort went into Rumia, Sistine and Celica, Glenn is very bland (He also needs to look bland for the show to use its comedy) and the whole class as well as the bad guys we've seen so far look very normal, much like \"extras\". The worst part I noticed was that the focus of the characters' eyes were sometimes off target, did the creator not know how to draw well in different angles?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe OP is a Jrock track \"Blow Out\" and the ED a Jpop track \"Precious You\".\\n\r\nThe character VAs are all good with one exception - I really don't like the VA they chose for Re=L.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nIt is very easy to notice that this is based on a light novel due to the characters. While at first glance they leave a good impression both visually and personalities, however.. the main characters all leave things to be desired when more heavily interacted with. There is very little sign of actual character development more than having a bit of backstory and flashbacks, which I don't consider to be real character development, since there are better ways to go about it.\\n\r\nThe only real character development can be seen in the first episodes regarding our MC, to how he changes his attitude toward teaching.\\n\r\nThe MC is the kind of MC who \"seems useless\" to the stupid characters, but always shows up and delivers when needed. He's kind of a grown up tropelord MC from highschool romcom animes in the sense that he gives off the same vibes but has seen all those clich\u00e9s before and will deliver their opposites every time when encountered.\\n\r\nRumia - Extremely nice.. Extremely nice.. Always nice.. ... .... ...\\n\r\nSistine - *Hmph..* *Hmph..* *Hmph..*.... Actually a nice girl, who would've thought?\\n\r\nCelica - The STRONGEST mage alive, can shoot laser beams 2m in diameter, but just turns out to be... completely powerless and not available in every situation they encounter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThis show delivers 2 things quite well:\\n\r\nThe first is how quirky the magic is, the \"limitless possibilities\" and how they can use those quirks to win fights etc.\\n\r\nThe second part is its above average comedy. I really wish they would have focused a bit more on the comedy rather than the forced \"feelings\" the characters are supposed to have. When characters just start loving MC for no reason, the characters become really stale, and the show becomes hard to watch. The good thing about how they did it is: Our MC is an adult! Which means he can actually notice girls with the \"love mc complex\"  and make fun of them rather than \"not notice\" and keep the episodes awkwardly boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3\\n\r\nIt's not a particularly interesting plot or setting. The art&animation is pretty good, and the characters can be a mess at times.\\n\r\nI've enjoyed this show up until now, but I doubt that it will get much better, or have a good finale.\\n\r\n7.3 for average, but worth a watch.",

The series picks up slightly in the following episodes, with some effort to justify the MC's actions and some background on the supporting cast. However, these efforts seem half-hearted and do not provide a believable justification for the characters. There is little reason why the MC is should be as OP ashe is, seemingly able to blitz through many of the challenges he encounters, all while having a pair of fangirls in tow. I feel that the characterization is the weakest link in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I found the conflicts/threats to be quite decent. There is good pacing and sufficient action to keep the audience entertained. But good conflict without good characters isn't going to make an impactful series.",

It also has magic in it. But even though its the \"magical world\" there are other anime that do magic better. Here it feels like they didn't want to go with knights or guns so they put magic in it. Its okay.\r\nThe beginning is quite good though, unexpected and funny. Even if you dislike harem anime, there is a decent comedy and enjoyment in this. Its nothing new but its not as bad.\r\nThe characters are well rounded up,classical stereotypes of girls and a seemingly incompetent MC... he isn't that.. he just lazy and unmotivated.. unless its a save the day situation in which everyone in the world disappears and he is the only one that can do it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is awesome so that's gonna carry it if nothing else. \\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend it for any lazy afternoon/night. You can easily blaze through all of it, its all good.\\n",

The way the anime went on was very funny and entretaining, there is a bit of ecchi but it doesn't bother and they don't overdo it. The last chapter was an open final, leaving place for a second season, which I wisht it would happen. If I would compare it to another anime I guess it's something similarto Zero No Tsukaima but not oversimilar the plots are different but they both start in a maigc school and are funny. Overall even if its an LN and people like to sh*t on this type of anime a lot, I still think it's fresh, funny and enjoyable. The only thing I don't understand is why their uniform is so weird.",

            "content": "Real Score:7.25\\10\r\nRokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, one of the most popular Anime this season, does it deserve the popularity it gets? Yes...and no. It is a really nice and enjoyable show, with a good MC, a really nice satire on the usual tropes of the Magical High School genre and an amusing side and explanation of magic. But the same Clich\u00e8s that the show makes fun of in the first episodes come back to bite the overall enjoyment and flowing of the story, some of the characters lose a lot of steam and, of freaking course, it doesn't end, making the entire season abait for future adaptations and for the Light-Novel Series\\n\\n\r\nStory 7.25\\n\r\nThe story is surprisingly good, it builds the characters, the world and the villains really well, it has a great variety of situations and the characters actually develop throughout the story, and because of the story only, there are very few flashbacks, the story continues and unfolds not because of a mere FlashBack , the 101 method of all storywriters to develop the story, but because of the story itself, as it evolves the characters adapt to it and respond in many different ways. The short arcs, they're around 3-4 episodes long, may bother someone, i'm not a big fan too, but i found it quite enjoyable: maybe the reason is that the pacing is astonishingly good, is not slow, but not that fast either, is a weirdbalance that may throw someone off, but that captivated me. The problems reside in the overuse of the same old Clich\u00e9s that we see all the time in the last 2 arcs, granted they aren't that bif of a problem, but after setting up a nice satire in the first 5-6 episodes, it's a shame seeing RokuDenashi fall in the same hole as the other Anime of this genre. The biggest problem is that the story ends too quickly, just when things started to get interesting, this is the same bait, the same method as every light novel adaptation out there, the ending does not exist to make the viewer feel good, or simply to applease it, it does not end with a good cliffhanger too, it just ends, like that, PUF!If you want to see more, read the freaking Novel you dumbass! Listen, i'm not against supporting the producers, we must support them if we want to have constant and quality content over the years, but there are better ways to do it, i should be incline to buy products because it genuinely intrigued me, because i want to know if  this show differentiates itself from the Novel\\Manga, because I decide to support it; this is forcing viewers to buy the Source Materials. Sorry for the little rant, it is not an attack to Rokudenashi, i enjoyed it and i will definitely read the Novel, i just wanted to say something about this horrible strategy that Publishing companies are using nowadays\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7\\n\r\nThe side characters are simple, yet effective, they all incarnate the same guidelines for High school characters, but you can actually get behind them and believe them sa a single class, unity, mainly because of the well-done Tournament Arc, that creates bonds between the class, something that should be done more in School Anime; however it's cut short and  they never go any further than that. 2\\3 of the main Trio is interesting, but nothing more: Rumia has the most interesting story and has a really nice character, not so naive as it seems, a lot more profound than you might think, but quickly becomes a damsel in distress that has to be always saved by our main character, what a pity. Sistine is, too, an interesting character on paper, and is not your typical Tsundere, but she never has that leap, that breakthrough needed for her personality, it may happen in S2, but here, it doesn't happen. Our main character, Glenn Radars, is hands down the best part of this show, he's got a really amazing and cool backstory, in fact i would 100% see and even support a prequel that follows the adventures of Glenn before going to the Alzano Magical High School Academy, they are build up incredibly well and add a lot to Glenn's character without flashbacks. He's a funny, charming, charismatic and secure protagonist, he's a breath of fresh hair, he's a reliable and secure guy,  you can genuinely cheer him up and get behind him.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7.25\\n\r\nSuzuki Konomi is always awesome to hear and her songs fit the scenery pretty well, they are energetic and pump you up for the viewing. The music is good, never goes out of his way and never becomes something more. The music in the action scenes is well-done and gets its point, that is make them more comfortable and  interesting\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Direction 6.75\\n\r\nThe art is good but nothing special, the character models are solid for the majority of the Anime, but some of the frames are rather clumsy and superficial, as are some of the textures and details in the backgrounds, who look bland and sloppy at times. The action scenes and the magic scenes are where the animation and direction really shine the colourful spells, the detailed runes and good choreography are really good. Too bad the direction is, well, normal, it doesn't stand out in no manner whatsoever but, at the same time, it's not bad, it's in the middle\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\r\nI really liked the entire Anime overall, the comedy is really well executed at times and Glenn's personality was just so entertaining. I liked all the Arcs, even though they were short, and i liked the way the story evolves with the characters. The character banter was really good and enjoyable, and i loved the different take on magic, a down to earth and bloody take on magic. I'm totally in for a second season and for a prequel for Glenn's story, a prequel that the character deserves. \\n\\n\r\nI won't  lie, this was a disappointment for me, after 6 episodes, i really thought that i would enjoy this a lot more, and maybe give a lot more than 7.25, it's a real shame that the same clich\u00e9s that it makes fun of in a clever way, brings it way down. The way that it ends may be infuriating but, however, it kinda works, it builds curiosity and makes you wonder what might happen next. It's a nice, i would recommend it this season, for the amazing main character, the interesting take on Magic and interesting story, that doesn't get too tiring, i have high hopes for a future season 2 if they correct their mistakes. Thanks for reading this review, May Our Sweet and Merciful Madoka be with you and don't wander in this Fool's World, and remember the face of our Sweet Lady",

            "content": "STORY: it takes place at an academy where magic is key and used in their everyday lives. It starts off with a substitute teacher filling in for a class, but he doesn't have a lesson planned out for them. Eventually, it has escalated to the point where one of the students has faced him in a duel and won (& told him to step up). But things get more interesting in the anime where an evil organization has invaded the school and abducted one of the students. From there, the anime lets us explore the other side of him (the good side). This anime containsa lot of cool battle scenes, the school life, comedic moments and a lot of cliffhangers and twists.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nGlen Raders: the substitute teacher who originally had no intentions of teaching magic to the class, but later on we get to see another side to him that is kind, caring and is capable of understanding the class' magic. He can be very cocky and obnoxious too.\\n\r\nSistine: one of the smartest students in the academy and is part of a rich family. On the outside, she comes off very strong, but on the inside, she is very vulnerable.\\n\r\nRumia: one of the sweetest, soft spoken students. She wants to use her magic to help others.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I enjoy the anime overall. It was nice, but there are a few flaws. Such as: needing to explore more of Glen's & Sistine's past (aka character development) and learn more information about the evil organization. Personally, I think the school uniform looks like a crop top.",

            "content": "This will be very brief and I will update once the series wraps up. \r\nI just want to say right off you will see alot of people hating on the series as they do any of this genre. These days in anime if it's not something with an insane and over complicated plot it usually gets hate especially anything using remotely cliche arch types characters etc. If your not one of these people and actually watch for enjoyment and don't mind a show not being groundbreaking or using themes anime have used forever and got popular then keep reading. \r\nThis is a magical academy animewith hints of harem etc. However though with common arch types which is why most people hate and say it's all terrible I really like the characters especially the girls so far. Also something basically a must for me im not to into comedy or just fat out harem shows so a serious on going good plot in it as well is a must and this has that. For a what most would consider a good vibe,comedy harem show this show actually has a pretty serious and dark plot. Just for reference and this isn't spoiling anything by episode 2-3 there are already deats and very very bloody fight scenes. It also looks like the mc has a very dark past at is going to be shown more of as it goes. \\n\\n\r\nI will say this show is one that already seems to be getting better as it goes. I will flat out admit from episode 1 it seemed like it was going to be your basic average a few a season level harem magical school show. It picks up tho and you see the differences in episode 2 and heavily in episode 3. I think this is aside from like I said people just loving to hate anything not considered elitist approved or insanely popular is why this show got dropped by alot of gets hated on. Compared to where it goes after episodes 2-3 if you just watched episode 1 it's not great. This show in recent memory had the biggest jump from episode one to 2-3 ive seen in a while. Rating just by episode 1 I would have given it most likely a 5-6 up to episode 4 im at around a 9. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind themes being used that are good an made anime what it is and don't require everything to be groundbreaking give this anime a shot and please watch it past episode 1. If your not into it past episode 3 then yes it's  a drop for you but don't drop after episode 1.",

When you find out the writers were being completely serious and there is no punchline whatsoever. \r\nAkashic Records could have at the very least been a decent ecchi romantic comedy, if it wasn't for the fact that it doesn't seem to understand how bad its own plot devices are. Compare to a better anime like Konosuba. Does Konosuba have a good story to it? Oh god no, it absolutely does not. But hereis the kicker: Konosuba is fully aware that it is bad and brilliantly takes advantage of its inherent badness to self parody at every chance it gets. That's how a show like this ironically avoids being bad - by not taking itself seriously and having full self awareness that the best way to be a fantasy-comedy is to go full slayers. Akashic Records unfortunately does not share this self awareness, nor does it understand what makes this kind of show good.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of trying to find ways to make all this nonsense entertaining, the writers try to pan off the standard tacky \"mamoru\" and \"I am strong because I have friends!\" elements as if they actually count as good storytelling. The result is that instead of being funny and enjoyable, Akashic Records ends up being cringy and generic. It makes you feel like the show was written for very young children, but at the same time this is an R-rated anime where the female students are all wearing ridiculously revealing school uniforms and violence is everywhere. So who was this show made for exactly? Who knows. Whatever the case, Akashic Records is bad. It's not ironically bad, it's just bad. \\n\\n",

I do read a lot of Chineses Light Novels that are based on magic/kung fu/romance and well like all Anime/Light Novels and Manga of this type it is hard to be Different..but this is still a good read/watch I enjoy it if you are a fan of Magic type anime i would recommend this. It has a pretty good storyline, I can't wait for a second season of the Anime while I catch up on the Manga/Light Novel. I enjoyed The anime.I like howthe art is done and how the story line has progressed so far isn't to fast it is just right to keep the viewer's /readers on edge, But it dose have some flaws like it seems to have ideas from sword art online and Other Military/School/Magic Anime.. but in the end it is still good to watch even with its flaws.",

Unfortunately, all these ingredients come together to create something just... fine.\r\nThe main problem is the fact that this is just a 12-episode series with no word yet on when or IF a second season will ever come out. If the series does truly just end here, then it's a major disappointment. There are so many unanswered questions. So many things were justglossed over and forgotten about. So many intriguing characters introduced and then shoved off-screen for the majority of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI really like this world enough to read the light novels, but I don't know if any of them have been translated to English. I'll have to do a bit of research on that front.",

But it did not break the beauty of the work.\r\nAnd the screenwriter leave some questions without awnsers, this was becouse they used only 4 volumes of the Light novel.

            "content": "Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, or Akashic Records in short, is one of the must watch anime this season. Why? Read on to find out.\r\nWe also get a healthy dose of action and romance in Akashic Records, and it packs a solid punch.\r\nThe anime is adapted from a light novel of the same name and it also has a manga adaptation which is pretty great. The story is pretty generic but enjoyable. In a fantasy world, where mages still exist, we get to see the goof ups and adventures of the extremely lazy but immensely capable Glenn Radars. He starts as a part timeteacher in the school and the story follows from there.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is superb! I just love it! The sound on the other hand is kinda okay, and while the OP doesn't strike as anything remarkable to me, I love the ED! \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, Akashic Records does a fantastic job. Glenn is easily my number one fav character this season. His comical yet serious nature, his antics, his courage and his love for his students & friends are immensely enjoyable. The other characters, especially, Rumia is also interesting. Her nerve of steel is appreciable. Sistine(the best girl ofc) does her job well portraying a cute girl and a lovable student. She's a tsundere, but a good one. She is powerful, like real powerful and supports Glenn. Re=L, the other girl is an interesting character. I'd like to spoil, but won't and I can say that she'll have a strong fandom after the series ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, Celica, Albert and the Queen plays side roles albeit important ones. I found Leos to be hateable enough as I don't like third wheels at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd pretty much suggest anyone to watch Akashic Records if you're a fan of comedy and action genres. The characters, the story, everything is just too good. Watch it, you won't regret. And also don't forget to read the manga(it's a shame that it's still behind the anime tho).\\n\\n\r\nAs a parting shot, Sisti(Shiro Neko) is totally the best girl! Don't agree with me? I don't care, lol. \\n\\n\\n",

Answer, it makes them look like a bunch of ho\u2019s, I mean, WTF is the illustrator, Kimura Satoshi, thinking about the girl\u2019s school uniform design? They ought to be working in a gentlemen\u2019s club as hostesses, instead of studying to be magicians or sorcerers, another pathetic thing about studio LINDENFILMS they didn\u2019t go all the way with the fanservice, which would have been a saving grace for this anime. The boy\u2019s uniform design doesn\u2019t fare either, I mean, what\u2019s with that cowl that they have to wear? The illustrator should have just made them boys wear a shirt and tie for crying out loud.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Sound:\\n\\n\r\nI really have nothing to say about the seiyuus who did the voices of the characters, and frankly I just don\u2019t have an opinion about both the opening and closing themes.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Character:\\n\\n\r\nOk, so the setting is in some English fantasy kingdom, and the main characters here have rather very pathetic names like Glenn Radars, Rumia Tingle, Fibel Sistine and Rayford Reil. The setting was old but the name were new, also the characters were too poor in how they were presented. We have a lousy teacher Glenn Radar, who can kick ass but lacks motivation, Sistsine who is this uptight proud girl who in the end is actually weak, Rumia, who we don't know how important is she that all of the sudden she becomes secondary on the mid of the season, also there is Reil, whom she has a sort of frenemy with Gleen where at one point she's trying to kill him and in the other she gets cutesy with him. Also, we never get to know as to what had happened to that evil maid Charlet Eleanor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWell, it was sort of funny that Glenn gets to have his ass kicked by Sisti at first, then seeing Glenn develop his relationships with his students, but in the end things were pretty predicable as Glenn rushes to free Sisti from marrying early, since she does remind of Glenn\u2019s love, the white dog, whom we have no idea as to what happened to her and let\u2019s not forget the puppet master who manipulates things in the shadows.\\n\\n\r\nMediocre 5, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nOne only has to watch the last episode to see why, so, another season? Yeah right.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRadars Out!",

            "content": "This show is pretty much what you can see from other similar anime. The difference is, they took the cliche` and added some variations to it, making it very enjoyable to watch.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nWell the story is not unique. Again, it is pretty much what you can see in anime of the same genre. Magic Competitions, villains, badass mc. The story is easy to understand. The thing is, in some anime, the way they explain their magic powers is difficult to understand, but in this anime, they did a good job in explaining their magic. The only problems I see with the story is that itis repetitive at some point and it is a bit too rushed. They crammed 5 volumes of the LN into a 12-episode anime. Even though it is crammed, it does not take any important and significant part out so it's acceptable. To sum it up, the story is quite normal but enjoyable! \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nThe art is great. The magic casting, CQC scenes, and other effects are great! The design on the characters are also superb. They made cute heroines look like goddesses. Noting else could be said about the art except that it is good.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nDefinitely the best part of this anime! The OP and the ED are both dope!I kept playing them over and over again. The OST/BGM they used is so good, and it may be the reason that this anime is hype. I will definitely listen to the OST once it's out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nGlenn (mc) is the best in this series. Actually, he is one of my all time favorites now next to Lelouch (Code Geass), Setsuna (Gundam 00), Shiiba Tatsuya, Kazami Yuuji (Grisaia), Kazuma (Konosuba), and Arata (Trinity 7). Glenn is basically a bastard, savage, kinda-tsundere?, easy-going teacher who trolls his students, colleagues, and enemies even in the most serious of circumstances. He never fails to amuse me. On top of that, he gets along with all his students well, especially Shiro Neko. He is not OP, but he is definitely badass. Definitely best MC of the Spring 2017.\\n\\n\r\nSisti (Main Heroine, or at least that's how I fell) is a classic tsundere who at first despises Glenn because of his attitude. After saving her from being raped, Sisti begins to respect him little by little, learning how to rely on him, helping him when he needs it, and started developing feeling for him (so obvious). For me, she is the best heroine of this series, because every time Glenn is in a pinch, she was always there to help him. She fights the enemy with strong resolve. Even at the time when Glenn was dying, she was the one who stayed with him and resurrected him, with the help of Albert. In short, she is a classic tsundere gone right. Best girl for me. She also has the most favorites in this series with a very large margin compared to Rumia.\\n\\n\r\nRumia is basically a kind, caring, and selfless girl. The problem with her is the she was always a damsel in distress. Every single time. She can't even fight for herself. If she could just fight even for herself, she would've been a better character.\\n\\n\r\nRe=L, Albert, Celica and the others are great supporting characters with their own special characteristics. Shout out to Harley (Halloween, Harvest, Harem) sensei for always being trolled by Glenn.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I enjoyed it to the point that I was literally waiting for new episodes to come out every Tuesday night (GMT 8). And after watching it once, I would watch it again and again especially when the episode really got me going. Best episodes for me were EP 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10.  Anyway, I would not mind having a season 2 for this. Actually, TBH, I want a season 2 for this because the ending was not satisfying. Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot!\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nOverall, the OST, Glenn and Sisti, and the comedy was what got me going for this series. It was really fun and enjoyable. Can't wait for season 2 if there are plans for it. I would recommend this series to people who love badass MCs, magic school genre, and comedy. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 for me.",

            "content": "Before we start:\r\nThis is more of a review of the reviews, rather than a review of the show. Something that hopes to help you make anything out of the huge disparity between user reviews rather than add another opinion to the already varied bunch. Now then...\r\nSo a show like Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records comes around and it gets some really mixed opinions. A bunch of people rate it at 3. Then there are some 9's. And to top it off there's a small handful of those who give it 7~, but never really get enough attention to reach the spotlight and be seen/readunless you dig through the reviews.\\n\\n\r\nSo who is right? Is is really the worst disaster that hit the Earth in this millenium? Or a work of art that deserves to be put at the forefront, for all the unbelievers to see that THIS is what anime is about? To be honest, it's neither and it's the 7's guys and gals that are mostly right. But to better explain, let's consider a different, purely theoretical example.\\n\\n\r\nImagine the new Transformers movie coming out. The first screenings are done and now the viewer reviews are coming in:\\n\r\n- There are some people who think it's utter crap and rate it at 3. It's shallow, completely uncreative, reusing the same overused tropes, the plot twists are predictable and the story lacks any meaningful message behind it. It's your common story about the Earth being in grave danger and only some special (care?) kid who thinks he's funny and his token lass (being there just because boobs) being able to save it. What MOST of them fail to notice is that you are >NOT< supposed to watch Transformers movie expecting it to forever change the way you look at your car/fridge/dildo. This, and that enjoyment can be drawn from different sources.\\n\r\n- There are some people who think it's the new coming of Jesus (the 9 guys). Those are easy to explain. They are MOSTLY just a bunch of dudes jacking off to two giant robots wrestling while covered in oil and rate it at 9 rather than 10 only because there were always those 2 meatbags that constantly got in the way of more giant robot fighting.\\n\r\n- And lastly, there are the wise ones, that put it at 6-8, stating that while it had some faults, it was nevertheless a good piece of simple, lighweight, commitment-less enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nNow replace the \"giant robots\" with \"cute girls\", do a few minor tweaks in other places and you have a summary of the user reviews for Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records.\\n\\n\r\nI wrote this all just to say that you - whoever you are - should approach this just like you would approach a Transformers movie and watch it only when in a mood in which you would gladly watch a Transformers movie. If you would watch that at all. If not - that's fine too, just be mindful of why was such a thing created and who it was aimed at.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for my own oppinion - it was unexpectedly enjoyable and I really mean it. I've seen some real copy-paste crap like Asterisk/Absolute Duo/other staf like that. I hated those and yet I still rated this one at 7 overall. That and that long Transformers tirade should be all that you need to make the call. You are (I assume) an intelligent being, you don't need to read a 10 page long essay about the cuteness of the girls or tropes used/avoided to tell if a roughly 4-5 hours long piece of animation is worth your time. Rather than going through all of those reviews, go watch the first episode. It's more or less what you will get untill the very end.",

            "content": "Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is overall a good anime. \r\nThe story isn't very unique, although it does present some novel ideas that separates it from other magical/school/supernatural anime out there. It generally flows at a good pace, gives us enough information to flesh the characters out, and progresses the story well enough. The progression of the story could be made more realistic/natural, however, and that is actually one of the things that bugged me the most. I could pick out specific episodes that were put in for different reasons, like \"this episode is to flesh out so-and-so's character\" and \"this episode is aboutrevealing this thing\" and whatnot, and basically what I'm getting at is that sometimes the episodes seem formulaic. I prefer it when episodes are able to create a seamless picture of the whole, telling the story in a way where it's not divided into blocks but has multiple strings in it that all tie into the end. (Hopefully that makes sense\u2014I did my best.) \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, if you're looking for a one-time/one-season anime, don't try this one. The ending wasn't entirely satisfactory. There wasn't that much development between the love interests and a large amount of big questions went unanswered, likely in the anticipation of a second season. (I hope there will be a second season.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is enjoyable but nothing that will get your heart pumping. \\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR \u2013 Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor starts off decently enough that you might think to stick around to see if it gets better. It never gets better.\r\nOn the list of things the world is lacking, another fantasy high school light novel must rank pretty high. Fortunately, Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor (AroBMI) \u2013 so called because Brilliant Bastard wasn't cumbersome enough \u2013 is here to provide.\r\nSistine & Rumia are two friends on their way to the first day of class at the Alanzo Imperial Magic Academy when they have an only in anime collusion with some guy. Said guy turns out tobe Glenn, a right bastard who mocks their apology & behaves in such a way that means Sistine must yell \u201cbaka!\u201d & shoot magic at him. As if the day couldn't get any worse, Glenn turns out to be their new teacher & not only is he a bastard, but an idle one at that.\\n\\n\r\nCliche beginnings aside, the first episodes of AroMBI showed promise. Glenn, pronounced G\u00fclenn in this universe, being a teacher rather than a student immediately stands out as somewhat of a novelty, though his appearance makes it hard to tell how much older than its students he's supposed to be. Though his cocky & abrasive, not to mention lazy, attitude rubs everyone up the wrong way at first, he soon reveals himself to be much more capable & reliable than he seemed. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes that focus on him as a teacher are the strongest. Taking a Great Teacher Onizuka approach to schooling \u2013 even using a similar title at least once \u2013 his unorthodox teaching methods gradually win over his students, even if he is openly disdainful of magic as a tool fit only for harming others. Eschewing the conventional methods of rote learning & memorisation, Glenn instead emphasises practical application & experimentation as well as encouraging each student to excel at what they're best at, rather than relying on the top students to carry the rest of the class. The potential was there for the series to at least offer a somewhat novel spin on the genre, even if Glenn still had the usual clich\u00e9 past & an evil organisation to fight.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, what potential it had is soon squandered by its inability to adapt genre conventions to the new status of its protagonist. It soon becomes apparent that, although a teacher, Glenn is still very much a light novel protagonist. Events all revolve around him, he is the solution to every problem & people just can't help but like him, think about him, or at least blame him for all their problems. Worse is that, while Sistine is your typical tsundere heroine, she is also your typical light novel love interest. There is some effort to explain Glenn's apparent closeness to her as being because she reminds him of someone he used to know. But by the time she's daydreaming about him defeating her plot convenient fianc\u00e9 & proposing to her, it feels very awkward. \\n\\n\r\nAs does Glenn's constant need to rescue his harem...sorry, students with non-brown hair. Normally you expect a teacher character to encourage their students personal growth & ability to stand up for themselves & that does happen with the class as a whole. But when the evil mages show up to cause trouble for the main female characters, it's all on Glenn to save them, once just in time to stop Sistine from being raped. \\n\\n\r\nRumia is supposed to be some sort of unique magic user, her power to amplify others magic apparently a cause both for her being hidden away by her royal mother & also why the evil mages keep attacking. But it's never established why her power, in a world full of magic, causes that, or why amplifying power is a bad thing while nobody bats an eye at Glenn's power to nullify magic or Sistine's power to drain it. It's just a thing the plot needed to have, really. When another character from his past, Rel (spelled Re=L) joins his class as a transfer student who openly professes her devotion to him, it only furthers the sense that ARoBMI is unable to think outside the box. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that near-rape scene, its narrow avoidance leads into another issue with the series: it's terrible sense of comedic timing. Sistine's assault is built up for well over a minute, with her calls for help becoming increasingly desperate as more clothes are torn through. But almost as soon as Glenn strolls through the door the tone does a 180 & witty banter ensues. Even in regular exchanges, jokes often fail to hit the mark, either due to excessive repetition or punchlines taking too long to deliver. It's alright when it's not trying to be funny, but it's almost always trying to be funny & is only made worse by the OST, which uses a cuckoo clock sound effect in the \u201cfunny scene\u201d music. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a frustrating lack of continuity & consistency between the three main arcs of the series (one for each girl). The first two build up an evil maid character to be the series' main antagonist, being involved in both Rumia's & Re=L's stories. But the final arc almost completely ignores her so Glenn can do battle with another guy from his past that we haven't been introduced to. It seems pretty basic to think that they would have to fight against the maid henchman before revealing a new, higher ranking enemy, or at least have him say \u201cyou sit this one out, I got this.\u201d But that wouldn't fit Sistine's marriage fantasy that's the core of the final arc, with all the unhealthy student \u2013 teacher relationship implications that has. By the final episode it's almost like they're flinging whatever they've got at the wall in the hope that twenty minutes of material sticks.\\n\\n\r\nThere are issues in the small details as well. For the first half of the series, the setting seems a fairly typical fantasy one, with magic & swords & carriages. But then in Re=L's arc there's suddenly a high-tech laboratory & Glenn's former special mage forces partner Albert hands him his old revolver. It's the only firearm in the series, which begs the question: why are there firearms in a world with knights & magic? The answer is because the director thought having Albert hand Glenn his old gun to symbolise their reuniting for one more case would make a cool scene, implications be damned. It's not the only time where something that worked in a different film is used to poor effect.\\n\\n\r\nAs to what the Akashic Record is, well you'll just have to read the novels to find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe production of AKoBMI follows the tiresomely familiar pattern of starting with its best foot forward & only getting worse as the series goes on. Putting the usual light novel inevitabilities aside \u2013 like silly uniforms & character designs taken from the beginners guide to archetypes \u2013 everything seems to look & move fine, with some eye-catching animation sequences in the first few episodes. But things become gradually more static & stuttery as the series progresses, with a notable decrease in the amount of detail put into character art. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also a couple of annoyingly obvious continuity errors. A minor but unmissable one is when Glenn has very clearly been stabbed through the lung, complete with bloody wound to mark the spot. But his bandages mostly cover his abdomen instead of his chest, presumably because it looked cooler. A more glaring & irritating one comes later, when Glenn punches an opponent into a wall. When the dust clears, he's in a Jesus Christ pose that the camera is really keen you get a good look at, only for him to be sprawled on the floor in the next cut, no falling animation or even a sound effect. It's eye rolling at best & likely to cause viewers to yell at expletives at the screen for how pretentious it is.\\n\\n\r\nAKoBMI is hardly the first light novel to start with an interesting premise, only to become increasingly unfocused & reliant on overdone tropes & clich\u00e9s as it progresses. But there have been so many of them, which becomes increasingly unforgivable as each year also produces more shows that buck the trend. The first 5-6 episodes that focus on Glenn becoming a teacher & Rumia are okay enough that they might be worth watching on their own if you're a big enough fan of the genre. But if you really want to watch a light novel adaptation about a magic bastard instructor, just watch Alderamin on the Sky.",

HOLY FUCK.\r\nI get it, I get it. This anime lacks originality and such, blah blah. But look at it this way. What if you judge it on a different perspective? What i'm saying is that you should compare this anime to other unoriginal anime. Then you'll find the magic. Get it? Cuz this is a magical anime? Never mind.\r\nSo yeah. I mean, the characters are pretty average if you want to say it that way (don'tinsult my waifus) but they're still pretty entertaining. Especially with Glenn. Oh boy, how happy I feel when watching him. His constant teasing towards his students are really heartwarming. No, not heartwarming. It's torture for them. But I like it :)\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we get all the shit about the uniforms being too sexy. But sexy is anime. And that's why anime exists. Sexy is why hentai exists. I love sexy. \\n\\n\r\nBut seriously though, there's really nothing wrong with the clothing. Sometimes, I even forget that their bellies are showing. You get used to it, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nI like this animu because of\\n\r\n-likable MC (srsly)\\n\r\n-likable heroines (get your hands off my waifus)\\n\r\n-if you don't like the waifus then there's always that blue haired girl and that blonde girl with the black, star wars sith clothing.\\n\r\n-Comedy\\n\\n\r\nI don't like this animu because the girls are 15.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved about this was how it embraces all the tropes, cliches, everything. It embraces it and isn't afraid to show it for all of us to watch. Some may have disliked it but I know despite it's lack of \"quality\", Rokudenashi whatever the fuck it's name is, is just trying to entertain us. It gives suspense and action when it needs to and gives comedy when it needs to. It offers what you need at the right time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like 15 year old girls wearing revealing clothing, comedy, a \"realistic\" MC, fanservice, a tsundere, a psycho maid, and a kuudere, then enjoy the masterpiece that is, Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records. No sarcasm.\\n\\n\r\nWait wait wait. Glenn is 19????? Woah............I guess that explains his childish nature. Don't worry. If you hate stupid people in anime then no worries. Glenn is pretty damn smart. So yeah...now I can end this review.",

            "content": "This Review will contain SPOILERS for Akashic Records\r\nAkashic Records is something of a curious entry to the \"magical high school\" trope that is common in recent years. Initially, it appears to follow a set formula that has been established over the years: The characters attend a school to learn some power, main male lead isn't all that exceptional, main girl lead is a tsundere, and so on. It seems like it will be entirely skip worthy and, in a word, trash. However, Akashic Records ends up becoming unexpectedly good because of some twists that deviate from the norm.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story of Akashic Records isfairly enjoyable. It follows short arcs that tend to focus on a given character with a faint overarching plot connecting it all. The arcs are fairly enjoyable and do their job well. They have a thin coat of harem hijinks while actually being fairly serious. However, what prevents it from scoring higher is the fact that the ending (VERY important) was rushed. It doesn't feel rounded off and needed at least another episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art for Akashic Records maintains a decent standard and has few quality  lows or highs. The art for the various spells and the eyes of the characters are the primary noteworthy aspects. General character designs aren't all that special, but are acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nI really can't give special credit to the soundtrack. It was an overall \"meh\" and had no memorable tracks to speak of. It served its purpose as a background, but doesn't go beyond that. The opening at the very least was pretty good. The voice acting was alright (though I wouldn't know given I don't speak Japanese), but I can't speak for the dub given I didn't watch it (yet).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nIn general, I liked the characters in Akashic records. I want to give special praise to the main character Glenn Radars. While he is best described as a lazy scumbag, he ends up being fairly interesting to watch. He isn't weak like most harem protagonists and is relatively amusing to watch. The rest of the cast is good, but a bit typical. I strongly believe they could have been given a little more nuance, but at the very least they have their own backgrounds that prevent them from being one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI want to especially stress that this series was very enjoyable to watch. As stated earlier, the key part is that it sets itself apart from other magical high school shows enough to be fairly interesting. It doesn't rely on fanservice to keep people watching and actually stays tame in that field. It has a cast that is fun to watch and has some good action scenes with a dash of humor. I really did like that it is comparatively serious to other shows of the same genre and has a good lead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nIn general, Akashic Records is at the very least worth a test run for most people. Give it the 3 episodes rule, and then decide to watch it fully or not. It deviates from the norm enough to be fairly interesting and fun to watch. While most elements are not exceptional, the good parts of them are executed well and make the show worthwhile.\\n\r\nIt probably is worth a second season, but I wouldn't count on it. \\n",

            "content": "Before I start, I'd obviously like to point out that I've not finished this anime yet, with one episode left to go. However, I feel that I can give a proper review of this anime even without that final episode. I'll edit if my opinions change.\r\nWell, that being said, onto my review. At first glance, Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records looks like a regular fantasy anime with school elements, but it ends up being a lot more than just your regular run-of-the-mill school comedy.\r\nStory: The story of Akashic Records isn't that much. Seeing as how this is a school themed anime, the main developmentof the plot is in the development of the characters. The first episode of this anime doesn't really do much compared to other animes, but hey, they did their job of introducing our lovable cast of tropes. However, the second episode is when Glenn starts dropping his \"bastard\" personality and trades it in for an actual teaching personality. But after episode 2, the anime starts picking up really fast, only to slow down near episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artists really made some amazing art, in my opinion. And I'm not just talking about the 2 bits of plot on Celica, I'm talking about all those magic spells that they drew. I have a strange fascination with how artist draw magic, and their summoning circles, and this anime has them drawn really well. Also, they did a nice job with the designs of all the different characters in Glenn's class, since they all look different from each other, and are all unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound: There's not much to say here in the sound category, but Konomi Suzuki's Blow Out is now one of my favourite openings. It's upbeat, and is a theme that I'd expect to hear from an anime like this. Other than that, I think that the voice actors did an excellent job, with Glenn sounding even more like a bastard than I'd expect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, with the characters, they're not too good, not too bad. Aside from Glenn, most of the characters are pretty much just tropes. Sistine, although very KAWAII~DESU, is just your ordinary tsundere catgirl at the end of the day. And even Rumia falls into another trope. To me, she kinda feels like Jeorge from Fire Emblem. Glenn, on the other hand, changes twice in this anime. The first episode 2, when he starts to become more of a teacher, and the second change is when the class goes back from the beach, and he regains his persona as a bastard.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I did enjoy this anime, despite how much I bashed the characters (it's bashing in my book >.<). The anime has moments where I smashed that next episode button, just because I wanted to see more of the characters and their tropes, or a climatic moment like in the beach episodes. This anime is something that I'd recommend to my friends, as long as they have a peculiar sense of humour like me. Anyways, I'll be looking forward to being able to watch that last episode. Bye for now!\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Looks like they set themselves up for season 2. Looking forward to that!",

            "content": "I didn't go in with any expectations for this anime nor was I looking forward to this but it surprisingly got better each week and is now part of my weekly anime binge session.\r\nThe first episode started off pretty weak. It seems a lot like your generic weak ass MC with a hidden past, the tsundere, the big chested teacher (Celica) and the goody two shoes. There wasn't really a clear direction and it was kind of scattered. \r\nAll the episodes past episode 1 are where it starts getting good. We can see that the MC isn't as weak as we all think he is,and he isn't a sorry excuse for a teacher. He actually knows magic but he uses hand to hand combat style pretty often so maybe he doesn't have that much mana for magic? We aren't quite sure of everything in his past but we do know that he used to serve in the Royal army of some sort and had two other comrades- forgot the first guy's name, and Re=L. Re=L is super cute, I am still confused as to whether she? is a girl or guy but I loved her since she came onto the screen. \\n\\n\r\nI don't mind Sisti and Rumia either. I just find it somewhat odd that Sisti has cat ears while everyone else looks normal. I haven't read the light novel or manga. Their school outfits are kind of questionable too but its an anime so whatever. I do wish that Sisti would be less tsundere, but I do like the chemistry between her and Glenn as well as Glenn with Rumia. Wouldn't mind if either of them got with Glenn. Is this supposed to be a harem? Not sure don't care. Lots of cliches in this but I think it was done right and not so in your face. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and soundtrack are kind of forgettable but I just skip through them anyway. \\n\\n\r\nI like this anime so I'll continue watching it. It's a decent watch for a general audience and I'm sure one can find a likable feature by giving this a shot.",

Other than the concept of magic, the world building was pretty confusing. I love the overall story but it really hasn't gone anywhere with 12 episodes.

            "content": "The reason I watched this anime was because I saw some clips that made me laugh. The clips were basically showing a guy (teacher) that didn't care or was really aggressive in his views. Example: Him saying the girls are falling in love with him kind of thing.\r\nThe back story of the anime is that there is magic. This magic is usually brought to form by a) people having the ability to use it b) the casting speed, which is them saying the incantation. But of course you can shorten it based on how your mind works or make the magic do something slightly different.So the story focuses on the main character named Glenn Radar. The guy is shown as someone how didn't want to do anything, lazy, not really caring about the school. In the class there are two main students, basically, that are the focus. One is Sistine, she is the hard headed always study type person, the other is Rumia, she the soft kind girl. Not sister but there something up with them. The other thing is there are some bad guys that are trying to make a noise attacking the school. So all that happening for Glenn.\\n\\n\r\nRating time:\\n\\n\r\nPlot: I think the basic introduction of the plot is neat. I like magic and fantasy so I had the interest. I think the anime show probably doesn't give it a justice for the plot since I feel there should be more. For 12 episodes I would say there was like 4 different progress. But progress felt like it was done already so they just re used again. I would give it a 7 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation was great. I mean it was sometimes ecchi and when you have those ecchi scene you know they will try there best to make the animation look really good and the art style really good as well. I would give this a 7.5-8 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I watched the anime in English dub. I would say that I enjoyed most of the voice actors. The voice actor for Sistine was getting annoying as the more I watched. The music wasn't bad or good. I would give it a 6.7-7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character introduction was done fine. They introduce them and I like the character define characteristic. The character past was done really fast and very little. That might be because of the amount of episodes and what they wanted to show to the viewer. Lastly the character development, I would say 2 out of the 3 main character made some progression. Though I would say it light. but again I would blame that on the number of episode constraint (maybe). I give it a 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall with Bias: After all said it done, I enjoyed the first half and the second half of the anime I was just watching it to complete the anime. I would give it a 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend: Would I recommend... probably not.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI inherited from my parents a tendency to keep records of the important documents I come across.\r\nFinancial papers, important personal information. While not the most organized set of folders imaginable, I keep track of the details in my life that require it to make sure that things are in order on my end.\r\nRokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records (or Akashic Records for short) could have done the same, keeping track of itself so that everything proceeded smoothly. Instead, it misplaces its details all over the place.\r\nSTORY\r\nAkashic Records: another anime, another arc-tiered cake to devour. TheInfiltration Arc, the Necklace Arc, the Project Revive Life Arc, and the Justice Arc layer this tale for the audience to digest as best it can. Unfortunately, weak frosting and missing flavor deliver to the audience an anime that starts out somewhat appetizing but eventually devolves into a forgettable foodstuff when the last bite chomps down.\\n\\n\r\nThe first taste starts at the top with the Kidnapping Arc. Minus the overt sexual assault scene, this arc argues for its status as the strongest of the bunch, setting the anime up for moderate success. The comedy is snappy and fun thanks to Glenn\u2019s lazy, prideful attitude. (Indeed, said comedy is Akashic Record\u2019s greatest strength as seen multiple times throughout the season.) The magic system takes a bit of priority with extra lessons as to its usage and construction. The plot heads for action and skirmishes as allusions to grander story beats and darker pasts appear.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, a competent first arc. But, after having one\u2019s fill, the next tier to the cake becomes a tad harder to stomach. In the Necklace Arc, again disregarding a sexualized segment involving a strange older gentleman and his fetish, the anime still does a nice job on the comedy side. For example, Sisti reinforces how cool of a dude Glenn is for involving the whole class in the field games, forcing him to double down on his nice-guy act. It also makes use of particular plot elements. Specifically, Glenn transforms into Rumia as a demonstration to one of his students, and this same transformation magic equates to the solution required to dissolve the queen\u2019s conflict.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this arc starts to give this cake a bitter flavor. It repeats a previous plot point \u2013 Rumia\u2019s kidnapping \u2013 which demonstrates a lack in narrative variety way too early on in the season. Furthermore, Rumia herself somewhat out of nowhere just remembers now that Glenn was, in fact, the person who had saved her all those years ago, glossing over what was presumably setup to be a big moment between the two.\\n\\n\r\nNothing too problematic for the time being. Indeed, to be fair, the new characters Re=L and Albert hope to keep the cake from falling over in their ability to sweeten the proceedings with new relationships between the cast. Then the show reaches the third arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe Project Revive Life Arc, taking place between episodes seven and nine (inclusive), begins to turn Akashic Records into a mushy mess. It repeats, yet again, the Rumia-gets-kidnapped plot point which really makes one wonder if she shouldn\u2019t have body guards protecting her 24/7. Regardless, the anime tries to cram in backstories about (fake) brothers and strange experiments that ultimately provide necessary info but do not lead to anything emotionally impactful. These episodes also don\u2019t quite nail down the drama when Glenn survives despite a massive wound through his chest without ramification and when the anime fails to capitalize on incorporating his students despite their higher emphasis in the previous arc.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, nothing here is technically horrendous in construction. But it is a whole lot of blandness as the anime does not quite have the know-how to provide a plot that reaches someplace interesting or worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, in rolls in the last arc of the season, the Justice Arc, which makes the cake almost entirely unappetizing. The comedy isn\u2019t as balanced as it was with the previous arcs, giving way for harsher happenings and more drama to unfold that it never quite got right in the first place. The plot goes with yet another \u201ckidnapping\u201d (read: blackmailed and forced to marry a weirdo which is basically kidnapping) scenario (but at least Sisti is the victim this time and not Rumia so that the show avoids outright repetition). And Glenn\u2019s weirdly handled loss to \u201cLeos\u201d and leaving of Sisti put the story in a rough spot.\\n\\n\r\nFor, it must be noted (and in its own separate paragraph at that) that the final episode of Akashic Records is the worst one of the season by far. It rushes forward to a ridiculous degree thanks to a couple of time skips, pushing the content forward without much regard. Moreover, a very brief flashback or two aims to draw supposed parallels between this tense situation and a similar one he encountered in the past with a girl named Sara from his memories. But, without much context of the latter, these parallels do not form well at all.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the villain and his tactics after his big reveal are laughably silly. His final attack amounts to practically nothing, the crucifixion symbolism following his defeat is really unnecessary, and he just runs away after everything anyway. And the episode barely crams in some relevancy for Celica right at the very end with some subplot about a labyrinth that doesn\u2019t matter at this point. The episode does have a full-circle narrative insofar as Glenn re-narrates his words from the very first episode, but that\u2019s not nearly enough to justify the complete mess that proceeds his words.\\n\\n\r\nWith this cake now begrudgingly devoured, it settles for a while before introducing other talking points. Specifically, each arc (more or less) focuses on a certain character and delivers a certain idea pertaining to an overarching motif on personal growth. In the first arc, Sisti showcases hope in her beliefs and the intentions behind her actions. In the second arc, Rumia wrestles with her true feelings and the notion of no regrets. In the third arc, Re=L highlights how one does not always need a reason to live if one just protects what is close to him or to her. In the fourth arc, Glenn proves how easy it is to lose one\u2019s true self along the way.\\n\\n\r\nOver-reiterating at this point, but, while these ideas are not by any means explored let alone powerful, it\u2019s nice to see that the anime had some kind of thread keeping this cake together as best it could.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Akashic Records uses scissors of its own accord to cut this thread. Despite the title and their potential importance, almost nothing about the so-called \u201cAkashic Records\u201d pops up except for a few words here and there as to their existence. Other plot points, like Melgalius\u2019s Sky Castle or the Researchers of Divine Wisdom, do not properly resolve. And the show does not do a very good job of carrying over a lot of the details from one arc to the next, like providing more about the academy itself or using Rumia\u2019s royal bloodline.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while this cake doesn\u2019t taste horrible, and the thread that binds it isn\u2019t so much torn as it is mangled amidst sloppy extra details, the entire experience rises no higher than the absolute bare minimum in execution.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe main artistic element that stands out in Akashic Records is the designs for its characters. Specifically speaking, the main outfits for the girls go straight for eyeful pleasure. Exposed midriffs, skimpy skirts, garter belts, complementary colors (blue and white), extra details (tiny cat ears, ribbons).\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, these designs serve their purpose of crafting a bunch of cute, ecchi looks for the female leads. On the other hand, they\u2019re a bit too overt when taking into consideration the anime\u2019s goals. I.e., their sexualized nature does not benefit either the story or the characters. Regardless, Glenn\u2019s meager look \u2013 a white button-up shirt, a red tie, and a disheveled head of hair \u2013 fit his lazy, unassuming nature well. And Celica\u2019s appearance \u2013 blonde hair, black dress, and \u201cevil\u201d color scheme \u2013 coincide with her witchlike persona. Meaning, not all the designs misalign.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the characters\u2019 designs, the anime does not venture too far with either its art or its animation. It has different magic usage and skirmishes throughout the season, but variety isn\u2019t a selling point here, and their effects usually do not amount to much besides flashy explosions. Background artistry and cinematography likewise provide nothing more than is absolutely necessary, putting the visuals in a passable state but without any flair to call their own.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, besides an incorrect coloring to a student\u2019s eyes during a comedic bit in episode seven, the anime does not commit any egregious errors that detract from the presentation. So, the mixed designs and the serviceable visuals keep the show upright enough to carry the show from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor Akashic Records, it cares about four main characters: Sisti, Rumia, Re=L, and Glenn. Ironically, though, \u201ccare\u201d may not be the correct word to use here.\\n\\n\r\nSisti is Rumia\u2019s \u201csister,\u201d and she comes from a political family with ties to the academy she attends. Her grandfather (now passed away) inspired her to pursue the ancient wisdom surrounding magic so that she could one day go where he sadly could not. While she is not exactly a juggernaut in the field, her promise and her drive push her along nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of her character revolves around fear. Fear of the truth behind how people sometimes use magic for vile deeds. Fear of going against her own beliefs. Fear of losing her friends and those close to her. Throughout the season \u2013 be it from Glenn\u2019s harsh life lesson, Re=L\u2019s provocations, or her own refusal to fight back \u2013 this fear grips her heart at most turns.\\n\\n\r\nSisti does have her small moments throughout the season. She supports Glenn during their skirmish with the skeleton warriors in the third episode, and she trusts in their judgement during the field games to keep spirits high. Unfortunately, it takes the entire season for her to finally confront those fears of hers altogether. In the final episode, she symbolically rips off the lower half of her (unwanted and bloodied) wedding dress, choosing to stand by Glenn and up for herself rather than running away as she so regularly did in the past.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Sisti\u2019s turnaround is appreciated, it\u2019s a too-little-too-late inclusion. However, worse off is Rumia. A kindhearted girl, she looks after Sisti and Re=L like an older sibling does, keeping a level head about the situations they find themselves in and treating everyone around her like a true friend.\\n\\n\r\nShe becomes the target of the baddies because of her special ability to amplify a user\u2019s magic, a rare trait within this world. As such, she spends most of her time kidnapped or otherwise on the sidelines without contributing much, if anything, of her own. Rumia makes up with her real mother, and her occasional asides with Glenn give the audience more insight as to her thoughts and her meager backstory. But, for the most part, she does little else besides be the nice one of the group.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Rumia barely maintains a presence as a notable character, Re=L goes one step lower and comes off as pretty pointless. From the get-go, she has two plans in mind: to always charge right at the enemy and to devote herself to Glenn indefinitely. As such, she\u2019s very much the major comedic relief part to the group in her deadpan mannerisms and silly behavior.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s introduced at around the episode five mark, but doesn\u2019t have much of a place within Akashic Records immediately. Instead, it isn\u2019t until the Project Revive Life Arc (which is where her name Re=L comes from) that her character receives attention. During these episodes, Re=L befriends, betrays, and befriends again as more of her backstory as a laboratory copy surfaces.\\n\\n\r\nThus, she officially joins the cast \u2013 only to lose all relevancy afterwards. When that last arc rolls around, Re=L may as well have never existed to begin with since she does almost nothing of value throughout the last three episodes of the season. (Rumia is in the same boat here, but she at least had a role in the show from the very beginning.)\\n\\n\r\nWith Re=L not even noteworthy as a cast member, that just leaves Glenn. While once an impressionable kid who sought to guard and to nurture the world from its evil ways, he quickly learned that magic did not follow his ideals of a complete force for good.\\n\\n\r\nBut the audience does not learn about this detail of him right away. Instead, he presents himself as an unconventional main protagonist of sorts. Beyond lazy. Dishonest to a degree. Unfazed by the clich\u00e9 dude-walks-in-on-a-bunch-of-girls-undressing scenario. Plus, he doesn\u2019t fight normally either, relying more so on his secret weapon \u2013 the Fool\u2019s Card \u2013 to do the exact opposite of battling with magic by negating it all around him. A fitting ability for the man who no longer loves magic.\\n\\n\r\nWith each episode, bits and pieces of Glenn\u2019s backstory come to light, and he teaches his students more about magic and life in general. In other words, he slowly becomes a rounder character, a stronger professor, and a better person. This transition from lazy loser to full-fledged teacher does not equate to anything nuanced, but his progress at least demonstrates an improvement for him overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs the season nears its end, Akashic Records tries to do more with him on a personal level, but it mishandles the content. His roundabout description of himself in his aside with Sisti in episode eleven isn\u2019t as meaningful without that aforementioned context. Furthermore, the poor attempts at linking his (presumably) beloved Sara with Sisti in episode twelve do not work well since the former\u2019s relationship likewise does not have much of a basis.\\n\\n\r\nStill, his lapse of self stands as a nice contrast to his professorial role throughout the previous rest of the season. A clear indicator that he belongs alongside his students to guard and to nurture as he has always wanted rather than away and alone within a world that he does not desire.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s one last \u201ccharacter\u201d in the anime. Quotes needed because this character isn\u2019t an individual but instead a collective. Although somewhat hinted at earlier in the season, episode four of Akashic Records turns Glenn\u2019s whole class (minus Sisti, Rumia, and Re=L) into a cast member themselves. Some of these students form cliques and have tiny moments here and there, letting their involvement go beyond just filling space in the classroom to complement the main girls.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the entire cast sadly puts forth more negatives than positives. Sisti has an arc, but it is not addressed enough. Rumia drives the plot, but she does not maintain much of a presence. Re=L makes for a completely pointless inclusion. And Glenn receives a few sides to his character, yet they are not as pronounced or as sound as necessary for his part in the anime. At least the other students do not go unnoticed, but that realization doesn\u2019t save Akashic Records to any large extent.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBlow Out\u201d, the opening track for Akaschic Records, isn\u2019t the most original song around in the medium, but it nonetheless has a solid foundation. The dual guitar riffs. The fast-paced drumming. The clean vocals. Each part combines to form a track that follows the anime\u2019s premise and plot while still working as a fine song on its own. The \u201cAhh!\u201d is perhaps a bit too out of sync, and the background sound-effect during its second half somewhat muddies the instrumentation. But these downsides do not completely detract from the OP\u2019s audio appeal.\\n\\n\r\nOpposite the OP, \u201cPrecious You\u2606\u201d plays at the tail end of each episode as the show\u2019s ending track. Slower and daintier, this beat-driven song puts more emphasis on the vocals. Multiple singers, specific sound placement, charming lyrics (\u201cBe with me. Stay with me. You and me.\u201d). Sadly, the ED is not as interesting as its OP counterpart, and it doesn\u2019t catch the ear when listened to it on its own. So, while it works as a means to hear something at the end of each episode, it isn\u2019t exactly a wonderful inclusion.\\n\\n\r\nBetween the OP and the ED, the original soundtrack does not contain anything too notable. Violins, pianos, and wind instruments usually make up most of the music played throughout Akashic Records as it pushes ahead with its fantasy setting and its more grounded moments. However, one particular piece does stand out. It plays the sound of a cuckoo clock, coinciding with Glenn\u2019s dunce-like persona and bringing a dash of laughter when first heard.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice-acting performances, nothing too grand exists. Yume Miyamoto as Rumia stars in one of her first main roles, and, while not an incredible performance, she can clearly play kindhearted characters well. Akane Fujita as Sisti also stars in one of her first main roles, giving the \u201cwhite-cat\u201d girl cute reactions in her various scenes with Glenn. And speaking of Glenn, Soma Saito as the main protagonist deserves a small shoutout, too. When not so serious, his sillier moments give him the chance to display a fun contrast that further helps the comedy of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith just the ED not pulling its weight, and the rest of the music and sound offerings supporting the anime as best as they can, the audio production for the show barely earns a passing grade.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI did not pick this anime up initially during the Spring 2017 season. Some people back during its airing suggested it to me, and I myself saw all the fun they were having with it despite its somewhat common approach in the medium.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the outset, it had me laughing and entertained if for nothing else besides the character interactions and the comedy. Glenn was a silly guy in his laziness and inability to accept defeat. Sisti\u2019s shyness, usually from the romance angle, were cute to watch, too. And even the tiny scene with her father and mother at dinner in episode four got a big chuckle out of me, enough to highlight it in my notes while watching.\\n\\n\r\nPast these first few or so episodes, though, the anime put higher focus on its drama and its action rather than sticking more strictly with its comedy. Because I didn\u2019t particularly care for the serious scenes and because the action never really did anything cool, I slowly lost interest in the show as it went along.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, I did occasionally laugh during the last half or so of the anime. Re=L declaring to the whole class that Glenn is her \u201ceverything\u201d got to me. Yet, when the last episode faded to black, I found myself shrugging my shoulders, unsurprised by its decline into less-than-mediocre territory.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had one wish, it would be for the anime to include Celica more in the festivities. Yes, the show jokes about how little screen time she has during the after-ED theater bits, but she\u2019s attractive and fun whenever she is around. With each subsequent episode, though, I would frown at her continued absence. And so, both shrugging and frowning, the show just did not impress me much.\\n\\n\r\nRokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records has bits and pieces going for it, but the overall project simply doesn\u2019t come together. A bland story, a bunch of mishandled characters, and an acceptable set of art and audio design decisions create the majority of this project. Rarely interesting and usually boring, it tracks only an unfulfilled desire for better organization.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, an arc-tiered cake whose subsequent layers either bloat or upset the stomach\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Fine, mixed designs and serviceable visuals lead to a presentation that carries on well enough\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Sisti fears but without enough going for her person, Rumia drives the plot but lacks a presence otherwise, Re=L fails in her pointless involvement, Glenn tries to become a better individual, and the other students at least contribute\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, okay offerings from the OP, the OST, and the VA performances, but the ED isn\u2019t too intriguing\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, entertaining first few episodes, some funnies sprinkled in afterwards, but mostly a shrugged experience that needed way more Celica\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "In my opinion the anime is good.\r\nThe characters are decent, good story and details. I really liked it and I hope there is a second season of the anime !!\r\nThe anime talk about of action and fantasy, we put ourselves in the shoes of Glenn Radars, a part-time teacher in a school of magic. However, her teaching methods are somewhat particular: when she arrives at class she writes on the blackboard \"Personal Study\" and takes a nap. One of his students, Sistine, can not tolerate him and challenges him to a duel that the professor loses. However, when the school is threatened, Glenn shows anunwavering determination to protect his students. Good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Good PART:\\n\r\nsince they announced it, it caught my attention, not because I had an innovative plot, but quite the opposite, the idea of \u200b\u200ba school of magic in the animes I love it so when I found out that the anime was going I started to take a look at it. .. And I must say it was better than I expected.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we go with the bad of this anime\\n\r\nFirst is the theme of the story, which is interesting but in the anime very little was known about it, I know that in only 12 chapters were not going to put everything but things that were important are counted in just a minute. The second is the final Villain of the anime, which despite having made a very careful plan from the beginning to take down Glenn, he lost very easily to me seems in the final chapter, which left me somewhat unsatisfied.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut in general its was good. I put 8/10 of the anime. That was my review. BYE!!",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, IF YOU ARE GOING TO READ THIS YOU PREFERABLY, HAVE FINISHED THE ANIME.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story seems like typical school/magic anime with an oberpowered teacher with a \"complicated past\". The anime itself says that the protagonist (Glenn Radars) is supposedly a normal person that manages to pull off the unexpected but in the end, it seems like all of the conflicts are resolved in the same way as these other magic/school anime where he just saves the day every time without fail. As I see it, the anime saying he's an ordinary man is just something they say to seem slightly differentwithout really changing how the conflicts are resolved from the norm. It doesn't really stray much from around the lines of \"unmotivated teacher changes and wins over students and protects his students\". And, although this may sound lazy I feel like the pacing for the first half is slightly rushed, like he goes from unmotivated bastard to amazing teacher within the first 2 episodes iirc. The story doesn't really seem like it knows where it's going it just dramatically throws you background information on the characters while not really building up to anything or doing anything with it.For example, Re=L has her own little bit where they reveal that she's part of an experiment to revive or rather copy the dead and tells you about her brother that was killed.But afterwards she just goes back to acting like a normal girl while the plot just uses the fact that she's actually a strong when its convenient.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nI personally am not too good at being critical of more subtle details of animation or noticing background music so this section will be more on a surface level.The art itself is pretty standard and there aren't really any moments I can recall where the animation seemed clunky or it sounded off.But at the same time, nothing really stands out in either aspects.But for the few soundtracks that I've noticed, they don't really seem like they stand out such as the music that they play for most fight scenes or dramatic scenes really just seem like an afterthought.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe character's designs themselves don't really stand out in my opinion but it's better than the designs being too over the top.One main issue I have is that the anime doesn't really seem to know which character it wants to be the female protagonist.For the first few episodes it seems like Rumia is the protag with her being targeted by terrorists and her powers and being a princess and what not and then in the later half it seems like she becomes a side character while Sistine becomes the main female protagonist.This itself isn't such a bad thing, however, it just seems like it was executed poorly. This is because the story still relies on Rumia to create conflicts mainly in the form of threats or taking her hostage but she herself doesn't really do anything but the story revolves around one of the other characters, mainly Sistine and Re=L to reveal information about them or the current villain.Rumia seems like she should be important and to a certain extent she is but still ends up being a side character that really from what I remember just says \"I'm glad you're okay, Sensei\" when she gets saved.But I digress, I'm sorry if that bit seemed like a rant or went on too long.The characters themselves aren't too overused but they're far from original.I can personally say that I think the voices for each character matches their personalities decently well and are believeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is an anime I was able to enjoy in the moment however, in hindsight, I probably shouldn't have as much as I did. If you're not actively trying to find faults and just watching it casually, you should be able to at least find some mild amusement.However, if you were to watch this anime critically, I don't think this would be too good of a choice if you're looking for something different or deeper.",

            "content": "I first came across this anime while watching the most anticipated animes of 2017 I did have high hopes for it as it seemed like it had a fun cast.Lazy ass teacher,cat female protagonist but it ends up being a horrible mess of overused cliches and fuck logic scenarios I couldn't get over.\r\nLets start with story first we have the same tragic back story which all anime have its sort of a mystrey but the anime does give hints to what actually happened  but basically the anime plays like mario damsel in distress and hero comes to rescue fair enough.Art was a bit finei guess not much to discuss not many new things this anime brought to anime world in that field just like my review plain and bland.Musics was fine although i didnt like the opening songs and closing songs its skipable to say the least.Character development is the main reason this anime nose dived,I feel like side characters were not given justice and u see very little to no development.Take for example the whole of class during the tournament episode there is extremely less coverage for our side characters the guys who made this should have done better always watching main characters is kind of boring and the anime looses its touch there.\\n\r\nTo be honest I only enjoyed first 2 episodes after that plot is very predictable.There are plot twists but if you are a regular in anime watching it is very predictable the hints this anime gives to the audience is almost like a taunt challenging you to figure out wtf will happen next.Glenn Radars is your typical main character shady past,overpowered skill or power we got it covered he has certain limitations which I liked about this anime,Sistene Fibel is the first female protagonist which I found can be replaced and the anime still makes lot os sense.Sure she resuces our main hero 2-3 times but no romance man she is only here for her cat ears seriously.Re=L has an interesting back story which I really like. Rumia is like the overused plot after some point always in danger needs to be rescued.Not a nice back story for her either.\\n\r\nThe anime starts off good and ends up being just a normal anime.It gives little explanations here and there on how magic works but i wasnt satisfied.Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei(irregular at magic) for example is really detailed about magic and logic on how things work.In case of this anime we are given ok this spell works like this and throw in 5-6 spells.If its magic school anime we deserve to know maybe a bit more on how things work dont you think?.The anime overall becomes something like this Calm at first plot development a few character development here and there,Evil guy gets girl,hero goes to save,back story somewhere in between,hero fails gets help and resuces the end.Very overused pattern.\\n\r\nOverall its not completely bad.There are a few puns I enjoyed like the magical punch and the first 2 episodes were really good but after that its like Black bullet not much fun.New episodes dont have live up to their expectaitions at some point.Will I watch it again? fuck no.just watch Irregular at magic school",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAs I delved more into the spring 2017 anime's I decided to check out one of the more popular anime's of the season and after finishing it my feelings about it are pretty mixed.\r\nThe story begins at the Alzano Imperial Magic Academy where Sistine and her friend Rumia end up having a new substitute teacher called Glenn, however he is a lazy douchebag who doesn't really give much care for magic, despite this these people end up getting involved in matters that are beyond their normal school days.\r\nNow as stories go this was pretty average mainly the usual kind of stuff I've seenbefore, true it's magic which I haven't really seen a lot of as a main concentration for an anime though it just didn't get to me mostly. It was fun seeing Glenn's character develop though the show as he starts out looking like a lazy douchebag character yet overtime he does start to warm up to the students of his class and the main female characters while also acting like a badass when bad things start happening.\\n\r\nThe magical aspect of the show was alright, but I have definitely seen this type of magic with colourful, well detailed circles plenty of times at this point, at least the spells were pretty good.\\n\r\nThe show does start out slow as we get introduced to the characters, then the situation does start to get a bit more dire and we get introduced to some of the characters backgrounds which are kinda dark, then some characters that are introduced do pick the show up a little bit like Re=L who certainly hepled the show out a little, but after her little tantrum the show gets a little bland again as they put in a forced marriage situation which just reminded me of High School DxD and even the final battle was pretty meh too so in some cases the story did disappoint me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were mostly bland apart from a few that kept the show going for me.\\n\r\nGlenn the MC is definitely a good character and his douchey attitude towards the girls was a nice change instead of a harem or romantic aspect even though it tries to do that, nonetheless he acts like an unreliable person however he is certainly a badass when it comes to fighting his enemies and even starts to warm up to the students once he gets to know them although his constant jokes always put him on their bad sides.\\n\r\nSistine, Rumia and Re=L are the main female characters and each of them do vary, Sistine is the main one and is your typical Tsundere girl yet for once she didn't annoy instead she was just a bit boring and whined quite a bit sometimes saying she isn't strong enough to help anyone although you gotta give her determination some respect.\\n\r\nRumia is the kind and innocent girl of the trio or as I like to call her Princess Peach because she gets kidnapped about 3 times in this show and it was kinda annoying how easy it was for her to get kidnapped although she was an important figure in all of this so it is understandable, she can be pretty strong though which for a character like her is surprising which is shown during the tournament episodes.\\n\r\nRe=L is introduced later on in the show and used to work with Glenn in the past, but she was by far the best of the three main girls and is a Kuudere and a pretty damn cute one because even though she hardly express's any feelings you can just look at her face and see the adorableness however the last thing you want to do is piss her off because not only is she good with a sword she also has a dark past where her brother was murdered which does make her go to the bad side at some point luckily this only lasts for about an episode making her character still very enjoyable.\\n\r\nCelica is an immortal mage that is a professor at the academy and a friend of Glenn, she is very powerful and can be quite easy going although if Glenn gets on her nerve's she does shift into a Tsundere tone, she isn't really in the show much during the second half, but I still found her more interesting than most of the characters.\\n\r\nAlbert who like Re=L is an old friend of Glenn and a very powerful mage who mainly uses magical sniping, but even in close quarters you shouldn't underestimate him, much like Re=L he doesn't show much emotion although he does care for Glenn's well being and does help him out a few times during the show.\\n\r\nThe villains weren't that great and mostly just seemed like a nuisance although Eleanor was definitely one sexually crazy woman that you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley or on the streets at night.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was ok, I liked the way the city looked which reminded me of something out of Lord of the Rings which seems pretty odd and the magic that was displayed wasn't too bad either it was definitely strong enough to cause some mayhem, the uniforms that the students wore was pretty mixed reception they looked nice, but the girls uniforms just looked like they were made to make them look sexy which just didn't feel right this time considering I getting no sexual attraction from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe action was actually pretty meh and even when it picked up it didn't impress me hell the final battle didn't make me feel amazed either and the show was surprisingly bloody which I was expecting to have in droves and I was also surprised to see guns which don't usually pop up in these settings plus seeing Glenn beat up enemies with his fist's was actually refreshing to see when people mainly rely on magic they forget that fist's are also an option.\\n\\n\r\nThere was certainly comedy in this show and it was ok especially the relationship between Glenn and Sistine made for some decent entertainment like when Glenn would get on Sistine's nerves and she just shot him up in the air with her wind magic and the way Glenn acted around the students was also really funny and made me think that the way he acted made sure there wouldn't be any forced romance, but I was mostly wrong even though Glenn doesn't have romantic feelings for the girls Sistine looks like she kinda does by the end and honestly it just doesn't feel right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a pretty average anime with some surprise's and funny moments here and there, but it surprise's me the most how this is one of the more popular anime's of the spring season.",

            "content": "Akashic Records was one of the most underrated animes of the season. I think a lot of people got turned off by the almost rape scene and ended up not giving the series a chance. Also, with being only 12 episodes the overall plot was a little lacking. However, those were really the only flaws of the series and unfortunately the rape scene happens very early one. Aside from that, this anime has great themes in it. It is shown throughout the series, the importance of friends, family, love, and standing up for what you believe in. Do not give up on your dreams. Thatis what made this anime so special. The situations that the characters had with each other tested the limits of friendship and trust. At the end of the day, it wasn't about the magic or school, it was about how interactions between characters changed them.

It does not unravel the mystery of Akashic record an Sky castle.It merely sparks an interest. The character is generic pattern in anime.

            "content": "Great Series if you enjoy terrible art, retarded characters, the most clich\u00e9d clich\u00e9s, and an overall generic anime. Otherwise I cant really recommend.\r\nSemi-Serious review below\r\nCharacters\r\nYou have your average main character (protag-kun). Protag-kun is a depressed ex-assasin that has the mystical ability to disable all magic, with no exceptions at all whatsoever (himsef included.) too bad he almost never uses it. There are many times in the 12 episodes where that ability would of come in very handy, but is rarley ever used. Additionally, the protag-kun has the common sense of an embryo, despite being a famous, well known assassin, whose hands are too bloody toteach children, he has absolutely no battle sense. He easily shows his back to his enemies, must be legally deaf, because two elephants having sex could sneak up on him, etc. In the introductory cut scene. at the very beginning of the first episode he is shown killing large groups of mages, but in all of his fights he struggles to kill just one. By the end of the 12 episodes, he is shown up by one of the 16(ish) year old girls in a fight against \"Evil bad Guy Villain Dude\".\\n\\n\r\nTwo other characters are average tsundere (Girl A), complimentary kudere (Girl C), and the typical large breasted girl (Girl B). You get fun memorable characters with this show, like the guy with pink hair from episode 5(?), and Generic side-character H. Essentially what I am trying to convey is that this anime has the most cookie-cutter, generic, and clich\u00e9d characters for an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe villain character, \"Evil bad Guy Villain Dude\" is my second least favorite character in this anime. He is only truly introduced in the last half of the last episode. He's the type of, \"I'm doing bad things because I am bad\" villain that seriously ruins entire anime. Nothing about, \"Evil bad Guy Villain Dude\" makes him feel like an actual character, rather he feels more like something that was slapped into the plot because a villain was necessary and the author had nothing better. His powers are lack luster, and apparently his magic is not effected by the protagonists ability to stop all magic.\\n\\n\r\nNow all the characters, though bland would at least give this series a mediocre 4/10. However I personally would give the characters a 2/10 because of, and Solely because of Girl C. If Girl C was a lamp-post than she would have been a better addition to this anime than what she is. She is a flaming hot ball of bipolar, who has no sense of what is socially acceptable, and so much of the story is ruined because of how bad her character relations are. (see bottom of the page for that)\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nStereotypical school-shounen-light novel anime that doesn't do a whole lot of things to stand out. Every arc of this story also is very predictable. Girl B is always the damsel in distress, Girl A is your typical tsundere, \"I'm not helping you because I like you B-B-Baka.\" that  is best friends with Girl B. She will stop at no lengths to help Girl A because of the power of friendship. As a bonus there's a bunch of side characters that are completely irrelevant to the plot, but the show acts like you know them anyways. Bonus!!!\\n\\n\r\nOne additional thing I should note, which falls under Story/Characters is the Characters tone. This is probably the worst thing in the entire anime. Here are a few examples, lets see if you can catch on about why it's so bad,\\n\\n\r\nEXAMPLE 1: Terrorists walk into room and shoot magic capable of killing the students right next to Girl A's head. Background characters leaning forward, mouths slightly open, intensely yawning(?)\\n\\n\r\nEXAMPLE 2: Bloody splattered all over the walls, furniture smashed, balcony door open revealing broken railing. Background characters walk in, and say, \"Hey girl A did you see Girl B?\" Other background character quizzically asks, \"Did something Happen?\" EXAMPLE 3*\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nSkipable ED, and a terribly choreographed ultra-generic OP.\\n\\n\r\nBMG is acceptable, probably the best \"art\" Akashic records has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nvery lazy animation, too many still shots / panorama's. Character design is, again very cookie cutter, and anyone with some knowledge of anime could accurately guess all the main character's roles just by looking at their designs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Akashic Record's art is pretty deplorable, even somehow being worse than shows like Asterisk wars.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\\n\r\nI certainly cannot recommend Akashic Records to anyone who likes quality anime. There are many anime that do the same thing as Akashic Records, but do it much better, like Magi and Mah\u014dka K\u014dk\u014d no Rett\u014dsei. Akashic Records currently has a 7.5(ish)/10 on mal, however I would give it a 3-4/10. If an anime were to do absolutley 0 right, and be completley boring it would get a 3/10. Akashic Records, though it does not do much did 1 thing that was mildly entertaining, and that was explaining it's own worlds principals of magic. However, it does absolutely nothing with these  principals later in the 12 episodes, returning to the point that everything protag-kun taught his students was only shown a few episodes after, then it completely diapered. The students in Akashic Records are never shown to have improved through the anime, which was the appeal of watching the teacher (protag-kun) in the first place. Instead the characters say they cant do something, through the power of protag-kun, they do it, then they go back into the sidelines, completely useless as if nothing ever happened.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah here's a score\\n\\n\r\n\"\\sum _{n=4}^{\\sqrt{16}}n / 10\"\\n\\n\r\n(sorry for this review being inconstant, wrote this pretty late im not exactly in the right frame of mind to worry aboud sentence structure and narative flow. expect some edits.)\\n\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nextras (*contain spoilers)\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is complete garbage. Like, SAO tentacle rape levels of garbage. It tries to be really clever with a denouement, and link back to the intro cutscene but it fails. The final battle is an anticlimax to an anime that is nothing but a large anticlimax.\\n\\n\r\nEXAMPLE 3\\n\r\nGirl C just impaled  Protag-kun with a sword. Girl A knows it's Girl C, and to rub salt into her wound Girl B is attacked by Girl C and handed over to the enemies that want to kill her. Girl A, and \"Alfred\" then attempt to save protag-kun from threshold of death. They do so. Later that episode Protag-kun approaches Girl C and is completely cool being impaled and almost killed. He convinces her to switch back to his side, and acts like he was never impaled by a huge sword. they defeat the villain of that episode (Fake onii-san) and return. ~Says nothing to protag-kun who almost died~. Girl A to Girl B \"I am glad you're back.\" Girl A to Girl C - frowns slightly, then IMMEDIATELY CRYING TO THE POINT THAT HER FUCKING TEAR-DUCTS DRY THEN WITHER, AND HUGS GIRL C TIGHTLY  \"I AM SO GLAD U R BACK\" ?wat?",

I'll make sure i tag them.\r\nThis wont be one of those reviews where i analyze the show through a critic's perspective. I'll simply rate it considering how i felt about it.\r\nStory - 8\r\nSo RokuAka is one of those cliched shows. It's got a harem, an op mc or whatever else. But this show's strength lies in packing all these cliches and tropes together to actually create something interesting. It had a decent story and each episode progressed the plot. It managed to pack all the contents in twelve episodes and made surenot a single episode was wasted. The plot was genuinely interesting and had a lot of potential, but the whole thing was so rushed that there were a ton of things unexplained by the end. There were a few genuinely interesting plot points but it was all seemingly wasted. It would have worked out a lot better if it had more episodes and a slower pacing. The plot was also heavily dependent on magic and it wasn't really a bad thing. The magic system was easy to understand, *cough* Mahouka *cough* which made the fight scenes fun to watch. The reason the ratings went down may be due to the fact that it kinda got rushed in the end and didn't get the ending it deserved. It was all packed into one episode which kinda sucked. I personally think this would have worked out a lot better with two cours.\\n\\n\r\nFor example-*SPOILER ALERT* \\n\r\nAll the villains seemed to be looking for the akashic records (it's in the goddamn title) but it was never really given a proper explanation. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nNo problems in the art department. It had a kind of unique take on the art style, the characters were beautifully animated. My only problem is with the lackluster fight scenes. They weren't that bad but they weren't excellent either.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.5\\n\r\nThe music suited the atmosphere quite well, the op was good, but looking back, i cant remember more than a single soundtrack despite the fact that i binged the show an hour ago. Sound- nothing special really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nThe usual cliched characters. The op mc, the tsundere, the kind girl, the loli a classroom full of whiny students who go seeennnssseeeiii at every possible moment, etc etc. The villains were quite different though, for example - *spoiler*the maid. The female cast was actually quite helpful like rayford and sistine assisting glenn in his battles. Rumia played the captured damsel in distress at every possible moment. The characters were a bit lacking but the cast was not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nThe only reason this show has 7.4 is due to its enjoyment factor. The first few episodes were extremely hilarious and enjoyable but went downhill as it progressed. The comedy in the first few episodes kept the lightheartedness of the show intact, but it got boring real fast. To me the tournament arc was enjoyable but it was rushed too, so basically the enjoyment of the first few episode gets spoiled by the pacing and the repetitive humour and the creators trying to stuff a ton of content into each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8 (7.75 really)\\n\r\nLike mentioned above there are a ton of good qualities in the show but it all goes downhill as the show progresses. It fails to keep the viewer interested in the show after the first few episodes. Towards the end it may actually seem like a chore to watch this. But whether you like it or not is actually upto you.",

But the second episode really got me hooked. It was going so well and had a big potential of making an amazing storyline, but it didn't. It sticked with this average cliche story that we have all watched, and is now so uninteresting, as well as the story came out as a cheesy fanservice instead of a decent, clearcut fantasy story. The story just revolved on Glenn saving everyone because everyone is so useless. It is cringy, though Istill love Glenn.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 7/10 SOUND: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and OST is good. But not the best still. But it is decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n1 point for Glenn because he is actually bad ass and smart. 1 point for Albert because he is best bro and probably the only one who does not need to be saved in the anime, and instead, he held up his own ass. 1 point for Celica because she is bad ass and can hold up her own ass.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the others, the whole anime focused around on saving the three girls included in the harem. That's it. If you want fanservice, go. If you dream of girls who are in distress, & you just want to imagine yourself saving them while pretending you are Glenn, go. But if you want quality, don't bother watching this. \\n\\n\r\nI just hoped the fanservice did not take over the entire freaking story.",

            "content": "TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.\r\nRokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records (RokuAka for short) is yet another of the required light novel adaptations of the season which showcases a story of MC-kun (in this case, Glenn) who pretends to be weak, but secretly has an immense talent or strength. He's forced into a situation with which he wants nothing to do with, and ends up meeting main love interest (in this case, Sistine). It's all said and done countless times while the setting and characters change from one place to another. \r\nRokuAka unfortunately suffersa lot from the painfully overdone attributes and story it was given. Glenn Radars starts out as a massive dick, and ends up becoming more and more likable... or so I wish. Through the story, Glenn's reasoning and beliefs get ever so more and more frustrating to listen to. Even his laughably normal backstory of being a former pro and losing his former love interest because of his failure to be OP is just boring as hell. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, your main love interest Sistine is a boring tsun-girl who's far too dere after 4 episodes. Your best girl who's unfortunately not main love interest is vital to the story, but is actually just there to be a hostage. Your kickass girl is basically emotionless except when it comes to Glenn. *sigh*\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: RokuAka is just another stereotypical light novel adaptation (just because it's a LN adaptation doesn't make it automatically bad, by the way) with the same setting, different location and different characters. Boring as hell all the way through, you wouldn't be missing out on too much should you choose to not watch this show.",

            "content": "Akashic Records of Bastard Magical Instructor, was a mediocre at best anime, using commonly used tropes and setting to make another anime of something we've already seen before.\r\nThe story/plot premise of this series, was at best all over the place. The first 3 introductory episodes weren't very good to an enjoyment level, the first episode was a bit cringe worthy, and unfortunately doesn't really establish anything but set up the tropes and show you how the harem starts.\r\nThe story of this series is about a \"mysterious\" I guess you could say temporary substitute teacher named Glenn Radars who's background becomes more apparent when flashed backlater in the series, and the whole show revolves around him and his \"class\" but more like 3 girls, Sistine, Re:L, and Rumia.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I say \"class\" is because throughout the show the class in generally doesn't really matter at all besides certain students. The class is more of a \"support when needed for Glenn\" and not a \"fundamental\" part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I hated about this show story/plot wise lies with the Title and nonstop hearing of \"AKASHIC RECORDS\" its in the TITLE, and literally said god knows how many times in the show, but never gives a single thought or minute as to explaining what even IS the Akashic Records. Instead the whole plot revolves around rescuing Rumia and other girls the entire series like you're a knight saving the princess from the tallest tower trope in fairy tales.\\n\\n\r\nThe story side I rate a 5 because the Akashic Records which is never talked about once in the whole story, and constant use of repetitive tropes, and cliched bullshit throughout the show made it very very boring, and on the contrary it being rushed to all hell is very nice also. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise I've already gone into for the most part, and the characters around Glenn are all just... bland. They're really really boring. We have typical tsundere Sistine, typical loli Re:L, and your basic anime girl Rumia.\\n\r\nSomething I also don't understand though as an Academy why is it never seem frowned upon the entire series that there are students constantly trying to get with Glenn? I fail to understand that as we clearly see other teachers/faculty see how the relationship is etc. I mean, there should be a boundary usually, however that is obviously not the case in this show. \\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary the enemies/villains in Akashic Records are even worse, not only do they all do the same stupid idea: LETS GO CAPTURE -insert whoever here- for their magic power, its done so almost Team Rocket like where there's never any success rate. The funny part is the amount of stupidity into some of the things that happen in the series. Not recommending this, but go rewatch some of the episodes Glenn uses the fools world and realize the laws of the card get broken whenever they need to keep the sequence going to work out how the author wants it to, and not \"what actually makes logical sense.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, you can kinda tell by how they dress all the female students like they're complete skanks, and the males all have the typical uniform seen in any other LN adapted magic/school/fantasy harem series dresses, so the art really isn't anything you haven't seen, and the animation also wasn't really different compared to anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound from the anime besides the OP was just meh. I actually really do like the opening theme for Akashic Records, but the voice actors do at least fit their respected character for the most part, but most of the time when something serious/emotional was happening it was poor. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of this series was weird, it started off like \"wow this looks like its gonna be complete garbage.\" to \"eh, maybe this can make a comeback?\" and then back to \"man this wasn't anything I haven't seen already.\" by episode 12. I give it a 6 being fair because honestly as a harem anime standpoint it really isn't that bad, but it isn't amazing either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say if you like harem series and never get sick of them, go ahead and watch this show. Its a show where you kinda just shut your brain off to enjoy. I personally didn't really like the show due to the fact that it breaks its own rules, pretty bad cast overall, and just the fact the most important parts of the actual show were never talked about in the slightest. I would really only recommend watching this if you want to kill time, or just really really like harems. I rate it a 7 overall, its not like its bad, or mediocre, I'd say its good for the most part for a harem genre show, which I generally rate it as just good or poor as is lol.\\n",

            "content": "\"So today's class will be a self-study period...\r\n'Cause I'm tired\"\r\n~ Yours truly, Glenn Radars (Everyone's beloved Sensei)\r\nWhat started out as one of the promising shows of the season, was let down by the rapid pacing of the story that left many fans - readers or non-source readers alike - bewildered. Had this anime adapted less volumes or went for a 2 season split-cour, it would do a great justice to this light novel adaptation in a season deprived of quality magic action show.\r\nStory: 6\r\nArt: 8\r\nSound: 8\r\nCharacters: 9\r\nEnjoyment: 9\r\nOverall: 8\r\nPersonally, this show is a 10/10 for my taste. But for readers sake, bias are sidelined. Hereare whats in store for you:\\n\r\nKawaii looking girls, definitely waifu materials or to add to your own personal 2D harem\\n\r\nCostumes & hairstyles? Good inspiration for cosplay materials.\\n\r\nComedy that doesn't feel out of place\\n\r\nDecent fight-scene\\n\r\nMC is someone who is more than meets the eyes\\n\r\nYou'll curse at the MC, but then you'll change your mind (everytime)\\n\r\nYou'd wish you had a teacher like Glenn Radars\\n\r\nYou'd wish you had an oneesan like Celica\\n\r\nYou'd wish you had Rumia as your wife, Re=L as your imouto and Sistine as your... err, it's a bit complicated\\n\r\nA hint of romance here and there, but just to tease you\\n\\n\r\nStrength of this show? Comedy, the fight-scenes, fun soundtrack and enjoyable casts of characters.\\n\r\nDownside of this show? Pacing of the story, MC personality might not be everyone's cup of tea, you don't even know what is Akashic Records at the end of the day and it's a light novel adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nMost light novel adaptation are borderline bad to watchable. Fortunately, Akashic Records sits above watchable but it is plagued by the pacing of the show itself. There are hardly any continuation in a light novel adaptation, since the purpose has always been to promote the source material.\\n\\n\r\n Also, only Japanese readers can easily access and fully comprehend the source materials. Majority of the English readers would rely on fans translation or adaptation that takes years to complete and by the time it's done, chances are you're not even gonna bother reading it. At least manga have the pictures to do the talking, even if you don't understand the text.  \\n\\n\r\nOnly few series are a notable exceptions, for example SAO. IMO, this trend and practice is slowly killing the anime industry. It's high time that producers rethink on how to run a sustainable business if budget is a concern in long run without compromising the quality of the show and fans interest, else we will forever be plagued with tons of poorly adapted LNs show every season in the years to come.   \\n\\n\r\nLastly, \\n\r\nthe show ended on an open note with a mixed signal, leaving behind a small hope for potential season 2 sequel, or it's just another gimmick by the producer trying to imply \"go read the source material for continuation, The End\" which unfortunately is a trend in the anime industry nowadays just to promote the source material. That, I leave to your imagination. \\n\\n\r\nTL;Dr - Strongly recommended to watch as your Spring 2017 line-up, a must watch of avid fans of school-action-magic-comedy-romance subplot based settings, and to read the source materials to truly enjoy and immerse of what could have been a serious contender for anime of the season/year.\\n\\n",

I honestly don't understand why it's so incomprehensible toanimators to maybe switch things up a bit before giving the rest of the us recycled plot, characters, and design. \\n\\n\r\nLike of course the female lead is a huge ditz who is passionate about learning and yet is a huge tsundere. Of course she practically gets raped in the very first few episodes. Of course the idea of anyone having any romantic interest in her is unfathomable to the human brain. Of course the main character basically treats her like shit. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not asking for a shoujo lmao, I'm asking for a fair representation of both genders?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!/\\n",

            "content": "Im Gonna start this off by saying ive completed aroumd 250 different shows to date and that my rating of 1/5 or 2/10 on a 10 scale reflects that 80% of the shows ive watched are better than this one. Im not saying this show has 0 entertainment value to be found. Now ill try to keep this short and sweet because itd be silly to put more effort into writing this review than the writers put into writing this show. Dont get me wrong i understand the appeal of this show, which happens to be more for the type of person who watches animeto project their self into the main characters position as a wish fulfillment fantasy of sorts. Theres nothing wrong with this per say, but its definitely far from my cup of tea. The show is riddled with uninspired writing, boring characters and villains and lacks any real depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of this show are all flat and boring and have no more depth than the archetypes that they were created around. Silver haired tsundere (sisti) is just a basic tsundere, she even makes a point to yell baka at least 3 times an episode in the most grating voice possible. The main protagonist (glen) is basic light novel protagonist type 2, the edgelord. He constantly trys to act like a lone wolf cool guy and of course gets all the underage girls he teaches affection despite his shitty demeanor. You get the point, none of the main cast is likable. The school outfits the girls have to wear cross the line between fantasy and fetish as well. The author just shamelessly put the main females in super revealing clothing and garter belts. Typically im fairly lenient with this kind of thing but as i said previously this is past fantasy and into fetishism. If a character wants to dress like that on their own accord so be it, but for a school to force them into these clothes is just kinda sick. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is just another uninspired high school magic acadamy based one like asterisk war or irregular at magic high. the show brings nothing unique or interesting to he table just like the other two shows i mentioned along with it. if youve seen one you might as well have seen all three. They also dont seem to know how to write a proper plot twist at all either. in the last mini arc the main villain reveals himself to be some other guy weve never even seen up to this point. on top of that the guy he was posing as was just introduced as well. as viewers we have no connection to either of these guys so finding out that he was just posing as some other guy is meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains in this show are also as weakly writen as the protagonists. Their motivations are weak and lack elaboration. Almost all of them are just mindless murderers or rapists hat just do it because gotta be evil somehow amiright??  The writers dont spend any time making these villains seem human at all and its just another example of this shows poor writing. I dont think theres one instance of nuance being added to the villains, which just leaves them as cackling maniacs with no real presence. I can honestly say i dont remember one of their names or faces.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be obvious by now between the title of my review and my commentary thus far but this show definitely gets a pass from me. Theres many shows that do this genre much better, Chivalry of a failed knight is one great example but theres also just many better shows out there in general. Go watch or black lagoon, sunabozu, my hero academia or psycho-pass season one if youre looking for something with action. Hope this review helps a person or two or opens he eyes of someone stuck in this genre of anime.",

Glenn Radars. \r\nHere we have this character who is unmotivated in life and doesn't want to do anything besides to sleep etc. Just lazy things. He will be assigned to an academy to teach magic lesson to his class. There he meetshis class. The class 2. Full of interesting students especially our protagonists like Shironeko (The Tsun----) and Rumia (The Kind and cute one) Everything will be spoiler so prepare to take some actions.\\n\\n\r\nIn my own watching. This anime didn't follow some cliches moments in other animes. It is interesting for me. I don't always watch Magic-school genre anime but this one captivated me episode by episode. Who knows where Tarot Cards would be interesting also. Every secrets and pasts of our characters are worth to hear and watch. Spending my time to this anime is quite good. Storyline so far is interesting. This is your typical anime but I am not sure how will this ends but it ends and this anime has ended not fair enough but bad enough to kill the mood of the viewers. It was good so far but how can I watch a forced and quick episode in the end? My hyped is not real so far in this anime. It just killed the last episode with some leftover plot and some mysteries. \\n\\n\r\nIf this is your first watch. Please make some hesitation to watch it. You will love and not love the characters. Please beware also of our \"Magic Punch\". That is one of the reasons I love this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading it~",

Later when they started to develop more characters things got deeper and the development itself was great and they managed to put comical moments there and there well. We got to know the motives and history of the characters well and why things are the way they are. Story is very slice of lifeish. Main characters are not per se looking for the thing that is the \"goal of the anime?\", it is rather that enemies drive them to look for it, I think. Art is great and action scenes are good though wouldhave wanted something even more action packed; ref. later in review. Sound design was ok, nothing remarkable. \\n\r\n       This anime would have been 8 or 9 if it weren't for the more lack luster and a bit rushed ending. It was kind a disappointment that there wasn't really a good resolve and scenes just went by very quickly without without good tie ends, so episodes didn't flow smoothly. Because of this rushing we didn't see a good action packed all out battle in the end. \\n\r\n       Badness of the ending is most likely due to the fact that studio wanted to end in action so they had to cut development in the end short to meet the 12 ep. limit. 24 episodes most probably would have solved this so they would have had time to develop things more and give us a satisfying ending.\\n\r\nIn the end we don't know what would have happened but for this anime's score is 7,4/10, rounded to 7/10.",

            "content": "(This review may contain spoilers and name drops of other forms of media)\r\nDid you know scores of GTA V on Steam are plummeting hard? Well scores of Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor on MyAnimeList seem to be plummeting even harder! However, I probably don't seem to understand what makes this anime so bad, but then again, it's not amazing either.\r\nStory - 7/10:\r\n(\"OH GOD! THE UNIFORMS MAKE THE CHARACTERS LOOK LIKE STRIPPERS! THIS ANIME SUCKS!\" - says a bunch of reviewers of this anime) To be fair, I didn't mind the school uniforms as it was inevitable fanservice that was commonplace in anime. But inregards to the actual story, the first few episodes set it up like it would have been a great parody of magical academy anime as I was laughing at a bunch of moments involving Glenn Radars, the main protagonist, who, as the name implies, is the bastard magic instructor, who is utterly lazy. But as the series went on, I remembered not getting used to its unwelcome sense of seriousness by around episode 8, where Re=L literally backstabs Glenn. Another flaw of this anime is how they tried to fuse seriousness with comedy by making Glenn not take situations so seriously, which brought the story aspect down. However, thankfully, Glenn does get blinded by rage in the last episode when attempting to kill off Jatice, the main antagonist of the anime, which might have been foreshadowed. Sadly, ending was rather anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10:\\n\r\nThe animation wasn't perfect but it was fairly good. One flaw is how Sistine Fibel always seems to be blushing when she is not supposed to. Other than that, the art was 2017 standards.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 3/10:\\n\r\nThis is where the anime takes a big hit; the sound aspect, with an abysmal OP by (oh crap!) Konomi Suzuki (no wonder why it sucks so bad, considering she made abysmal OP's for both No Game No Life and Re:Zero, but this one is even worse than both!) and a squeaky ED I don't even remember. Other than that, no comment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10:\\n\r\nIt was an alright cast of characters, almost almost no one unique, except for maybe Glenn Radars, who goes through personality changes from being lazy, to being kind and caring, to thankfully being blinded by rage, although I would want to see more of that rage. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10:\\n\r\nNot the most enjoyable anime in the world but it's decently enjoyable, so 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5.8/10:\\n\r\nIt's not as abysmal as everyone is starting to think, but it's not even close to perfect either. It has its enjoyable moments and does have a few differences from other action harem school anime, but don't expect it to be super amazing.",

            "content": "Akashic records of the bastard instructor is based off the light novel of the same name that I only started to read recently. This anime after seeing the Pv for it and the first episode is proving to be one of the best animes that started this season. Power based animes like Akashic records are one of the staples of the anime industry and one of the most common genre and with good reason. The premise of the show somewhat resembles another anime that I seen in the past that had a similar story and premise. This was Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. In a way,the main character Glenn does have some resemblance to the main character of that show. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise behind Akashic records is a rather simple one and centers around the life of a magic instructor that has a rather dark past that one day becomes an instructor at a famed magic academy where he is charged with teaching a class of trainee mages that among their number includes some really interesting characters. However just as the main character Glenn thinks he\u2019s earned an easy job evil forces start to make their moves and forcing Glenn to protect his students and friends from them. \\n\r\nStory and setting \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for Akashic records follows the adventure and life of the main character Glenn Radars a 21-year-old mage that despite not looking like he has the knowledge to become a magic teacher is forced to become a teacher at the famed Alzano Imperial Magic academy. Here he meets a host of interesting characters that includes Rumia a positive and cheerful girl that loves to learn and aspires to use magic to help improve the life of people and Sistine an intelligent and competent mage of noble birth that despite acting tough cares a great deal about her classmates and friends. Though Glenn\u2019s laid-back nature and dismissive attitude towards magic antagonizes the members of the class both Glenn and the class soon find common ground after Glenn meets Rumia and Sistine and gets to know them more. However, from the shadows enemy factions begin to start their nefarious plans against the empire and Glenn and his students find themselves caught up in their plans forcing Glenn to both defeat them and defend his friends and students. \\n\\n\r\nThe story for Akashic records is largely set within the Alzano empire a country that seems to be run by a monarchy. The Alzano empire is famed for its magic and its strong mages which are used for both offensive purposes and research purposes. Rather than using wands or staffs like in other anime and media that feature mages and magic in this world seems to be incarnation based and features a variable number of steps that must be taken before the spell can be used. \\n\\n\r\nSistine\\n\\n\r\nSistine Fibel voiced by veteran seiyuu Akane Fujita of Orange and High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main heroines of the show. A 16-year-old girl of noble birth that attends the magic academy that Glenn is posted to Sistine is a proud girl that has great pride in both her family and in the field of magic. At the same time, she\u2019s also hard working and kind and cares a great deal about her friends and classmates. While also hard working Sistine is also highly motivated as a student that comes from her desire to study magic and achieve her goal into the legendary sky castle which is one of the great mysteries of the empire. Although a rich girl and a Tsundere Sistine doesn\u2019t fit the profile of an archetypal rich girl in that she is willful and kind to all she meets and at the same time willing to put herself in the line of fire to protect them highlighting her bravery. \\n\\n\r\nSistine and Glenn have an interesting relationship that forms a part of the animes main plot and serves as character development for her character. In the beginning of the series Sistine did not really have a very high opinion of Glenn both as a teacher or as a mage mainly due to his lazy nature and the way that he taught the class. However, as the series progresses and seeing more of Glenn\u2019s true nature and how much he\u2019s been through as well as seeing how much he\u2019s willing to do to protect his students Sistine\u2019s impression of him starts to change. Though she will still get angry with him it can be seen that she\u2019s also more understanding of Glenn as a result and more willing to go with his ideas than in the past. In terms of character role however Sistine in addition to being one of the main heroines also has an important role with regards to Glenn in that she serves as a foil to him that is able to deflect Glenn\u2019s worst ideas and keep him focused on the task at hand. This is a role that she shares with the character of Celica. Aside from her strong personality Sistine actually has a rather strong motivation for studying magic that stems from the last wishes of a member of her family that she respected a great deal. As a result, she is very determined to study hard so that she can one day be able to achieve her dream and fulfill the wishes that wasn\u2019t achieved by her motivator. One notable trait of their relationship is the nickname that Glenn gave Sistine on their first meeting White cat which though annoyed her to great extent was eventually accepted by her as her relationship with Glenn improved. This was a good indication of their deepening relationship. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character, I thought that Sistine was a pretty well-designed character. While smart, fast thinking and brave she was not the typical rich girl that most nobles are and instead displayed kindness and compassion to her friends and classmates that was surprising and really put her in good stead. However, the main highlight that her character brings to the field is of course the relationship that she establishes with the main character Glenn and the changes that she helps bring out in him. I also thought that their relationship though not started on the best of terms was developed rather well and I thought it was cute seeing her develop feelings for Glenn though. Overall, I thought that Sistine was an excellent character that brought a lot to the plot and that her seiyuu Akane Fujita really did an excellent job portraying her. As a result, Sistine is one of my favourite characters on the series. \\n\\n\r\nRumia \\n\\n\r\nRumia voiced by new seiyuu Yume Miyamoto is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the man heroines of the series. A cheerful and positive 16-year-old girl Rumia attends the Alzano imperial magic academy with her best friend Sistine and is part of the class that Glenn teaches. Personality wise Rumia is a kind, caring and diligent person that while also a studious person always strives to keep arguments and disagreements in the class to the minimum. Like Sistine Rumia is a capable mage that tries hard to improve her knowledge of magic but in contrast to Sistine her intended reason for this is to improve her knowledge of magic so that she can think of ways that it can be improved so that it can be used for the benefit of all of humanity. While Rumia may look meek and innocent on the outside Rumia actually is a very brave and responsible person that tries her best to protect her friends and classmates from the danger that is drawn to her even if it meant sacrificing her life in order to protect them. Rumia and Sistine have been friends for a long time and as a result Sistine can be considered to be her best friend. As a result, both know each other very well and most often can guess on what motives are behind their actions. In the anime, this trait is mainly used by Rumia when she tries to determine Sistine\u2019s actions with regards to her interactions with Glenn often to hilarious results to Sistine when she finds out. As a result of her personality Rumia often finds herself as the mediator when trying to deal with Sistine\u2019s disagreements with Glenn which I found to be funny to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with Sistine Rumia also plays a role in effecting changes to Glenn\u2019s personality and behavior though in a slightly different way. In Sistine\u2019s case she manages to effect changes in him due to her earnest nature and passion to achieve her intended goal but in Rumia\u2019s case the change was mainly due to the dreams and wishes that Rumia has in relation to magic and how it can be used to help people. Like Sistine Rumia tries her best to educate Glenn on what a good mage should stand for and how magic should be used though in this case this is reinforced by her own beliefs in magic as well. With Rumia\u2019s character I really liked the fact that while quiet Rumia is still able to provide a great deal of emotional and knowledge to Glenn and the cast with her prominent trait which is determination and courage helping the most as it motivates them even more so.  \\n\\n\r\nAs with the other heroines of the show Rumia also has a sub story arc of her own that concerns her real identity and the tense relationship that she has with her real mother. I felt that this story arc was actually pretty well done as it helped establish the cause of Rumia\u2019s meek personality as well as reveal the trauma that not only hung heavily on Rumia but also on Glenn as well. Overall, I felt that the character of Rumia was very well designed and contrasted with the other main heroines like Sistine and Re=L in personality. While certainly not as proficient in combat as Re=L or as headstrong as Sistine Rumia exhibited a kindness and determination that serves well to motivate the main cast as they deal with the threats that pop up in the story. Though this is the first time that I heard Yume Miyamoto\u2019s voice I felt that she did a pretty good job in voicing Rumia. \\n\\n\r\nGlenn \\n\\n\r\nGlenn Radars voiced by veteran voice actor Soma Saito of Qualidea code and Rokka no Yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the show. A veteran mage that has a mysterious past that is forced to find a job to support himself and on recommendation of his guardian decided to apply for a teaching post at a prestigious magic academy even though he lacked the required skills needed. Personality wise Glenn actually has two different personalities with the second being hidden behind the mask of the first that he adapts in his normal duties. Glenn\u2019s initial personality is one that is laid back and lazy and seems to adapt the belief that he\u2019s only here for his pay check. This personality is what the students in his class seen as Glenn started to teach them and from this I can certainly see why the students especially Sistine did not view him with confidence. Though laid back and lazy in the beginning Glenn as the series progresses mainly due to the efforts of Sistine and Rumia and to some degree Celica does start to get serious with his teaching which switches his personality to his second one. \\n\\n\r\nIn this second personality that Glenn adapts when he gets serious with his job Glenn is notably more serious with his teaching and tries to ensure that each of his students understand the topics that he\u2019s teaching them by breaking his topics into individual chunks that are more easily understood. Because this manner of teaching is noticeably different from how other instructors at the academy teach and because the techniques that he teaches actually have a noticeable difference Glenn\u2019s teachings soon become more famous. \\n\\n\r\nArguably from this second personality we can get a sense of what Glenn\u2019s true personality that was hidden is actually like. When properly motivated Glenn though still retaining his prominent trait of adaptability is apart from being more serious with is job more caring towards his students and see\u2019s each one as his responsibility. As a result, any mistake and failure that they incur is felt by Glenn as he views this as his own failure. Although overconfident and cocky at times Glenn\u2019s confidences in his students are often based on a combination of his faith in his teachings as well as in the skills of his students and usually have a high probability of succeeding. A peculiar trait of Glenn\u2019s is the way that he motivates his students which in this case is done usually be him not believing that his students can achieve their goal which has the effect of making his students angry and cause them to perform even better by devoting more attention to it. Though odd to see for a teacher this method of motivation that Glenn makes use was surprisingly effect as the students with Sistine at their head will try ever harder so that they can prove to Glenn that they can do it. Overall, I felt that the character of Glenn was a pretty well designed one that proves that while knowing how something works in theory is all well and good its actual experience combined with the means of adapting that knowledge that is the most useful on the field. Though a somewhat incompetent teacher at first it was nice to see Glenn develop both as a character and as a teacher over the series and seeing him develop a good working relationship with his class and also with the main heroines of Sistine, Rumia and Re=l was heart-warming to see. I felt that Soma Saito really did a pretty good job in voicing the character of Glenn.  \\n\\n\r\nCelica \\n\\n\r\nCelica voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Eri Kitamura of Yamada and the seven witches and High school of the dead fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Glenn and co\u2019s main allies. A professor at the academy that teaches at the magic academy that Sistine and Rumia study at and also the one that recommended Glenn for the role of a lecture Celica\u2019s personality can be best described as that of a trickster. A long living mage that seems to have extensive knowledge regarding magic in a number of different fields Celica and Glenn seem to have a close relationship as she was the one that adapted him when his parents were killed. As a result, it can be said that the foundation of the magic that started him on his path of becoming a mage actually stems from her. The relationship between the two can be seen to be a close one but not to the extent of being a romantic one as of yet. Yet it does appear that she does have a great deal of trust in him. Personality wise Celica has a rather mischievous personality in that she loves to tease Glenn though at the same time she can be equally serious as well. Celica has also proven to be pretty smart and well-read in that she\u2019s able to deduce the identity of a curse object with only the minimum of hints. Lastly Celica can also be surprisingly understanding able to see the true reason why Glenn\u2019s attitude towards teaching has changed and seeing how his students have affected him. In the end, I felt that Celica though not often seen was a great support character that did a lot to help Glenn and co in the story. I felt that Eri Kitamura did a pretty good job in voicing the character of Celica and though I would have liked to see her more her existing role will have to do.  \\n\\n\r\nRe=L \\n\\n\r\nRe=l played by veteran seiyuu Ari Ozawa of Classroom crisis and Asterisk wars fame is one of the main support characters in the series and is one of the series three main heroines. A combat mage and a part of the empires elite mage corps division where she is partnered with Albert Re=l is a very quiet girl that prefers solitude than be with friends and indeed despite her age in which she should be in school actually has very few friends. While quiet and innocent Re=l also has limited social skills in the beginning of the series and as such rarely talked to anyone other than Albert and Glenn. Indeed, when confronted by strangers Re=l would often hid behind Glenn when present. This behavior actually reminded me of a child to which Re=L\u2019s personality resembles. Despite that Re=l\u2019s personality in the beginning can be described to be rather blunt and straightforward in the most comical of ways. As a result of her personality Re=l prefers things to be straightforward. Because of her limited social skills other people find it hard to approach her which is the main reason why she doesn\u2019t have any friends. Re=L\u2019s most prominent trait that is seen most prominently when she first appears is that she associates everything about her with Glenn which often caused an embarrassing moment for Glenn and a sense of jealousy for Sistine that I found to be pretty funny. \\n\\n\r\nThe development of Re=l\u2019s character in the series I felt was actually done pretty well and was tied to her sub story arc which focused on explaining her origins and her past and explain how she and Glenn actually met. This story arc I felt was pretty interesting and I have to say Re=l\u2019s origins was really unexpected.  As the series progresses and as Re=L meets not just Glenn but also Sistine and Rumia Re=L\u2019S personality starts to change. Though still only able to express a limited amount of expressions Re=l\u2019s personality and demeanor starts to become more positive as she starts to make friends with not just Sistine and Rumia but also with other members of the class which had the effect of making her more happy and cheerful. This also revealed a surprisingly cute thing about her which was her love of eating desserts.  As a result of both the forming of friendships with Sistine and Rumia and accepting who she really was after completing her sub plot Re=l becomes more not just more positive and cheerful but also more determined than ever to protect those that she considers dear to her. More importantly she was able to understand the intended lesson that Glenn wanted to convey to her in this arc which was to live your own life and let people accept who you are. \\n\\n\r\nThe most important relationship for Re=l in the series is without a doubt the one that she shares with Glenn that stems from the fact that she was saved by him and followed him when he was in the corps. As a result, his sudden disappearance was a great shock to her and ultimately was what caused her personality to be that of a recluse. This is a fact that Glenn too knows and is something that can be seen that he regrets immensely. As a result, her story arc was as much as it in revealing Re=l\u2019s past and origins as it was in establishing the effects that Glenn\u2019s sudden exit had on his friends.  Overall Re=l I felt was a well-designed character that had an interesting backstory and origin that really defined her. I felt that her seiyuu Ari Ozawa really did an excellent job in portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nEleanor \\n\\n\r\nEleanor voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yoko Hikasa is one of the main support characters and is one of the many villains that Glenn and co face in the series. A member of a terrorist organisation that forms this series main villain Eleanor is a devious, manipulative and deceitful person well used to manipulate people to achieve her own goals. At the same time Eleanor has been shown to have excellent combat skills that are on par with even veteran mages like Albert surprisingly. Indeed, Eleanor is the only evil mage that Glenn hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to deal with which was surprising. Though a support character I felt that Eleanor was an interesting character that brought up the point that evil mages could be just about anybody even a simple maid like herself. Her combat scenes with Albert though were pretty interesting and I felt that her seiyuu Yoko Hikasa really did a great job in portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nLeo \\n\\n\r\nLeo voiced by veteran voice actor Kensho Ono of Aldnoah Zero and Bungou stray dogs fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of the many villains that Glenn and co has to deal with. A talented mage that Sistine is familiar with Leo is a capable, smart and well-mannered person that on the outside appears to be a perfect gentleman. Leo is also a talented speaker and teacher and excels at breaking down complex problems and explaining how each part works. In a way Leo can be considered to be a contrast to Glenn. Leo\u2019s true nature and personality that he skilfully hides behind his mask however is vastly different to normal personality in that he is arrogant, competitive and manipulative and would trample other people\u2019s dreams if it meant he could achieve his even quicker. The true reason that caused him to actually into a villain however was really surprising though. In a way Leo can be considered to be perhaps the best two face character I have seen in a long time mainly because his two different personalities are entirely opposite of each other. This character actually had a pretty surprising twist near the end that I though was well executed and was certainly unexpected. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of arts and animation I felt that the character designs for the individual characters in the series was done pretty well and was largely faithful to the source material which in this case is the light novel. The design of the school uniform that Sistine and Rumia wear did of course raise some eyebrows but since this was in line with the source material I guess it can\u2019t be helped. The designs for the uniforms that Re=L and Albert wear as part of their duties I felt was also pretty good as they helped convey a sense of authority that members of the military should have. Animation in general I felt was well done especially in relation to showing how magic in this world is used and what its effect are like. The fight scenes in this series I felt was pretty detailed and clear and allowed us to clearly see the moves that both sides made during the fight quite easily.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series I felt was well done with both the opening and ending themes being my favorites as they were both catchy and positive. The scene music I felt was nice and was appropriate for the scenes that it was used in. Akashic records like most anime these days makes use of an opening and ending theme which in this case was Blow out by Konomi Suzuki and precious you which is sung by the seiyuu\u2019s for the three main heroines in this show which is Akane Fujita for Sistine, Yume Miyamoto for Rumia and Ari Ozawa for Re=l. The opening theme I felt managed to convey a sense of excitement for the series that was welcoming and fresh while the ending theme managed to convey a sense of hope towards the future while also being catchy. Both I felt were pretty well done and matched the tone of this series as well. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting as a whole for the series I felt was excellent with particular praise going to Akane Fujita, Yume Miyamoto and Ari Ozawa who voiced the characters of Sistine, Rumia and Re=l who I felt managed to portray their respective characters really well. Soma Saito who voiced the main character Glenn I felt also did a pretty good job in portraying him. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Akashic records was an interesting and impressive anime that had among its main strengths a strong story that was full of twists and revelations, strong and well-developed characters, excellent voice acting and excellent animation and design with regards to animation, character design and fighting scenes. Finally, it had a very strong voice cast as well. This anime is one that deserves a sequel though because it had everything that a good anime needs and without a doubt this anime is one of the best ones for this season. Most importantly the ending the series I felt was really well executed and reflected the changes that not just Glenn as a character has developed into but also in how perception of him from his class that was wary of him at first at changed as a result of the struggles that they been through together. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot line for Akashic records I felt was pretty interesting and had a pretty unique premise that drew me to it. The idea of a reclusive mage that despite not having the required skills and qualifications actually become a teacher at a prestigious magic academy was a surprisingly good identity and role for the main character. As the main character is actually a teacher naturally the other main characters that he interacts with will either be students or teachers. However, it was also interesting to have characters that are connected to the main characters past also make an appearance and take key roles in the story as well. As is common in most modern anime the overall plot of the show also contains a series of sub story arcs that that are intermingled with the main plot and focus on one of the main heroines and have the effect of expanding upon the personalities and motivations of the heroines that it has as its main focus. I felt that each of these story arcs was well designed and really helped in providing context and background info on the respective heroines and what their motivations are as a person. Of the three my favorites were Re=L\u2019s and Rumia\u2019s. The overall plot line was also notable for having a number of sudden twists that introduced a number of situations required a good amount of quick thinking and adaptability to overcome traits of which the main character and his allies had no shortage off. Some of these situations were pretty surprising such as in the second story arc. The revelation on the identity of the true mastermind behind these incidents though surprising was introduced into the series a bit too late for him to be really effective at his role but despite that he did prove to be an interesting villain that had both conviction in his beliefs and genuine skills to back that up. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters for the show whether main or support cast I felt was pretty well designed and had interesting personalities that only served to define them and make them really stand out. However, while their initial personalities were strong it\u2019s the way that they are developed and improved upon that ultimately makes each of the characters special in their own right. The personality changes that each of the main characters go though as they are developed I felt was pretty good and it was nice watching them grow into more mature and better characters as the series progresses. Of the characters in the show the main cast arguably had the best in terms of character development with each of the main heroines undergoing changes in their personality as a result of not just meeting and re encountering Glenn but also as a result of their respective sub story arcs that apart from showing their origins and what caused them to develop their initial personality also served to let them find whats the most dear to them and from their discover the motivation that they need to improve themselves. Apart from the three main heroines I felt that main characters personality was developed rather well and it was heart-warming to see him develop not just as passion to teach but also care about his class and its students and more importantly be willing to put himself in harm\u2019s way in order to protect them from threats. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I expected this to be your run of the mill magic academy storyline with a perverted protagonist who gets caught up in totally crazy and suuuper awkward situations that occur in literally every anime ever with a male main character and several supporting female characters. Instead what I got was an interesting story about a substitute magic instructor who tries to open the minds of his students, and have them think about how to use magic outside of what their textbooks teach them. I also thought this was going to be a stereotypical ecchi anime, made more creepy than usual by the fact that themain character is a teacher and his students are underage, but once I was able to look past the scanty school uniforms I ended up liking the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I should say about this anime before I briefly discuss each element of the show is this: Before you judge whether you will like the show or not, watch up to episode two. If you are wondering why I insist on doing this, it is because episode one is garbage. It is full of clich\u00e9s and a whole lot of nothing important happening. However, it provides context for the events of episode two, so I still recommend you watch it. For those of you who follow the three episode rule like myself, this is not a problem. For those of you who do not follow the three episode rule, I urge you to watch through to episode two before deciding if this anime is for you or not. That being said, let's go over the aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's not bad for a magical academy setting. For something that has been done a billion times over, I feel as though the creators of this show managed to put an interesting spin on it. Most magic academy stories take place from the students' perspective, but instead with this show, we get both the teacher's and students' POV's on the story. Although having the teacher as the main character is not a novel idea (e.g. Negima), the way it is presented in Akashic Records is presented well enough. Because Glenn already knows a lot about magic, the fights that take place showcase how serious he can get, while still keeping the viewer informed on the workings of magic in this universe via Glenn\u2019s lectures to his students. In the interest of being fair, the episodes do have a habit of jumping around sometimes, and inserting filler episodes such as a beach trip. I felt as though there were several minute chunks in a few episodes that could have been cut entirely and replaced with either character development scenes or more world building scenes. But, for what the show has, it works.\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about the art. It feels standard and generic, like any anime studio could have made this. Some of the background art is nice, and a few of the shots going over the different locales are nice, but for the most part it looks pleasing enough to the eye to not be considered bad. The areas where it shines are in the appearances of the magic spells.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack - from what I remember of it - is quite nice. Many of the songs that play during dialogue-heavy scenes are soothing, while music played during action scenes are upbeat and exciting! That being said, I am not exactly an expert on what makes good music and soundtracks, so I cannot say much else on it, nor do I feel confident going into detail on why it's so great.\\n\\n\r\nBy far, the best part of the show is the characters, especially the main character, Glenn. Most anime protagonists are hotheaded boys who are kind to a fault, and get angry when someone harms their friends. Glenn's an utter bastard - true to the show's name - and is not afraid to be himself in that regard. He's lazy, rude, and shoots down the dreams of his students (at first). Yet as the show progresses, we see more and more that this bastard personality is more of a persona than a personality. This other side of him is brought out while he teaches his class, but the two students who see this side the most are Sistine and Rumia, the main supporting characters. At first glance, these two are your generic tsundere with a big dream, and deredere with a dark past. Of the two, Sistine has the bigger spotlight and goes through more development than Rumia (although the most focus goes to Glenn). The other students in Glenn's class are also quite interesting. The only problem is that we never learn much about them. None of the students' backstories or motivations are fleshed out much beyond basic personality traits and what type of magic each of them is best at, according to Glenn. This is a huge shame because I would have loved to learn more about some of the other students, as well as other supporting characters such as Albert. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the story, art, and setting are nothing special, but the characters are all marvelous and make the show worth watching. That said, Akashic Records' biggest shortcomings are the generic setting, art style, story (to a degree), and the fact that it has a very interesting and diverse character cast, yet only fleshes out about four of those characters. In comparison, an anime such as Negima dedicates entire episodes to some of the different students, and although it never gets to every student, you're still left knowing more about them than you will with Akashic Records. In fact, I found that the students that I was most curious about were the ones who had just enough screen time for me to notice them, but not enough to remember their names. Overall though, if I was asked whether Akashic Records was worth somebody\u2019s time to watch with a simple yes or no, I would say, \u201cYes.\u201d",

            "content": "Cliches sometimes lives or dies whether the cliches it's riding itself on can differ from itself, Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records one such that's on thin ice, good or bad.\r\nRokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is another staple of the magical school with the superpowered OP protagonist but with a slight twist to itself that has diminishing returns.\r\nWell what does LA mean by that?, well first and foremost, Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records has your typical standard magical school anime with the OP main protagonist that is an utter constant in this anime, it's in it's execution is slightly differs such as ourmain OP protagonist Glen Radars voiced by \"Soma Saito\" being a lazy narcissistic substitute teacher for the Alzano Imperial Magic Academy and he \"at first\" is a horrible magician AS well as being weak...but that's soon changes the more you watch of Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records. As carry on watching the anime, you start to see that Glenn slowly but surely changes into the expected OP main protagonist and is cleverly masked through other characters arcs along with his own hidden backstory as well and by all means developing others as well as the mysterious main protagonist is fine and all and even better since we're expected him to be OP as hell but at the start but he's clearly not and slowly getting used to him as a karmic savant main male protagonist being a magical teacher. But from all that, it seems especially with Glenn's writing and development in this anime that he quickly changes into the thing he was expected to become in this anime, this is probably LA's biggest gripe with the anime though there are more problems along with Glenn in the process of it all.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the characters in this anime is vast yet somewhat lacking as the plot's focus has a typical character focused arc feel to it with the added hints to Glenn's backstory in the process. The characters that get the most focus from this becomes Glenn himself due to him needing to be introduced with his cliched with a twist introduction as well as his development into being the badass he's expected to become, Rumia Tingel voiced by Yume Miyamoto, best friend of Sistine and her having a mysterious backstory to her and being the damsel in distress for the majority of the anime, though she was LA's favourite character in all this as she was your typical nice girl to Sistine's tsundereness and was a constant support to Glenn throughout the entire anime even if she was being a damsel in distress, the aforementioned tsundere Sistine Fibel voiced by Akane Fujita being the typical tsundere to Glenn as well as his minder yet the constant support of her class away from Glenn's affairs. One of her major problems is exactly that, she for the most part is the support to her classmates but at first was the cliched tsundere to Glenn and not much else and considering she's one of the defining main characters in this anime, she had more of a hand in the background than the major plotlines until it was her arc and even then her focused arc had more to do with Glenn than herself, she's \"nearly\" wasted potential but thankfully this anime actually paid her mind and remembered to even give her an arc that ties into Glenn. Finally we have Re=L voiced by Ari Ozawa, one of Glenn's old college's who might as well be part of Glenn's harem, though her arc did make her more than that. From this, the rest of the characters, from the harem nanny of Celica Arfonia voiced by Eri Kitamura (and LA's favourite minor character) to the many classmates are satellite to supporting characters to the 3 main leads who have arcs to them. The only other character problem LA had with Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is the most obvious one...although this anime does become unpredictable at times the one constant is that the expected villains in this anime are stock mad crazy psycho magicians but the only defense to that are that finding out who will either become really easy if you pick up the hints or some will be really unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by LIDENFILMS, it's expected of them to have some stark and unique character designs and they really do pop out at you (thus why LA really liked Celica), ohh and before LA forgets and this is an obvious point but \"yaaaaa school uniform looks like a sailor fuku stripper\" schtick...LA didn't really care but yes...the uniform design is weird in this one, moving on please. The magical fights are entertaining to watch and some fluidity to them albeit they fall into the \"rune spamming\" notion but that's the magic lore of the world of Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records at hand, nonetheless the magical battles are decent enough to watch and this anime doesn't skimp on the bloodlust either....hmm they still haven't gotten that off since Schwarzesmarken haven't they.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we go, LA had been thinking about the voice work for this anime for some time especially one seiyuu but that will be a bit down the line. Soma Saito as Glenn was decent enough keeping to his character of the lazy karmic teacher who happens to be a badass but Soma Saito prideful tone can be a bit irritating at times but LA thinks that the point of that. LA really liked Yume Miyamoto as Rumia vocals overall and she had the wide range of emotions minus the annoyance that LA needed to make her easily LA's favoruite seiyuu of this anime. As for the other voice cast, LA really liked Eri Kitamura's femme fatale harem nanny-esque vocals as Celica though LA wished LA saw more of Celica in the first place and seeing Yoko Hikasa doing the psychotic villain vocals was a fresh breath of air for LA from her but again like Eri Kitamura, LA wished LA saw more of Yoko Hikasa's character. Now to the seiyuu your expecting LA to talk about...Akane Fujita...LA actually liked it very much (what with LA being a fan of anime tsundere's) as her tsundereness though brash and abrasive though with ALOT of restraint even at her worst, Akane's deredere vocals do come and balance things out and it's not just all tsun vocals from Akane. To be frank, Akane's role as Sistine is LA's most tolerable role from her for Spring 2017...but LA's said most tolerable not the best from her but nonetheless from ALL of this, the voice cast is decent albeit LA would have wanted other seiyuu's to shine in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nRokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is a case of where an anime diverts your expectations greatly but it loses steam VERY slowly before it turns into the thing it was trying NOT to be like and this easily manifests itself into our main protagonist Glenn but just with this does it make Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records horrible?...well LA isn't giving this anime any grace and even then LA thinks there are much bigger fish to fry than Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, it's harmless at best for LA, trying to be something new....then loses it soon afterwards from both tone, plot and characters and at worst it's trying to sell you light novels under the guise of it being a fresh and different magical school anime with an OP protagonist with some credit to itself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Expectations may vary to change\" will be a very solid statement to Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records if anything.",

The art is very cute but not overly cute, the characters are memorable for their own comical views and tropes and the story felt kind of all over the place for a bit. \r\nThe protagonist and his outlook on life come into play about midway through the anime and the ending ties quite a bit of speculation up nicely and puts a bow on it. Given how the ending was portrayed and I won't say morethan that to avoid spoilers. I'd be really happy to watch a second season or even an ova to add more depth to what is actually going on in this fictional world. \\n\\n\r\nMy likes are definitely the main trio of females in the show, their personalites and actions balance each other out perfectly to be cute and in your face but not overly annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe only real thing I disliked was the lack of linearity in the plot which kind of put me off until I got to the end, and the lack of brutality in the fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nTo argue my own negativity, the delivery left a sour taste because I kind of had predetermined notions instead of coming in with a fresh mindset and in the fight scenes that's a personal preference and shouldn't reflect badly on the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn summation, if schools or magic are something you enjoy in an anime. You should give this an honest watch, give it 3 eps and if you don't like it move on.",

            "content": "I felt lukewarm at best, watching this anime.\r\nThe story started unpromisingly, with a pretty stagnant first episode. It gathers pace slightly as the anime progresses but is never really gripping. Much of the tension to the plot is negated by the sketchy limits of magic and abilities of the characters. It is a light, comfortable ride, hitting all the expected notes, but never ventures out of the ordinary. \r\nA teacher who doesn't fit into a prestigious academy clashes with his students, and as they are draw into dangerous affairs of the kingdom the teacher starts showing a different side to himself. Short adventure arcs followeach other as the characters are developed and their back story explored. Some are more poignant than others, all the arcs are inoffensive, and enjoyable, but nothing to surprise or amaze.\\n\\n\r\nGlenn began as a very interesting main character. He started as a pretty useless and weak magician, absolutely inept at his job as teacher of the most prestigious magic academy in the world. He slowly reveals a more serious and dark nature as the anime progresses, and as his character was gradually   rounded I was more and more excited about finding out more.\\n\\n\r\nUntil he dropped right into a stock, bland, cliche, boring, done-to-death anime hero, complete with troubled past( flavored with tragic love story), OP abilities, doing good to redeem his dark past, an unchanging resolve to uphold justice, protecting everyone and not letting anyone die \"again\" ... etc, etc., the whole bucket load. \\n\\n\r\nSistine is your typical tsundere main heroine, who inspires the hero and keeps him anchored to light and hope. Blah blah blah. Rumia, the other main heroine, is not as typical a shounen anime heroine. She is strong but gentle, not especially talented, with a troubled past and an unique ability. Rumia is definitely the more sympathetic and compelling of the two heroines, though not exactly out of the ordinary, but sadly, the anime spends more time on Sistine and her inevitable crush on Glenn.\\n\\n\r\nRel is the most intriguing of the show's female characters, but I felt that her story was glossed over, and her actions and the motives behind these actions roughly explained and too rushed a to arouse empathy in the viewer, which is a shame, because her back story had the most potential, and raised rather profound questions and explored an interesting issue with more depth than this comedic anime seemed to have potential to.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty much what you'd expect from this kind of an anime. The character designs are slightly too fan service oriented to my taste. Cat ears on Sisitine, and that bunny ear gravity defying ribbon on Rumia... And that uniform... What academy has that kind of uniform?\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a light hearted anime that seemed truncated rather abruptly. (Just when some depth seemed to be had from the dynamic of Sistine and Glenn, the anime ends.) A show very suited for relaxing, nothing offensive, not really exciting, but fairly enjoyable.\\n",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\nSo where to start...  Oh I know, characters.  Well for one thing, they're atrocious.  You have Glen-sensei, who try's to be the next GTO/Kouro-sensei, but in reality is overpowered light novel protagonist-kun, even though subjective trash will try to justify that he's not, but the problem is that the narrative will stick him in situations where he has the upper hand, or plot convenience kicks down the door and says, \"Hey, he can do this thing that no one/not many people can do.\"  Then there's Sistine, who's Asuna Clone Number Four Million Eight Hundred Thousand and Two, basicallytoken waifu, with a bitchy tsundere personality, and wants protagonist-kun's dick, and for whatever reason, the writers of the show decide to show that she's \"capable\" and \"can take care of herself\", but then they don't really showcase her doing much, and then halfway through the shows twelve episode run, she gets shoved into this damsel in distress role because some dude comes in to marry her for political reasons because she's the daughter of the queen of the kingdom, and now Glen has to go save her because the guy who's trying to marry her is evil. Also, she gets sexually harassed in the second episode, since it's a shitty light novel adaptation, so it has to have some form of rape. Did you get all that?  Okay good, moving on to the next character.  Who are we at now, Rumia?  Yeah, Rumia.  Rumia is BigTits McGee, and a lot of her character is based on the idea that \"sad stuff happens to me, so you should feel sorry for me so make me best girl.\"  Then there's Re=L, who's loli service oni-chan complex.  Also, what the fuck kinda name is Re=L?  You'd think it would have some sort of big, symbolic meaning, but no, it doesn't.  There's this blue haired dude that's just kinda there.  There's this black dressed boob lady who's just kinda there.  Aaaand I think that's all for important characters.  There's a supporting class, but they're just kinda there (I'm starting to notice a trend) and there's no really standout villain.  A big problem the shows characters have, is that they don't have any after game goals.  No \"I want to be hokage\", \"I want to be king of the pirates\", \"I just want a quiet life\", none of the characters have any equivalent of that...  Except Sistine.  \\n\\n\r\n     In the first episode of the show, Sistine states that she wants to go to this castle in the sky that her grandpa wanted to get to, but he died before he could get there, and the actual narrative never brings it up again, except for maybe the final episode, but that's just speculation.  But the show keeps on reminding the viewer, that hey, this is still a thing by cramming castle into random shots that just so happened to be aimed at the sky throughout the whole fucking show.  \\n\\n\r\n     It's kinda like Attack On Titan Season One, where it baits the viewer along with big plot reveals that inevitably lead into the grand scheme of things, even though it rarely ever does, so it just becomes a big cycle of plot reveals.  But with Akashic Records, it baits the viewer along until oh, look, it's the last episode, so now we're just going to season two bait, but we have to end this first season somehow, don't we?\\n\\n\r\n    The final episode ends with this really uninteresting plot reveal that the big villain was pulling the strings the whole time, and he has some sort of connection to Glen, because everything in the narrative has to be connected to Glen somehow, and Sistine, who was supposed to get married this episode, continues to be the useless damsel she's been set up to be for the last couple of episodes, tears off her wedding dress, which is the writers of the show saying \"look how progressive we are\", and remembers she's really good at magic, and then she and Glen fight big villain guy in a giant magic laser beam fight, until Glen punches big villain, and yay we won. \\n\\n\r\n     Another big problem the show has is the tone shift of its fight and action scenes.  At the beginning of the show they set up that all the fights will have a depth of strategy to them, similar to a JoJo Stand battle or an early Naruto fight, but then towards the end of the show, it just changes to generic magic spell battles.  \\n\\n\r\n     The pacing of the show is atrocious.  They try to cram so much shit into the short span of twelve episodes that it whole thing comes off as moving to fast, basically giving certain important plot threads not enough time to develop, making a bulk of the narrative seem pointless. \\n\\n\r\n     The animation is decent.  It could be good, but whenever there's action it was always happens to quickly to even realize what's going on.  Don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure they reuse the same clip of Sistine punching Glen into the sky a couple of times every episode, maybe not every episode, I could be wrong about this one.  The shows aesthetic, is again, decent, it's this pseudo cel shaded look, which admittedly looks fine, but nothing more than that.  Just fine. Although, I will say that the effect they use for magic looks pretty nice, reminds me of Konosuba.  \\n\\n\r\n     The shows opening and ending credits are nothing to right home about.  The opening kinda just showcases characters doing nothing, then there's shot of Glen being edgy for no apparent reason, while this shot of Sistine shifts into this girl from Glens past, Sarres I think her name is, and then it interludes into this generic action sequence set to one of the most generic get-the-viewer-hyped-for-action songs I've ever heard in my life.  The ending credits are just still shots of the main four characters, exception being the shot of Glen with the spinning magical card.  \\n\\n\r\n     And now to address the big elephant in the room, the character designs.  From what I've said so far, this show isn't one worst things in the world, and that's true, it's not.  But these character designs are just God awful, especially the female school uniforms.  They're literally stripper outfits, and compared to the modest and classy, it just makes me think that whoever thought that making the female characters wear skirts that are almost as short as my dads belt, should really go back to art school.  Plus, add to the fact that they say nothing about the characters themselves merely adds fuel to the fire.  \\n\\n\r\n     If there is one positive thing I would like say about the show, is its next episode previews.  These short thirty seconds previews were probably the one thing about the show I actually looked forward to watching every week.  Probably the best bits were the ones with the blue haired dude and all the cats, they always managed to put a smile on my face.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Akashic Records is bad, but it's certainly not the worst thing ever, and certainly not even the worst thing this year.  I give at a 3/10, it's just plain bad.",

            "content": "This show starts off pretty strong, and I thought it was actually pretty good for the first half or so.  But after the second arc it suddenly feels like filler in some long running shounen series. It just becomes: New bad guys show up, do something evil, get beaten, move to next arc. Honestly, the second arc wasn't much better, but it hadn't become a pattern at that point, so it didn't bother me as much.\r\nThe characters were entertaining in the beginning, but not enough to make the second half actually enjoyable. The show went from being one I looked forward to every weekto one that I finished just because I was already almost done with it anyways.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso the uniforms are probably the worst I've ever seen. Seriously, they went with an unrealistic and impractical design that was supposed to look good, but it doesn't even do that. Maybe that's just my personal preference, but I think R=el looked way better in her first appearance than she did wearing that uniform.\\n",

            "content": "I usually like these types of anime, and I wanted to like this one as well.  However, I was unable to like it and it is because of the characters.  First, there is the tsundere Sistine, who is quick to use violence on her own teacher.  I do not have problems with tsunderes, but when they do not hesitate to use violence on the mc, but unable to fight back against their enemies is annoying.  If Sistine is not using violence on mc, she is crying or freezing-up against the enemy.  Next comes Rumia, which most part of the showshe spends as the damsel-in-distress.  Then again, she is a princess, so she is always in another castle.  She should be training on protecting herself more.  Probably the character that I dislike the most is the one that fits the typical manga/anime trope, easily forgiven.  In manga/anime, no matter what horrible act a character commits, if they apologize all will be forgiven.  Another trope I dislike when a parent is also easily forgiven for what they did to their child, which the mother in this case is forgiven.  Later, in the anime, it was made like the mother was not that bad.  She was and she still is, but all the characters are okay with her, including her daughter.",
