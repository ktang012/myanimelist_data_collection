            "content": "Alright, I admit it. I was skeptical at first when I heard of this anime, since I've seen all sorts of gender bender plots. Besides, \"Jellyfish Princess\"? What kind of title is that?\r\nBut don't be deceived by first impressions. True to its roots, this anime is focused at a more mature audience then typical animes; that's why it's the josei genre. It relates to many aspects of \"fandoms\". Trains, Japanese culture, fashion, politics, and much more. Many of the characters are attractive, not by their looks, but by their personalities, and how their individual fandoms relate to them. This not only gives a charm inthe story, but watchers can easily understand and recognize them.\\n\\n\r\nTo give focus onto the main characters, Kurashita Tsukimi is the titular Jellyfish Princess. She is obsessed with jellyfish and dream of being an illustrator.She lives with the \"Amars\" the other 30-something fujoshi, and men are not allowed within the Amamizukan, their apartment. The other \"heroine\" is Koibuchi Kuranosuke. A son of a politician, he crossdresses in hopes of avoiding politics, and he fatefully meets Tsukimi. Hilarity ensues.\\n\\n\r\nLight-hearted but clearly having its own depth, Kuragehime is definitely worth watching, if only for the character interaction. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nWarning: The opening and ending songs are highly addicting. Watch with care.",

            "content": "What were my first thoughts on Kuragehime? It sounds stupid. An anime about middle aged lonely otaku virgin women is absolutely unheard of in this day and age. None of them are even cute! \u2018Give me moe or give me death!\u2019 is quite a common thing nowadays. And above all it\u2019s just another slice of life. Almost nothing is attractive if you were to just explain \u2018The Jellyfish Princess\u2019 to any other fan. \r\nHowever, despite all its unattractiveness it is by far the most beautiful anime of the fall season.\r\nAt first glance, without being told anything, anyone would assume the majority of the main characterswere guys. This would include Mayaya, Banba and Jiji. Quite honestly those names are some of the strangest names I\u2019ve heard in all the years I\u2019ve watched anime. Coupled with their rather quirky nature and almost unisexual apparel you\u2019d almost never guess they were girls until the show told you and if all you\u2019re looking for is moe you\u2019d be hugely disappointed. However their personalities, now factoring Tsukimi and Chieko, seem to overcome all those faults. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the obsessive otakuness that drives their actions but the characters seem endearing; you can laugh at them, with them, and even understand why they act the way they do. All the NUNZ are just fun and somewhat loveable to watch as they interact with the \u2018Hipster\u2019 Kuranosuke. \\n\\n\r\nKuranosuke is, currently, my most favorite character of the series. He\u2019s that annoying crossdressing neighbor that runs into your life and does whatever he wants, typically destroying any semblance of piece. Aside from being completely hilarious, he\u2019s the main reason the plot moves at all and without him I don\u2019t think the everyday lives of the NUNZ would have been hilariously affected as they are now.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the main attraction to this series, I would believe, would be the characters. But not in the same way a show like K-ON attracts using their characters. While K-ON has you admire and squeal over how cute their characters act, Kuragehime has characters that live by quirks many otaku and others without good people skills would find familiar and easy to understand. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, don\u2019t let the description throw you off. Let it take you in and you\u2019ll find Kuragehime, among its faults, shines as bright as the brightest jellyfish at night.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Don\u2019t listen to the OP or ED. They\u2019re so addictive it\u2019s hard to sleep while knowing they aren\u2019t in your hard drive RIGHT NOW.\\n",

            "content": "'Kuragehime' ('Jellyfish Princess') is a modern Cinderella story featuring the unlikeliest cast of a jellyfish-otaku princess and the cross-dressing prince.\r\nThe first thing I noticed about the series is the heavy influence of live-action movies.\r\nEpisode titles are parody of film titles:\r\n1. 'Sex and the City' (2008)\r\n2. 'Sukiyaki Western Django' (2007)\r\n3. 'Enchanted' (2007)\r\n4. 'Eden' (2006)\r\n5. 'Watashi wa Kai ni Naritai' (1959/2008)\r\n6. 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968)\r\n7. 'Kinyuu Fushoku Rettou: Jubaku' (1999)\r\n8. 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004)\r\n9. 'Midnight Cowboy' (1969)\r\n10. 'The Turning Point' (1977)\r\n11. 'Field of Dreams' (1989)\r\nOP is a parody of a series of famous scenes from Hollywood and Japanese films:\r\n1. 'Sex and the City' (2008)\r\n2. 'StarWars' (1977~)\\n\r\n3. 'Singin' in the Rain' (1952)\\n\r\n4. 'Mary Poppins' (1964)\\n\r\n5. 'Emperor of the North Pole' (1973)\\n\r\n6. 'Onna Tobakushi' (1967)\\n\r\n7. 'James Bond' (1962~)\\n\r\n8. 'Game of Death' (1978)\\n\r\n9. 'The Graduate' (1967)\\n\r\n10. 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, major Japanese film producers and distributors were in production committee (Fuji, Toho, and Asmik Ace actually show their real opening credits in an episode)\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Josei\" is a minor subcategory of \"shoujo\" manga and anime, targeted toward older audiences (18+). 'Kuragehime', despite being published on a josei manga magazine, lacks any mature characters or themes to really categorize it as one  (and it won a manga award in shoujo rather than otona (mature/adult) category). This is clearly a shoujo anime.\\n\r\n'Kuragehime' is about a bunch of female otaku in Amamizukan, an apartment complex in Tokyo. These girls are severely repulsed by men and fashionable/successful people, but our heroine Tsukimi one day makes friends with fashionable cross-dresser Kuranosuke and finds out later that not only is he male, he 's also from a rich political family.\\n\r\nThe first half of the story is mostly about Kuranosuke extending his influence over \"Ama~s\" (\"Nun~s\"), the girls in Amamizukan. It should be noted that while literal meaning of \"ama\" is \"nun\", which suits their virgin and hikikomori status in their house, it is also a derogatory slang for \"women\" (much like how \"nun\" is a slang for \"prostitutes\" in English). These girls are basically calling themselves \"bitche~s\"\" and \"whore~s\".\\n\r\nThe \"Ama~s\" consists of otaku girls with extremely bizarre hobbies. Tsukimi is into jellyfish, Ichimatsu Dolls for Chieko, 'Romance of Three Kingdoms' for Mayaya, and senile men for Jiji. The only ones with relatively common interests are Jyuon, the nocturnal fujoshi BL manga writer, and Bamba, as railfans existed way before the word \"otaku\" became a slang. Other than our heroine Tsukimi and acting-landlord Chieko, all the other \"Ama~s\" girls exist almost solely for comedy.\\n\r\nThe second half of the story is about saving Amamizukan from a land development project. This is mostly attempted to be done by fund raising, in which the challenge for introverted girls to go out into the world and forced to interact with people is depicted, as well as Kousuke's attempt to transform Tsukimi's introvert personality by building up her confidence.  Unfortunately, \"Ama~s\" are almost always forced to do these things they detest, and their fear of outsiders have not eased at all, freezing up in uncomfortable situations to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of a shoujo anime, there is also a lot of romantic concerns for the heroine, and the typical love triangle, predicaments etc. that confuses individuals of their own feelings and prevent love confessions. \\n\r\nThe character development between Tsukimi and Kuranosuke are rather good, though they are put into one random predicament after another, and saved in the last minute by fairytale successes, whether it's extreme makeover, profitable sales, or crowd-pleasing dress designs. Kuranosuke is practically a prince who tries to save Tsukimi from isolation and turn her into a fashionable and popular chick. Of course, she turns into a gorgeous Yamato Nadeshiko simply by taking off her glasses and putting on some makeup. The story develops into a clich\u00e9 Cinderella fantasy. To make it worse, everything gets solved by predictable deus ex machina in the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt quality for 'Kuragehime' is very high. Lots of variety with backgrounds, as the characters travel around Tokyo. I recognized almost every single location in Shibuya during the first episode, the staff completely animated real sites. Maybe because I'm way more familiar with Shibuya than Akibahara etc, but it seemed like they put far more attention into detail than the typical series.  I can tell you that this is a very faithful reproduction of the city down to individual stores and signs. Other places like Amamizukan (actually a male-only lodge in West Waseda), parks, and streets seem to be modeled after real places as well.\\n\r\nCharacter designs deviate from the ordinary, with memorable style and traits for most characters. None of the \"Ama~s\" members are beautified. Fluidity is rather good, and all the characters were drawn with extremely high consistency. The comedic special effects (petrification, shock etc) were done very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is dominated by seasoned veteran seiyuu in 30s and 40s with wide range of voices that fit characters pretty well. However, none of their voicing jobs were particularly memorable.\\n\r\nBGM were extremely strong, wide range of instruments playing music of different style, often setting/enhancing the mood for comedy. OP as mentioned earlier, is parody of famous scenes from movies with surprisingly good flow and audio-visual synchronization. Chatmonchy is known for their distinct rock songs, and they don't disappoint with the off-beat OP song 'Kokodake no Hanashi (Just Between Us)'. As usual of their songs, there's something about it that really moves you, and it fits the series very well with its quirkiness and optimism. And who better to sing the ED than Sambomaster, who came to popularity after their song was featured as theme song for 2005 'Densha Otoko' live-action drama, which still remains to be the most watched and arguably most influential otaku story in history? Their song \"Kimi no Kirei ni Kizuite Okure (Realize How Beautiful You Are)\" is a poignant rock song that really captures this anime's theme, and the ED animation comes in long shot of 1 cut. Very impressive. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all its originality in premise, character setting, art style, and sounds, 'Kuragehime' still failed to separate itself from clich\u00e9 shoujo story development. \\n\r\nAs per typical shoujo anime, there's a lot of inner monologue explaining characters' thoughts and emotions. While this is a typical trait of shoujo manga/anime series and theoretically improve empathy and emotional attachment, I consider this to be a very poor storytelling technique as it takes away the joy of thinking and imagining their state of mind. It gets tiresome when they explain the obvious every single time, and slows down the pace of the story. The comedy was hilarious at first, but gets repetitive after a while with identical 'Ol\u00e9' cover ups, shock face, petrification, girly prime minister etc. that gets predictable and tiresome after a while. Repetition can be funny, but it needs to be executed with intelligence and variety.\\n\r\nIn addition, I found it hard to connect with the characters simply because their interests are too \"maniac\" (bizarre/weird), as the Japanese call it. I don't think I'll ever understand a girl's unhealthy fascination with jellyfish or creepy dolls or senile men moe... and I was completely lost when Mayaya spew out bunch of 'Romance of Three Kingdoms' references. I also had no idea why the author would portray girl otaku as nothing more than simple creepy freaks. \"Ama~s\" may be a group of girl otaku with uncommon interests, but they all behaved like a cookie cutter male otaku from general public's perception of otaku culture other than their androphobia, and didn't explore further into the views and motivations from girl otaku's perspective.\\n\\n\r\nIt is still an enjoyable show, but 'Kuragehime' could've easily been so much more. However, I am very impressed at how 'noitaminA' series continue to reject the trend in the industry with uncommon premise and low on moe/ecchi. Any series aired in this time slot continues to be a must-watch for serious anime fans.\\n",

            "content": "The setup for Princess Jellyfish revolves around six NEET females who have decided to live together in a small, \"retro\" building. They all lead their daily mooch lifestyles through the show, coming into contact with a few different types of people in the process, and that is just about its entirety.\r\nBefore moving along with that statement, let's focus on the budget. Princess Jellyfish is well animated and has a pleasant art style. The show's direction carries some expression, and the soundtrack is indeed serviceable. I would consider the opening and ending music good and am pleased when seeing how plentiful of references they can be,along with some of the show. Some of this is refreshing, however, things shift downward when the focus is directed more to the actual story and what it has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI've witnessed many NEET anime and other shows which follow very similar premises, like Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Stories of this focus have been carried out well and in a way that keeps them interesting with some variety. Just by being a series that carries the term \"slice-of-life\", it isn't expected that you will be entering a mirror of a slow reality, as series like Haruhi show you can push the bar a bit. Even so, Princess Jellyfish decides to go right ahead and take a dive in that concept.\\n\\n\r\nPrinces Jellyfish is a story of a forced, shallow love-triangle and of socially odd people who open themselves slightly to amending their typical ways. That's the story of Princess Jellyfish, and that's as far as it will go. Essentially, watching the first two episodes of the series will give you enough to accurately guesstimate the entire series with this in mind, besides the fates of the love triangle. No plot point in this show ever gets developed or treated as something beyond the strange will it has to continually shift them to goofy, comedic gags. A point like the rationality of NEETs is never explored, while several times being joked at, and by the end it comes to thought that the whole incorporation of it was for the basic intent to be served as a quirk by the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of Princess Jellyfish consists of the quirkiness of its character roster. Many of these character's personalities are literally their quirks, along with the basic principles of being a NEET for the main girls. No character ever feels alive beyond the second episode, which ends up making the show feel like a string of events involving a cross-dresser and a bunch of nameless moochers. Not to mention the \"events\" that take place are hardly ones that peak interest as issues that arise are so meager that at times you might think more towards the fact that these characters are doing absolutely nothing beyond surviving off their parents allowances.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not degrading Princess Jellyfish with bias in its inclusion of NEETs, but the whole idea is simply inserted half-heatedly, and while the show seems to push to develop the character's self-respect to become more individual people, the story only grows them far enough to barely reach a relationship with someone of the opposite sex. This lack of focus into anything else beyond a basic romance creates a sensation of the show's true goal being the ability to self-insert. The only arguable message the show presents is that anyone can be beautiful if they choose to be so, but this is presented more figuratively than literally with nothing proving such an idea beyond the character being drawn more attractive after having a cartoon makeover. The characters run off quirks and the plot lacks in meaning and depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe slightly unique, light romance of Princess Jellyfish is without a doubt the strongest thing it had going for it. The quirkiness presented at the start from both sides, along with the side characters involved, created for a situation where a potentially interesting romance could have begun. Although it continued to be the show's strong-point after the start, things quickly began to damper as the writer decided it would be best for the characters to stick to their roots and have their personalities almost literally be their quirks, letting events and situations lead the way. The main character is brought down in this lack of attention to development, and by the end of the show you're left with the same self-insertable character with just the upgrade of a chance at love. That love, in particular, forming without any sense of the word \"natural\". Explaining in a way not to make the entire series feel empty by revealing the love triangle plot, both male leading characters in question lead generally purposeful lives in which they would have no reason to feel desperate about their love lives. However, upon their run-down with the main female, things clearly change to her liking.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an anime with some western movie industry influence, only in references, than this show has some of that. If you want a slice-of-life series with quirky comedy and awkward situations, this show has that. If you are looking to be at least somewhat emotionally invested in either plot or characters, wanting something to ponder about or something to surprise you, than this show beyond the first episode is likely not what you'd appreciate watching.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing taken care of in Princess Jellyfish. The show grabs the term \"slice-of-life\" and takes it to heart, fueling its uniqueness off of character quirks that are admittedly unique in that they can't all be defined by the most generic of archetypes. The story is devoid of plot goals and development, as the ending feels but a few paces ahead of the beginning. Solutions to problems come at the ding of the microwave, and characters are taken straight out of the fridge to be eaten raw. Does that sound like part of your diet?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI double-dog dare those who are about to click \"not-helpful\" to discuss first. I'm always open.",

            "content": "When looking into this anime, it\u2019s like looking into an anime version of a fairy tale, which sort of involves a princess or a princess-like character and also a fairy godmother-like character, but unlike a fairy tale (or at least, any fairy tale that\u2019s been infected by Disney sooner or later), this one is going to be sugarcoated, especially when dealing with the stages of being awkward around different people and the way you act around them.\r\nAmamizu-kan, an old boarding house in Tokyo, is the home of The Sisterhood \u2013 a group of otaku women of various stripes who shun The Stylish and men ingeneral. Tsukimi, a jellyfish fanatic, is the latest addition to their ranks. One evening a strange Stylish woman helps her out and she brings the Stylish home with her...only to discover that \u201cshe\u201d is a \u201che.\u201d Despite her pleas, Kuranosuke, the disenchanted cross-dressing son of a prominent political family, sticks around, finding himself more and more fascinated by The Sisterhood in general and Tsukimi in specific. When unscrupulous developers begin to eye Amamizu-kan's location, Kuranosuke realizes that there is more at stake than just a building, and sets out to galvanize its residents to save their way of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the whole \u201ccoming out of your shell\u201d type of story when a person who has a different outlook on life wants to help them not only with experiencing life outside their comfort zone, considering that they are going to need it since their home is on the verge of being wrecked. As for the romance aspect, I did sort of sense that the main characters Tsukimi & Kuranosuke would have their relationship to grow but to me, it was never towards the \u201clovey-dovey\u201d type of relationship but more like a \u201cclose friends\u201d relationship and I thought it was great that they stuck it to that. As for the side story with Kuranosuke\u2019s brother, it didn\u2019t went anywhere at all with him having a crush on Tsukimi, only to ended early with the one character Inari, who\u2019s the one that\u2019s after Amamizu-kun and the very textbook definition of the word \u201ccold bitch\u201d, gets involved plus, his brother Shu isn\u2019t that interesting of a character or even that memorable unlike Kuranosuke himself, who was one of my favorites in the show for being the motivator of Tsukimi and the other women in the sisterhood. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Tsukimi, she is portrayed as a sweet but very awkward and often an easily weirded-out character with his unique interests in jellyfish and drawing them ever since she saw them with her late mother. The other tenants in the building also have their unique personality about them with the acting landlady Chieko collecting traditional Japanese clothes and dolls, Banba is into trains, Jiji into older men and Mayaya is a fan of Three Kingdoms and unfortunately out of all of them, Mayaya is the most annoying character on this show, mainly because while she\u2019s very animated, all she does is act like a neurotic fangirl and not the kind that would be fun to hang out, but the kind that rages about everything and everybody so much, you want to pop an synapse after just to calm down.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this gets a little rough around some of the character movements and designs. Brains Base, the guys that brought you Baccano! & Durarara!! , has made some good animation in their past works and for this, it\u2019s more like when Durarara began to show its budget problems during the second half but then again, this is an 11-episode anime, so I shouldn\u2019t expect much of a grandiose amount of animation, but it is typical of Brains Base\u2019s style of animation and it was good to say the least. The music is very appealing to most of the show with its comical style to some of the scenes to the light dramatic moments in there. Plus, the opening and ending themes are quite addictive to listen to, especially the opening sequence where it parodies or pay homage to most movie franchises like Star Wars, James Bond, The Seven Kingdoms, Singin\u2019 in the Rain, Mary Poppins, etc.\\n\\n\r\nFor the FUNimation dub, this was one of those dubs that didn\u2019t sound so usual. Usually, I yawn at FUNimation dubs, not that they\u2019re bad (they make good dubs) but they\u2019re not that special to begin with. I did liked Maxey Whitehead\u2019s performance as very sweet and genuine although it is strange hearing her as a lead female character since most of her roles have been androgynous sounding boys. Josh Grelle did convince me that Kuranosuke was an actual girl at first and even though I find Mayaya to be annoying, Monica Rial plays the role and her voice much differently than she used to, it sounded more lower than her standard of voicing characters. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: The show is actually worth watching around the first chance you get. Some of the humor can be charming and unique up to an extent although I hate that it ended on a lousy cliffhanger, which mean it\u2019s one of those \u201cread the manga\u201d endings. It\u2019s something you would either want to rent or own the DVD to.\\n",

            "content": "I would like to preface this review by warning ya'll that this anime suffers from Ending in the Middle of the Manga Syndrome. If you've enjoyed an anime like Fruits Basket, Ouran Highschool Host Club, Soul Eater, Kimi Ni Todoke, etc. and felt a little uneasy by the inconclusive ending and then googled your uneasy feeling and discovered the manga is like 80 chapters ahead of where the anime left off - you're going to run into the same situation here. Clear your to-read list, because Princess Jellyfish is going to be a top-priority read for you once you're done this bite-sized series. Then again,if you're made of metal or something and you don't care about having a plot with any resolution, proceed without caution.\\n\\n\r\nSlice-of-Life and RomCom anime are my guilty pleasure genres. I don't always find that they have a lot of substance beyond endorsing really cute teeny-bopper supportive relationships. I've found that a lot of slice-of-life anime fall into the trap of over-emphasizing the romantic sub-plots to the extent that any other story elements are underdeveloped or just plain boring.  In contrast, Princess Jellyfish, like all my favourites in the genre, brings something new and insanely interesting in all aspects of its plot. Even the shoujo elements - where one character stares bleary-eyed at the stars and contemplates feelings - aren't in your face. This might not make sense, but the plot mutes itself in such a way that all of its features shine(???) \\n\\n\r\nThe only word I can really use to describe how well this anime shines out would be 'character'. The show literally oozes character from its every inappropriate crevice. The actual characters are unique and varied, ranging from flamboyant and confident to wacko or sweet or mature, but every single one of them is fucking hilarious. Granted, a lot of the main characters can be difficult to relate to, but they'd make for some poor outcasts if the audience were able to instantly project themselves onto their favourites. They're all likable, regardless. \\n\\n\r\n Even the character designs are super innovative (I hate to use that word, but it's the best I've got. Sad face), I can't gush about the designs nearly as much as I'd like: they're all so different!! And they suit each character's personality so well!! GUSH.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really caught me off guard was how mature Princess Jellyfish was, too. \\n\r\nLike, one of the main love interests is a heterosexual drag-queen who helps build confidence in young women. *SPOILERS* There's a male character who is kind of almost date-raped by one of the female antagonists. The overarching plot focuses on the implications of changing infrastructure on the lives of a city's residents. PARENTAL LOSS. SOCIAL ANXIETIES AND SELF-CONFIDENCE IN YOUNG WOMEN. GENDER AND SEXUALITY. I have absolutely no idea how this anime can be so unassumingly smart but lighthearted. It's impressive and it makes me happy.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to make a complaint, it would be that the score wasn't particularly stand-out. That's it. Everything else was enjoyable and cool. If you're itching for a slice-of-life gem, this one's for you!",

            "content": "Originally I didn't plan on watching this. It wasn't something that I felt like I could possibly get into. My close friend was speaking so highly of it one day I decided to give it a try for myself and it was love at first sight. Literally, when I saw the opening sequence is when I fell in love with this anime. I know I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover but this anime has not failed me yet. \r\nA wonderfully beautiful story about some single, virgin, otaku women who all have their own unique obsession. little did they know their world would becompletely flipped around by a vibrant and  androgynous spoiled kid, generous and with good intent he will introduce them to a world outside of their protective shell which is their dwelling. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is mediocre. It all depends on what you would classify as \"art\" this show is artistic in more ways than just visually. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound track so far is fantastic, as stated above, I fell in love with the opening theme instantly. The ending theme also has a certain appropriate feel to it if you know what I'm saying. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are wonderfully constructed. Not sure if this is good or bad but I can kinda relate to them in more ways than one(ahem....minus the NEET part). I find myself being attracted to how adorable tsukimi is and I think she is the perfect protagonist to this series. \\n\\n\r\nI wait for this show to come out every week. This weekly release of this show is really the highlight of my day whenever I see it. I have yet to watch an episode that hasn't made me crack up laughing or gush at how adorable the characters are sometimes :) \\n\\n\r\nOverall I believe this anime is absolutely one of the best anime's I've had the pleasure of watching in a very long time. The conclusion to this anime will be bittersweet, I want to see how it will finish up, but at the same time I wish I could watch it forever. I really hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do.",

            "content": "Kuragehime is one of these romantic comedy anime series where, on first glance, tries to be refreshing by introducing a completely unorthodox premise along an atypical cast of characters and only end up a bit lacking, and while I still think that this is the case, the great direction that it had with it's great energy overshadowed it's weaknesses.\r\nThe energy in this series is just, palpitating. Every episode is refreshing to watch and there is no dull moment. The interaction between the cast of characters is extremely entertaining and its slapstick comedy never ceases to make me smile. Moreover, there are cliffhangers in virtually everyepisode of the series until the last one which keeps the viewer on the edges of the seat. That does not mean that the cliffhangers are good ones though. The conclusion of these cliffhangers were quite predictable on the second half and the conclusion to the cliffhanger of the penultimate episode was just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in the first half of the series is really good. It really had this perfect blend between romance and comedy and neither never feels too heavy. Though this changed on the second half. The comedy became less consistent and the drama sometimes felt a bit too heavy but always tolerable and interesting, in the sense of wanting to know what will happen next, to watch. Moreover, one could really see that the creators were trying to put the maximum things possible on the final episode and even though the chain of reactions remained natural, the pacing however started to feel very rushed and sometimes stepped out the boundaries of time.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, its cast of characters are both pleasant and entertaining to watch, not to mention that each character has a personality of his/her own. This really creates a colourful atmosphere where each personality clashes with one another. However this itself is its own downfall because the short amount of episodes restrained the bunch from being decently developed. Indeed, until the end it is as if the inhabitants in Amamizukan did not develop at all: nobody passed her fear of stylish people along her prejudice thoughts regarding them. Mayaya remained annoying, Juon is still trapped in her dark room and Banba is always afro-licious. Moreover, many of them feel so mono dimensional that they seem to be exaggerated caricatures of modern otakus. Which is not the glorified, sympathetic characters shown in some anime but rather judgemental people who only believe on their own words and delude themselves into thinking that they actually fit the norm, and the rest of us not so much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the setting, it really remained safe throughout the end. The creators just basically threw the Amars on some unknown place to see their reaction. This is extremely safe because the reactions always tend to be either funny or exciting, the latter is usually used as a cliffhanger. And I am quite happy with this considering that the series is too short for them to be quite experimental with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals here are very beautiful, with Kuranosuke being in a different dress a lot of times in a single episode. The animation though, not bad is still far from being perfect. Sometimes, not frequently there tend to some still frames. Forgivable though.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is constant, not good nor bad, just average. I love the OP and ED songs. Both of them were catchy and I actually find myself chain listening to them. The OP song fits Tsukimi's character while the ED song Kuranosuke's goal on making her feel more confident. The instrumental music though is nothing too remarkable, which is understandable considering what gave the series its life what its cast of characters and fast pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe replayability of this series, like for any other noitamina anime series is really high.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Kuragehime remains a favourite romantic comedy anime where the interaction between its atypical ensemble really masks its weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nStory/plot: Simple and quirky. Nothing that stands out though. 82.5%\\n\\n\r\nStorytelling and pacing: Again, 11 episodes is just too few and the pacing felt very rush on the final episode. Other than that its fast pace gave it a very energetic feeling to it. 87.5%\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters, however mono-dimensional they were, are really fun to follow and their energy kept the series dull-free. 90%\\n\\n\r\nSetting: Very safe, does not stand out but does not disappoint. 80%\\n\\n\r\nVisual and animation: very good visual albeit some still frames. 85%\\n\\n\r\nMusic: While the instrumental music was nothing special, the OP and ED songs were both catchy: 85%\\n\\n\r\nReplayability: HIGH . Can be replayed a multitude of times without it getting dull. 95%\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 86%/100% (pretty good) (MAL does not let me do this kind of rating scheme.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommended?: Yes\\n",

            "content": "The best word to describe Princess Jellyfish would be adorable, but that would be doing the show a disservice. Yes, it is very, very cute. Yes, it's sweet. Yes, it's shoujo, but it's not all pink and sparkly eyes. It's endearing and heartwarming without being cavity inducing.\r\nWhen I first started the show, all I could think was it was Tumblr: The Anime. A group of socially awkward women (who met online!) live together in an apartment building they've nicknamed \"The Nunnery\". Our main character, Tsukimi, is the youngest of the Sisterhood and has moved to Tokyo to become an illustrator. She's the least bizarre ofher roommates, but she's still completely and utterly obsessed with jellyfish and can't talk to \"Stylish\" people or boys. Eventually, she meets Kuranosuke who just happens to be a stylish boy. He pushes her to experience new things and champions saving the apartment building in which she lives.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, after Kuranosuke came on to the scene, I was worried that the show would focus on changing Tsukimi into a \"Stylish\" person ala The Wallflower because \"all girls want to be pretty! Right?!\". This was particularly troubling because Tsukimi and the other members of the stisterhood, LIKE the way they are. There are some social anxieties they'd like to iron out, of course, but they know what makes them happy most of the time and they do it. My next concern (again, thanks Wallflower) was that this show would turn and focus on boys.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, I was wrong on both accounts! Kuranosuke does give Tsukimi and her roommates (except Chieko, the kimono wearing Japanese clothing enthusiast, she's also the heaviest character so the fact that she gets to be beautiful just the way she is, in anime no less, is awesome) makeovers, but they are for very specific reasons--like going to a political meeting. The message wasn't to try to change them, but to teach them how to use social conventions to their advantage. If you show up to a formal meeting in sweats, no one is going to take you seriously. If you're trying to sell things in a trendy area like Harajuku, you have to look trendy. It was no different than you or I dressing professionally for a job interview. When the task was over, everyone went home and went back to doing what made them comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Kuranosuke did was get them out of the house and--in Tsukimi's case--give them the tools to not be crippled by their anxieties and run away.\\n\\n\r\nEventually (and predictably) we see Kuranosuke fall for Tsukimi. Interestingly, though, he's not just interested in her when she's made up and beautiful. And of course she's beautiful in fancy clothes and make up, this is shoujo. But rather when she's talking about the things she loves. Jellyfish Princess subverts the old trope of \"girls are more beautiful when their in love\" and applies it to their interests. Kuranosuke stares longingly at Tsukimi even when she's in her braids and glasses, as long as she's talking about something she loves. Usually, she's talking about jellyfish.\\n\\n\r\nThe good:\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the art. I don't know how impressive it is by usual modern standards, but it reminded me a little of Studio Ghibli (drawing wise, not animation) and the stylish women were drawn with these big amazing retro-shoujo curls and the fashion was very Ai Yazawa. The character designs weren't exactly inspired, only one of Tsukimi's roommates has a face to speak of, but they do have different body types, which is great. Visual gags were effective, funny, and not over used or grating. You will find yourself laughing aloud.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was spectacular. Every voice actor was great, especially Mitsuki Saiga as Kuranosuke. The OP and ED were delightful, and the background music was jazzy and perfectly fit the eclectic, quirky feel of the show. I'm pretty sure Kuranosuke's theme even had lyrics!\\n\\n\r\nIt was great to have a cast that wasn't made up of high schoolers. Everyone is an adult, with most characters in their thirties. Tsukimi and Kuranosuke are the youngest at college age. There were a few extremely well developed characters, Tsukimi was a perfect portrayal of a geeky girl. If you're on this site, I'm sure you'll see some of yourself in her. Kuranosuke's brother Shu was fascinating. Kuranosuke himself was extremely complex and gives you A LOT to think about, and the portrayal of the Japanese prime minister as a ridiculous lunatic who can't get his approval ratings out of the single digits was unexpected and scathingly brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nOn most accounts, the show can be called progressive and even feminist at points as characters subvert some gender stereotypes, but certainly not all. There is a male transvestite (who is probably gender queer based on his back story) and this isn't played for laughs nor is he a stereotype. And a man who isn't the transvestite is sexually assaulted by a woman, something that is rarely depicted. Again, this isn't played for laughs and the man in question was shown to be very troubled by the incident.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\\n\r\nThe ending leaves several plot lines dangling. In a way that's good because the final scenes focus on Tsukimi being more confident in herself and not on which boy she ended up with, but I still want to know what happens! There is a plot line that is relevant at first, then becomes irrelevant, BUT JUST KEEPS GOING FOR NO REASON. I'm not sure what it was trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not vital or anything, but it is worth pointing out that Tsukimi's roommates don't get any more depth past their obsessions. Kuranosuke's chauffeur gets more characterization than this. That said, they do serve their purpose, so it's up to you whether this is a pro or con.\\n\\n\r\nThe Madonna/Whore Dichotomy is strong in this one. Obviously, Tsukimi and the Sisterhood are virgins. They're presented as funny or cute. They're \"good\" characters. The only other named woman in the show is the antagonist, a career mogul aptly named Inari, who gets what she wants by having sex as bribes or having sex for blackmail material. This isn't too bothersome because Inari isn't bad because she has sex. She's bad because she does it for ulterior motives, but the over sexualized female villain is a sad trope to play in a show that's so innovative in other places. It would have been nice if we had one more named female character who was sexually active and still got to be \"good\".\\n\\n\r\nActually, the show handles the whole topic of sex pretty poorly. It is automatically assumed that any character who is uncomfortable around the opposite sex is a virgin, and two characters who are *THOUGHT* to have had sex with each other are treated like they're in a relationship. Because, you know, that's the only time sex happens/the only out come of sex.\\n\\n\r\nThe cross dressing character declares that he is \"normal\" in a way that definitely means \"not gay and not a pervert.\"\\n\\n\r\nOk, so that's a lot of talk about sex, but it's actually not a big deal in the show itself and, aforementioned assault aside (which isn't shown past something being slipped in a drink and then the guy waking up), the show is totally innocent.  I don't even remember an on screen kiss. This isn't a con, I just want to point it out incase I scared some one away. \\n\\n\r\nI love Kuranosuke to tiny little lip gloss covered pieces. He's my favorite character in the show, but he's also the most problematic. He has his own not socially acceptable obsessions that would make him just as much of an otaku as the Sisterhood, but this is never commented on, presumably because he presents himself to the world in a physically attractive manner. Also, at the END of the series, after spending significant amounts of time with the other characters, he sometimes shows little regard for their interests, going so far as to expect Chieko to sell the dolls she loves while saying he would never sell his clothes.\\n\\n\r\nAs I pointed out earlier, there is a scene where a character is sexually assaulted--he is drugged, brought to a stranger's house, undressed, touched (not sexually, but still spooning with an unconscious, unwilling person is not cool), and has photos taken which are used to blackmail him. The woman who did this is never punished. If that sort of thing bothers you, be warned. There are also a few instances where characters, both male and female, are slapped or kicked in a way intended to hurt them but adds nothing to the plot but some icky feelings.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately:\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Jellyfish is a wonderful little story that's original, interesting (I didn't mean to watch it all in two days!), and actually has some pretty great things to say.\\n\\n\r\nIt should appeal to people who like shoujo without all the focus on romance, slice of life (though it isn't this-- it has a definite plot and goal), and anyone that wants to see a good! new take on otaku culture, or if you just want to watch a really funny show.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it based on just how endearing it is, and the characters of Tsukimi and Kuranosuke alone.",

            "content": "I was able to watch back-to-back episodes of Princess Jellyfish with ease, which is often something I cannot do (I'm not much of a marathoner concerning TV shows or movies). This show was definitely entertaining with a very cute premise, but there are some problems with it that I think keep it from being great. I would be curious to read more of the manga to see how it compares.\r\nA real brief summary of the show (if you're interested) is that a young woman by the name of Tsukimi Kurashita is the newest tenant in an apartment building filled with fellow otaku or nerds. Eachof the girls in the building has an overwhelming passion for their main interest or hobby, and it is a well known rule that no men are allowed inside the building. One day Tsukimi meets one of the \"Stylish\", who happens to be a guy named Kuranosuke who crossdresses. An interesting friendship (and maybe even something more) begins to form between these two characters, and Kuranosuke works hard with Tsukimi and the other tenants to raise money to save the apartment building.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said previously, this show is certainly entertaining and held my interest, so I believe it is worth a watch. I am disappointed however in how the plot was executed. Perhaps this is due to the small 11-episode nature of the series, I'm not sure. I feel that there was a lot of potential for more character growth, which is never seen. It would have been nice to have seen Tsukimi and the tenants slowly begin to be more confident and involved in their community. I also would have liked to have seen Shu's character explored more.\\n\\n\r\nI very much disliked the relationship between the character Shu and the landshark lady. She sexually harasses Shu, leads him to believe they had sexual relations (when they didn't), and threatens him with blackmail. The reason why this bothered me so much is that you never see for sure if Shu has learned something or grown from this terrible experience. Instead of confidently standing up for himself he still unnecessarily reaches out to the woman throughout the series. (SPOILER SPOILER) At least at the end he appears to walk away from her in embarrassment of the whole situation. This scene could be very easily interpreted differently however. I think I could have accepted this portion of the plot more if some sort of character development came of it (because sometimes bad things do happen), but I do not see that here.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is very fun, alluding to many pieces of pop culture. I enjoyed the art style and slightly muted color scheme too. This show is a little frustrating because I feel that it has so much untapped potential.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion is that this is an enjoyable watch, but I was certainly not blown away or moved like some other slice-of-life series I've seen. I would recommend this, but with some reservations.",

            "content": "As an adult male that grew up watching shonen action and mecha series, you would expect Kuragahime/Princess Jellyfish would be the last series I would watch, much less become a favorite. And yet this brief but wonderful series crept its way into my heart as I found myself watching every episode, each ending with a smile on my face and a warm, fuzzy feeling in my chest.\r\nStory: 9\r\nEvery episode has a nice pacing. The happenings of them keep you engrossed so much, that by the time it's over, you'd think it was too fast. It ends at a mere 13 episodes, but each episode feltlike it packed the maximum amount of content without feeling overloaded. Princess Jellyfish does a great job of not treading through the same shoujo trail of hokey, melodramatic writing, and instead has something more down to earth and believable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nFrom the moment you watch it, Princess Jellyfish's artwork already sets itself apart from its shoujo contemporaries. Every character is distinctive looking, for starters. The backgrounds are also nicely done and \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing bad but nothing truly outstanding here. The opening and ending sequences however do have a great choice in music, and the homages to other series is apparent and very well received. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 15\\n\r\nThe shining jewel of Princess Jellyfish is undoubtedly its characters! All of their characteristics and personalities are just as distinctive as their looks. Character interaction does a lot in carrying the plot of the series, and it is done masterfully. Their awkwardness is outshined by their believability, as each character has a layer added to them as the series progresses. I couldn't help but love all of them, flaws and all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nPrincess Jellyfish is entertaining from start to finish. Seeing these painfully awkward characters wrestle their way through life's challenges was entertaining, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere just isn't enough publicity on this series, and it really deserves more! If you like slice of life series that revolve around otaku, there are very few that hit closer to home than Princess Jellyfish!",

            "content": "I actually really like this, its way different than anything I really saw. A lot of people do a lot of otaku outcasts but this one has a little different vibe to it. The characters, though their names are hard to remember, are remember-able for how out there and crazy they are. Each one is a otaku in their own way and have different ways of showing it whether it is being crazy about kimonos, to posting old men\u2019s pictures into a scrap-book. A little creepy, but it\u2019s not as bad as it seems. The guy is really cool even if he cross-dresses but heseems normal otherwise. The underlining story is pretty much being true to yourself and never give up on your dreams.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is wonderful even if it lacks in some places. It mostly does this when you look between the two \u2018worlds\u2019 and depicts Tsukimi\u2019s world and Kuranosuke\u2019s world. It\u2019s not all that bad, but once in a while when the two worlds meet, it\u2019s sometimes a bit harsh of an art style. I really love the designs of the jellyfish and how they actually have a few facts about jellyfish that are supposedly real. I don\u2019t care much too actually look them up but they sound real so its ether true or the actor is rather good at making it sound true. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the most part is well done. The English is a little bothersome though I really like the cute voice of Tsukimi and Kuranosuke. I\u2019m not so fond of one or two of the characters in the apartments and it made me cringe the first few times I heard them. Now along the way, I ether got used to it, it got better, or I just didn\u2019t even care about what they sounded like because the story was just so good!\\n\\n\r\nAll together, it was funny and sweet. Really, if you want funny, This is it! Sadly, it has a very bad cliff hanger right now and I really want to see more! It does make me want to read the manga now but something really tells me that this is better as an Anime then the manga. \\n",

            "content": "There are a couple of good Otaku community Anime's out there, but \r\nnone have Kuragehime beat in the sheer absurdity of the fan \r\ncommunity.  As the name implies, the main character, the \r\njellyfish princess, is utterly taken by jellyfish.  She lives in \r\na \"nunnery\" so named because the residents are female outcasts \r\nthat hate all things fashionable and hip, and regularly curse the \r\nexistence of men.  The other residents are obsessed with trains, \r\nold men, Kimonos, and Romance of the 3 Kingdoms.  \r\nJellyfish girl, Tsukimi, meets a fashionable girl one night who \r\npersistently insists on staying over.  Uneasy already witha \\n\r\nhipster, Tsukimi learns in the morning that the girl is actually \\n\r\na transvestite.  He becomes taken with the nunnery and Tsukimi, and \\n\r\ndecides to visit regularly to the Chagrin of the other residents.  Kuragehime is \\n\r\nalways sweet and endearing the way Otaku community stories like \\n\r\nGenshiken or Doujin Work tend to be, but the plot changes focus \\n\r\nfrom romance to keeping the nunnery safe, and the ending gives an \\n\r\nanticlimactic (though thoroughly amusing) conclusion to both.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Jellyfish girl, Kuranosuke the crossdresser and \\n\r\nperhaps one other character, the cast is merely gag fodder, \\n\r\nflaunting their ridiculous obsessions constantly.  For example, \\n\r\nanytime a location is mentioned, the train girl will mention what \\n\r\nline that location is near.  The 3 kingdoms girl will also make \\n\r\npoor analogies of what is happening to events in the epic.  You \\n\r\nnever get to know their hardships or struggles with their social \\n\r\nproblems.\\n\\n\r\nTsukimi and Kuranosuke, in complete contrast, have very \\n\r\nheartwarming stories tied to the loss of their mothers.  Their \\n\r\nhobbies remind them of their mothers, and some of the most \\n\r\ntouching moments in the series come from both the happiness and \\n\r\nsadness they feel when they partake in their obsessions.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the romance element is rather weak, and when it \\n\r\ntakes center stage the series drags.  Tsukimi has a potent \\n\r\ncupid's arrow, love at first sight reaction that somehow gets way \\n\r\nmore emotionally involved than a crush.  She runs off crying when \\n\r\nshe thinks a guy she hasn't shared 3 or 4 sentences with might \\n\r\nnot have feelings for her.  She may be inexperienced in love, but \\n\r\nit will probably be hard for anyone who's gotten past the 7th \\n\r\ngrade to see this as the pinnacle of heart break and romantic \\n\r\ndrama.  The best romantic moments are the awkward ones that are \\n\r\ntouching and funny at the same time, but they are few and far \\n\r\nbetween.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is fluffy looking, with light, slightly faded \\n\r\ncolors like one piece or Paradise Kiss.  The characters have the \\n\r\nfull lips but not the sharp faces typical of shoujo/josei Anime.  \\n\r\nThe fashion choices might be eccentric and odd for real life, but \\n\r\nare beautiful to look at in animation.  I'm not really sure how \\n\r\njellyfish could be any sexier than they are in Kuragehime either. \\n\r\n This is definitely a pretty series.\\n\\n\r\nKuragehime is stuck somewhere between a melancholic slife of \\n\r\nlife, a romantic drama, and a heartwarming otaku expose.  The \\n\r\nending doesn't really tie it all together, but it's entertaining \\n\r\nenough at 11 episodes.\\n",

            "content": "Immediately getting on my good side, Higashimura's distinctive character designs work wonders for this series where other artists might not have even given it a second thought. The residents of the Amamizukan don't look like your typical anime girls, they're not designed to be beautiful or attractive and this helps to make their awkwardness all the more believable, but they're not repulsive either. There's still enough charm to them that they can be quite cute at times, and when Kuranosuke gives them all makeovers they take on a much more conventionally appealing aesthetic while still remaining completely recognizable. Brain's Base doesn't slack in the animationdepartment, either; movements are mostly pretty fluid, albeit with some occasional hiccups, and show's overall art design is welcoming. The color scheme for this show in particular is incredibly warm, bright and inviting, with plenty of flourish to keep it visually engaging. On a whole, this is a shining example of what the studio can achieve both technically and artistically, brimming with panache and enthusiasm. It looks great.\\n\\n\r\nThe music exists, I guess. I think they were going for a big city feel, like a tribute to some of those rom-com flicks set in New York (why is it always New York?) and it pulls this off competently, but never really goes above and beyond. There's the playfully seductive piano, a little jazz, what sounds to be the clarinet accenting its more low-key moments, but it's hardly exceptional and even in execution there are some moments where it could have been handled better. There's one scene in which Kuranosuke is struggling to come to terms with the possibility that he's fallen for Tsukimi, while Tsukimi is confronting her own insecurities. In between all of this, the Sisterhood realizes that Kuranosuke's boobs are fake but assume he's just a flat-chested woman. This is an emotionally complex, tonally diverse scene, and it would have worked a lot better if the music dipped and swelled to match these different moments instead of just running a gentle contemplative piece over the entire thing. It's a passable soundtrack but certainly nothing to write home about. The opening and ending theme, however, are both excellent and neither is worth skipping over.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the Japanese track is top-notch across the board, able to handle both the show's comedic and dramatic sides with finesse, and I guess that's all that needs to be said about it. From what I've heard, the general reaction to the dub for this series has been overwhelmingly positive, but I could see it potentially making some viewers uncomfortable. This has nothing to do with the acting, which is generally pretty solid. Heck, Josh Grelle as Kuranosuke is a downright highlight for being able to bounce perfectly between the character's feminine and masculine sides, and talents like Maxey Whitehead, Monica Rial, Leah Clark and Ian Sinclair really do pour all their hearts into their respective roles. The problem I find with the dub--and let me preface this by saying that many of you probably won't mind at all--is in the script, which is peppered with dated colloquialisms and attempts to sound \"trendy\" that ultimately just comes off as immature more than anything. I realize that's part of the joke and I have nothing against liberal, interpretive dubs that focus on preserving the intent of the original dialog rather than the precise content, it's just piled on a little thick for my taste and I could see plenty of other viewers--not just the sub purists--having the same reaction. Give the dub a try, and if you're fine with the first episode it probably won't bother you from there. It bothered me and I still really enjoyed the dub, so maybe I'm just nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does have some dramatic moments and honest themes to convey, but even then it's often tongue-in-cheek so let's start by looking at the humor. The comedic moments in this show can be situational, slapstick, satirical, referential or some combination of these things, and I'm happy to say it's really funny... about two-thirds of the time. What happened to the other third? Well, maybe they were trying to create a warm sense of familiarity, but some of the jokes here get recycled too often and emphasized too much for comfort. The first time Kuranosuke accidentally refers to himself as a boy and Tsukimi goes through her \"oh boy\" cover-up singing routine, it's kinda funny, but this keeps happening with little variation and quickly wears out its welcome. The girls' \"defense mechanism\" of turning to stone in uncomfortable public places and Tsukimi's tendency to jump to the most pessimistic conclusion about everything also get pretty repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nStill, even if a few of its jokes are overused, don't let that discourage you because this show is still pretty darn funny. The girls have a wide variety of wacky quirks and unusual interests and the show isn't afraid to have a little fun at their expense, but unlike some other comedies (I'm looking at you, Big Bang Theory) the show doesn't look down on them for their niche interests and they're still likable and easy to sympathize with. Many of us know what it's like to have an interest few people share--heck, that's kinda what being an anime fan in the West is like. Kuranosuke and his circle add even more comedic juices to the mix while avoiding some easy cliches. There are almost no \"it's funny because he's a transvestite\" moments, which would have been laziest rout to take; instead, the show takes full advantage of all the social barriers and potential misunderstandings that could occur between a male crossdresser and a house full of female otaku, and they all play off each other really well. Kuranosuke's family, friends and acquaintances are all interesting and memorable in their own ways. Ultimately, the jokes in this show work because even though the characters all have their quirks, they're not solely defined by them, allowing the show's humor to flow more naturally. This show loves its characters, and there need to be more comedies like that.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how silly it gets, though, this is a story of strange and troubled people and it never fails to get that across. The show doesn't hesitate to criticize Tsukimi and her friends on some of their anti-social habits, but at the same time it never condemns them from being who they are or loving what they do. As individuals, I have to admit their personalities can be a little sparse. Mayaya is spastic and sees the world as an epic battlefield, Banba is deadpan and has a silly afro, Jiji is shy and likes old men, and Chieko is commanding with a maternal touch, and at times it seems like there's not much to them beyond that. Still, there are moments in the series that make it clear that's not the case, when they step forward to help one another through dire straits. They all enjoy their lives, far more than the well-to-do, \"respectable\" members of society, and when push comes to shove they're looking out for each other. It's little moments like this that really makes these characters likable, I just wish there were more of them. Tsukimi herself is the centerpiece of this group, and the youngest among them--she's fully integrated into their way of life but perhaps hasn't quite forgotten the dreams they all once had, she's grounded enough to realize they probably won't come true but innocent enough to still hope for it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the show's depth, though, comes from Kuranosuke's side. At the center is Kuranosuke's lack of a sense of belonging, which stems both from being an illegitimate child and from his fascination with women's clothing, which he learned from his mother. Refreshingly, he's fully come to terms with his gender identity: he's a straight man who happens to like dressing as a woman, but the women he's been with up to this point to are from his father's world, the world of the rich and spoiled. Still, his family isn't demonized either. His father and half-brother Shuu both continue to suffer from the affair in their own ways, and they really do care about Kuranosuke. And then there's his uncle, the incredibly unpopular prime minister of Japan, who's more accepting than anyone of Kuranosuke's habit, presumably because he knows the stress of the political world and would rather just enjoy life without worrying what people think of him. This is played entirely for laughs, but that's the thing about this show: almost everything is at least partially played for laughs and it still manages to get all these points across. I'm not even sure whether Kuranosuke's uncle was intended as a satirical statement or just thrown in there to be silly, but the result is equal parts absurd and surprisingly poignant (at least, as a statement; the character himself is just a loon).\\n\\n\r\nSo what happens when these two worlds meet? Where to begin? Kuranosuke starts off treating these girls both as objects of curiosity and as his personal projects; he's fascinated by how different they are, but can't quite wrap his mind around the radically different values they carry or that dolls and jellyfish could be as important to them as fashion is to him. The sisterhood is initially wary of the stylish stranger, and it takes a believably long time for this one-way fascination to develop into mutual respect. Shuu goes through his own arc on the side, and the show does a remarkably good job of balancing all the different sides it presents. If there's one place the drama falls flat, it's the romance. Tsukimi and Shuu become mutually attracted on sight and hardly interact at all outside of a few awkward moments to perpetuate the mutual misunderstandings between them. It's intended to convey both characters' innocence, but there's not enough substance to make it believable. Kuranosuke's attraction to Tsukimi is handled a little better, it'd have to be since they actually get to know each other, but even then it mostly just comes down to him being struck by how \"cute\" she is. There are probably deeper reasons for him being drawn to her, they're just never shown to us and that's a real shame.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakness in the series' romantic relationships stems from a much greater problem. It's a problem that's very common to anime adapted from ongoing source material, I've brought it up in a previous review and I'll most definitely have to bring it up again in future reviews: this series was adapted from a much longer, still-ongoing manga, and the adaptation doesn't feel complete. At the end of the show, the writers decide to slap on an ending that ties up the basic conflict that kept the plot moving along but offers little resolution to the actual character arcs, which are infinitely more important. Given another episode or two, I'm certain the writers could have brought the story to a more satisfying conclusion, or at the very least they could have left the plot open to a second season instead of slamming the door shut the way they did. What we're left with is a bunch of thematic questions and only a handful of answers, so it's a good thing the questions are as good as they are.\\n\\n\r\nWith any luck, a second season will eventually take this series to new heights, and given its acclaim and popularity I suspect the manga will find its way to the West in the near future, but as a stand-alone anime Princess Jellyfish is simply too short. Still, that doesn't take away all the good this anime has to it, even on its own. Here we have a series that speaks to the nerds and otaku of the world without ever making itself inaccessible to wider audiences. It's lovable, funny, clever and insightful and I heartily recommend giving it a try.",

The story was alright, though it seemed to change purpose a few times, the art was amazing and portrayed the divide between the stylish and the otaku by giving examples of both extremes that were very well explained and actually quite realistic, the music was lively and cheerful, which fit the show very well.  Then, there are the characters.  This series has some the most endearing characters I've ever encountered in a series, it is very easy to sympathize and relate with them.  Because of all of these factors, I found agreat amount of enjoyment with these eleven episodes.  Overall, this was a fantastic anime.",

What kind of title is that?\r\nBut don't be deceived by first impressions. True to its roots, this anime is focused at a more mature audience then typical animes; that's why it's the josei genre. It relates to many aspects of \"fandoms\". Trains, Japanese culture, fashion, politics, and much more. Many of the characters are attractive, not by their looks, but by their personalities, and how their individual fandoms relate to them. This not only gives a charm inthe story, but watchers can easily understand and recognize them.\\n\\n\r\nTo give focus onto the main characters, Kurashita Tsukimi is the titular Jellyfish Princess. She is obsessed with jellyfish and dream of being an illustrator.She lives with the \"Amars\" the other 30-something fujoshi, and men are not allowed within the Amamizukan, their apartment. The other \"heroine\" is Koibuchi Kuranosuke. A son of a politician, he crossdresses in hopes of avoiding politics, and he fatefully meets Tsukimi. Hilarity ensues.\\n\\n\r\nLight-hearted but clearly having its own depth, Kuragehime is definitely worth watching, if only for the character interaction. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nWarning: The opening and ending songs are highly addicting. Watch with care.",

            "content": "What were my first thoughts on Kuragehime? It sounds stupid. An anime about middle aged lonely otaku virgin women is absolutely unheard of in this day and age. None of them are even cute! \u2018Give me moe or give me death!\u2019 is quite a common thing nowadays. And above all it\u2019s just another slice of life. Almost nothing is attractive if you were to just explain \u2018The Jellyfish Princess\u2019 to any other fan. \r\nHowever, despite all its unattractiveness it is by far the most beautiful anime of the fall season.\r\nAt first glance, without being told anything, anyone would assume the majority of the main characterswere guys. This would include Mayaya, Banba and Jiji. Quite honestly those names are some of the strangest names I\u2019ve heard in all the years I\u2019ve watched anime. Coupled with their rather quirky nature and almost unisexual apparel you\u2019d almost never guess they were girls until the show told you and if all you\u2019re looking for is moe you\u2019d be hugely disappointed. However their personalities, now factoring Tsukimi and Chieko, seem to overcome all those faults. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the obsessive otakuness that drives their actions but the characters seem endearing; you can laugh at them, with them, and even understand why they act the way they do. All the NUNZ are just fun and somewhat loveable to watch as they interact with the \u2018Hipster\u2019 Kuranosuke. \\n\\n\r\nKuranosuke is, currently, my most favorite character of the series. He\u2019s that annoying crossdressing neighbor that runs into your life and does whatever he wants, typically destroying any semblance of piece. Aside from being completely hilarious, he\u2019s the main reason the plot moves at all and without him I don\u2019t think the everyday lives of the NUNZ would have been hilariously affected as they are now.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the main attraction to this series, I would believe, would be the characters. But not in the same way a show like K-ON attracts using their characters. While K-ON has you admire and squeal over how cute their characters act, Kuragehime has characters that live by quirks many otaku and others without good people skills would find familiar and easy to understand. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, don\u2019t let the description throw you off. Let it take you in and you\u2019ll find Kuragehime, among its faults, shines as bright as the brightest jellyfish at night.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Don\u2019t listen to the OP or ED. They\u2019re so addictive it\u2019s hard to sleep while knowing they aren\u2019t in your hard drive RIGHT NOW.\\n",

            "content": "'Kuragehime' ('Jellyfish Princess') is a modern Cinderella story featuring the unlikeliest cast of a jellyfish-otaku princess and the cross-dressing prince.\r\nThe first thing I noticed about the series is the heavy influence of live-action movies.\r\nEpisode titles are parody of film titles:\r\n1. 'Sex and the City' (2008)\r\n2. 'Sukiyaki Western Django' (2007)\r\n3. 'Enchanted' (2007)\r\n4. 'Eden' (2006)\r\n5. 'Watashi wa Kai ni Naritai' (1959/2008)\r\n6. 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968)\r\n7. 'Kinyuu Fushoku Rettou: Jubaku' (1999)\r\n8. 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004)\r\n9. 'Midnight Cowboy' (1969)\r\n10. 'The Turning Point' (1977)\r\n11. 'Field of Dreams' (1989)\r\nOP is a parody of a series of famous scenes from Hollywood and Japanese films:\r\n1. 'Sex and the City' (2008)\r\n2. 'StarWars' (1977~)\\n\r\n3. 'Singin' in the Rain' (1952)\\n\r\n4. 'Mary Poppins' (1964)\\n\r\n5. 'Emperor of the North Pole' (1973)\\n\r\n6. 'Onna Tobakushi' (1967)\\n\r\n7. 'James Bond' (1962~)\\n\r\n8. 'Game of Death' (1978)\\n\r\n9. 'The Graduate' (1967)\\n\r\n10. 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, major Japanese film producers and distributors were in production committee (Fuji, Toho, and Asmik Ace actually show their real opening credits in an episode)\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Josei\" is a minor subcategory of \"shoujo\" manga and anime, targeted toward older audiences (18+). 'Kuragehime', despite being published on a josei manga magazine, lacks any mature characters or themes to really categorize it as one  (and it won a manga award in shoujo rather than otona (mature/adult) category). This is clearly a shoujo anime.\\n\r\n'Kuragehime' is about a bunch of female otaku in Amamizukan, an apartment complex in Tokyo. These girls are severely repulsed by men and fashionable/successful people, but our heroine Tsukimi one day makes friends with fashionable cross-dresser Kuranosuke and finds out later that not only is he male, he 's also from a rich political family.\\n\r\nThe first half of the story is mostly about Kuranosuke extending his influence over \"Ama~s\" (\"Nun~s\"), the girls in Amamizukan. It should be noted that while literal meaning of \"ama\" is \"nun\", which suits their virgin and hikikomori status in their house, it is also a derogatory slang for \"women\" (much like how \"nun\" is a slang for \"prostitutes\" in English). These girls are basically calling themselves \"bitche~s\"\" and \"whore~s\".\\n\r\nThe \"Ama~s\" consists of otaku girls with extremely bizarre hobbies. Tsukimi is into jellyfish, Ichimatsu Dolls for Chieko, 'Romance of Three Kingdoms' for Mayaya, and senile men for Jiji. The only ones with relatively common interests are Jyuon, the nocturnal fujoshi BL manga writer, and Bamba, as railfans existed way before the word \"otaku\" became a slang. Other than our heroine Tsukimi and acting-landlord Chieko, all the other \"Ama~s\" girls exist almost solely for comedy.\\n\r\nThe second half of the story is about saving Amamizukan from a land development project. This is mostly attempted to be done by fund raising, in which the challenge for introverted girls to go out into the world and forced to interact with people is depicted, as well as Kousuke's attempt to transform Tsukimi's introvert personality by building up her confidence.  Unfortunately, \"Ama~s\" are almost always forced to do these things they detest, and their fear of outsiders have not eased at all, freezing up in uncomfortable situations to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of a shoujo anime, there is also a lot of romantic concerns for the heroine, and the typical love triangle, predicaments etc. that confuses individuals of their own feelings and prevent love confessions. \\n\r\nThe character development between Tsukimi and Kuranosuke are rather good, though they are put into one random predicament after another, and saved in the last minute by fairytale successes, whether it's extreme makeover, profitable sales, or crowd-pleasing dress designs. Kuranosuke is practically a prince who tries to save Tsukimi from isolation and turn her into a fashionable and popular chick. Of course, she turns into a gorgeous Yamato Nadeshiko simply by taking off her glasses and putting on some makeup. The story develops into a clich\u00e9 Cinderella fantasy. To make it worse, everything gets solved by predictable deus ex machina in the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt quality for 'Kuragehime' is very high. Lots of variety with backgrounds, as the characters travel around Tokyo. I recognized almost every single location in Shibuya during the first episode, the staff completely animated real sites. Maybe because I'm way more familiar with Shibuya than Akibahara etc, but it seemed like they put far more attention into detail than the typical series.  I can tell you that this is a very faithful reproduction of the city down to individual stores and signs. Other places like Amamizukan (actually a male-only lodge in West Waseda), parks, and streets seem to be modeled after real places as well.\\n\r\nCharacter designs deviate from the ordinary, with memorable style and traits for most characters. None of the \"Ama~s\" members are beautified. Fluidity is rather good, and all the characters were drawn with extremely high consistency. The comedic special effects (petrification, shock etc) were done very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is dominated by seasoned veteran seiyuu in 30s and 40s with wide range of voices that fit characters pretty well. However, none of their voicing jobs were particularly memorable.\\n\r\nBGM were extremely strong, wide range of instruments playing music of different style, often setting/enhancing the mood for comedy. OP as mentioned earlier, is parody of famous scenes from movies with surprisingly good flow and audio-visual synchronization. Chatmonchy is known for their distinct rock songs, and they don't disappoint with the off-beat OP song 'Kokodake no Hanashi (Just Between Us)'. As usual of their songs, there's something about it that really moves you, and it fits the series very well with its quirkiness and optimism. And who better to sing the ED than Sambomaster, who came to popularity after their song was featured as theme song for 2005 'Densha Otoko' live-action drama, which still remains to be the most watched and arguably most influential otaku story in history? Their song \"Kimi no Kirei ni Kizuite Okure (Realize How Beautiful You Are)\" is a poignant rock song that really captures this anime's theme, and the ED animation comes in long shot of 1 cut. Very impressive. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all its originality in premise, character setting, art style, and sounds, 'Kuragehime' still failed to separate itself from clich\u00e9 shoujo story development. \\n\r\nAs per typical shoujo anime, there's a lot of inner monologue explaining characters' thoughts and emotions. While this is a typical trait of shoujo manga/anime series and theoretically improve empathy and emotional attachment, I consider this to be a very poor storytelling technique as it takes away the joy of thinking and imagining their state of mind. It gets tiresome when they explain the obvious every single time, and slows down the pace of the story. The comedy was hilarious at first, but gets repetitive after a while with identical 'Ol\u00e9' cover ups, shock face, petrification, girly prime minister etc. that gets predictable and tiresome after a while. Repetition can be funny, but it needs to be executed with intelligence and variety.\\n\r\nIn addition, I found it hard to connect with the characters simply because their interests are too \"maniac\" (bizarre/weird), as the Japanese call it. I don't think I'll ever understand a girl's unhealthy fascination with jellyfish or creepy dolls or senile men moe... and I was completely lost when Mayaya spew out bunch of 'Romance of Three Kingdoms' references. I also had no idea why the author would portray girl otaku as nothing more than simple creepy freaks. \"Ama~s\" may be a group of girl otaku with uncommon interests, but they all behaved like a cookie cutter male otaku from general public's perception of otaku culture other than their androphobia, and didn't explore further into the views and motivations from girl otaku's perspective.\\n\\n\r\nIt is still an enjoyable show, but 'Kuragehime' could've easily been so much more. However, I am very impressed at how 'noitaminA' series continue to reject the trend in the industry with uncommon premise and low on moe/ecchi. Any series aired in this time slot continues to be a must-watch for serious anime fans.\\n",

            "content": "The setup for Princess Jellyfish revolves around six NEET females who have decided to live together in a small, \"retro\" building. They all lead their daily mooch lifestyles through the show, coming into contact with a few different types of people in the process, and that is just about its entirety.\r\nBefore moving along with that statement, let's focus on the budget. Princess Jellyfish is well animated and has a pleasant art style. The show's direction carries some expression, and the soundtrack is indeed serviceable. I would consider the opening and ending music good and am pleased when seeing how plentiful of references they can be,along with some of the show. Some of this is refreshing, however, things shift downward when the focus is directed more to the actual story and what it has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI've witnessed many NEET anime and other shows which follow very similar premises, like Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Stories of this focus have been carried out well and in a way that keeps them interesting with some variety. Just by being a series that carries the term \"slice-of-life\", it isn't expected that you will be entering a mirror of a slow reality, as series like Haruhi show you can push the bar a bit. Even so, Princess Jellyfish decides to go right ahead and take a dive in that concept.\\n\\n\r\nPrinces Jellyfish is a story of a forced, shallow love-triangle and of socially odd people who open themselves slightly to amending their typical ways. That's the story of Princess Jellyfish, and that's as far as it will go. Essentially, watching the first two episodes of the series will give you enough to accurately guesstimate the entire series with this in mind, besides the fates of the love triangle. No plot point in this show ever gets developed or treated as something beyond the strange will it has to continually shift them to goofy, comedic gags. A point like the rationality of NEETs is never explored, while several times being joked at, and by the end it comes to thought that the whole incorporation of it was for the basic intent to be served as a quirk by the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of Princess Jellyfish consists of the quirkiness of its character roster. Many of these character's personalities are literally their quirks, along with the basic principles of being a NEET for the main girls. No character ever feels alive beyond the second episode, which ends up making the show feel like a string of events involving a cross-dresser and a bunch of nameless moochers. Not to mention the \"events\" that take place are hardly ones that peak interest as issues that arise are so meager that at times you might think more towards the fact that these characters are doing absolutely nothing beyond surviving off their parents allowances.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not degrading Princess Jellyfish with bias in its inclusion of NEETs, but the whole idea is simply inserted half-heatedly, and while the show seems to push to develop the character's self-respect to become more individual people, the story only grows them far enough to barely reach a relationship with someone of the opposite sex. This lack of focus into anything else beyond a basic romance creates a sensation of the show's true goal being the ability to self-insert. The only arguable message the show presents is that anyone can be beautiful if they choose to be so, but this is presented more figuratively than literally with nothing proving such an idea beyond the character being drawn more attractive after having a cartoon makeover. The characters run off quirks and the plot lacks in meaning and depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe slightly unique, light romance of Princess Jellyfish is without a doubt the strongest thing it had going for it. The quirkiness presented at the start from both sides, along with the side characters involved, created for a situation where a potentially interesting romance could have begun. Although it continued to be the show's strong-point after the start, things quickly began to damper as the writer decided it would be best for the characters to stick to their roots and have their personalities almost literally be their quirks, letting events and situations lead the way. The main character is brought down in this lack of attention to development, and by the end of the show you're left with the same self-insertable character with just the upgrade of a chance at love. That love, in particular, forming without any sense of the word \"natural\". Explaining in a way not to make the entire series feel empty by revealing the love triangle plot, both male leading characters in question lead generally purposeful lives in which they would have no reason to feel desperate about their love lives. However, upon their run-down with the main female, things clearly change to her liking.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an anime with some western movie industry influence, only in references, than this show has some of that. If you want a slice-of-life series with quirky comedy and awkward situations, this show has that. If you are looking to be at least somewhat emotionally invested in either plot or characters, wanting something to ponder about or something to surprise you, than this show beyond the first episode is likely not what you'd appreciate watching.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing taken care of in Princess Jellyfish. The show grabs the term \"slice-of-life\" and takes it to heart, fueling its uniqueness off of character quirks that are admittedly unique in that they can't all be defined by the most generic of archetypes. The story is devoid of plot goals and development, as the ending feels but a few paces ahead of the beginning. Solutions to problems come at the ding of the microwave, and characters are taken straight out of the fridge to be eaten raw. Does that sound like part of your diet?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI double-dog dare those who are about to click \"not-helpful\" to discuss first. I'm always open.",

            "content": "When looking into this anime, it\u2019s like looking into an anime version of a fairy tale, which sort of involves a princess or a princess-like character and also a fairy godmother-like character, but unlike a fairy tale (or at least, any fairy tale that\u2019s been infected by Disney sooner or later), this one is going to be sugarcoated, especially when dealing with the stages of being awkward around different people and the way you act around them.\r\nAmamizu-kan, an old boarding house in Tokyo, is the home of The Sisterhood \u2013 a group of otaku women of various stripes who shun The Stylish and men ingeneral. Tsukimi, a jellyfish fanatic, is the latest addition to their ranks. One evening a strange Stylish woman helps her out and she brings the Stylish home with her...only to discover that \u201cshe\u201d is a \u201che.\u201d Despite her pleas, Kuranosuke, the disenchanted cross-dressing son of a prominent political family, sticks around, finding himself more and more fascinated by The Sisterhood in general and Tsukimi in specific. When unscrupulous developers begin to eye Amamizu-kan's location, Kuranosuke realizes that there is more at stake than just a building, and sets out to galvanize its residents to save their way of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the whole \u201ccoming out of your shell\u201d type of story when a person who has a different outlook on life wants to help them not only with experiencing life outside their comfort zone, considering that they are going to need it since their home is on the verge of being wrecked. As for the romance aspect, I did sort of sense that the main characters Tsukimi & Kuranosuke would have their relationship to grow but to me, it was never towards the \u201clovey-dovey\u201d type of relationship but more like a \u201cclose friends\u201d relationship and I thought it was great that they stuck it to that. As for the side story with Kuranosuke\u2019s brother, it didn\u2019t went anywhere at all with him having a crush on Tsukimi, only to ended early with the one character Inari, who\u2019s the one that\u2019s after Amamizu-kun and the very textbook definition of the word \u201ccold bitch\u201d, gets involved plus, his brother Shu isn\u2019t that interesting of a character or even that memorable unlike Kuranosuke himself, who was one of my favorites in the show for being the motivator of Tsukimi and the other women in the sisterhood. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Tsukimi, she is portrayed as a sweet but very awkward and often an easily weirded-out character with his unique interests in jellyfish and drawing them ever since she saw them with her late mother. The other tenants in the building also have their unique personality about them with the acting landlady Chieko collecting traditional Japanese clothes and dolls, Banba is into trains, Jiji into older men and Mayaya is a fan of Three Kingdoms and unfortunately out of all of them, Mayaya is the most annoying character on this show, mainly because while she\u2019s very animated, all she does is act like a neurotic fangirl and not the kind that would be fun to hang out, but the kind that rages about everything and everybody so much, you want to pop an synapse after just to calm down.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this gets a little rough around some of the character movements and designs. Brains Base, the guys that brought you Baccano! & Durarara!! , has made some good animation in their past works and for this, it\u2019s more like when Durarara began to show its budget problems during the second half but then again, this is an 11-episode anime, so I shouldn\u2019t expect much of a grandiose amount of animation, but it is typical of Brains Base\u2019s style of animation and it was good to say the least. The music is very appealing to most of the show with its comical style to some of the scenes to the light dramatic moments in there. Plus, the opening and ending themes are quite addictive to listen to, especially the opening sequence where it parodies or pay homage to most movie franchises like Star Wars, James Bond, The Seven Kingdoms, Singin\u2019 in the Rain, Mary Poppins, etc.\\n\\n\r\nFor the FUNimation dub, this was one of those dubs that didn\u2019t sound so usual. Usually, I yawn at FUNimation dubs, not that they\u2019re bad (they make good dubs) but they\u2019re not that special to begin with. I did liked Maxey Whitehead\u2019s performance as very sweet and genuine although it is strange hearing her as a lead female character since most of her roles have been androgynous sounding boys. Josh Grelle did convince me that Kuranosuke was an actual girl at first and even though I find Mayaya to be annoying, Monica Rial plays the role and her voice much differently than she used to, it sounded more lower than her standard of voicing characters. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: The show is actually worth watching around the first chance you get. Some of the humor can be charming and unique up to an extent although I hate that it ended on a lousy cliffhanger, which mean it\u2019s one of those \u201cread the manga\u201d endings. It\u2019s something you would either want to rent or own the DVD to.\\n",

            "content": "I would like to preface this review by warning ya'll that this anime suffers from Ending in the Middle of the Manga Syndrome. If you've enjoyed an anime like Fruits Basket, Ouran Highschool Host Club, Soul Eater, Kimi Ni Todoke, etc. and felt a little uneasy by the inconclusive ending and then googled your uneasy feeling and discovered the manga is like 80 chapters ahead of where the anime left off - you're going to run into the same situation here. Clear your to-read list, because Princess Jellyfish is going to be a top-priority read for you once you're done this bite-sized series. Then again,if you're made of metal or something and you don't care about having a plot with any resolution, proceed without caution.\\n\\n\r\nSlice-of-Life and RomCom anime are my guilty pleasure genres. I don't always find that they have a lot of substance beyond endorsing really cute teeny-bopper supportive relationships. I've found that a lot of slice-of-life anime fall into the trap of over-emphasizing the romantic sub-plots to the extent that any other story elements are underdeveloped or just plain boring.  In contrast, Princess Jellyfish, like all my favourites in the genre, brings something new and insanely interesting in all aspects of its plot. Even the shoujo elements - where one character stares bleary-eyed at the stars and contemplates feelings - aren't in your face. This might not make sense, but the plot mutes itself in such a way that all of its features shine(???) \\n\\n\r\nThe only word I can really use to describe how well this anime shines out would be 'character'. The show literally oozes character from its every inappropriate crevice. The actual characters are unique and varied, ranging from flamboyant and confident to wacko or sweet or mature, but every single one of them is fucking hilarious. Granted, a lot of the main characters can be difficult to relate to, but they'd make for some poor outcasts if the audience were able to instantly project themselves onto their favourites. They're all likable, regardless. \\n\\n\r\n Even the character designs are super innovative (I hate to use that word, but it's the best I've got. Sad face), I can't gush about the designs nearly as much as I'd like: they're all so different!! And they suit each character's personality so well!! GUSH.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really caught me off guard was how mature Princess Jellyfish was, too. \\n\r\nLike, one of the main love interests is a heterosexual drag-queen who helps build confidence in young women. *SPOILERS* There's a male character who is kind of almost date-raped by one of the female antagonists. The overarching plot focuses on the implications of changing infrastructure on the lives of a city's residents. PARENTAL LOSS. SOCIAL ANXIETIES AND SELF-CONFIDENCE IN YOUNG WOMEN. GENDER AND SEXUALITY. I have absolutely no idea how this anime can be so unassumingly smart but lighthearted. It's impressive and it makes me happy.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to make a complaint, it would be that the score wasn't particularly stand-out. That's it. Everything else was enjoyable and cool. If you're itching for a slice-of-life gem, this one's for you!",

            "content": "Originally I didn't plan on watching this. It wasn't something that I felt like I could possibly get into. My close friend was speaking so highly of it one day I decided to give it a try for myself and it was love at first sight. Literally, when I saw the opening sequence is when I fell in love with this anime. I know I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover but this anime has not failed me yet. \r\nA wonderfully beautiful story about some single, virgin, otaku women who all have their own unique obsession. little did they know their world would becompletely flipped around by a vibrant and  androgynous spoiled kid, generous and with good intent he will introduce them to a world outside of their protective shell which is their dwelling. \\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is mediocre. It all depends on what you would classify as \"art\" this show is artistic in more ways than just visually. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound track so far is fantastic, as stated above, I fell in love with the opening theme instantly. The ending theme also has a certain appropriate feel to it if you know what I'm saying. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are wonderfully constructed. Not sure if this is good or bad but I can kinda relate to them in more ways than one(ahem....minus the NEET part). I find myself being attracted to how adorable tsukimi is and I think she is the perfect protagonist to this series. \\n\\n\r\nI wait for this show to come out every week. This weekly release of this show is really the highlight of my day whenever I see it. I have yet to watch an episode that hasn't made me crack up laughing or gush at how adorable the characters are sometimes :) \\n\\n\r\nOverall I believe this anime is absolutely one of the best anime's I've had the pleasure of watching in a very long time. The conclusion to this anime will be bittersweet, I want to see how it will finish up, but at the same time I wish I could watch it forever. I really hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do.",

            "content": "Kuragehime is one of these romantic comedy anime series where, on first glance, tries to be refreshing by introducing a completely unorthodox premise along an atypical cast of characters and only end up a bit lacking, and while I still think that this is the case, the great direction that it had with it's great energy overshadowed it's weaknesses.\r\nThe energy in this series is just, palpitating. Every episode is refreshing to watch and there is no dull moment. The interaction between the cast of characters is extremely entertaining and its slapstick comedy never ceases to make me smile. Moreover, there are cliffhangers in virtually everyepisode of the series until the last one which keeps the viewer on the edges of the seat. That does not mean that the cliffhangers are good ones though. The conclusion of these cliffhangers were quite predictable on the second half and the conclusion to the cliffhanger of the penultimate episode was just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in the first half of the series is really good. It really had this perfect blend between romance and comedy and neither never feels too heavy. Though this changed on the second half. The comedy became less consistent and the drama sometimes felt a bit too heavy but always tolerable and interesting, in the sense of wanting to know what will happen next, to watch. Moreover, one could really see that the creators were trying to put the maximum things possible on the final episode and even though the chain of reactions remained natural, the pacing however started to feel very rushed and sometimes stepped out the boundaries of time.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, its cast of characters are both pleasant and entertaining to watch, not to mention that each character has a personality of his/her own. This really creates a colourful atmosphere where each personality clashes with one another. However this itself is its own downfall because the short amount of episodes restrained the bunch from being decently developed. Indeed, until the end it is as if the inhabitants in Amamizukan did not develop at all: nobody passed her fear of stylish people along her prejudice thoughts regarding them. Mayaya remained annoying, Juon is still trapped in her dark room and Banba is always afro-licious. Moreover, many of them feel so mono dimensional that they seem to be exaggerated caricatures of modern otakus. Which is not the glorified, sympathetic characters shown in some anime but rather judgemental people who only believe on their own words and delude themselves into thinking that they actually fit the norm, and the rest of us not so much.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the setting, it really remained safe throughout the end. The creators just basically threw the Amars on some unknown place to see their reaction. This is extremely safe because the reactions always tend to be either funny or exciting, the latter is usually used as a cliffhanger. And I am quite happy with this considering that the series is too short for them to be quite experimental with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals here are very beautiful, with Kuranosuke being in a different dress a lot of times in a single episode. The animation though, not bad is still far from being perfect. Sometimes, not frequently there tend to some still frames. Forgivable though.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is constant, not good nor bad, just average. I love the OP and ED songs. Both of them were catchy and I actually find myself chain listening to them. The OP song fits Tsukimi's character while the ED song Kuranosuke's goal on making her feel more confident. The instrumental music though is nothing too remarkable, which is understandable considering what gave the series its life what its cast of characters and fast pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe replayability of this series, like for any other noitamina anime series is really high.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Kuragehime remains a favourite romantic comedy anime where the interaction between its atypical ensemble really masks its weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nStory/plot: Simple and quirky. Nothing that stands out though. 82.5%\\n\\n\r\nStorytelling and pacing: Again, 11 episodes is just too few and the pacing felt very rush on the final episode. Other than that its fast pace gave it a very energetic feeling to it. 87.5%\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters, however mono-dimensional they were, are really fun to follow and their energy kept the series dull-free. 90%\\n\\n\r\nSetting: Very safe, does not stand out but does not disappoint. 80%\\n\\n\r\nVisual and animation: very good visual albeit some still frames. 85%\\n\\n\r\nMusic: While the instrumental music was nothing special, the OP and ED songs were both catchy: 85%\\n\\n\r\nReplayability: HIGH . Can be replayed a multitude of times without it getting dull. 95%\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 86%/100% (pretty good) (MAL does not let me do this kind of rating scheme.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommended?: Yes\\n",

            "content": "The best word to describe Princess Jellyfish would be adorable, but that would be doing the show a disservice. Yes, it is very, very cute. Yes, it's sweet. Yes, it's shoujo, but it's not all pink and sparkly eyes. It's endearing and heartwarming without being cavity inducing.\r\nWhen I first started the show, all I could think was it was Tumblr: The Anime. A group of socially awkward women (who met online!) live together in an apartment building they've nicknamed \"The Nunnery\". Our main character, Tsukimi, is the youngest of the Sisterhood and has moved to Tokyo to become an illustrator. She's the least bizarre ofher roommates, but she's still completely and utterly obsessed with jellyfish and can't talk to \"Stylish\" people or boys. Eventually, she meets Kuranosuke who just happens to be a stylish boy. He pushes her to experience new things and champions saving the apartment building in which she lives.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, after Kuranosuke came on to the scene, I was worried that the show would focus on changing Tsukimi into a \"Stylish\" person ala The Wallflower because \"all girls want to be pretty! Right?!\". This was particularly troubling because Tsukimi and the other members of the stisterhood, LIKE the way they are. There are some social anxieties they'd like to iron out, of course, but they know what makes them happy most of the time and they do it. My next concern (again, thanks Wallflower) was that this show would turn and focus on boys.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, I was wrong on both accounts! Kuranosuke does give Tsukimi and her roommates (except Chieko, the kimono wearing Japanese clothing enthusiast, she's also the heaviest character so the fact that she gets to be beautiful just the way she is, in anime no less, is awesome) makeovers, but they are for very specific reasons--like going to a political meeting. The message wasn't to try to change them, but to teach them how to use social conventions to their advantage. If you show up to a formal meeting in sweats, no one is going to take you seriously. If you're trying to sell things in a trendy area like Harajuku, you have to look trendy. It was no different than you or I dressing professionally for a job interview. When the task was over, everyone went home and went back to doing what made them comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Kuranosuke did was get them out of the house and--in Tsukimi's case--give them the tools to not be crippled by their anxieties and run away.\\n\\n\r\nEventually (and predictably) we see Kuranosuke fall for Tsukimi. Interestingly, though, he's not just interested in her when she's made up and beautiful. And of course she's beautiful in fancy clothes and make up, this is shoujo. But rather when she's talking about the things she loves. Jellyfish Princess subverts the old trope of \"girls are more beautiful when their in love\" and applies it to their interests. Kuranosuke stares longingly at Tsukimi even when she's in her braids and glasses, as long as she's talking about something she loves. Usually, she's talking about jellyfish.\\n\\n\r\nThe good:\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the art. I don't know how impressive it is by usual modern standards, but it reminded me a little of Studio Ghibli (drawing wise, not animation) and the stylish women were drawn with these big amazing retro-shoujo curls and the fashion was very Ai Yazawa. The character designs weren't exactly inspired, only one of Tsukimi's roommates has a face to speak of, but they do have different body types, which is great. Visual gags were effective, funny, and not over used or grating. You will find yourself laughing aloud.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was spectacular. Every voice actor was great, especially Mitsuki Saiga as Kuranosuke. The OP and ED were delightful, and the background music was jazzy and perfectly fit the eclectic, quirky feel of the show. I'm pretty sure Kuranosuke's theme even had lyrics!\\n\\n\r\nIt was great to have a cast that wasn't made up of high schoolers. Everyone is an adult, with most characters in their thirties. Tsukimi and Kuranosuke are the youngest at college age. There were a few extremely well developed characters, Tsukimi was a perfect portrayal of a geeky girl. If you're on this site, I'm sure you'll see some of yourself in her. Kuranosuke's brother Shu was fascinating. Kuranosuke himself was extremely complex and gives you A LOT to think about, and the portrayal of the Japanese prime minister as a ridiculous lunatic who can't get his approval ratings out of the single digits was unexpected and scathingly brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nOn most accounts, the show can be called progressive and even feminist at points as characters subvert some gender stereotypes, but certainly not all. There is a male transvestite (who is probably gender queer based on his back story) and this isn't played for laughs nor is he a stereotype. And a man who isn't the transvestite is sexually assaulted by a woman, something that is rarely depicted. Again, this isn't played for laughs and the man in question was shown to be very troubled by the incident.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\\n\r\nThe ending leaves several plot lines dangling. In a way that's good because the final scenes focus on Tsukimi being more confident in herself and not on which boy she ended up with, but I still want to know what happens! There is a plot line that is relevant at first, then becomes irrelevant, BUT JUST KEEPS GOING FOR NO REASON. I'm not sure what it was trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not vital or anything, but it is worth pointing out that Tsukimi's roommates don't get any more depth past their obsessions. Kuranosuke's chauffeur gets more characterization than this. That said, they do serve their purpose, so it's up to you whether this is a pro or con.\\n\\n\r\nThe Madonna/Whore Dichotomy is strong in this one. Obviously, Tsukimi and the Sisterhood are virgins. They're presented as funny or cute. They're \"good\" characters. The only other named woman in the show is the antagonist, a career mogul aptly named Inari, who gets what she wants by having sex as bribes or having sex for blackmail material. This isn't too bothersome because Inari isn't bad because she has sex. She's bad because she does it for ulterior motives, but the over sexualized female villain is a sad trope to play in a show that's so innovative in other places. It would have been nice if we had one more named female character who was sexually active and still got to be \"good\".\\n\\n\r\nActually, the show handles the whole topic of sex pretty poorly. It is automatically assumed that any character who is uncomfortable around the opposite sex is a virgin, and two characters who are *THOUGHT* to have had sex with each other are treated like they're in a relationship. Because, you know, that's the only time sex happens/the only out come of sex.\\n\\n\r\nThe cross dressing character declares that he is \"normal\" in a way that definitely means \"not gay and not a pervert.\"\\n\\n\r\nOk, so that's a lot of talk about sex, but it's actually not a big deal in the show itself and, aforementioned assault aside (which isn't shown past something being slipped in a drink and then the guy waking up), the show is totally innocent.  I don't even remember an on screen kiss. This isn't a con, I just want to point it out incase I scared some one away. \\n\\n\r\nI love Kuranosuke to tiny little lip gloss covered pieces. He's my favorite character in the show, but he's also the most problematic. He has his own not socially acceptable obsessions that would make him just as much of an otaku as the Sisterhood, but this is never commented on, presumably because he presents himself to the world in a physically attractive manner. Also, at the END of the series, after spending significant amounts of time with the other characters, he sometimes shows little regard for their interests, going so far as to expect Chieko to sell the dolls she loves while saying he would never sell his clothes.\\n\\n\r\nAs I pointed out earlier, there is a scene where a character is sexually assaulted--he is drugged, brought to a stranger's house, undressed, touched (not sexually, but still spooning with an unconscious, unwilling person is not cool), and has photos taken which are used to blackmail him. The woman who did this is never punished. If that sort of thing bothers you, be warned. There are also a few instances where characters, both male and female, are slapped or kicked in a way intended to hurt them but adds nothing to the plot but some icky feelings.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately:\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Jellyfish is a wonderful little story that's original, interesting (I didn't mean to watch it all in two days!), and actually has some pretty great things to say.\\n\\n\r\nIt should appeal to people who like shoujo without all the focus on romance, slice of life (though it isn't this-- it has a definite plot and goal), and anyone that wants to see a good! new take on otaku culture, or if you just want to watch a really funny show.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it based on just how endearing it is, and the characters of Tsukimi and Kuranosuke alone.",

            "content": "I was able to watch back-to-back episodes of Princess Jellyfish with ease, which is often something I cannot do (I'm not much of a marathoner concerning TV shows or movies). This show was definitely entertaining with a very cute premise, but there are some problems with it that I think keep it from being great. I would be curious to read more of the manga to see how it compares.\r\nA real brief summary of the show (if you're interested) is that a young woman by the name of Tsukimi Kurashita is the newest tenant in an apartment building filled with fellow otaku or nerds. Eachof the girls in the building has an overwhelming passion for their main interest or hobby, and it is a well known rule that no men are allowed inside the building. One day Tsukimi meets one of the \"Stylish\", who happens to be a guy named Kuranosuke who crossdresses. An interesting friendship (and maybe even something more) begins to form between these two characters, and Kuranosuke works hard with Tsukimi and the other tenants to raise money to save the apartment building.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said previously, this show is certainly entertaining and held my interest, so I believe it is worth a watch. I am disappointed however in how the plot was executed. Perhaps this is due to the small 11-episode nature of the series, I'm not sure. I feel that there was a lot of potential for more character growth, which is never seen. It would have been nice to have seen Tsukimi and the tenants slowly begin to be more confident and involved in their community. I also would have liked to have seen Shu's character explored more.\\n\\n\r\nI very much disliked the relationship between the character Shu and the landshark lady. She sexually harasses Shu, leads him to believe they had sexual relations (when they didn't), and threatens him with blackmail. The reason why this bothered me so much is that you never see for sure if Shu has learned something or grown from this terrible experience. Instead of confidently standing up for himself he still unnecessarily reaches out to the woman throughout the series. (SPOILER SPOILER) At least at the end he appears to walk away from her in embarrassment of the whole situation. This scene could be very easily interpreted differently however. I think I could have accepted this portion of the plot more if some sort of character development came of it (because sometimes bad things do happen), but I do not see that here.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is very fun, alluding to many pieces of pop culture. I enjoyed the art style and slightly muted color scheme too. This show is a little frustrating because I feel that it has so much untapped potential.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion is that this is an enjoyable watch, but I was certainly not blown away or moved like some other slice-of-life series I've seen. I would recommend this, but with some reservations.",

            "content": "As an adult male that grew up watching shonen action and mecha series, you would expect Kuragahime/Princess Jellyfish would be the last series I would watch, much less become a favorite. And yet this brief but wonderful series crept its way into my heart as I found myself watching every episode, each ending with a smile on my face and a warm, fuzzy feeling in my chest.\r\nStory: 9\r\nEvery episode has a nice pacing. The happenings of them keep you engrossed so much, that by the time it's over, you'd think it was too fast. It ends at a mere 13 episodes, but each episode feltlike it packed the maximum amount of content without feeling overloaded. Princess Jellyfish does a great job of not treading through the same shoujo trail of hokey, melodramatic writing, and instead has something more down to earth and believable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nFrom the moment you watch it, Princess Jellyfish's artwork already sets itself apart from its shoujo contemporaries. Every character is distinctive looking, for starters. The backgrounds are also nicely done and \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing bad but nothing truly outstanding here. The opening and ending sequences however do have a great choice in music, and the homages to other series is apparent and very well received. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 15\\n\r\nThe shining jewel of Princess Jellyfish is undoubtedly its characters! All of their characteristics and personalities are just as distinctive as their looks. Character interaction does a lot in carrying the plot of the series, and it is done masterfully. Their awkwardness is outshined by their believability, as each character has a layer added to them as the series progresses. I couldn't help but love all of them, flaws and all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nPrincess Jellyfish is entertaining from start to finish. Seeing these painfully awkward characters wrestle their way through life's challenges was entertaining, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere just isn't enough publicity on this series, and it really deserves more! If you like slice of life series that revolve around otaku, there are very few that hit closer to home than Princess Jellyfish!",

            "content": "I actually really like this, its way different than anything I really saw. A lot of people do a lot of otaku outcasts but this one has a little different vibe to it. The characters, though their names are hard to remember, are remember-able for how out there and crazy they are. Each one is a otaku in their own way and have different ways of showing it whether it is being crazy about kimonos, to posting old men\u2019s pictures into a scrap-book. A little creepy, but it\u2019s not as bad as it seems. The guy is really cool even if he cross-dresses but heseems normal otherwise. The underlining story is pretty much being true to yourself and never give up on your dreams.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is wonderful even if it lacks in some places. It mostly does this when you look between the two \u2018worlds\u2019 and depicts Tsukimi\u2019s world and Kuranosuke\u2019s world. It\u2019s not all that bad, but once in a while when the two worlds meet, it\u2019s sometimes a bit harsh of an art style. I really love the designs of the jellyfish and how they actually have a few facts about jellyfish that are supposedly real. I don\u2019t care much too actually look them up but they sound real so its ether true or the actor is rather good at making it sound true. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the most part is well done. The English is a little bothersome though I really like the cute voice of Tsukimi and Kuranosuke. I\u2019m not so fond of one or two of the characters in the apartments and it made me cringe the first few times I heard them. Now along the way, I ether got used to it, it got better, or I just didn\u2019t even care about what they sounded like because the story was just so good!\\n\\n\r\nAll together, it was funny and sweet. Really, if you want funny, This is it! Sadly, it has a very bad cliff hanger right now and I really want to see more! It does make me want to read the manga now but something really tells me that this is better as an Anime then the manga. \\n",

            "content": "There are a couple of good Otaku community Anime's out there, but \r\nnone have Kuragehime beat in the sheer absurdity of the fan \r\ncommunity.  As the name implies, the main character, the \r\njellyfish princess, is utterly taken by jellyfish.  She lives in \r\na \"nunnery\" so named because the residents are female outcasts \r\nthat hate all things fashionable and hip, and regularly curse the \r\nexistence of men.  The other residents are obsessed with trains, \r\nold men, Kimonos, and Romance of the 3 Kingdoms.  \r\nJellyfish girl, Tsukimi, meets a fashionable girl one night who \r\npersistently insists on staying over.  Uneasy already witha \\n\r\nhipster, Tsukimi learns in the morning that the girl is actually \\n\r\na transvestite.  He becomes taken with the nunnery and Tsukimi, and \\n\r\ndecides to visit regularly to the Chagrin of the other residents.  Kuragehime is \\n\r\nalways sweet and endearing the way Otaku community stories like \\n\r\nGenshiken or Doujin Work tend to be, but the plot changes focus \\n\r\nfrom romance to keeping the nunnery safe, and the ending gives an \\n\r\nanticlimactic (though thoroughly amusing) conclusion to both.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Jellyfish girl, Kuranosuke the crossdresser and \\n\r\nperhaps one other character, the cast is merely gag fodder, \\n\r\nflaunting their ridiculous obsessions constantly.  For example, \\n\r\nanytime a location is mentioned, the train girl will mention what \\n\r\nline that location is near.  The 3 kingdoms girl will also make \\n\r\npoor analogies of what is happening to events in the epic.  You \\n\r\nnever get to know their hardships or struggles with their social \\n\r\nproblems.\\n\\n\r\nTsukimi and Kuranosuke, in complete contrast, have very \\n\r\nheartwarming stories tied to the loss of their mothers.  Their \\n\r\nhobbies remind them of their mothers, and some of the most \\n\r\ntouching moments in the series come from both the happiness and \\n\r\nsadness they feel when they partake in their obsessions.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the romance element is rather weak, and when it \\n\r\ntakes center stage the series drags.  Tsukimi has a potent \\n\r\ncupid's arrow, love at first sight reaction that somehow gets way \\n\r\nmore emotionally involved than a crush.  She runs off crying when \\n\r\nshe thinks a guy she hasn't shared 3 or 4 sentences with might \\n\r\nnot have feelings for her.  She may be inexperienced in love, but \\n\r\nit will probably be hard for anyone who's gotten past the 7th \\n\r\ngrade to see this as the pinnacle of heart break and romantic \\n\r\ndrama.  The best romantic moments are the awkward ones that are \\n\r\ntouching and funny at the same time, but they are few and far \\n\r\nbetween.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is fluffy looking, with light, slightly faded \\n\r\ncolors like one piece or Paradise Kiss.  The characters have the \\n\r\nfull lips but not the sharp faces typical of shoujo/josei Anime.  \\n\r\nThe fashion choices might be eccentric and odd for real life, but \\n\r\nare beautiful to look at in animation.  I'm not really sure how \\n\r\njellyfish could be any sexier than they are in Kuragehime either. \\n\r\n This is definitely a pretty series.\\n\\n\r\nKuragehime is stuck somewhere between a melancholic slife of \\n\r\nlife, a romantic drama, and a heartwarming otaku expose.  The \\n\r\nending doesn't really tie it all together, but it's entertaining \\n\r\nenough at 11 episodes.\\n",

            "content": "Immediately getting on my good side, Higashimura's distinctive character designs work wonders for this series where other artists might not have even given it a second thought. The residents of the Amamizukan don't look like your typical anime girls, they're not designed to be beautiful or attractive and this helps to make their awkwardness all the more believable, but they're not repulsive either. There's still enough charm to them that they can be quite cute at times, and when Kuranosuke gives them all makeovers they take on a much more conventionally appealing aesthetic while still remaining completely recognizable. Brain's Base doesn't slack in the animationdepartment, either; movements are mostly pretty fluid, albeit with some occasional hiccups, and show's overall art design is welcoming. The color scheme for this show in particular is incredibly warm, bright and inviting, with plenty of flourish to keep it visually engaging. On a whole, this is a shining example of what the studio can achieve both technically and artistically, brimming with panache and enthusiasm. It looks great.\\n\\n\r\nThe music exists, I guess. I think they were going for a big city feel, like a tribute to some of those rom-com flicks set in New York (why is it always New York?) and it pulls this off competently, but never really goes above and beyond. There's the playfully seductive piano, a little jazz, what sounds to be the clarinet accenting its more low-key moments, but it's hardly exceptional and even in execution there are some moments where it could have been handled better. There's one scene in which Kuranosuke is struggling to come to terms with the possibility that he's fallen for Tsukimi, while Tsukimi is confronting her own insecurities. In between all of this, the Sisterhood realizes that Kuranosuke's boobs are fake but assume he's just a flat-chested woman. This is an emotionally complex, tonally diverse scene, and it would have worked a lot better if the music dipped and swelled to match these different moments instead of just running a gentle contemplative piece over the entire thing. It's a passable soundtrack but certainly nothing to write home about. The opening and ending theme, however, are both excellent and neither is worth skipping over.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the Japanese track is top-notch across the board, able to handle both the show's comedic and dramatic sides with finesse, and I guess that's all that needs to be said about it. From what I've heard, the general reaction to the dub for this series has been overwhelmingly positive, but I could see it potentially making some viewers uncomfortable. This has nothing to do with the acting, which is generally pretty solid. Heck, Josh Grelle as Kuranosuke is a downright highlight for being able to bounce perfectly between the character's feminine and masculine sides, and talents like Maxey Whitehead, Monica Rial, Leah Clark and Ian Sinclair really do pour all their hearts into their respective roles. The problem I find with the dub--and let me preface this by saying that many of you probably won't mind at all--is in the script, which is peppered with dated colloquialisms and attempts to sound \"trendy\" that ultimately just comes off as immature more than anything. I realize that's part of the joke and I have nothing against liberal, interpretive dubs that focus on preserving the intent of the original dialog rather than the precise content, it's just piled on a little thick for my taste and I could see plenty of other viewers--not just the sub purists--having the same reaction. Give the dub a try, and if you're fine with the first episode it probably won't bother you from there. It bothered me and I still really enjoyed the dub, so maybe I'm just nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does have some dramatic moments and honest themes to convey, but even then it's often tongue-in-cheek so let's start by looking at the humor. The comedic moments in this show can be situational, slapstick, satirical, referential or some combination of these things, and I'm happy to say it's really funny... about two-thirds of the time. What happened to the other third? Well, maybe they were trying to create a warm sense of familiarity, but some of the jokes here get recycled too often and emphasized too much for comfort. The first time Kuranosuke accidentally refers to himself as a boy and Tsukimi goes through her \"oh boy\" cover-up singing routine, it's kinda funny, but this keeps happening with little variation and quickly wears out its welcome. The girls' \"defense mechanism\" of turning to stone in uncomfortable public places and Tsukimi's tendency to jump to the most pessimistic conclusion about everything also get pretty repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nStill, even if a few of its jokes are overused, don't let that discourage you because this show is still pretty darn funny. The girls have a wide variety of wacky quirks and unusual interests and the show isn't afraid to have a little fun at their expense, but unlike some other comedies (I'm looking at you, Big Bang Theory) the show doesn't look down on them for their niche interests and they're still likable and easy to sympathize with. Many of us know what it's like to have an interest few people share--heck, that's kinda what being an anime fan in the West is like. Kuranosuke and his circle add even more comedic juices to the mix while avoiding some easy cliches. There are almost no \"it's funny because he's a transvestite\" moments, which would have been laziest rout to take; instead, the show takes full advantage of all the social barriers and potential misunderstandings that could occur between a male crossdresser and a house full of female otaku, and they all play off each other really well. Kuranosuke's family, friends and acquaintances are all interesting and memorable in their own ways. Ultimately, the jokes in this show work because even though the characters all have their quirks, they're not solely defined by them, allowing the show's humor to flow more naturally. This show loves its characters, and there need to be more comedies like that.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how silly it gets, though, this is a story of strange and troubled people and it never fails to get that across. The show doesn't hesitate to criticize Tsukimi and her friends on some of their anti-social habits, but at the same time it never condemns them from being who they are or loving what they do. As individuals, I have to admit their personalities can be a little sparse. Mayaya is spastic and sees the world as an epic battlefield, Banba is deadpan and has a silly afro, Jiji is shy and likes old men, and Chieko is commanding with a maternal touch, and at times it seems like there's not much to them beyond that. Still, there are moments in the series that make it clear that's not the case, when they step forward to help one another through dire straits. They all enjoy their lives, far more than the well-to-do, \"respectable\" members of society, and when push comes to shove they're looking out for each other. It's little moments like this that really makes these characters likable, I just wish there were more of them. Tsukimi herself is the centerpiece of this group, and the youngest among them--she's fully integrated into their way of life but perhaps hasn't quite forgotten the dreams they all once had, she's grounded enough to realize they probably won't come true but innocent enough to still hope for it.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the show's depth, though, comes from Kuranosuke's side. At the center is Kuranosuke's lack of a sense of belonging, which stems both from being an illegitimate child and from his fascination with women's clothing, which he learned from his mother. Refreshingly, he's fully come to terms with his gender identity: he's a straight man who happens to like dressing as a woman, but the women he's been with up to this point to are from his father's world, the world of the rich and spoiled. Still, his family isn't demonized either. His father and half-brother Shuu both continue to suffer from the affair in their own ways, and they really do care about Kuranosuke. And then there's his uncle, the incredibly unpopular prime minister of Japan, who's more accepting than anyone of Kuranosuke's habit, presumably because he knows the stress of the political world and would rather just enjoy life without worrying what people think of him. This is played entirely for laughs, but that's the thing about this show: almost everything is at least partially played for laughs and it still manages to get all these points across. I'm not even sure whether Kuranosuke's uncle was intended as a satirical statement or just thrown in there to be silly, but the result is equal parts absurd and surprisingly poignant (at least, as a statement; the character himself is just a loon).\\n\\n\r\nSo what happens when these two worlds meet? Where to begin? Kuranosuke starts off treating these girls both as objects of curiosity and as his personal projects; he's fascinated by how different they are, but can't quite wrap his mind around the radically different values they carry or that dolls and jellyfish could be as important to them as fashion is to him. The sisterhood is initially wary of the stylish stranger, and it takes a believably long time for this one-way fascination to develop into mutual respect. Shuu goes through his own arc on the side, and the show does a remarkably good job of balancing all the different sides it presents. If there's one place the drama falls flat, it's the romance. Tsukimi and Shuu become mutually attracted on sight and hardly interact at all outside of a few awkward moments to perpetuate the mutual misunderstandings between them. It's intended to convey both characters' innocence, but there's not enough substance to make it believable. Kuranosuke's attraction to Tsukimi is handled a little better, it'd have to be since they actually get to know each other, but even then it mostly just comes down to him being struck by how \"cute\" she is. There are probably deeper reasons for him being drawn to her, they're just never shown to us and that's a real shame.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakness in the series' romantic relationships stems from a much greater problem. It's a problem that's very common to anime adapted from ongoing source material, I've brought it up in a previous review and I'll most definitely have to bring it up again in future reviews: this series was adapted from a much longer, still-ongoing manga, and the adaptation doesn't feel complete. At the end of the show, the writers decide to slap on an ending that ties up the basic conflict that kept the plot moving along but offers little resolution to the actual character arcs, which are infinitely more important. Given another episode or two, I'm certain the writers could have brought the story to a more satisfying conclusion, or at the very least they could have left the plot open to a second season instead of slamming the door shut the way they did. What we're left with is a bunch of thematic questions and only a handful of answers, so it's a good thing the questions are as good as they are.\\n\\n\r\nWith any luck, a second season will eventually take this series to new heights, and given its acclaim and popularity I suspect the manga will find its way to the West in the near future, but as a stand-alone anime Princess Jellyfish is simply too short. Still, that doesn't take away all the good this anime has to it, even on its own. Here we have a series that speaks to the nerds and otaku of the world without ever making itself inaccessible to wider audiences. It's lovable, funny, clever and insightful and I heartily recommend giving it a try.",

It reminds me of a combination between some older shoujo, and some more obscure stuff I've seen, but nonetheless is high quality and comparable with other great \"art series\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a ten, because I could watch it over and over again, and refer it to anyone I know. On top of that, I can't think of a single flaw, or thing I'd change to make it better. For me, this series meets perfection!",

            "content": "Hi everyone!\r\n\"Kuragehime\"...what a strange synopsis I read until now!\r\nBut I was curious so I decided to read it, even though I'm not a lot into crossdressing, I was honestly interested in the josei \"slice of life\" part.\r\nA bunch of overgrown vergin&otaku gilrs live together in a old building menaced to be destroyed by the typical district renovation which demolishes the old areas to build in new, high palaces and commercial malls.\r\nThe Main character, the jellyfish-otaku girl, meets a crossdressing (but not gay), rich and spoiled boy, who'll become part of the group and who will change things a lot.\r\nSo, what to say?\r\nThis is not, maybe,the best anime of the world, but it's hilarious, brilliant, colorful and very very amusing and if you like different and creative anime you can trust \"kuragehime\".\\n\\n\r\nStory: As I said, nothing striking: little things, a bunch of virgin girls too grown-up to really change but still showing off their best capabilities.  Each episode is entertaining and full of details so you won't be disappointly searching for endless explaination. \\n\r\nI found the plot a bit fuzzy and incoherent in the latest episodes: too many characters to deal with, not enough time to care about them, not enough space to let things happen, an hasty way of handing things. \\n\r\nI suppose this is motivated by circumstances: the manga, which I'm now following, is still ongoing and in \"kuragehime\" they changed it a little to let the story fit with the only 11 episodes. They could just simply follow the main manga lead and wait...sometimes I don't really know why producers are so hasty!\\n\\n\r\nArt: I simply loved this neat, graceful shaped style, very feminine and intriguing. Soft and still not too full to disturb the vision (just as, for example, Gokinjo no monogatari: interesting but too heavy after some time), the brushstrokes are precise, steady but also harmonic. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: interactive, informal and simply funny, I found myself laughing without even knowing it! It's fast and well- done, not a masterpiece but strong enough to let the characters and the story layer over it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: A little stereotypical at first sight, Kuragehime reveals the various world of otakuness, showing different reasons and behaviours of being overly fond of something. Every girl has her own world but they perfectly fit together because they're all out of the real normal world, where only apparences and lies seem important. A very sharp critique to the japanese social patterns,sometimes so strict and uncapable to let people express their true selves with freedom. And the result is this: they shut themselves out in a room with objects/dresses/games/food/animals etc etc , and this is always  too extreme to be lived with serenity. \\n\r\nI didn't really like the male characters, the main is too feminine (but still I'm approving his strong feelings and good nature) and the others are a bit undertone (but still very involving)\\n\\n\r\nMusic&Sound: happy and full of rhythm,a normal but very indicative background.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This series really does show promise, however, the characters do not develop throughout the plot as much I had hoped. The art is colorful, the characters are unique and interesting, and the whole idea of focusing on female otakus is very original. Be warned of some spoilers below.\r\nUnfortunately, interesting stories with potential were skipped around with, with none ending properly. This constant skipping around made the series feel empty and the originality novelty. For example,Tsukimi and Shuu have a cute little romance that went nowhere. Their relationship didn't even have to go in a romantic way, but it has to at least end properly. Tsukimihas a crush on Shuu and Shuu with her, and even though Shuu's seems to be very vain, he does seem to care for her. Then he does little to salvage his chances with Tsukimi when Shouko steps in. Almost immediately, Shuu and Tsukimi never interacted ever again which was dissappointing. I do admit though that this example is a bit biased since I support Tsukimi and Shuu together. Maybe it's the fact that Tsukimi and Kuranosuke, the guy she's supposed to fall for, don't have enough \"together\" moments. The fact that the two are mostly platonic in the end does not help with their romance either. The characters are honestly very unique although they greatly lack development. The genre \"romantic comedy\" doesn't seem suitable because of the lack of a solid romantic plot. The main romance is not even between the protagonist and a main character. The idea of a romance with Tsukimi and a main character exist, but only an idea (and for most, an expectation). Kuranosuke's father cheated on his wife and there is no explanation for it. Truly respectable for a politcan.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is really a lot more critical than I planned, and while I truly enjoyed the series, I am more talented at pointing out flaws. Know that if you decide to look into it, there are many great elements to it such as the comedy, cross-dressing, and characters more people can relate to (Or at least I can relate to them.)",

            "content": "When first reading the synopsis and seeing the anime cover picture I was hesitant to watch this anime. I always make a note however to read some reviews and the rating it is getting. Most of the time a rating of 8 and consists of an anime that for its genre is a truly fantastic anime. Resulting from this I gave it a shot.....and I LOVED IT!\r\nRight from the start I loved all the characters, a diverse environment full of funny, loveable characters. What truly entertained me as a social introvert was how you can relate to most of the characters in the show becauseit is based around a group of \"NEET\" girls who are social outcasts. I mean Tsukimi(the main female character) is outside and couldn't be any more uncomfortable and out-of-play so she ran back to her apartment. I was already in love with this anime, I was laughing half the time and fell in love with all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers around Tsukimi and how she has an obsession of Jellyfish from when she went to an aquarium before her mothers passing. This has stuck with her since. One night, she passes a local fish store to see 2 different kinds of jellyfish in  the same fish tank which can cause one of the breeds to die due to the others secretion. She then informed the store clerk who didn't listen but listend to a beautiful \"HIPSTER\"(YES THEY USE THE WORD HIPSTER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NORMAL) who convinces the man to let her buy the jellyfish. \\n\\n\r\nIt isn't until after this that Kuranoske comes to their apartment(no boys allowed!!!!) that she discovers that Kuronaske is a boy cross-dressing as a female. The story then continues from there with love, and comedy mixed perfectly to bring about great laughter and infinite interest in the show.\\n\\n\r\nPeople rejoice, if you are the type of person who likes a comedy/romance with characters you can truly connect to then this anime is for you. All the females in  this apartment make you laugh your ass off! They all stick together for the common cause that they cannot socialize normally as opposed to others. Resulting from this are continuous scenes that made me wet myself.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the story is there too. I don't want to go into complete detail but rest assured that this anime has a heartwarming story with superb pacing. Every episode gives you that feeling when you have finished all your sweets! You know, that more-ish feeling? It brings me great pleasure when you stumble across and anime like this every here and there because it reignites your reason and passion to watch anime.",

It's done so poorly.

After all, it does sound like any other common romance drama\u2014a young, timid girl accidentally meets a handsome boy who finds her interesting and decides to bother her when all she wants is for him to leave her alone. However, after much thought, Ifound that it was because of this clich\u00e9 that this anime was able to get the audience to truly embrace the unique stories behind both characters.\\n\r\n\tMy favourite part about this anime would probably be how the two main characters were able to comfortably adjust to each other's opposite lifestyles. While one was an anti-social and awkward young lady living off of her pocket money, the other was an eccentric cross-dressing son of a politician. They actually sound like pretty cheesy and overused \"rich boy and poor girl\" character descriptions but the way they played on it was very interesting.\\n\r\n\tKuranosuke would give Tsukimi multiple chances to transform her appearance\u2014as well as the rest of the crew, to be precise\u2014but he didn\u2019t want to change the group\u2019s entire outlook on the way they dressed. Instead, he just wanted them to know how to use the simplest of things, such as fashion, to their advantage. In this case, he made them realize that in order to be deemed as a legitimate resident of Amamizukan, they had to dress seriously. In a literal sense, he wanted them to \u201cdress to impress\u201d. But of course, once the task was done, everyone was allowed to go home to their own comfort zone and return to their normal selves. This, to me, was probably one of the best twists Kuragehime had to offer because it turned an overused scenario from a romantic love story to a lesson that could be be learned by anyone.\\n\r\n\tNow, while the beginning-middle parts were great, I didn't particularly enjoy the ending- it seemed a little too open-ended. I mean, the ending to the two protagonists themselves gave pretty good closure, but there was also this side story involving Kuranosuke's brother and the female landmark developer, and the way they ended that was just...... eh. Nonetheless, since I wouldn't say that I'm interesting in continuing the manga, I'd say the anime did a pretty good job overall.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating: 10 ^_^ Maybe even +1 because the OP and ED were perfect,",

            "content": "Ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9!\r\nStory:\r\nWhat exactly IS the story of Kuragehime? Is it about the imminent closure of the apartment complex the main character lives in? Or is it about the love triangle between her and the two brothers? Or is it about Tsukimi coming out of her shell? Hard to say, maybe it\u2019s about all these things, maybe about none of them. The direction isn\u2019t clear at all, but that is not a fatal issue thankfully. The comedic scenes work regardless of the context and the romantic aspects are at least interesting. On the downside, that\u2019s pretty much it. If we\u2019re talking about a storyhaving flesh on its bones (and I have no idea if that is even a real allegory or whatever), this anime is slenderly built. Certain things, like the older brother romance, suddenly get aborted while others, like the potential sale of the building, lead absolutely nowhere. I get the feeling, that Kuragehime would have been better off being an episodic show than trying to tell a continuous story.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nKuragehime doesn\u2019t have much to show off in terms of special effects, obviously, so the focus is automatically on the character designs and the overall color scheme. For a story grounded in reality, the anime is quite colorful and features a bunch of creative and distinct characters. I liked what they did with Tsukimi a lot, she is not exactly ugly in her \u201cusual\u201d form, more very plain and unkempt. Once she does dress up, she actually looks pretty good. But not too good, that would have been unbelievable. Featuring a pretty boy transvestite also gave the creators the possibility to play around with outfits, which I will not comment on further as I have no sense of fashion whatsoever, but I will say that they were creative with that. This show feels a bit older than it really is, which may or may not be intentional, but it seems a little odd to me. To break all this down into a single sentence, Kuragehime looks fine, nothing special but for what it is it\u2019s absolutely okay.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening song is kinda cacophonic, but it\u2019s so charming that this doesn\u2019t matter and I ended up enjoying and rarely skipping it. Now that I think about it, that was probably intentional. The ending song was also quite likeable, though less morable. All the voices were pretty good and fitting, especially Mitsuki Saiga as the androgynous Kuranosuke. The side characters ended up annoying me after a while, including their voices, but that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with how well they were done. As far as score goes, I didn\u2019t notce anything exceptional.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI already mentioned the side characters, so let\u2019s start with them first. Most of them are one joke ponies, which isn\u2019t bad in itself, but if you expose them too much they really get on your nerves and some of them have this problem going on. Jiji for example is rather harmless, she does have no other character trait besides being into old men, but she only speaks up very rarely. Mayaya however talks a lot, all the time. And it is never funny or doing anything to advance the plot or whatever. In general, I had the feeling the girls were more concerned with keeping up their nerdiness than facing the problems at hand. The only one having anything reminiscent of depth was Chieko. Tsukimi and Kuranosuke on the other hand were much more interesting and likeable. At least they actually did something. They were also quite believable in action and words, having some awkward moments (like we all do), but being somewhat fun to be around, though in very different ways. The brother was a nice guy, but his character development just kinda stopped when the relationship focus went from Tsukimi to that other slut. In total, the main cast is fine, but it lacks the strength to carry the show with a mediocre at best sidecast constantly interfering.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment:\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t have a bad time watching Kuragehime, not at all. But in the end I have to ask myself weather I was really entertained or if I simply wasted a couple of hours with nothing getting stuck. I\u2019m still not entirely sure about the answer to that question. It doesn\u2019t hurt to watch this show, it does have a different approach to female characters, being completely devoid of sexualization or fanservice and having \u201cugly\u201d heroines as well as a transvestite that is not played for laughs or hardcore molesting gay, so if nothing else, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air if you want to escape the titty monsters of most anime. There isn\u2019t much else I can say to recommend it though, except maybe that if you have nothing better to do, you might as well just watch this. A nice show with little to no lasting impact.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n6.4/10",

I thought I was going to end up dropping it, but by the 3rd episode, I was hooked. \r\nThere are many endearing characters in this anime, the utmost being Tsukimi, the main character.  She is just too adorable.  You can't resist sympathizing with her, and I think a lot of us girls who are into anime can relate to her.  The jellyfish theme is unique, beautiful and entertaining.  Also, I really liked that the romance was present, yet subtle, as area lot of other aspects of the plot, such as the pasts of both Tsukimi and Kuranosuke.  Like in any good story, a lot is implied rather than stated.\\n\\n\r\nI was disappointed by Kuranosuke's role.  I picked this anime mostly because it's a gender-bender anime, but Kuranosoke's being a boy does not add much excitement or depth to the plot, although his character is quite likeable.  Although I like the idea of the \"otaku house,\" that the girls stay in, the girls themselves are not likeable characters.  (Excepting Tsukimi.)  They are all very closed-minded, rude and self-centered.  I expected them to mature a little bit over the series, but it didn't really happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was unfulfilling, but, seeing as this anime is so new, I imagine there might be more on the way.  \\n",

(There's also a cute cross dressing boy.)\r\nA lot of people are like that, which makes it relatable. All in all, I really liked the show. Not so much because of the plot or characters because in all honesty they are a little bland and anti-climatic. I really only liked Kuranosuke (the cross dresser) because I felt like he had a more enjoyable personality. All the girls, including Tsukimi, the main protagonist, are sowrapped up in their hobbies, there's no room for anything else.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I liked about this anime was the atmosphere, all the funny moments, and the message: To be ok with liking the things you enjoy. The anime was very sweet and although the ending doesn't finish the story, I think it's worth watching and reading the manga to see it yourself. I think it'll overall be 10x better. Plot, and character wise.",

I was very interested to keep watching. I really enjoy the main characters Kurashita, Tsukimi and Koibuchi, Kuranosuke. I don't really like Tsukimi's roommates at all. But still the show keeps dragging me in. After 5 episodes, the roommates are starting to grow on me but I'm still not quite sure how I feel about them. But overall I thinkit's a very good show. I especially love the opening and ending songs! They are very catchy. ^_^",

            "content": "Back in 2010 when noitamina was on a bit of a streak with constant hit after hit \u2013 especially in the wake of Tatami Galaxy which even I consider to be one of the best anime ever \u2013 Princess Jellyfish arrived and became the breakout surprise in a Fall season that was lacking in hits (Come on guys. Panty and Stocking and Soremachi were fucking hilarious). It was praised for being charming and hilarious, and even now it\u2019s remembered fondly amongst the more elitist section of the anime community in spite of the acknowledgement that its ending was utter shit. Looking back at people\u2019s praisefor the show, I\u2019m realizing that even amongst my more elitist colleagues, there\u2019s a big sense of living in the moment rather than looking at the big picture. Because quite frankly, even if you were a fan, I\u2019d be surprised if you denied that the big picture was utter shit in every way.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the moments are good by themselves. I literally only enjoyed the first episode of this show because it was what I wanted the show to be: a hilariously dark take on otaku fandom ala Revenge of the Nerds or maybe even Heathers. I thought the show would use that as a jumping off point to continue cranking out non-stop jokes or present a smart dark take on how this sort of nerdish behavior is wrong or even a hyperglorification on how being a nerd is cool. Instead, the show reminded me of Kick-Ass and how it promised to be a great modern-day satire on superheroes in the first few minutes, only for the rest of the film to take itself too seriously and devolve into a shitty fighting story with unlikable characters and terrible attempts at humor.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the occasional funny line from Kuranosuke (I also watched this show dubbed, so I had a laugh at his English VA hamming it up), I didn\u2019t laugh once at what was going on. That jellyfish pointing out the obvious got old fast and the Nunz are completely unlikable people who reject society on purpose because\u2026I dunno. I don\u2019t think the show bothered to explain that. Again, I would have been fine with this if the show was going for pure comedy. I love Sabagebu right now and one of the main characters in that show flat-out murdered a bunch of helicopter pilots with her airsoft guns. But the thing is, all the characters in Sabagebu are hyperstylized jackasses where the comedy comes from them being mean to each other. There\u2019s no asinine plot where \u201cwe\u2019re supposed to care that they get booted from their home even though it would be a hell of a lot better for them in the long run\u201d attached to that show.\\n\\n\r\nNot only did Princess Jellyfish think including that plot was a good idea, it proceeded to make it the main focus, which did about as much good to my entertainment as Republicans do to general existence. I\u2019m sorry, but just like how most people don\u2019t care for Maeda\u2019s females because they\u2019re moe crybabies, I don\u2019t care for this show\u2019s females because they\u2019re nerdy cowards.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of nerdy cowards, that\u2019s what the only real \u201chuman\u201d character of the show is as well. Tsukimi is the main character of the show and we\u2019re mostly privy to her thoughts and flaws. Unfortunately, I fail to see why she\u2019s the main character because she\u2019s an do-nothing whiner with a strange jellyfish obsession and an impossible dream to become a princess. Kuranosuke is the one who has to support her every step of the way, but whilst he\u2019s the only character making laughs, I fail to see why he\u2019s so obsessed with her. Sure he eventually starts falling for her (and we have to be told this by him through external monologues, so hoorah for subtlety), but what about before then? Come to think of it, despite the fact that he moves things along, we don\u2019t really get to know much about him at all. So whenever the plot required him to get serious, it came off as weird and stalker-ish.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters like Kuranosuke\u2019s brother and that Shouko chick are so shallow and inconsequential to what\u2019s going on that they\u2019re not even worth mentioning. That stupid love triangle arc literally had no importance to anything in the show and should have been cut out entirely. Especially when the cause of it is because of a plot line reminiscent of She\u2019s All That, which was a flawed concept even back in the 90s.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this ties into the real reason I can\u2019t stand Princess Jellyfish: it\u2019s boring and nothing interesting ever happens. Only one plot line is actually treated as important by the show, but it has no flavor because the subjects at the center of the thing are annoying stereotypes and the ending to it was extremely unsatisfying. The other plot threads like Tsukimi designing jellyfish dresses and such are things that happen in the plot. But that\u2019s all they are at the end of the day: things. This isn\u2019t an exploitation film nor a straight up-comedy. You need things with purpose beyond \u201cit\u2019s entertaining to see girls in the fashion business and blushing around older guys\u201d in order to create substance. To create entertainment. I don\u2019t watch fiction to see series/movie-length sneak previews to something you\u2019re probably not even going to make. I watch it to see something get accomplished, and all that got accomplished in Princess Jellyfish was that being a shut-in gets you rewarded, all girls want to become princesses, and that it\u2019s one of the few anime in existence that gives nipples to men.\\n\\n\r\nYou will not believe how rare man-nipples are, not only in mainstream stuff, but in the anime porno world.",

            "content": "I wasn't told the translated name of the anime until after I had watched some of it, thanks to my sister who thought I might pre-judge the anime for having a feminine name. It didn't make a difference, I watched it anyways and here's what I thought!!\r\nProbably not very impacting to others, but I was honestly moved by the story. You really felt for Tsukimi and understood where she was coming from. She's a girl who has moved to the city and has a very intense obsession with jellyfish. She loves to draw them and knows practically everything there is to know about them. Shelives in a communal living situation with other \"Otakus\" of various things. Mayaya loves 3 Kingdoms, Banba loves trains, Jiji loves---well they all have their obsessions, we'll put it that way. The girls live in fear of the \"stylish\" girls who intimidate them beyond belief, practically turning them into stone that can't speak or move. This is a visual gag in the show, but it's pretty consistent through the whole series. Tsukimi meets someone who sticks up for her early on and it turns out they become very close friends...watch the show for the rest, I don't want to ruin anything!\\n\\n\r\nThe music, especially the introduction, for the show is pretty good. It's something I'd actually listen to on its own which is really saying something. The voice acting on the dub is hit or miss, it really boils down to the characters. Some of them are spot-on (Kuranosuke) while some make you just cringe (Mayaya). I'm not sure if it's poor direction or what, but it was a mixed bag on that, mainly isolated to different characters. The main characters are done well enough to where the show is worth using the dub in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the strength of this show, those being Tsukimi and Kuranosuke. Some side characters like Shuu, Kuranosuke's brother, get a side story and decent screen time, but the bulk is Tsukimi and Kuranosuke. You delve into their psyche a great deal and realize they don't do things flippantly, especially Kura. and his most notable \"quirk\". They have the most depth and make for great interaction with one another in the show. The strong story elements keep their dialogue and conversations fresh, as do some of the other comedic elements of the show which I won't spoil (Oh boy!! lol). Commentary from Clara is also very enjoyable and funny.\\n\\n\r\nI really wish I could say the same about some of the side characters, but they were honestly the weakest part of the show for me. The voice acting may have had something to do with it, but I think I found Jiji the funniest and she barely talked (couldn't really hear her either). Chieko was an interesting character and had some good bits, some more from her would have been good. Banba had a couple of moments of humor, but Mayaya was almost unbearable for me. This may have been in part because of the voice acting, but her character seemed to add very little and an episode where she barely talked was all the more enjoyable to me because of that. Shuu was a dry character, but was used in humorous ways very well. The uncle (Saburouta) had a schtick that I found hilarious, so scenes with him were definitely enjoyable. Yoshio was a very minor character, but shined when he had a chance. I realize the girls had a certain personality type to fulfill, but Tsukimi was just as awkward while being much more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a SoL that felt much different in my opinion, there was a bit more at stake here with the main storyline. It was involving and you watched to keep watching, not just because of the cliffhangers. While there are some loose ends you'd like to see tied in the anime, the ending is still very VERY good. I didn't feel slided, just like I wanted to see more. It's an anime I could watch over again, but the fact that it's so story driven means that it might not be as impacting as the first time you saw it. Still, the comedic gags and other elements make it very humorous. If the voice acting was better across the board, this would have gotten a better rating. The story and main characters is really what carries this anime. Suffer through the other girls and you'll eventually be rewarded for it (\"I got alll dolled up for Uncle!\"). If you like SoL, this is definitely worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nEvery girl is a princess :)",

            "content": "Sometimes life doesn\u2019t go quite the way you envisioned it. Growing up, most of us are littered with rose-tinted hopes and dreams for our futures. But, when the fated day comes, you find yourself not quite measuring up to the ideals you were promised. The disappointment that ensues can drive those people to a life of seclusion, away from the \u201clucky ones\u201d. Kuragehime is an anime about a group of such people; a show about 5 NEET women who found themselves in a rough spot in life and chose to create an impenetrable fortress from which they can look down on the \u201cbeautiful\u201d people, allwhile mooching off their \u201cbaby-boomer\u201d parents, ignoring their duty to society by getting a job, and spending their time and money by feeding their personal quirks and obsessions. But what happens when a beautiful, fashionable \u201chipster\u201d finds a way into their lives and  turns out to be the only one capable of rescuing them from a shared dilemma weighing on them like a bag of bricks?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\n\tAs a fan of other NEET and Otaku-heavy shows like NHK, OreImo, and Genshiken, the premise was immediately interesting to me. To the show\u2019s credit, it keeps its story incredibly fun and engaging throughout with the fast pace of twists constantly being thrown at the viewer. Everything from the revelation of the hipster\u2019s identity, to the blooming love-triangle, and the introduction of the seductive antagonist(among other things) keeps the story moving forward despite the slice-of-life trappings that are littered throughout to fill space. The main problem with Kuragehime\u2019s story is the lackluster ending and its complete failure to deliver on most of the questions and dilemmas that were established. The love triangle, for example, is never properly resolved and the \u201cromantic\u201d connection between the implied couple feels half-baked at best. The big corporate issue gets resolved so quickly and with so little effort on behalf of the characters that it felt as if the author didn\u2019t know where to really go with it or how to resolve it. These and other issues are not criminal or abysmal, but they leave a strange void in your soul, because the show just sort of ends, and you have to deal with it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe good news, on the character end, is that the two main characters are done very well considering the short length of the show. Kuranosuke and Tsukimi brought a lot of life to the events of Kuragehime due to the polar opposite natures of their personalities. Kuranosuke, being the eccentric, ADHD-ridden optimist that he is, essentially makes it his life\u2019s goal to turn a shy, quiet, nerdy little girl into the titular Princess Jellyfish that she always dreamed of being.  The charm exuding from the interactions between these two characters basically ended up carrying the whole show for me, mainly because the other characters are woefully underdeveloped(particularly in the case of Shuu). Confoundingly, this goes double for the other tenants of the house that Tsukimi stays at. Despite being featured prominently in the show\u2019s OP, ED, and just about every episode, these tenants live and die by the single quirk that is meant to represent their \u201cwacky\u201d personalities. It\u2019s endearing at first, but starts to annoy as the show goes on because of my next criticism: the show\u2019s humor is very repetitive. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny that Mayaya really likes Chinese history/Dynasty Warriors to the point of screaming her lungs out about it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny that Yoshio loves his Benz at the expense of everything and everyone else. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny that every time Kuranouske accidentally lets out that he\u2019s a boy, Tsukimi starts screaming \u201cOle!\u201d Hell, I don\u2019t think that Banba liking trains and Jiji having the hots for old men counts as comedy. It\u2019s just sort of random. While these things were perfectly fine and enjoyable the first or second time, you\u2019ll start feeling like the writer ran out of material as you keep seeing the same punch lines brought up again and again and again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n\tIt\u2019s annoying how conflicted I am with this show, because I really, really wanted to like it. I can\u2019t deny that I enjoyed the hell out of it, but at the same time, I can\u2019t deny that there were plenty of moments that left me scratching my head or trying to push back the \u201ccringe\u201d. I can\u2019t even let the presentation carry it for me, because even though the art was crisp and stylish, it didn\u2019t stand out all that much and the music was mostly only serviceable.  Kuragehime is a show that had a lot of potential and, for all I know, the manga might have actually managed to capitalize on a lot of it. The anime, however, failed to do that for me and I can, therefore, only give it a half-hearted recommendation to those interested in trying it.\\n",

            "content": "i dont think a romance slice of life josei anime about a NEET obsessed with jellyfish would have me feeling so conflicted, but it did in every way possible ((((sorry guys this is a long one))))\r\nthe anime centers around the protagonist Tsukimi Kurashita, an aspiring illustrator from southern japan who moved to Tokyo to try to make a name for herself in the industry. ever since she was little she has been obsessed with jellyfish of all kinds and becomes quite the expert, but her love for them turns her into a NEET. she lives in a communal apartment/dorm with 5 other girls she metonline who also are NEETs with various different obsessions: Banba loves trains, Chieko loves traditional japanese dolls and clothes (she is also the present caretaker of the apartment and the daughter of the woman who actually owns the property), Jiji loves elderly men, and Mayaya loves \"Record of Three Kings.\" The apartment also has a female BL mangaka who is a complete shut in and communicates with the other girls via letters sent under her door. \\n\\n\r\nbut all of these girls do have one thing in common: no boys\\n\\n\r\nthe girls have a complete disdain for professionals, hipsters, \"stylish\" people, but above all they hate boys. in comes Kuranosuke Koibuchi, whose identity is initially unknown. she is a tall, thin, pale, stylish girl with plenty of confidence who helps Tuskimi and befriends the other girls in the house, helping expose them to the rest of the world to help them experience how \"the other half is,\" however, Kuranosuke is actually a college student and the youngest son of a very wealthy career political, who takes great interest in cross dressing. \\n\\n\r\nstory (6/10): the story is....interesting. i honestly dont really know how to feel about it because some aspects of it were intriguing but others were conventional. its definitely quirky and the personalities from the other characters really helps spice up what is, at the barebones of it, a very common plot that includes the main character \"coming of age\" in a love triangle. the characters really do most of the work beefing the plot to make it more dynamic and dramatic; if the characters werent done as well as they were i would have probably rated this section much lower. \\n\\n\r\nhow they wrote the ending was also.....interesting. im not trying to spoil the ending but to keep it short: most people HATE cliff hangers or unresolved endings, im definitely one of those people, but a \"cop out\" ending imo might be a little worse than a cliff hanger because it feels rushed and i feel like thats exactly what this anime did. they threw together some sort of last minute plot twist to magically tie up the major loose end and wiped their hands clean of it and called it a day. as im typing this im realizing unsatisfied i was with it\\n\\n\r\nart & sound (7/10): im not really much of an expert on animation, character and sound design, so i really dont have much to say about this anime other than it seemed well animated and directed. the voice acting was really solid and fit the characters well. the character design was also pretty solid. the setting was also pretty good as well. i like how they drew the individual rooms for the girls in detail to help reflect their personalities and interests. the intro and outros were bangers, i actually went out of my way to look up the discography for both artists after the anime was done because i really loved the music.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters (8/10): some characters didnt get as much screen time as i liked or expected. Banba and Jiji were interesting and i thought that the scenes with all of the girls together made all of the characters more enduring and the scene more enjoyable. Kuranosuke's father was another interesting character that was featured who also seemed like they had some potential that was given very little air time. but from the characters that did take up most of the screen time im very satisfied!!! i think that the NEETs are very interesting both in their obsessions and the slight character development that they all had. they made great comic relief too, and that job of being the straight man or the funny guy was bounced around from girl to girl as necessary so the jokes/gags didnt seem too repetitive. i thought that Tsukimi character design was cute and obsession unique but i thought her back story was boring and predictable. i feel like for a main character, you would want something profound and significant, but it was just a standard trope. also i feel like Tsukimi was ended the anime somewhat the same person she was when the anime started. i know 11 episodes is basically no time, but if there is not season 2 then i feel like Tsukimi should have grown more considering she was the main character. Kuranosuke is honestly a more fitting main character. his character design is striking and continually changing, his background story is dramatic and it interlocks with the secrets his family has, and his motives and struggles are nuanced and find their way into the interactions he has with the other characters. he all around was my favorite and tbh i feel like he had the most growth and development throughout. \\n\\n\r\noverall (7/10): like i said in the beginning, the anime was interesting. i liked the motifs of femininity and of the jellyfish. i liked the message that was being sent out being able to love and treat yourself without losing who you really are to social trends. while some of the language was a little offensive about being queer, i did like the idea of trying to normalize male cross dressing, more specifically men getting in touch with their feminine side and treating themselves better (this example was a little extreme but hopefully the themes got across). the characters were different and memorable and the plot did manage to make me giggle at times. if theres a season 2, im definitely down for watching it",

            "content": "At a recent anime convention, I was asked to watch Kuragehime by a friend who professed that it was one of the best anime he had ever seen. Having now watched the entire anime I will admit that, while not the world changer my friend made it out to be, Kuragehime is a charming anime filled with interesting characters and it was completely worth my time to watch it.\r\nStory - 8\r\nThe story of Kuragehime is an interesting one. On the surface it is the tale of a group of societal rejects, each obsessed with a different subject, banding together for safety and protection from theworld around them. They hide themselves away, avoiding contact with anyone who they feel doesn\u2019t fit into their group. They go so far as to ban men and anyone considered \u201cstylish\u201d from their home, but in order to protect this safe home they have created for themselves, they must enter the very world they have tried to hide from. It is here that the story really shines. While the show contains many hilarious moments and kept me laughing, it is the focus on the overarching growth of the characters that really make the story what it is, a feel good tale about an interesting group of women overcoming adversity.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Kuragehime can be quite beautiful. It possesses a different feel than most art I\u2019ve seen in anime. While some of the character designs, such as Mayaya\u2019s and Banba\u2019s,  are quite plain, it seems as though this is by choice as it creates a wonderful contrast with each character\u2019s \u201cstylish\u201d look. Other characters feature multiple designs that really shine especially Kuranosuke\u2019s many looks. The background art is well done with many of the settings being bright and colourful. Also the animation itself is smooth and fluid, especially with the quick and awkward movements that Tsukimi often makes.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9\\n\\n\r\nSound is another aspect of Kuragehime that is well done. The voices really fit the characters from Saiga Mitsuki as the emotional Kuranosuke to Kumai Motoko as the calm Banba. The comedic delivery of each line is masterfully done making sure each punch line is delivered to maximum effect. A special mention has to be made of Hanazawa Kana, in one of her earlier roles, as main character Tsukimi. She manages to perfectly portray each of Tsukimi\u2019s moods from self-disgust to fiery seriousness and even creepy infatuation. The music in the series is above average, but other than an extremely catchy opening song, really isn\u2019t all that noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I enjoyed Kuragehime as a whole, the characters are the one aspect of that I think could not have been better. Each of the \u201cotaku\u201d women who live together has a different obsession and the quirks that come with it. The way that their obsessions pop up in almost every aspect of their lives is a constant source of hilarity. Despite these obsessions, the characters aren\u2019t just stereotypes. As the series goes on, the viewer can see how each of the women grows through the changes that Tsukimi\u2019s friendship with Kuranosuke brings into their lives.  It is this growth that makes each of the characters so interesting. Even minor characters such as Kuranosuke\u2019s brother are given growth as characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 9\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m the first one to admit that I am often quite easy to please. There are few anime that I don\u2019t enjoy a fair bit. It takes something pretty awful for me to dislike it. Despite this I can say that I enjoyed watching Kuragehime more than most anime. The characters were interesting and the story was engrossing enough that myself and three friends had no trouble watching all eleven episodes in one sitting and still, a week later, we find ourselves discussing how much fun we had watching it. It\u2019s the kind of anime that makes the viewer feel good, both for the characters and about themselves. I had a smile on my face while watching Kuragehime and as I wrote this review I smiled again, while I remembered Tsukimi and Kuranosuke\u2019s adventures. If you are looking for a fun anime to spend an afternoon watching then I think you should give Kuragehime a try.\\n",

            "content": "Like Paradise Kiss, Princess Jellyfish is a serious coming-of-age story about a young women thrust into a world of fashion that she doesn't understand, but which she is in some ways very much prepared for. Many of the themes that were explored in that anime are explored here as well, though the degree to which attention is focused on such themes varies greatly. (Two examples: sex isn't a non-issue here, but it's not explored nearly as heavily as it was in Paradise Kiss; likewise, a gender-bending cross-dressing character is given a lot of time here as well, but the exploration of this character's psyche isconsiderably more compelling than that offered in Paradise Kiss.) \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this the better anime (in my opinion) is the character design (and writing), the quality of the animation, and the pacing of the story. Paradise Kiss struggled with creating realistic characters, instead opting to make likable and attractive archetypes the heroes, while giving each one major flaw. The characters here are better rounded (with the exception of of some of the supporting roles, who are mostly just around for laughs and high-energy antics) and *look* more like real people. Most of the cast is women, though they tend to not be your average anime female cast, insofar as looks (and attractiveness) are concerned. Indeed, in a refreshing change of pace, the first time you meet some of them you'll likely mistake them for men. The cross-dressing character is the most effeminate of them all (the 'villain' aside) and also had the most attention from the animators--you'll almost never see him in the same outfit twice, and he moves convincingly in all of them. The animators (and the Japanese voice actor) are to be commended for providing a top-notch characterization of a straight male who prefers to dress like a woman.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the pacing--it's hard to imagine it being much more perfect than this. The overall energy level is high, and the 'fashion' element of the show doesn't kick into full-force until the last two or three episodes. The 'build-up' is wisely spent getting to know the important players in this large cast, and while it may not be as 'serious' as Paradise Kiss, it's a lot more fun, though one subplot involving female-on-male molestation hits some appropriately dark notes. The series does have its fair share of flaws--the hyper-activity of some of the characters gets pretty grating, and I imagine that a lot of people may not much care for the heroine at all. She doesn't support herself financially, leads her life fairly aimlessly, and purposely presents herself to be as frumpy as she possibly can. She also suffers from crippling social anxiety, and is a huge nerd, to boot. All of this adds up to a character who is frequently frustrating, though no one is as frustrated with her as she is. She really worked for me though--she reminds me of myself from about 10 years ago, and I commend the writers for presenting her in this way without sinking to the same levels of emotional manipulation that other shojo anime so frequently do. \\n\\n\r\nIt's all over pretty quickly, and the conclusion truthfully isn't much of a conclusion at all. The central dilemma is solved, yes, but the romantic subplots remain unresolved--and the character development is ultimately very minimal compared to what most people would probably like to see. I don't necessarily think that any of this is a bad thing--but I would not mind seeing this get a second season, either. Recommended.",

I kept it to a minimum but there is a plot synopsis.\r\nI went into this show with next to no knowledge aside from knowing Tsukimi was a NEET and Kuranosuke was a drag queen. I had seen the manga a few times in stores and had heard the name every so often. The cover art always caught my eye I had some time to kill today so I decided I'd watch it.\r\nThe general synopsis is a group of NEET women age 18-30 live in a retro style home. All are otaku and incredibly bad at socializing. Themain character with an interest in jellyfish, Tsukimi, brings home someone she thinks to be a woman only for her to turn out to be a man with an interest in fashion and cross-dressing named Kuranosuke. He tries to help the NEETs come out of their shells while a businesswoman attempts to get his brother, a politician, to side with her in redeveloping the neighborhood Kuranosuke's newfound friends live in. There is also a love square between Tsukimi, Kuranosuke, his brother, and the businesswoman. It's a simple and cliche plot that is resolved quite awkwardly (or in the case of some things, not resolved at all) but I can forgive an uninteresting plot for good characters.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, my biggest issue with the show was the characters. The NEETs don't have much characterization aside from being quirky, socially awkward, and obsessed with something. Most scenes comes down to A) the NEETs being shocked and petrified (quite literally) by their awkwardness or B) the NEETs being quirky as they rant about their obsessions. The same can be said for Kuranosuke and Tsukimi except sometimes their mothers come into the picture and Kuranosuke is skilled socially. I don't need a show with the most well rounded cast of characters out there however, when all the characters are near carbon copies of one another but with different interests and every bit of comedy comes from the same situation that is when I take issue. I would have greatly preferred if the supporting cast were more fleshed out and they had more to their lives. The fact that the cast is quite small only serves to exacerbate this problem.\\n\\n\r\nAll this said, I didn't stop watching and I had an alright time with this show. There were a few cute scenes that I enjoyed and the art and music are fine. I eventually was able to turn my brain off and have a good enough time, even if I found the plot cliche, the comedy repetitive, and the characters flat. I get why people like this show and if you enjoyed it don't let me stop you, but this show isn't for me and I wouldn't say I'd recommend it.",

            "content": "Somewhat of spoilers ahead, not too big.\r\nThis show could have been a 9 or even 10 for me if certain parts had been a little different. \r\nWhat I loved was the concept and the characters. The humor is mature, yet there's some silliness embedded in it that keeps the show light. All the otaku's with their various quirks are very endearing and oftentimes very humorous, and the rest of the characters have their own fleshed out personalities. To me, this isn't like some shows where only a few peoples' personalities are shown. Even the \"villainess\" (spoiler?sorry!) of this show has redeeming qualities; She could becringeworthy and over the top, but still maintained some comedic relief. It was also neat to see the male main character comfortable with his feminine side, which is something a lot of shows/movies, etc do not explore, especially in Western media.\\n\\n\r\nI also love all the jellyfish references, whoever created this show obviously did their research. The show's main female character, Tsukimi, has a believable affinity to these creatures, and it adds a lot of depth to the show (no pun intended!) \\n\\n\r\nAs for what I didn't like...\\n\r\nThere is one part towards the last episodes where one of the male characters just slaps a woman straight in the face, and that just didn't seem necessary. Granted, this woman was really scummy but I just don't see how the male character hitting her made any sense.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if I'm being really picky about things, the main male character kinda seems to be trying to change Tsukimi into something she is really not, and I thought by the end of the story he would come full circle to see that he did't need to change her, and that her true beauty came out when she was truly being herself, in her element with her jellyfish. I don't know, maybe this is covered in the manga, but I haven't read it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this show. The animation was beautiful, it made me laugh, and it gave me the feels.",

            "content": "P R E M I S E\r\nFrom the summary and title, I've heard many people assume that this is a stupid show with no plot and ridiculous, weird, annoying characters. And for your information, those people are partly right. Except this show isn't stupid, rather, it's unique and very adorable for a josei anime.\r\nKuragehime, or Princess Jellyfish, is a slice-of-nerdy-otaku-life-plus-hipster-crossdresser show that I've watched subbed and dubbed (I switched between the two with each episode). Both never fail to amuse me and make me laugh aloud - the characters are so sweet and endearing, the OP and ED sometimes makes me cry inside at howcute and sincere it feels to me, and each episode just takes me on another \"ordinary\" day with Kuranosuke and the Sisterhood (and Shuu of course haha!).\\n\\n\r\nS H O R T C O M I N G S\\n\r\nSome viewers may enjoy watching plot-rich anime with tons of satisfying character development; if that is strictly your taste, you may not like this anime very much. My tastes are like that in music and art, and it varies greatly so I can enjoy several genres and styles. This anime lacks in plot and character development, yes, but there are other things that it offers without a doubt. If you're expecting romance from a josei such as this, then you won't find much, but it is there (quite anti-climactic though) - but, you may find more romance in the manga continuation, which I haven't read yet but will very soon! The art may also be not the greatest things your eyes have feasted upon, considering that we're dealing with \"NEETS\" or \"hikikomoris\" with food obsessions and old-man crushes most of the time, but, well... that leads to the pros.\\n\\n\r\nP R O S\\n\r\nThe characters are so unique and strange, but absolutely adorable. They have these quirks you won't just find in any anime, and they do undergo a bit of development, but they're otherwise static. The art, to me, is simply fitting; it's not too over-the-top, the outfits and hairstyles vary often (but mostly for Kuranosuke), and the animation for it is not choppy and is quite fluid. If the OP and ED were sweets, I'd get a cavity because they are so sweet - the OP's singer has a sweet voice, as if she's talking about her life (and the modern references are plentiful and fun to catch!), and the ED's lyrics make my heart melt at its sincerity and raspy tone like it's begging you to like the parts of you that you don't like. These factors - the likable characters, the art, the animation, and the music - is enough to get me engaged and enjoying this anime quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nC L O S U R E\\n\r\nThis is an anime worth watching, in my opinion. I know even guys who have watched this and were not disappointed or bored with it (e.g. Mitch Grassi, according to a video in SUPERFRUIT - side note, his mention of Kuragehime actually was the first time I've heard of it!). It is sweet, funny, heartwarming, a bit dramatic, and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 40/50 ~ 80% ~ 8/10",

            "content": "Watching Kuragehime felt like a throwback to when I was a little girl and I started watching anime and falling in love with this whole new world. I'd even go as far as to say I regained some of that wide eyed innocence in me while watching it.\r\nI can't explain what is it about this anime that made me feel so warm and happy on the inside, but there's a lot to love. Tsukimi is an amazing lead, both funny and also relatable, without ever feeling clich\u00e9 (which happens /a lot/ in these sort of plots). Kuranosuke is everything I needed in my life ina character, so unique (although I'm well aware cross-dressing males aren't exactly news in anime) and refreshing. The chemistry between these two is what keeps most of us hooked, because you actually get to see both sides perspectives throughout the story instead of a one sided glance at things from the leads perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you fall in love with Kuragehime and you get royally annoyed that it only got 11 episodes when it should have, at the very least, been granted 25. Even with the short amount of air time, the anime doesn't feel unfinished though (for the most part, that is) so you don't have to worry about that. You will want more and you'll probably end up reading the manga to know more (like I will), but I don't think that's a bad thing at all.\\n\\n\r\nPS: on a very, very small note, the one thing I wasn't super into was some of the supporting characters, especially Mayaya. It's just a personal thing, really, but I found her very annoying for some reason. So if there was any cons I had to point out to this anime, she'd be it.",

            "content": "After taking a short break from anime for the past few weeks, I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what I should watch next. I didn\u2019t really have a desire to watch any specific anime, or any particular genre. So I was just looking for anything that was good. While flipping through different anime on trying to find something interesting, I stumbled across Princess Jellyfish (Kuragehime). It peaked my interest because this wasn\u2019t the first time that I had come across this series. I had actually considered watching it in the past, but I decided to watch another anime instead. But, after looking at the synopsis and genres,it turned out to be sort of what I was looking for. A short and sweet slice of life series with interesting characters and some comedy sprinkled in. Once I saw how many people had fallen in love with the series in the past, I was sold. Did Princess Jellyfish live up to the high praise of it\u2019s fans, or was I in for a big disappointment?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nTsukimi Kurashita, is a shy otaku girl who moves to Tokyo in order to pursue her dream of becoming an illustrator. Once she arrives, she meets up with some friends that she met online, who invite her to live in there apartment complex, Amamizukan. In Amamizukan, there is one rule that must be observed above all others: there are absolutely no boys allowed in the building. But that\u2019s not a problem for the women living in this apartment; they\u2019d rather indulge in each of their own nerdy hobbies anyway. But, while Tsukimi was trying a save a jellyfish from certain destruction, she was aided by a beautiful young \u201cwoman\u201d who suggested that she just buy the jellyfish and take care of it herself. After helping Tsukimi carry the jellyfish, tank, and all of the necessary peripherals, back to Amamizukan, \u201cshe\u201d decided to sleep there for the night. The following morning, Tsukimi came to a shocking realization: this beautiful young \u201cwoman\u201d that was helping her was actually young man about her age. \\n\\n\r\nTypically, there are two ways that the \u201cslice of life\u201d part of an anime in integrated into a series\u2019 story. The first way is when an anime has an overarching narrative that embraces the other genres of the anime, such as action, mystery or romance, and has slice of life elements mixed into it. The second way is when a series decides to take the slice of life elements, and make those the main focus of the anime while sprinkling in its other genres like comedy. Princess Jellyfish definitely falls closer to the latter style. This series, like many other slice of life shows, is very character driven. Any overarching story elements come in the form of problems for the characters to solve. This allows the series to really focus on the characters, and how they\u2019re living their lives, while still giving the series a sense of progression.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the story, in and of itself, isn\u2019t all that great. Like I said before, it\u2019s only reason for being here at all is to give the characters something to work for. The quality of the story isn\u2019t helped by the fact that the ending to the major problem presented in the series is\u2026abrupt. Comical, and kind of expected, but abrupt. And I\u2019m specifically saying the ending to the major problem for the series because that was really the only thing that was concluded by the end of the final episode. Several character stories were left totally unfinished. And not just the side characters either; the two main characters still have a lot of things that haven\u2019t really been resolved by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Princess Jellyfish are one of the best, and most interesting parts of the series. But, like the story, the characters in this series have some shortcomings. Our two main characters, Tsukimi Kurashita and Kuranosuke Koibuchi, are the two characters who we\u2019re given the most background information about and who receive the most development. The problem is that neither of their backstory\u2019s or their development is really complete by the end of the series. Sure, we\u2019re able to get a good sense of who they are by the end of the series, but there were so many unanswered questions. And those were issues that plagued the main characters. The supporting characters receive even less development than main characters, and we\u2019re given little to no background information about most of them. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between the characters also lack development. The series ended before the relationships between many of the characters could finish developing, which is a shame considering the time that the series spent trying to do just that. \\n\\n\r\nWith all of that being said, this cast of characters, for the most part, are all extremely likeable. Each character has a set of quirks that are both charming and humorous. Tsukimi and her roommates also all share some similar quirks and personality traits, and often times will all respond to a situation in the same exact way\u2014which makes for some pretty funny moments. Now there are some moments where the characters may straddle the line between charming and annoying, but that isn\u2019t the case most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nIf I had the describe Princess Jellyfish\u2019s animation in one word I would say that it\u2019s\u2026pleasant. Its quaint animation style really fits the general eccentric, and calm tone of the series. There aren\u2019t a whole lot of sharp, vibrant colors in this anime. You\u2019ll see them sometimes, scattered throughout some of the scenes, but, most of the time, the colors are very soft. \\n\\n\r\nThe character models were fairly unique and distinct. You certainly won\u2019t have trouble telling characters apart in this series. The background scenery is solidly done, but nothing really stood out to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Princess Jellyfish\u2019s opening and ending songs. I think that the opening and endings are a pretty good representation of the feelings of our two main characters, Tsukimi and Kuranosuke. The opening reminding me a lot of Tsukimi and the ending reminding me a lot of Kuranosuke. I\u2019m not saying why because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but I did really enjoy both the opening and the ending of this series very much. But, I don\u2019t really have much of an opinion on the rest of the OST. That\u2019s because, other than the opening and ending, nothing really stood out. Usually, during the course of a series, there\u2019s a song or two playing in the background that catches my attention, but that didn\u2019t really happen here. The music served it purpose, I guess. I never heard anything that sounded out of place, but I also didn\u2019t hear anything noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, after I finished watching the series, I listened to a few samples from the OST. And, I must admit, the OST does have some unique, and catchy songs. Some of which are really good. Maybe it was because I was more interested in what was going on, on the screen, but the series\u2019 OST didn\u2019t add a lot to anime for me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nDespite the lackluster ending and character development, I really enjoyed watching Princess Jellyfish. I was really interested in the lives of the characters, and couldn\u2019t wait to see what was going to happen next. One area where I think that this anime\u2019s short episode count helps it is in its re-watch value. While I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll be returning to this series anytime soon, if I\u2019m looking to watch a comedy slice of life in the future, I know that I can tune in to Princess Jellyfish without making a huge time commitment. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/5\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.3/5\\n\r\nAnimation: 3.4/5\\n\r\nSound: 3.2/5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3.7/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 3.3/5\\n\\n\r\nWhile Princess Jellyfish doesn\u2019t do anything exceptionally well, its likeable characters and solid animation help to make this into a pretty entertaining anime. \\n",

The first episode didn't seem really interesting, other than the fact that it was about jellyfish. Just a bunch of middle-aged otakus, that were girls, but lacked a lot of femininity so I was kind of disappointed since I thought it would be boring. What I didn't really like was that it was lacking some romance. Also it felt like things really got started only during the last couple episodes because it's not just the romance bit, but also when the main character finally started to shine.But even so, it was a really enjoyable anime to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI like how each character's personality is unique, both the otakus and the opposing party. There were parts with the character getting jealous that made me scream \"kyaa!!\" that really made me want to keep watching. Also not to mention I'm the type of person that usually likes to watch anime with reverse-harem, love triangles, and a lot of excitement, so I this this was something new to me. The art was good, and unlike what I wrote above, there were parts when all the characters could shine. Each of the main characters' backgrounds were narrated thoroughly, and I guess you could say after hearing them, jellyfish are a really big part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, I really enjoyed this anime and I'm sure I will like the manga too :)\\n\\n\r\nNote: if you feel discouraged after this review, since I don't really know how to write a good review, get your butt back to that website or whatever you do to watch anime, and watch Kuragehime because I will drag you there with my teeth if you refuse. :D\\n\\n\r\nJK 8D",

THANK GOD THAT I DID. Princess Jellyfish will probably be one of my favourite series for a very long time. As an anime fan, artist, and collector I found this series extremely relatable.As a former volunteer and attendee of conventions I know people who fit perfectly into the roles of each of the girls, relating Tsukimi most with myself. \\n\\n\r\nI caution the viewer who wants to see a complete series. The manga is still on-going, but the anime is only 11 episodes long, and doesn't really end with a lot of questions answered. Despite that, I still recommend it.

I loved Kuranosuke, who jump-starts Tsukimi\u2019s life and starts to pull her out of her shell, and he looked hot wearing both traditionally male and female clothing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, maybe because this anime is so short, the ending is massively rushed and feels incomplete with several plot threads left open-ended, which is disappointing as there is no season 2 planned. :( Though apparently there is a live-action movie due out in December 2014?",

            "content": "Story: Are you a female recluse? Well, this anime seems to be harping on the fact that some girls are just geeky anime fans, right? Yeah, so the stereotypes don't really help but there are some good elements about this story besides that. A girl named Tsukimi has arrived in Japan to start a new life for herself. In the process, she ends up rooming with girls just like her because she's pretty shy and introverted. One day, while walking home, she notices a poor jellyfish in danger in a pet store. She wants to buy it, but she can't really talk to people withoutfreezing up. That's when a beautiful woman shows up to save the day. After letting her sleep in the apartment complex for a night, Tsukimi discovers a very shocking secret that her new friend has. She is actually a HE! Not only were beautiful women forbidden from the apartment to begin with, if her friends discover that Tsukimi has a man in the place, she'll be kicked out for sure. I have to say that a crossdresser in the mix is pretty creative, but again, this is one of those stories that the majority of it is in the manga, but not the anime, so it's gonna feel choppy at some points. It's actually pretty good in flow for the most part, so I would rate this a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style for this anime is pretty interesting considering the content it has. The designs of the main character and her friends are very unique. When Kuranosuke reveals to be a guy, he kinda reminds me of Howl from Howl's Moving Castle. Yes, he's that hot. Also, the mix between pencil and cleaner designs is a pretty interesting contrast to separate outsiders from the normals. It's not meant to make fun of others, but it kinda gives off a vibe that the main group is a lot more interesting than the modern art style. That's what I like most about it. Nothing seems out of place to me, but that's just my opinion. I would give this section a high 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: There's not really much to talk about sound. The opening and the ending are pretty much okay. They're not bad or anything. Just not totally catchy or interesting. The inside music is okay, too. It's stuff like that that makes me put this show as background noise. 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are a lot of interesting characters in this anime, but then again, many of them seem irrelevant. I love Tsukimi and Kuranosuke as main leads in general. If anyone who has read the manga can tell me if these two get together or not because I really want to know since the show ends up on a cliffhanger as well. I also love Tsukimi's group of friends because they all each have a quirky personality that ends up being put to good use. They're not mean. They're kind spirited, and they all love Tsukimi very much. The other side characters, mostly Kuranosuke's family, are pretty dull, especially his brother. I just couldn't get into their stories at all because they seem pointless to me. With this being the case, I would say 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The show is pretty funny within its own right. There may be things that can throw people off, but I did like this show to watch just once. However, if you have read the manga to this, you may be indifferent to the show. If you do plan on watching this, read the manga afterwards. I would rate the enjoyableness at 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Not really much to say. Just that the main score is rounded up to 8/10.",

            "content": "Princess Jellyfish is an 11 episode anime Directed by Takahiro Omori who is best known for the very popular series Baccano and Durarara!!! . This slice of life , romantic comedy focuses on the lives of the women of Amamizukan, an apartment building in Tokyo, where the only tenants are otaku women, and where no men are allowed. This description is the root of the entire story, almost every pun and awkward yet hilarious situation. Not much time is spent explaing the pasts of all the women of Amamizukan  but at no point do these supporting characters become boring and you truly do getto know these characters. So without saying much I will say If you are a Fan of The Wallflower and Paradise Kiss just combine those two into 1 anime and you will have Princess Jellyfish. The story has subtle cliches , and an easy to follow \"I saw that coming\" atmosphere but somehow I could not stop watching and completed all 11 episodes uninterrupted ,eagerly awaiting to see what would happen next. The story ends openly, however it is not a cliffhanger . It leaves just enough closure to sustain your imagination yet is set up for what could possibly be  a follow up season or continuation. I enjoyed it but feel I should note than an Open mind is needed for any male anime fan to appreciate/enjoy this series. This is easily one of my favorite anime that I have seen in the past year and definitely in my top 5 guilty pleasures .",

What I love so much about it is, he has such a love for all things feminine, even though he himself is a very masculine kind of guy. \r\n A great emphasis this show has is the relationships Kuanosuke and Tsukimi have with their mothersthat helped to influence their love for both jellyfish and fashion, that give us an understanding as to why these two characters are the way they are and why I think they work so well together.\\n\\n\r\n I have a problem with many romance anime, as A) always focus in high school, B) all end with their high school sweet hearts and C) always involve this girl hate atmosphere when the main protagonist gets the guy. However, this one is different. For A) The characters are out of high school and in their adult years, B) Tsukimi does not fall in love with our beautiful Kuanosuke but someone else, and C) the two main characters have a beautiful relationship together that makes me melt inside with the warm and fuzzies. This is why more Josei need to be adapted into anime. They have such great potential, with great stories that I feel are more realistic than the shojo genre.\\n\\n\r\n What I love about this anime is that the feelings that these characters develop for each other, isn\u2019t an instantaneous, \u201cI like you\u201d. It progresses slow but steady and by the end there are no couples, there are just people who care about each other. These 11 episodes will make you want more and I suggest reading the manga if you want to see what happens between these characters. \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is I really want a second season\u2026..so badly\u2026\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWhen you look at all the women in Amamizukan, you originally think these girls are just plain weird with their obsession with freaky dolls, trains and \u201cThe Three Kingdoms\u201d, yet you start to understand that these characters live in a society that doesn\u2019t appreciate them much for their passions. They feel like outcasts in a society run by the stylish but Amamizukan ends up becoming a safe haven for them. A home, where they feel accepted for who they are. Even Kuranosuke. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the reality is we are all a little weird and different. The girls don\u2019t change for society, sure Kuranosuke gives them a bit of a makeover to emphasize their good traits but their still the same people. That\u2019s what I love about this anime, it\u2019s about being yourself even if you think society won\u2019t accept you because you will find people who will. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kuragehime, or \"Princess Jellyfish\" in English, is an 11-episode directed by Takahiro Omori and produced by the animation studio Brains Base. Based on a josei manga, it's a very funny and sweet series that is extremely underrated. \r\n          ~STORY~\r\nThe story of Kuragehime follows an eighteen year old girl named Tsukimi, who suffers from social awkwardness. She lives in a women-only home with several other social misfits, and has a love for any and all jellyfish. The story of this show is very simple but sweet. It deals with a topic that not many other shows dealwith, which is fitting in and being who you are. The show has the tendency to be funny without trying to hard, something which I greatly appreciate. Though it does display some clich\u00e9s, the story is quite original. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n         ~ART/ANIMATION~\\n\r\nThe animation was produced by studio Brain's Base, known for doing the animes Baccano! and Durarara!!. The animation is well done, as expected from Brain's Base. The colors are bright and the quality is consistent. The characters designs are funny and cute, and each character has their own feature. \\n\\n\r\n         ~SOUND~\\n\r\nAlthough I have no idea who composed the music for the series, I give them props. It isn't the best soundtrack I've ever heard, but for what it is, it's very good. The opening and ending is also very good, both of them fitting very well with the series. The English dub is also very good. I was very pleased to hear Maxey Whitehead in the lead role, because she is a very good voice actress whom I feel doesn't get enough behind the microphone time. Since I personally haven't seen the subbed version, I don't have much to say about it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n     ~CHARACTERS~\\n\r\nThe characters are probably one of the strongest points of the show. There was never a character I didn't like. The main character, Tsukimi, is a very sweet and honest character, and I found myself relating to her often. Our second main character is Kuranosuke, a boy around Tsukimi's age who comes from a wealthy family. However, Kuranosuke enjoys cross dressing greatly, and often performs makeovers on Tsukimi. He has an older step-brother names Shu, who has feeling for Tsukimi when she is her beautiful state. Then there are the various aged-women who live in the same home as Tsukimi:\\n\\n\r\nChieko, the manager and daughter of the owner\\n\\n\r\nMayaya, a woman who tends to shout and act over-excited\\n\\n\r\nBanba, a woman with a large afro (which is actually a natural perm) who is obsessed with trains\\n\\n\r\nJiji, a quiet and shy girl who has an unnatural attraction to older men. \\n\\n\\n\r\n        ~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. It's funny story and realistic characters were only one part of this great anime. As I said before, this anime is very underrated and under-appreciated. \\n\\n\\n\r\n       ~OVERALL~\\n\r\nOverall, I give  Kuragehime a solid 10/10. It's a wonderful series, and one I wish they would make a second season to. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll bite! I was skeptical at first. Jellyfish Princess as a title is as possibly the worst title possible. Poop on Your Shoes would be a better title. But regardless of the title I took a leap and jumped right in. 3 episodes in I was swimming with the jellyfishes and jumping to the next episode without pause. 10 out of 10 is a rarity for me. Fairly memorable characters. Great songs and interesting plot twists. It will have you rushing out to get the manga to see where it goes from here. The only disappointment I had in this anime was the lack ofepisodes.11 was not enough. 24 would of been a great number to fully fill out this arc but overall still a 10! Watch it you won't be disappointed.",
