            "content": "What would you get if you crossed Thelma & Louise with City of God? You may get complete drivel, or you may, if you're very lucky, get something like Michiko to Hatchin.\r\nManglobe, the production company (and the brains behind), Michiko to Hatchin, have really pushed the boat out with this anime. But then again, they're no strangers to success or quality, especially as they are the company responsible for Ergo Proxy and Samurai Champloo. The series was directed by Yamamoto Sayo and is effectively her first full time at the helm of a production, and whilst this may have been a gamble on the partof Manglobe, it's one that certainly paid off as Michiko to Hatchin has a certain \"fresh\" quality that I haven't seen in anime in a long time (not since Cowboy Bebop in fact).\\n\\n\r\nThe tale is about an escaped convict named Michiko Malandro and her quest to find her lost, and supposedly dead, lover Hiroshi Morenos. In order to achieve this, she \"kidnaps\" a girl who is supposedly Hiroshi's daughter, initially thinking that she would know where Hiroshi is. However the world has changed during her years in prison, becoming at times more brutal and less forgiving.\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to set this tale in a quasi-South American (Brazilian), country was a stroke of genius as the creators and director could do things that would never have been included had the show been given a more staid setting. In addition to this, the characters themselves are able to have that little bit more \"flair\" about them because of the setting, something that initially detracts from some of them until one realises that the gaudiness is all simply part of that character's persona - more on that later though.\\n\\n\r\nNow fans of Ergo Proxy and Samurai Champloo will know that Manglobe are able to produce some stunning visuals, and Michiko to Hatchin is no slouch in this department. From barren deserts to lush jungles, from slum shanties to sleek factories, the level of detail is excellent, and well above that of many recent titles. In addition to this, the various settings in which the story takes place have a certain realistic quality about them that belies the fact that this is an anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the  great scenery, the characters are extremely unique and well designed, again, adding to the sense of realism about the show. The leads and immediate supporting cast are individuals to a tee, with each character possessing a certain lifelike quality that many anime would find difficult to match.\\n\\n\r\nOne area where the show really excels is with the animation. It's rare to see such lifelike movement in anime, and in many ways the fluidity and natural motion in Michiko to Hatchin represents a step up from that of Samurai Champloo.\\n\\n\r\nSound is another area where this show works very well. The effects are extremely well chosen and choreographed, and while some may be overwhelming, this is actually purposeful because of the situations the characters may find themselves in. The music used throughout the series is atmospheric and refreshing, and is reflective of the Latin-American feel of the show. The OP, a track called \"Paraiso\" by the Japanese jazz band Soil & \"Pimp\" Sessions, is an excellent piece that harks back to the classic \"Tank!\" of Cowboy Bebop fame. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the ED, \"Best Friend\" by Karutetto, as it is a bit too \"boy-band\" for my tastes.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the truly great things about Michiko to Hatchin is actually the cast. Manglobe and Yamamoto took the somewhat surprising, move when they chose the actors, opting not for established traditional seiyuu but for established screen actors. However, this seemingly risky choice has paid off in spades for the series. Maki Yoko (Battle Royale II: Requiem, The Grudge), is extremely versatile as the sexy, pouting, hotheaded, and somewhat childish Michiko, whilst Ohgo Suzuka (Year One in the North, Memoirs of a Geisha), is truly excellent in the role of Hatchin as she provides a depth of character that is rare to find.\\n\\n\r\nWhich neatly brings us to the characters themselves. Michiko is willful, headstrong, selfish in the extreme, and very childish. Hatchin is somewhat shy and nervous, but also responsible, tidy, and hates laziness. Both leads are extremely well defined from the outset, something which is reinforced as the relationship between the two is extremely combative (the pair are effectively polar opposites). Others like the terrifying Satoshi Batista or the terrier-like (i.e. always chasing Michiko), Atsuko Jackson are also well defined from the start, and through the first few episodes it may be difficult to see how any of the characters are actually developing because of the strength of the characterizations.\\n\\n\r\nOne reason for this is because both Manglobe and Yamamoto decided against using normal anime practices for developing characters, and instead chose a far more realistic and subtle approach. One needs only to compare the relationship between Michiko and Hatchin (or even Michiko and Atsuko), at the beginning of the series, with their behaviour towards the end to see exactly how much they have developed as characters. An example of this is the fact that Michiko is initially very much an annoying, sexy, pouting, selfish jerk, however at the end of the series she reminds me of Balsa from Seirei no Moribito. Hatchin, Atsuko and Satoshi also undergo this extremely subtle development (you'll see how much by episode 20).\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series for many reasons, the main one being the fact that this is a show that is not afraid to show the casual brutality of its setting. There will be some out there who didn't like the way the series ended, however I found the conclusion to be very much in keeping with the essence of the series, whilst at the same time being far more realistic than the endings of most other anime.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin is a rarity in the medium, and should not be prejudged on the basis of one or two episodes. The complexity of each character, the harsh, unforgiving setting, the sometimes brutally real actions of individuals, and the extremely subtle development all serve to make this one of the best shows of 2008, and one of the best anime to appear in the last decade. At times Thelma & Louise, at times City of God, at times Laurel and Hardy, this anime possesses a style and flair that surpasses that of Samurai Champloo - a feat by any measure.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the quality of this series, and its previous titles, I'm rapidly becoming a fan of Manglobe.",

            "content": "In a world plunged into an immoral wasteland, it is often difficult to find friends and comrades that you can believe in. The cold brutality of the situation may be that you simply can\u2019t. But sometimes a slight glimmer of hope remains amid the tumult and chaos, that maybe perhaps you really do have a partner out there, a comrade that will stick with you and care for you to the very end.\r\nThe world depicted in \u201cMichiko to Hatchin\u201d is this wasteland, a setting fraught with greed and death amid the indigent and the impoverished. This is South America (Brazil), or rather a variation ofit. From the gritty alleys, to the squalid shanties and the lush and viridescent landscapes, Manglobe doesn\u2019t disappoint. The setting is not only a beauty to look at but is also something unique and rare that allows the show to take wing and travel regions that are distinctive yet still within the realms of what was initially established. Through this director Yamamoto is able to channel the genius of Watanabe and the result is something unlike any other that challenges and perhaps even surpasses works such as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo.\\n\\n\r\nThe story chronicles the lives of mainly Michiko Malandro, an escaped convict on a desperate hunt to find a supposedly dead man that was once her everything and Hana Morenas nicknamed Hatchin, the apparent daughter of this man and who Michiko initially thinks is the ultimate clue to helping her achieve her goal. The premise is set, but the main plot is less prominent than what many would expect. In this show it is merely used as a device to tie in many self-contained stories together and give the show a satisfactory conclusion because ultimately this show isn\u2019t about the goal, it never was. The show is about the journey and the bonds that are broken and healed along the way. And the stubborn, immature Michiko along with the self-righteous, mature Hatchin are characters real and charming enough to carry you through this journey and not let you go. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has an astounding soundtrack that lives and breathes nearly as much as the characters do. The energetic soundtrack fits every beat and every pulse of this high-powered train ride, yet also smoothly transitions towards a more melancholy nature when the situation calls for it. Through this the music is able to create remarkable scenes of raw emotion and immeasurable charisma that echo and persist long after you have finished the show. The animation is no slouch in its department either. One of the reasons why Michiko and Hatchin feel so startlingly real is that they look and move like real people as well and while there are times where the animation quality may drop, it still stays very consistent throughout and lends to an experience that is both aesthetically pleasing and emotionally stimulating.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately this is a series that as well as examining the lengths in which people would go to accomplish their goals, more importantly looks at the bonds that are formed during that time. Michiko and Hatchin go on a dangerous adventure together as a tornado of a tag team, and through this are able to form a relationship that overcomes the trials and tribulations that come their way and even the long and arduous chasm created by time. It is a bond both honest and deep that lies in juxtaposition with the superficial and vapid bonds congesting the streets of Brazil, a strong bond of indomitable love and unending trust. And though there are many instances throughout the series where the two characters pull each other down with their flawed personas to the extent that you would think they are better off without each other, it becomes evident later on how much they need one another, how much more they are able to accomplish with each other as their platforms. The show does well to depict two sides of a relationship, one of anger and disarray during quarrels and also one of a serene and resonant beauty during the rare moments of an embrace and while the show is far from deep or a riddled literary piece of work, it does well to show the power of friendship and love in a realistic manner and the way in which it is able to travel the void of time and always be there right when you need it, proving that love is far from a burden, but rather a privilege. The privilege of being responsible for another.\\n\\n\r\nSayo Yamamoto\u2019s first work is by no means perfect, but through its unique setting, remarkable soundtrack and captivating characters, she is able to construct a show filled with raw emotions and a flaring style constituting to a heartening, disturbing and riveting journey that in my book is nothing less than a masterpiece.  \\n",

            "content": "Anime that are set out of Japan whilst not as uncommon as many may think are still few and far between but what is even more rare is an anime that takes place in Latin America. Michiko to Hatchin is representative of everything that is uncommon but amazing about the anime industry: it has style, nice characters, a unique setting and a vast array of themes, and whilst at times it is harsh it never forgets to be light-hearted in its ingenuity.\r\nMichiko to hatchin's story is rather unusually executed; my original impressions was that the series was episodic but upon completion that statement was afairly inaccurate description, but in saying that I still find that each episode is 'episodic' in its own way. Each episode does contribute to the story being told, but interestingly enough they also provide detail on many background details: such as the lives of a group of kids growing up in the slums Sao Paulo, or even settling in on the business motives of an organized crime network hosting a bullfighting tournament or a prostitution ring etc etc...\\n\\n\r\n To its credit these many moments scattered throughout the series helped maintain my interest throughout the series entirety; each scenario was new and refreshing, each life had something different to offer. Unfortunately, criticisms still need to be considered, as whilst all these many moments managed to pique my interest. I could only feel that they somehow seemed to be a foot-hold in grabbing the viewers attention because the actual story seems kind of trivial in comparison to many of the side-stories.\\n\r\n This observation still only further justifies why i believe this series to be good, as it came up with such a variety of side-stories that managed to maintain a consistently high level of quality, that made the long journey all the more worth it in the end.\\n\\n\r\n One thing that I wanted to point out upon entering this series, is that at the period of time in which Michiko to Hatchin is set. Brazil was going through a revolution. I was personally a little disappointed when I discovered that this series covered very little of that historic event. Not to discredit the series for this because instead of doing that, it's vivid portrayal of life in Brazil at the time seems particularly plausible and in many ways makes up for my disappointment. Underneath every garbage bin and behind every building, the place oozes with a deep sinister corruption. Everything from the police cover-ups and false justifications, money laundering, prostitution, you name it, this series probably has it.\\n\\n\r\n A positive to all this, is that the series doesn't try to make a bad name out of all of this. It simply lets its vision unwrap itself never bombarding its audience with moral preaching. This is the lives of these people, are they happy with it? Maybe, maybe not, but at least they are making a living out of what they got, and if what they have is morally ambiguous then why not use its absolute best.\\n\\n\r\n The actual story whilst being rather trivial as I mentioned earlier is twisted around with the many side-stories adding a bit to the series worth. What irks me though is the motivations behind the foundation of the story, our main character Michiko being one of the soul main characters comes across as ditzy and in many ways, really gullible which does little to help with story progression, and most of the story is moved forward by side-characters.\\n\\n\r\n Even with these criticisms, I still must say that Michiko to Hatchin's ending is probably one of the best conclusions to an anime series that I have ever encountered. One problem I have found with many shows is that they take too long to conclude or the exact opposite where they don't have a conclusion. Michiko to Hatchin falls fair and square into the middle. Covering everything that it had previously established and no noticable plot threads are left unresolved without seeming to rushed or too slow. \\n\\n\r\n One of the most notable things about Michiko to Hatchin's story is its interesting cast. The show takes the time and effort to construct a diverse quantity of personality and character traits. I do have a couple of issues with some minor and the main characters, some minor characters (not many) are occasionally used as plot conveniences but even these characters still get some level of development. Emphasizing that this series waste's no time in establishing its characters personalities, ambitions and motivations, which is certainly a good thing.\\n\\n\r\n One of the best things about watching this series was watching Michiko and Hatchin's characters develop as the series played out, they're an unusual and possibly eccentric combination of mother and daughter. Many times I began to wonder if they are even related, like at all, but as a member of the audience, I could feel a relationship present, whilst being slightly unorthodox it was not an impossible relationship to envision. It is entertaining to watch as they interact, learning from each others mistakes. Watching the unusually mature Hatchin take care of the naively reckless but caring Michiko, and vice-versa.\\n\\n\r\n My complaints with some of the characters, are that their motivations are occasionally very vague. A good example would be some of the interactions between Michiko and Atsuko, a few of the outcomes from there encounters are occasionally poorly explained and sometimes a little stupid. Without giving away any spoilers, there was one particular scene where I was screaming at Atsuko in my head for not carrying out a particular action that she had tried so hard to achieve but in the end didn't carry it out. The reason? Well I might have missed it because the motivation behind it was sort of precarious but the consequences for iit rendered their reasons completely arbitrary.\\n\r\n Our main character Michiko isn't without fault either, very prone to some questionable actions throughout the series, chasing someone who is clearly trying to get away from her just seems to be a motivation that is slightly beyond my comprehension.\\n\r\nOther than these complaints it was an interesting cast nonetheless and despite these people's shortcomings, these actions (even the ones that I previously mentioned) never felt out of character and becomes a small plus in my book.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art whilst not anything spectacular is very clean and this quality is constant throughout the entirety of the series. The most notable moments are seen in the many action sequences. Each scenes choreography was well animated rarely ever resorting to cheap techniques (and if the series did they were very well disguised). Each scene had a fluidity all on its own, it was fast-paced when it needed to be, retrospectively it was slow when demanded and normal between these many moments. Each frame never felt out of place when actions were being displayed. I mention this because the sheer breadth and style of the many action sequences in this series never lets up and the art knows how to dictate the adrenaline pumping moments and thus contributes to the series well-established atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\n  One of the best things about Michiko to Hatchin is the background designs. Never before have I seen a 3rd world/2nd world country presentation as detailed than I have in Michiko to Hatchin (with a possible exception of \"Flag\") in an anime/manga series. Everything from the large open spaces accompanying a desolate road; to the slum, crime ridden districts of Brazil's many cities, towns and communities. The level of detail that goes into many of the locations emphasize the tensions building in each district and community.\\n\\n\r\n The character designs across the board are very commendable, and I loved how all the characters have a degree of acceptable realism to them. Whilst Michiko the main lead has a busty accentuated figure, her figure is complimented by the shows diverse characters and as mentioned previously with their large range of personalities, the same can be said for each character's designs. Figures often appear in a versatility of chubby, well-groomed and formal, poor and hungry, old and young character types. Serving to make the characters far more relatable, increasing the series impact.\\n\\n\r\nOne particular aspect of the art that I wish to take into consideration is actually the opening and ending credits. One thing I loved about this series was the mesh of beautiful textures that I witnessed upon entering and leaving every episode. With a hint of photo-shop thrown into the blend of pseudo-phantasmagorical art reminiscent of a retro-American psychedelic hippie movement.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin's soundtrack is a well-made and thoroughly appropriate soundtrack with a collaboration of string instrumentals, mostly of the ukulele and acoustic guitar, with a common accompaniment of percussion instruments such as the timpani, bongos and such. A lot of the songs in the series ost are wildly and energetically presented, catering to the fun and adrenalin-soaked and occasionally sexually fused atmosphere that the series provides.\\n\\n\r\n Some of the tracks are particularly memorable, most notably the opening sequence with its bubbly bebop jazz style. Effectively melding its complex harmonics making it an absolute blast to listen to, with the show forcing me to listen to it every single time I started a new episode, and that is definitely a good thing.\\n\r\n Each track adequately sets the tone of each scene and never fails to boast an exciting entourage. Overall I see no reason to complain about the ost. It is effective, different and great to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show does have a couple of faulty points, where entertainment value can be somewhat lacking on a couple of occasions and at times I felt the characters make stupid decisions but they are few and far between. And as I mentioned before, rarely do those stupid decisions seem out of character, so if anything it helps benefit the series.\\n\r\n Altogether this series is a quality adventure taking place in an untouched landscape. It has a positively balanced story with non-repetitive scenario's, the show never tries too hard at what it does and loves to revel in its own world. It knows its limits and actively makes use of that boundary. It is a vision that is both refreshing and entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone who shares a delight in venturing into a world of interesting characters and constant thumping of a glorious beat in every background.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "****As of Episode 11****\r\nStory - 9.1/10 (A-)\r\nFor the most part, the story brings you in from the first episode. A real good plot, some really well drawn out character backgrounds, a spice of latin flavor in each episode and the occasional boob shaking, finger flipping action, courtesy of Michiko. You're going to love the random yet plot focused action of the femine duo. Many twists and turns await, and as of episode 11, it's been a great ride.\r\nArt - 9.7/10 (A)\r\nWell, i haven't seen such colorful designs in..never. Each episode brings something as unimportant (Ex. Shoes, TV's, a gas station) to life. This has somethingto do with the setting, a great choice by the creator. You'll be amazed how well each piece of setting and backdrop is well animated. Michiko's design of a bad girl convict shows itself from the very beginning.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\n--OP/ED Theme: 9.0/10\\n\r\nThe Opening theme is a latin-flavored beat, &quot;Paraiso&quot; by Soul &amp; Pimp Sessions, it really shows the cultural stance of Michiko to Hatchin. An upbeat, fiesta that can show that a non-vocal song can be just as good as a vocal one. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ending theme brings the show down to a mellow, humble stop with &quot;Best Friend&quot; by Karutetto (Quartet). A moving song with a variety of different drawings in each part of the ending, something that can really leave you (almost) in tears. Beautifully well sung, the adding vivid images that accompany it also well done.\\n\\n\r\n--BGM: 8.3/10\\n\r\nThe BGM is really well played, from the town on the outskirts to the strip bar scenes, it blends well. Some of the lesser bgm will probably leave your mind the next episode, but it's still good while it lasted.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8.9/10\\n\r\nThere's a shortage of characters but the one's i can name are really well done. Aitsuko, the police chief and a (former) friend to Michiko, another bad girl cop with a no-nonsense attitude, how someone like her and Michiko ever became friends is still a mystery to me. Every character has a purpose for being there, and Michiko to Hatchin is one of those shows where they all come together in their own seperate and uniquely different ways. Now we have members of Monstro, including Satoshi. He's a real charmer..right. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Conclusion/Enjoyment - 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin is a show with a great future and a greater chance of becoming a hit show with a cult following, no doubt. It has the basic components that make a show and more. Only 6 episodes in, and i can tell you it's good and you WANT more. While every show that has been deemed &quot;perfect&quot;, it's highly unlikely. Every show has faults, Michiko to Hatchin is no exception. However, it's cultural upbringing and remarkable characters along with the homely latin-flavored music can easily overcome those tiny faults. If you want a change, vote Michiko to Hatchin (pun intended).\\n\\n\r\nOverall(Averaged): -8.8/10 (B+)",

            "content": "\"Michiko e Hatchin\" is a hybrid between Brazilian and Japanese culture that is best compared at first as a \"Cinderella\"/\"Prisoner 701 Scorpion\" mix, however the episodes that follow seem more like a Thelma and Louise story arch accept it's a mother daughter combo.  \"City of God\" was also mentioned by another reviewer and it's hard not to compare the Braziling like gang violence that occurs throughout this series. These comparisons are really loose references though, considering Michiko and Hana's relationship became much more dynamic as the series progressed. The artwork is very vibrant and fun, and the music has a spicy Brazilian edge andkeeps the tempo of this fast paced action drama melodically interesting.\\n\\n\r\nBackground Info:\\n\\n\r\nSayo Yamamoto's debut as a head director is full of promise. Yamamoto is no stranger to smash hits as he has directed episodes of Samurai Champloo, Eureka Seven and Ergo Proxy. Shinichiro Watanabe himself the director of \"Cowboy Bebop\" is lending a hand for his friend by producing the Music, and Seiki Tamura the art director of \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" and the Background art director of \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\", \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"The Grave of the Fireflies\" helps make this production definitely something that needs to be watched. \\n\\n\r\nStory and Character Analysis:\\n\\n\r\nAt the center of this anime is a story about a society in which two little girls  are forced to grow up early due to abuse and a world that won't let them have a childhood. Michiko(mother) and Hana(daughter) are both subjected to physical and mental torture from a young age. For Michiko, the need for love and reconciliation from the one person whom she believed loved her, husband Hiroshi, was originally the driving force to her existence.  Michiko deeply desired some normality in her life, since she was forced as a little girl to grow up fending for herself. The normal future that was ripped away from her by a crime syndicate was something she never forgot. This dynamic later switches from Hiroshi to her daughter Hana. \\n\\n\r\nHana's search for her father is one part escaping her original dismal and abusive situation but eventually evolves into a quest to gain her mothers love and some since of family. Through out this story the mostly painful relationship between her and Michiko occurs mostly because of Michiko's selfish nature and Hana's protective personality. The mother/daughter angst story arc plays out right until the end and made the series feel completed and more realistic in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe little criticism I do have revolves mostly around the other underdeveloped story arc's which included subtle but sometimes blatant lesbian implications. Definitely a story that can be appreciated by feminists, me included. \\n\\n\r\nGreat Series!\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show came out in October 2008\u2026\u2026..and yet I just found out about it or know its existence 4-5 years later. I did a little research about the show and wonder a few things about it, such as it was made by Manglobe, the same production studio who brought another favorite anime of mine, Samurai Champloo, and also it was the first anime directed by a newcomer by the name of Sayo Yamamoto, who later on went to direct Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine (which I heard good things about, although I don\u2019t keep track on the franchise) and I can seeit as a spiritual cousin to both Champloo & Cowboy Bebop with a Latin / Jazz flavor mixed in.\\n\\n\r\nHatchin is a girl raised by strict foster parents who has long given up her dreams of freedom. Michiko is a sexy criminal who escapes from a supposedly inescapable prison. When she suddenly enters Hana's life, these two very different women set off on a journey across a lawless land in search of a missing man from both their pasts.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this show does have similarities to the two shows I just mentioned earlier; most likely the former considering it is a type of show where the journey of finding this mysterious man named Hiroshi and traveling to the destination is more focused than the destination itself with these wild, crazy, and charismatic characters drawn in and the cities/towns they visit along the way. It\u2019s not really a show with a strong or overwhelming plot but it\u2019s more entertaining and thrilling where all you need is a simple premise but make it watchable on screen. As for the other surrounding factors, the anime is based more on realism than it seems with the cities, ghettos, rivers, deserts and of course, the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that, I really loved the characters of Michiko and Hatchin as to me, they are like the badass and child pairing that wouldn\u2019t look right on the drawing board first, but it worked out. Michiko is like the female version of Mugen from Samurai Champloo with a bit of the same characteristics: A mysterious and dark past, someone who seems to be very unstoppable to anybody she faces, kind of an idiot to be around, and can be very harsh to their companion\u2026..at first. Hatchin or \u201cHana\u201d is that one character I was really rooting for to\u2026..well\u2026.survive. I wanted to say she\u2019s like Ed from Cowboy Bebop but she\u2019s actually more responsible than her and also the way she gets treated in the first 2 episodes by her foster family, I instantly wanted her to leave them because personally, I would\u2019ve left there sooner and knocking all of them out (and yes, I mean, all of them). Sure, Michiko is not actually World\u2019s Best Parent but she would be safer with her than them. Plus, the bond between them is very mother/daughter-like but the roles would be reserved and it\u2019s actually funnier that way. Other characters including Atsuko Jackson is the foil to Michiko mostly because she\u2019s always trying to catch her, yet she escapes and we all know that Atsuko has a soft spot for her as well, almost like the same connection as Michiko to Hatchin, a kindred spirit as you think about it.  In short, all of the characters do have their moments of clarity and rough development. Some may as innocent as you think or vice-versa, either way, they all evolve in some form.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, this is very scenic and gorgeous to gaze at and if this show was to ever air in HD, it would enhance the viewing pleasure. This is one of Manglobe\u2019s best looking shows to date, even better than most current shows (although the only shows from Manglobe I saw was Samurai Champloo, Deadman Wonderland, & House of Five Leaves) and let me remind you this was made in 2008 and I know it isn\u2019t vintage yet but it\u2019s something more unique than the usual anime and that\u2019s also been said before but it\u2019s true. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is another department where they succeed, especially with the opening, \u201cParadiso\u201d by SOIL&PIMP Sessions and this opening is very reminiscent of the classic anime opening, \u201cTank!\u201d from Cowboy Bebop and speaking of that, Shinichiro Watanabe happens to be the music producer of the series, which explains that Watanabe feel I was getting from the show itself. The music was by Brazilian musician Alexandre Kassin of The +2\u2019s and the background music is also very impressive with its blend of jazz, funk, psyche Delia & samba music. However, the ending theme wasn\u2019t bad, I just never think of that song when it comes to this series.\\n\\n\r\nNow, even though I am a dub watcher, I saw this in the sub\u2026\u2026mostly because this is no English dub (yet). As of the time of the review was written, FUNimation will release it this year with Monica Rial as the voice of Michiko & Jad Sexton as Hatchin. There isn\u2019t a clip of the dub released yet but the sub was an overall decent effort.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: I have found a new anime that really piques my interest and I really love this and I\u2019m pretty sure that when the dub comes out, I\u2019m going to love it as well but as of now, this is definitely a show I can recommend to most newcomers of anime and experienced watchers. \\n",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nWe often see in a lot of anime series either the same setting, Japan or an alternate apocalyptic distant future setting, well that happens most of the time in anime these days. Been a fan of anime I often ask myself: \"When are we going to see the setting of a story, crossing the Sea of Japan and reaching a different shore?\" Well Michiko to Hatchin is the answer. This series delivers in a single episode more of what you can see in anime these days, imagine all 22 episodes? The breathtaking locations, landscapes and scenarios are perfect; you will actually be transported into thisamazing country that has cultural traces from Brazil. I got to hand it to Sayo Yamamoto, this is her first directional debut, and what a job she has done, creating pure art. I am looking forward to see more of her work in the future. Studio Manglobe has done it again, form being highly involved in classics such as Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy, into creating one if not the best anime series this decade of 2000 has offered.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a story that focuses and tries to unite the two main character's differences into one goal. Suddenly everything becomes a wild adventure and you are there witnessing this entire phenomenal and unique bond between two people, despite the stepping-stones that awaits them in the road. The locations in the story left me speechless, there are scenes in rivers, deserts, cities, ghettos, and beautiful portrayed forest and jungles. You will see all kinds of characters in this story: from mafia syndicate leaders, to different kinds of gangs and hitmen, to robbers and cops, pimps and prostitutes, poor people and junkies. You will also see in the story unexpected characters to have good hearts, feelings and good intentions toward others. Every little detail in the story it is explain, there are no plot holes. The story is just to impressive and unique, even if it looks a little similar to the Hollywood film; Thelma and Louise, it's still way superior and also Michiko to Hatchin's story offers you way more, it is inspiring.  \\n\\n\r\n10 of 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Samurai Champloo's art and animation, then Michiko to Hatchin will not disappoint you, because basically it's the same people. Studio Manglobe did this series with passion and love, something they have done before. The art is superb and beautiful, almost like a goddess. Every character is treated unique in their art design. The action and adventure's art and animation is perfectly executed. Like watching Cowboy Bebop's or Samurai Camploo's art and animation, you never get tired because it's perfect. Thats why the animation clearly never fails in every episode. The opening of the series is very creative, it has a 70's and 80's style but really impressive and the colors used are stylish, like the series. The ending is not that colorful like the opening; it's a calmed and relaxing projection of the hidden side of the story. The landscapes they create and show you are literally the definition of art. You are transported into the scene, and you will believe that you are inside, because of how perfect this art and animation has been done.\\n\\n\r\n10 of 10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nEvery sound and music is perfectly sync and synchronized with every scene in the entire series. The seiyu in this series did one heck of a job, although the main cast is compose of more film actors than Seiyu, but they did a perfect job by lending their voices for those epic roles in this classic. Their voices match every character the play in the story. In this series when you hear gunshots the perception you feel is that they are real, because of how well the sound department has created them. The music composed is by a Brazilian music group called, Kassin + 2 and is also produced by Shinichiro Watanabe (Director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo). The music is great in the entire series, because it fits in every important scene. Kassin + 2 does a great job with the music taking us into the roots and lands of Brazil with their music. The opening theme: \"Paraiso\" by Soil & \"Pimp\" Sessions is a good song, it depends on your music taste, some might like it, and others might not. But if you liked the originality that Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts displayed in Cowboy Bebop's opening creating \"Tank\" then \"Paraiso\" will not be a disappointing song. The ending theme: \"Best Friend\" by Karutetto, is more passive than the opening, imagine the name says it all, but also a good song, also very original and not annoying. The sound and music of this series does not top the one in Ghost in the Shell SAC series or Eureka 7, but it takes another different direction, it takes you directly into the core of the cultural traces of Brazil.\\n\\n\r\n10 of 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things in a story, are the characters. Well let me tell you that in Michiko to Hatchin every character was literally develop to it's maximum. You never see a character get left behind in the story or plot like in other anime series. This is one of the great things that this series offers to it's viewers, also you get to see a lot of different points of views that every character offers you, so you can know him better thus in the end you can judge him differently. The names of all the characters are pretty solid and original. One of the main characters is named Hatchin (voiced by Suzuka Ohgo). She was a character that did deliver a solid performance, and left me speechless, she definitely earns a spot as one of the greatest characters in anime. All the characters are stylish; they have their own personalities and egos. Most of the characters in this story need innocence in order to prevail, that's something you see often in life. You will either feel a connection with one of the characters or one will automatically take you to feel his situation. That's how powerful the characters are develop in this story, they are memorable and not forgettable. One of the finest and best character developments I have seen since Cowboy Bebop.  \\n\\n\r\n10 of 10   \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that when you actually finish watching it, you will say I will put it again because every moment was enjoyable and unforgettable. The action scenes are highly enjoyable and never boring, you will see them over and over again. To the problems and situations the main characters get into, to the gun shots you see, to the fighting scenes, to the fast pace action car chases and to every detail you come across with. You will enjoy it and you will be asking for more at the same time, hoping it never ends. \\n\\n\r\n10 of 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI was thinking that Code Geass was basically the best series of this decade, but I was wrong. Upon discovering Michiko to Hatchin everything changed. This series is more than about freedom, it's about what we have in life and what do we do with it, and what it means to us every second and moment of our existence. Every episode teaches us something different about life, something you don't see frequently in anime these days. If you like Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, then think of Michiko to Hatchin as the fused version, of those two titans. Clearly Michiko to Hatchin takes a whole different direction in anime, going beyond and transcending what is called a classic masterpiece. That\u2019s why Michiko to Hatchin is the best anime series the 2000\u2019s has given us. It deserves to be called, the greatest anime of this decade.\\n\\n\r\n10 of 10\\n",

            "content": "After seeing the first few minutes of MtH, I hav enoticed the character design for Michiko. She doesn't look like 99.99% of anime girls (woman in her case) but she looks 99.99% better than them. The sexy, cute, strong, rowdy, independent woman is composed to perfection in her. And I am glad to say that she never uses her sex-appeal to get what she wants. \r\nAs you can probably see, Michiko is the strongest point in this anime, but that doesn't mean that the side characters are worthless. This is one of the handful of animes in which side-characters and \"villains\" have more depth inthem than 99.99% of the main characters in animes out there. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are times in the 22 episodes that can be so confusing that you just leave it be. Maybe it's because all the factions (including Michiko minus Hatchin) are folks who were born on the very bad side of life. But this is a good thing as well since it doesn't give the viewer a generic \"black and white\" that they have seen hundreds of times already.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, it's great. The characters move fluidly; The camera angles are perfect; the action scenes are strong. Music-wise, the music fits the poverty stricken side of Latin-America. And of course, the story. It's realistic and feels like real life which just makes the title feel different from your run of the mill anime. And yes, it does feel like Cowboy Bebop, except that MtH is a more realistic version of that.",

            "content": "_M&H_ is an adventure anime featuring a young orphaned girl Hatchin who is kidnapped from her foster parents by an escaped felon to look for her father, Hiroshi McGuffin. They travel from town to town in a quasi Mexico-Brazil, searching for him while evading the police; invariably, they discover the princess is in another castle and must leave town under hot pursuit. Every episode, someone beats Hatchin, scams her, tries to sell her, kill her, abduct her, or lie to her, while no plot happens. This goes on for 22 episodes.\r\nTo be blunt, _M&H_ is an astonishingly mediocre anime. The plot is astoundingly boring asMichiko and Hatchin kill time in random cities until something bad happens and they have to leave. The initial plot, finding Hiroshi, seems like it will be resolved within a few episodes and the series will get serious and deal with the incipient gang warfare, except, that turns out to be the *entire* series, dragging out endlessly as they miss Hiroshi skipping out on them like 4 times. Characters are brought in only to never play any particularly meaningful role (what was all that stuff with Satoshi Batista? it never went anywhere until he's casually killed off at the end). More time is spent ogling Michiko's breasts and stomach than trying any world-building so most of the time we're stuck watching the same Martian desert hellscape we've been watching for 15 episodes before. There is no dramatic suspense as we know that no matter how much Michiko screws up and no matter how many cops are after her, she will never be hit by their bullets and will somehow jump over all their cars in her motorcycle in sequences that have approximately 1.2% as much excitement or interest as a _Lupin the Third_ escape sequence. Did I mention that Hatchin is just treated absurdly badly by everyone in the whole series (including Michiko, and excluding the Chinese singer, who as far as I can tell is literally the only person in the series who actually treats Hatchin well - because even her 'friend' Rita somehow neglects to mention that the circus will sell her off).\\n\\n\r\nThe series is produced by Shinichir\u014d Watanabe and created by Manglobe (Ergo Proxy, Samurai Champloo), but while I kind of guessed as much since I was getting a _Cowboy Bebop_ vibe, _M&H_ highlights by contrast just how great _Cowboy Bebop_ is: CB was regularly punctuated by unforgettable music and scenes, from \"Green Bird\" to the finale; _M&H_ has totally forgettable themes except for the mildly interesting animation of the OP; CB had a hallucination episode which, aside from being amusing, deepened the characterization of the main characters and added foreshadowing, while _M&H_'s hallucination episode was just some wacky images; CB had semi-realistic combat scenes and jeet kune do inspired martial arts, while M&H just leaves us eyes rolling at a woman in high heels yet again beating up some burly men; CB had a spaceship which bled and suffered with the main cast, while M&H has a motorcycle which keeps breaking yet mysteriously keeps showing up; CB had a thought-out yakuza backstory driving the central conflict, while M&H has some random stuff in the early episodes which turns out to not even matter once Satoshi gets killed off; CB had distinct locations and worlds, from Mars to Earth to Ganymede, while M&H has just two locations, a seaside town and dusty baked-dry slums. M&H just comes off as bizarrely half-baked, as if some notes were taken on a possible anime but then the anime studio had to turn them into an anime overnight without any time to research locations or come up with interesting places to go or things to do. Whether it's bizarre Japanisms like ear-cleaning (I am pretty sure girlfriends in Mexico do not clean their boyfriends' ears with giant fluffy q-tips) or the lack of any understanding of racial politics or identities in Latin America/Brazil (no matter the color, everyone interacts the same) or rendering pointless character arcs (the cop Atsuko, Michiko's masochist lesbian friend, who is hunting Michiko but keeps assisting her and letting her escape, finally definitively breaks with her at the end, declaring Michiko dead to her, in one of the few moving scenes: 'the next time we meet, it'll be as strangers'. So *of course* in the final episode, Atsuko will go and free her again!) (Satoshi, the gang boss, seems to have some sort of goal or grudge, although he remains mostly a cipher despite enormous amounts of screentime, but of course he is killed before meeting Hiroshi) or bring out sudden swerves in plots (in a brief timeskip at the end, we find Hatchin living and working on her own... as a single mother. Despite Hatchin having been the only sensible character who worked hard or planned ahead in the series! Can we believe this? No, we cannot. Nor can we believe that Michiko somehow escapes from jail without anyone noticing and spends weeks refinding Hatchin, who is then going to go on wild road-trips with Michiko and her baby.) or are just pointless (Hiroshi, far from being some sort of Jay Gatsby figure, turns out to just be a loser who keeps scamming people and disappears as soon as they find him) (if Michiko isn't Hatchin's mother, who is? No answer is ever given and hardly anyone even asks) (what was up with those tomatoes anyway?).\\n\\n\r\nThe only two episodes which were any good was the bull-fighting episode, and the aforementioned Chinatown episode where the 'actress' rescues Michiko for Hatchin. (I was surprised to learn there were Chinatowns in Latin America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatowns_in_Latin_America I hadn't known there was significant Chinese emigration to any of those countries.)\\n\\n\r\nSo: the plot is boring and nonsensical; most of the characters uninteresting or undermined; the art would be OK if it ever changed; the music totally forgettable. It is a waste of an anime and worse than season 2 of _Kaiji_ or _Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro_.\\n",

            "content": "In a small Latin American town, a young girl dreams to be freed from her abusive foster parents. Her wishes come true when an escaped convict leaps through the dinner room window on a teal motorbike and asks her to help her find her mysterious father. Together, they travel the distance to find a man they thought they knew while experiencing the barren but lively existence shared by their fellow countrymen.\r\nIt's been a few seasons since the last promising title in this genre popped up--and Michiko to Hatchin certainly lives up to expectations. With deep Latin American vibes and subtle storytelling, the series manages topull the audience in for a look at several storylines loosely tied together through Michiko's (the vixen convict) past. While their search for Hatchin's father--Michiko's former lover--provides a stimulus for their journey, it acts more as a literary tool to pull the characters through a myopic look at the lives of their fellow countrymen. It is difficult for me to find a favorite among the subplots as they all took a decently honest and heartfelt look at how people in less developed nations survive--though I found the more dramatic subplots (i.e human trafficking) of rather mediocre execution.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko and Hatchin act as foils for one another: Michiko, the adult, acts childish and impulsive while Hatchin, the child, behaves responsibly. Most reviewers seemed to enjoy this chemistry but I found it lukewarm and underdeveloped. While Hatchin's character failed to impress(her relationship with her abusive parents never felt present and her \"maturity\" seemed a pretentious addition), Michiko was developed extensively throughout the series and the characters associated with her past succeeded in hooking my attention. In fact, I personally preferred watching the minor characters in the series--their stories were deeply entrenched in their impoverished situations, yet the livelihood with which they confronted adversity became truly inspirational.\\n\\n\r\nThe series boasts a strong soundtrack and voice acting, nicely echoing an image of a boundless road, sprawled before Michiko, Hatchin, and the people they met. The Latin traces are very apparent in the bold color schemes: cyan skies splashed with vivid turquoise and deep reds. The combination of brilliant sound and great animation certainly makes this anime worth watching, even if it falls short of the true geniuses in the genre (see Cowboy Bebop + Samurai Champloo). So be sure to check this out for a look at something different than your run-of-the-mill titles!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. After a quick check, Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo fame was indeed involved in the soundtrack. Sayo Yamamoto, who directed Michiko to Hatchin, also played an important role in the making of Samurai Champloo. Good to see that these people are still making shows >3.\\n\\n\r\nwritten for Minitokyo's Newsletter: MT-Maigetsu",

            "content": "Michiko to Hatchin, taking place somewhere in an eccentric, sandy, and unpredictable South American setting closely resembling Brazil, follows Michiko Malandro, a sexy and aggressive convict on the run, and 10 year old Hana Morenos, a shy, pale, mild mannered young girl living under the wing of a cruel foster family which has made her life a constant struggle for as long as she can remember. In a meandering and heart pumping trek across various South American cities filled with adventure, tragedy, and bloodshed, the unlikely duo stick together led by one common goal; the hope of finding Hiroshi Morenos, the man who Michiko fellhopelessly in love with before being sent off to prison many years ago, and the father who Hana had the chance to meet. Along the way, the two deal with a wide variety of characters in the various towns they stop in, ranging from a psychedelic underground surgeon, a child sex-trafficking ring disguised as a group of traveling circus performers, and various men from Michiko and Hiroshi's past as members in the infamous Monstro gang.\\n\\n\r\nThe somewhat episodic nature of this show, which in turn leads to a variety of characters and side stories found within it, will ultimately lead some to believe that the show has no direction, or is plagued with inconsequential filler. However, in most cases, these arcs add a lot to the overarching story, as the world building and character development achieved in them are an invaluable part of Michiko to Hatchin's success, and are usually quite entertaining in their own right. With each stop on the path to finding Hiroshi, as the two characters go off on their separate paths (only to begrudgingly meet up when it's time to move on), they find themselves in a variety of dangerous, romantic, and humorous situations. By these means, the viewer gets a glimpse into their heads that we ultimately wouldn't get a chance to experience without the 'episodic' nature the show lends itself to; we're forced to see how both Hana and Michiko behave and adapt to various situations when they're not in the company of each other, and by these means, what would have otherwise stood out as a duo with opposite personalities, becomes a portrayal of two very unique characters in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the development of the main characters that we get to see in this manner, an equally important aspect is the showcasing of the show's environment. The South American setting, an unfamiliar one to most anime fans, is expanded and broadened constantly by the various settings and personalities one comes across when following the escapades of the two; we see the ins and outs of each city, from the poverty stricken streets, to the underground gangs controlling everything from behind closed doors, to the struggle of the everyday man trying to earn a living, to the run-down apartments the characters are always staying in. Their portrayals, along with the show's detailed and distinct background art, jazzy latin style soundtrack, and beautiful character designs, do a great job of immersing the viewer into what would otherwise be an unfamiliar Latin American setting. \\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot itself is a solid one, though nothing mind-blowing. With each town the protagonists decide to rest in, we discover more and more clues regarding the whereabouts and backstory of their beloved Hiroshi, including many flashbacks explaining and highlighting his backstory as a powerful gang leader, which include some of the best scenes in the entire show. His shady history, and Michiko's quest to catch up with some of his old associates in a quest for clues to his whereabouts, make up most of what one would consider the show's \"central plot\". As the two delve deeper and deeper into things in a quest for the truth, and become more involved with various gangs, they find themselves facing an increasing amount of members who want their blood, and some who are after Hiroshi themselves. This dynamic, paired with the fact that the police are also after the two, makes for a fast paced story in which the characters are always on their toes, always ready to fight off or run from the various forces trying to bring them down.\\n\\n\r\nAlready having analyzed the show's strong points, there are a few flaws which need to be looked at with just as much conviction. Though they certainly weren't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the show, I couldn't help but feel that it could have been a lot better had a few glaring downsides been amended.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, and probably most disappointing considering the high production value and great character designs, were the action scenes. Despite the clever and suspenseful build-up leading to nearly each and every one of them, whenever the time came for shit to really hit the fan, the results were usually pretty underwhelming. These scenes had a overwhelming amount of mood ruining asspulls, the nonexistence of any antagonist who can seem to properly aim a gun, (at least when they're shooting at Michiko) and everyone's favorite, a police force chock full of bumbling idiots. The scenes which could have been a series of heart-pounding climaxes are usually done in a fairly uncreative manner, and they usually rely on the same exact tricks and situations as the last one; frankly, they felt lazy. Not over-the-top enough to make you really drop your jaw, but at the same time, not realistic enough to demand much attention from the viewer. Seeing as how this show took place in a setting dominated by cold blooded, gun wielding gang members, it's a pity that the action scenes couldn't have been stronger, and it definitely took some air out of the sails for me as the adventure went along.\\n\\n\r\nWhile my second gripe might seemingly be a bit of a contradiction considering the praise I gave the show's episodic nature earlier, I felt that they did a poor job of connecting the story arcs. While it may have just been an unavoidable consequence of the way the story was told, we'd often find one adventure end, only to find the characters in a completely different situation by the time the next episode started. Without getting specific, there are a few times where the stories just didn't seem to get enough closure, and the viewers are frustratingly thrust into a sort of \"square one\" type situation, where all previous events are forgotten, and our heroes are just on the road again per usual. Whether it's the result of the episodic structure, the 22 episode allotment, or just a case of bad directing, I would have appreciated a bit more flow between the individual stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other flaw I wanted to bring up is difficult to describe without spoiling anything, but I found the pacing in the final two episodes to be uncharacteristically rushed, with an ending that just didn't seem to match the tone from the rest of the series, and one that left a bad taste in my mouth, despite being adequate.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin is a show that managed to set the stage for an amazing story, with a set of likable and in-depth characters, brilliant thematic music and art, and a fantastic, believable atmosphere. While these strong points weren't exploited to their fullest thanks to a few pacing issues and some lacking action scenes, they make for one hell of an adventure that really shines when it shines, even if it's dragged down by a few murky moments.",

            "content": "Sayo Yamomoto, now somewhat well-known for her more recent show, Yuri on Ice, had her directorial debut with Michiko to Hatchin. After her infatuation with Latin American film and a trip to Brazil, she unleashed her creativity with a show about an escaped convict trying to reunite a gangster's daughter with her mysterious father. While there is an overarching plot, many episodes are spent in an unrelated locale, developing the characters and the setting and allowing the show to truly feel alive.\r\nThe art is stunning, both with its fluid animation and color composition (particularly in the OP). Action scenes are well-choreographed, and backgrounds suit eachepisode well. The characters consistently change outfits (sometimes multiple times in a single episode), again helping the show feel true to life. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST of this show is top-notch, blending club bangers like \"Papo Cafajeste\" with mellow, bossa tunes like \"Ritmo suado\" seamlessly. The OP is jazzy and colorful, the ED a feel-good tune to soothe the viewer after any particularly emotional episodes. In addition, the voice actors made each character feel alive, helped in large part by enlisting live-action actors (Ohgo Suzuka for Hatchin, Sakai Maki for Atsuko, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nEvery character served a purpose, whether it be for the development of the main cast or simply to inject yet another dose of realism into the show. Any character shown on-screen is unique and has their own moral dilemmas and motivations, but the viewer is often left to interpret these for themselves, a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't enjoyed a show as much as this in actual years, anime or otherwise. The strong female cast, the unorthodox setting (for an anime), the stellar script-writing from Ujita Takashi, it all coalesces into a near-perfect show. I have extremely minor qualms with it (namely deus ex machina that occurred several times), but I'm willing to overlook these in sense of the larger focus on the cast and their journey.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Highly recommended to fans of compelling female casts, Sayo Yamomoto, and loosely episodic series (a la Samurai Champloo) \\n\\n",

            "content": "Michiko to Hatchin was a pleasant surprise. After reading a few short reviews I was intrigued by the fact that a lot of people pointed out how the series turned out to be a much deeper drama rather than a simple action-driven anime that they were expecting.\r\nI was not disappointed. If you are looking for a series with interesting, complex characters, do not miss this. In fact, I will be go further and say that you should watch Michiko to Hatchin. \r\nThis series features some of the most deep and complex character portrayals I have ever seen in an anime. Be warned - the directorsdon't go to great lengths to explain characters' thoughts or motivations behind their actions and I see this is a huge plus. This ambiguity is what makes this story come alive and seem so believable - it is how we see people around us in real life - often strange, often unpredictable and hard to explain. Some episodes will leave you pondering and thinking \"why\", and like any great work of art most of us will come to different conclusions. This puts M&H to the top among the classics in my books.\\n\r\nThe story itself is not very original, it is quite simple and some episodes try to lighten the mood with side-stories that feel a little out of place. In a few rare places, it almost feels like directors tried a bit too hard to make this anime more appealing to the general crowd and gave it some attributes that it could have done without. For example, I couldn't help but wonder why so many characters have Japanese first names? Given that the story is set in an imaginary Latin American country, this detail is most peculiar.\\n\r\nIn general, I felt like the characters held the whole thing together, their presence compensated for some gaps in the plot and I was literally glued to the screen until the very last episode.\\n\r\nIt would be harsh not to mention what great job Manglobe has done here. Animation style is original and suits the setting very well, the music is superb and character designs are extremely well made. Without their creative touch this series wouldn't have been this good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I give M&H a 10. It is definitely one of the best series in the past decade and it has the substance to rival some of the greatest series ever made. It is a must see for all anime fans out there.",

            "content": ":STORY:\r\nThe story for this series is fantastic. What I seem to be noticing is that anime sort of has a niched appeal, which is okay. However, the problem is that those who are responsible for creating the anime are more responsible for putting in the stylistic elements in anime that anime fans enjoy than creating a piece of literature that can benefit humanity. This series, however, transcends that and truly is a piece of artwork that pays no loyalty to the traditional standards of what makes anime entertaining, but rather is loyal to getting the creator's message across in the most effective way possible. Inthis case his message is made quite well and movingly with this episodic story of a young girl and her hot, recently discovered biological mother search for the young girl's father. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the first clues that the the message was in fact made effectively is that the message can't be summarized very easily. What this means to me, is that every element of each episode is entirely necessary and has a purpose, and the message can't be made without them. Each run-in with a gang, or dealings with a stripper trying to escape, or a brief affair with a married man who smokes, all play a role to where the meaning of the series wouldn't be the same without each.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed it's discretion in the area of comedic relief. Nothing drives me up the wall in an anime than excessive and unnecessary humor, ESPECIALLY when it cuts off a serious moment that potentially could have a beautiful and lasting effect. This didn't have any of that but rather allowed the dark and depressing be dark and depressing and poking in some sophisticated humor only when it was due and this allowed it's emotional effect to be that much more poignant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is very literary and riddled with symbolism, and makes for an entertaining and moving story. It's one flaw might come from being too dense to where some meaning might get loss in translation or forgotten.\\n\\n\r\n:ART:\\n\r\nAnother spectacular aspect of this series. The character design, the setting, the colors, they all work together to set the perfect mood for the corresponding situation in the story. The environment, being in the colorful central america/south america was vibrant and beautiful to look at. All the characters finally evolve from the tired out, generic, ethnic-neutral style of other animes, and their appearance fits their character and personalities to a T. \\n\\n\r\n:SOUND:\\n\r\nI usually don't even bother with tihs section, but it is worth mentioning the soundtrack, written by the great Japanese neo-jazz group: SOIL and PIMP sessions. Like everything else discussed so far, the jazzy, dynamic soundtrack fits what's going on and works so perfectly with the tones throughout.\\n\\n\r\n:CHARACTER:\\n\r\nThere are so many memorable characters in this series, and not one of them is flat. All of their behaviors, as it pertains to their character is so over the top in a good way. It's almost surreal the way the characters behave and look and it's so wonderful to watch. \\n\\n\r\n:ENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nIt's true that one sort of has to have a mature sense of film and art to fully appreciate this series fully ( I hope that doesn't sound too pretentious or stuck up). It's not exactly a laid-back watch either, and somewhat requires your mind to interpret all that happens. By no means does that mean that there isn't enjoyment to be had, because absolutely there is enjoyment to be had by simply watching the drama and the emotional journey. I do recognize that in art series like this, there is a little more difficulty in pure entertainment, but I can't deny how invigorating this series is.\\n\\n\r\n(I'm sold after watching Ergo Proxy and now this, these guys need to come to America and make a film. It'll go over like gangbusters.)",

            "content": "This is an Anime I've been looking forward to watching since I read about it: the action taking place in Brazil, chocolate skinned heroine, different characters (you hardly find an anime with latino or afro foreigners playing so many good roles..Let's not speak about  some exceptions, for they make the rule true u_u), interesting story...You could get me hooked by less than that, people 8D!\r\nSo, where do I start?\r\nThe incredible Michiko that I've liked from the beginning to the end? This bombshell has got will, brain, so much guts and na\u00efve feeling of love. The way she's so wild, she knocks and she fightsback..wow. I wish women with more personality like this would run more often in the Anime stories. Also, I found her funny: she made me smile whenever she's fighting with Hatchin, giving some back to antagonists and ignoring horny guys all the way.\\n\\n\r\nHatchin? Wouuuuh >_< I luved her. I luv luv luv this character, whether her appearance, her personality or her troublesome relationship with Michiko. She's a responsible fighter for a 10 yrs-old girl. I also liked the fact that she didn't get involved emotionally with the whole father story. Besides, she's cute u_u and even when she is older, she's cuter 8D\\n\\n\r\nThe story? Well, a relaxing exotic purpose to stay on the road on a motorcycle, be part of gangs' wars, get involved with other people's life or in the other way, passing by when you could have helped. The story is good even though I felt the writers could have come with better stuff and episodes if they weren't committed to the one-little-story-per-episode. In addition to this, I was expecting the end and it came as I figured it out..I knew the writers wouldn't screw up the scenario just to please happy-endings-moods. Besides, let's face it: an anime showing kids who hold guns and kill, grownups who abuse children in so many ways and people killing each other in the same way they'd say \"hello\"  can't have a clean end O_o.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko e Hatchin sets my motorcycle dream on fire and makes me feel good, either about my life or about the world we're living in. It makes me want to visit dirty Brazil and witness more of the other sides of things ^^. It's a pleasant exotic and original anime with impressing main characters and good homie supporting ones",

            "content": "This anime was a breath of fresh air. In anime there's so many things you can do with a story and characters buy sometimes it's good to see a realistic setting (other than Japan) with (semi) realistic action and adventure. The dub really gave a feel to this anime the sub didn't.\r\nMichiko and hatchin starts off with them on a quest to find hatchins father Hiroshi, sound familiar? It's more so about the ride and how the characters develop than an actual plot. Most episodes can standalone and still make sense of the story. Maybe 2 episodes kind of felt dragged but they were needfor character development so its not a big deal.\\n\\n\r\nThis series gives off a very bebop/champloo feel in the atmosphere. Action is present but is not the main focus of the anime. You'll appreciate it when it comes with how well its done.The colors and backgrounds are some so well which seems like a lost cause in some anime. Not only was their variety in scenery but the character designs were some of the best in a while as well.\\n\\n\r\nMany thimgs make this series great and antagonists is one of them. Love them or hate them in the end you may h\u00e0ve mixed emotions for them. From the police to the thugs it shows how violence and power can corrupt people and does a damn good job of that. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I give this ani e a 8.7/10 with its uniqueness and staying true to what it was to the end. If youre looking for a realistic action type series you may be disappointed but going in with a clear head you may love it as well",

            "content": "Well well well here goes my first MAL short and sweet (SS) review! Let's hope I'm not rambling anything so here is how I'll go...\r\nIf you are an action addict like me and only came here to see whether this is a great action anime look somewhere else but if you somewhat happen to want to delve yourself into an adventure that has some outstanding characterisation, art and sound set in Brazil (it's Brazil! What a change of setting for once!) then this might be that hidden gem you're looking for. \r\nStory 7/10\r\nAs the summary by MAL suggests this anime tells us of the adventureof two characters Michiko and Hatchin on a quest to find Hiroshi, a runaway. Now, this mediocre story sounds common right? Much like Samurai Champloo if you ask me but nonetheless everything is different in this anime... What I love about this story is the fact that it teaches you things about life along the way...especially the end. Life isn't a straight-line. This anime takes on a more realistic approach on things - one of the most realistic I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely fantastic. No doubt the visuals are appealing and the setting and surroundings reflect the themes portrayed in the show as well as the culture. Character designs are unique and very different to the \"usual\".\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is flawless imo. With a south-american influence no doubt was it catchy when it needed to be and boy was the OP song enjoyable. I always skip intro songs but in this anime it was an exception. The jazzy, hip hop and south american feels made me feel lost in enjoyment which steered away the anime intentions but it was that good! Music usually increases my enjoyment by a 3-fold in anime and as a musician by hobby I thoroughly enjoyed some tracks in this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nCharacterisation was above your average. Need I say more? The chemistry between Michiko and Hatchin was entertaining yet intriguing. I do believe some characters should have had a bit more screen time just so the audience could figure things out for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the journey and am glad I stuck through...if this anime had more action...alot more action this anime would be a 10/10 based on my preferences which is rather ignorant. No doubt this anime isn't one to skip or underrate. Manglobe studios did a marvellous job in this one. To sum it up it's experimentation at it's finest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10",

            "content": "Michiko to Hatchin was a fun romp through the various slums and deserts of fictional Latin American locales as Michiko and Hana press on their journey to find Michiko's ex-lover and Hana's biological father, Hiroshi Morenos. The series proved to be quite realistic in its exploration of the various locales within the series where crime and poverty are rampant with the police not able to do enough in halting both. Town streets are worn-down and derelict as a result of the nonstop crime and poverty faced within such slums and people resort to crimes such as child smuggling and drug trafficking to get by withinthe world of Michiko to Hatchin. Considering the harsh details I've heard about life within Latin and South America, I was quite impressed with how believably this series explored such issues.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Michiko to Hatchin does do enough in fleshing out the show's prominent characters (Hana, Michiko, Atsuko and Satoshi) and whatever conflicts they face as they become connected to Hana and Michiko's search for Hiroshi. In particular, Hana and Michiko's bond is the central focus of the series making for both humorous and touching moments as they are frequently at odds with one another due to how different they are in personality and thinking, yet are the best thing both have had in their lives due to their harsh pasts. Adding to the show's comedy are episodes where the duo encounter some over-the-top characters within town slums such as a crackpot doctor, an eccentric Chinese restaurant cook and a cross-dressing opera singer.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's plot is mostly linear as Hana and Michiko journey in finding clues pertaining to Hiroshi's whereabouts, as well as some fillers where the two encounter said crazy characters and some focus on Atsuko's past. The show isn't afraid at making things become intense as Michiko and others get into some dangerous territory while confronting thugs, the police, assassins and mobsters leading to some crazy action sequences with car chases and gun fights. These scenes are quite fluid and jaw-dropping to see onscreen as vehicles and characters move smoothly enough during intense moments.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the presentation, the visuals of Michiko to Hatchin are bright and full of detail in depicting the various town slums and deserts that Michiko and Hana travel through. Such detail also went into character designs as they were designed in various ways, from being black to Mexican to fat to ugly to attractive. The soundtrack consisted of Latin and Carribean style musical choices such as salsa and jazz that fit perfectly well with the show's Latin American-like setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't without its imperfections. The show's first episode had the annoying habit of overemphasizing Hana's family abuse problems and the ending felt rather lackluster in addressing Hana's new life with Hiroshi due to the lack of background on his character. There are also some plot holes that the show doesn't bother to address such as who Hana's mother was, how Hana got her stomach tattoo and what ever happened to an assassin that helped Michiko towards the end of a later episode.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these gripes, Michiko to Hatchin made for a fun and touching comedy-drama thanks to the chemistry between Hana and Mitsuko, as well as their encounters with various criminals and crazy characters within various Latin American slums. This was one of the better unlicensed anime titles I've had a chance of seeing as of late.",

            "content": "What would you get if you crossed Thelma & Louise with City of God? You may get complete drivel, or you may, if you're very lucky, get something like Michiko to Hatchin.\r\nManglobe, the production company (and the brains behind), Michiko to Hatchin, have really pushed the boat out with this anime. But then again, they're no strangers to success or quality, especially as they are the company responsible for Ergo Proxy and Samurai Champloo. The series was directed by Yamamoto Sayo and is effectively her first full time at the helm of a production, and whilst this may have been a gamble on the partof Manglobe, it's one that certainly paid off as Michiko to Hatchin has a certain \"fresh\" quality that I haven't seen in anime in a long time (not since Cowboy Bebop in fact).\\n\\n\r\nThe tale is about an escaped convict named Michiko Malandro and her quest to find her lost, and supposedly dead, lover Hiroshi Morenos. In order to achieve this, she \"kidnaps\" a girl who is supposedly Hiroshi's daughter, initially thinking that she would know where Hiroshi is. However the world has changed during her years in prison, becoming at times more brutal and less forgiving.\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to set this tale in a quasi-South American (Brazilian), country was a stroke of genius as the creators and director could do things that would never have been included had the show been given a more staid setting. In addition to this, the characters themselves are able to have that little bit more \"flair\" about them because of the setting, something that initially detracts from some of them until one realises that the gaudiness is all simply part of that character's persona - more on that later though.\\n\\n\r\nNow fans of Ergo Proxy and Samurai Champloo will know that Manglobe are able to produce some stunning visuals, and Michiko to Hatchin is no slouch in this department. From barren deserts to lush jungles, from slum shanties to sleek factories, the level of detail is excellent, and well above that of many recent titles. In addition to this, the various settings in which the story takes place have a certain realistic quality about them that belies the fact that this is an anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the  great scenery, the characters are extremely unique and well designed, again, adding to the sense of realism about the show. The leads and immediate supporting cast are individuals to a tee, with each character possessing a certain lifelike quality that many anime would find difficult to match.\\n\\n\r\nOne area where the show really excels is with the animation. It's rare to see such lifelike movement in anime, and in many ways the fluidity and natural motion in Michiko to Hatchin represents a step up from that of Samurai Champloo.\\n\\n\r\nSound is another area where this show works very well. The effects are extremely well chosen and choreographed, and while some may be overwhelming, this is actually purposeful because of the situations the characters may find themselves in. The music used throughout the series is atmospheric and refreshing, and is reflective of the Latin-American feel of the show. The OP, a track called \"Paraiso\" by the Japanese jazz band Soil & \"Pimp\" Sessions, is an excellent piece that harks back to the classic \"Tank!\" of Cowboy Bebop fame. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the ED, \"Best Friend\" by Karutetto, as it is a bit too \"boy-band\" for my tastes.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the truly great things about Michiko to Hatchin is actually the cast. Manglobe and Yamamoto took the somewhat surprising, move when they chose the actors, opting not for established traditional seiyuu but for established screen actors. However, this seemingly risky choice has paid off in spades for the series. Maki Yoko (Battle Royale II: Requiem, The Grudge), is extremely versatile as the sexy, pouting, hotheaded, and somewhat childish Michiko, whilst Ohgo Suzuka (Year One in the North, Memoirs of a Geisha), is truly excellent in the role of Hatchin as she provides a depth of character that is rare to find.\\n\\n\r\nWhich neatly brings us to the characters themselves. Michiko is willful, headstrong, selfish in the extreme, and very childish. Hatchin is somewhat shy and nervous, but also responsible, tidy, and hates laziness. Both leads are extremely well defined from the outset, something which is reinforced as the relationship between the two is extremely combative (the pair are effectively polar opposites). Others like the terrifying Satoshi Batista or the terrier-like (i.e. always chasing Michiko), Atsuko Jackson are also well defined from the start, and through the first few episodes it may be difficult to see how any of the characters are actually developing because of the strength of the characterizations.\\n\\n\r\nOne reason for this is because both Manglobe and Yamamoto decided against using normal anime practices for developing characters, and instead chose a far more realistic and subtle approach. One needs only to compare the relationship between Michiko and Hatchin (or even Michiko and Atsuko), at the beginning of the series, with their behaviour towards the end to see exactly how much they have developed as characters. An example of this is the fact that Michiko is initially very much an annoying, sexy, pouting, selfish jerk, however at the end of the series she reminds me of Balsa from Seirei no Moribito. Hatchin, Atsuko and Satoshi also undergo this extremely subtle development (you'll see how much by episode 20).\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series for many reasons, the main one being the fact that this is a show that is not afraid to show the casual brutality of its setting. There will be some out there who didn't like the way the series ended, however I found the conclusion to be very much in keeping with the essence of the series, whilst at the same time being far more realistic than the endings of most other anime.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin is a rarity in the medium, and should not be prejudged on the basis of one or two episodes. The complexity of each character, the harsh, unforgiving setting, the sometimes brutally real actions of individuals, and the extremely subtle development all serve to make this one of the best shows of 2008, and one of the best anime to appear in the last decade. At times Thelma & Louise, at times City of God, at times Laurel and Hardy, this anime possesses a style and flair that surpasses that of Samurai Champloo - a feat by any measure.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the quality of this series, and its previous titles, I'm rapidly becoming a fan of Manglobe.",

            "content": "In a world plunged into an immoral wasteland, it is often difficult to find friends and comrades that you can believe in. The cold brutality of the situation may be that you simply can\u2019t. But sometimes a slight glimmer of hope remains amid the tumult and chaos, that maybe perhaps you really do have a partner out there, a comrade that will stick with you and care for you to the very end.\r\nThe world depicted in \u201cMichiko to Hatchin\u201d is this wasteland, a setting fraught with greed and death amid the indigent and the impoverished. This is South America (Brazil), or rather a variation ofit. From the gritty alleys, to the squalid shanties and the lush and viridescent landscapes, Manglobe doesn\u2019t disappoint. The setting is not only a beauty to look at but is also something unique and rare that allows the show to take wing and travel regions that are distinctive yet still within the realms of what was initially established. Through this director Yamamoto is able to channel the genius of Watanabe and the result is something unlike any other that challenges and perhaps even surpasses works such as Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo.\\n\\n\r\nThe story chronicles the lives of mainly Michiko Malandro, an escaped convict on a desperate hunt to find a supposedly dead man that was once her everything and Hana Morenas nicknamed Hatchin, the apparent daughter of this man and who Michiko initially thinks is the ultimate clue to helping her achieve her goal. The premise is set, but the main plot is less prominent than what many would expect. In this show it is merely used as a device to tie in many self-contained stories together and give the show a satisfactory conclusion because ultimately this show isn\u2019t about the goal, it never was. The show is about the journey and the bonds that are broken and healed along the way. And the stubborn, immature Michiko along with the self-righteous, mature Hatchin are characters real and charming enough to carry you through this journey and not let you go. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has an astounding soundtrack that lives and breathes nearly as much as the characters do. The energetic soundtrack fits every beat and every pulse of this high-powered train ride, yet also smoothly transitions towards a more melancholy nature when the situation calls for it. Through this the music is able to create remarkable scenes of raw emotion and immeasurable charisma that echo and persist long after you have finished the show. The animation is no slouch in its department either. One of the reasons why Michiko and Hatchin feel so startlingly real is that they look and move like real people as well and while there are times where the animation quality may drop, it still stays very consistent throughout and lends to an experience that is both aesthetically pleasing and emotionally stimulating.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately this is a series that as well as examining the lengths in which people would go to accomplish their goals, more importantly looks at the bonds that are formed during that time. Michiko and Hatchin go on a dangerous adventure together as a tornado of a tag team, and through this are able to form a relationship that overcomes the trials and tribulations that come their way and even the long and arduous chasm created by time. It is a bond both honest and deep that lies in juxtaposition with the superficial and vapid bonds congesting the streets of Brazil, a strong bond of indomitable love and unending trust. And though there are many instances throughout the series where the two characters pull each other down with their flawed personas to the extent that you would think they are better off without each other, it becomes evident later on how much they need one another, how much more they are able to accomplish with each other as their platforms. The show does well to depict two sides of a relationship, one of anger and disarray during quarrels and also one of a serene and resonant beauty during the rare moments of an embrace and while the show is far from deep or a riddled literary piece of work, it does well to show the power of friendship and love in a realistic manner and the way in which it is able to travel the void of time and always be there right when you need it, proving that love is far from a burden, but rather a privilege. The privilege of being responsible for another.\\n\\n\r\nSayo Yamamoto\u2019s first work is by no means perfect, but through its unique setting, remarkable soundtrack and captivating characters, she is able to construct a show filled with raw emotions and a flaring style constituting to a heartening, disturbing and riveting journey that in my book is nothing less than a masterpiece.  \\n",

            "content": "Anime that are set out of Japan whilst not as uncommon as many may think are still few and far between but what is even more rare is an anime that takes place in Latin America. Michiko to Hatchin is representative of everything that is uncommon but amazing about the anime industry: it has style, nice characters, a unique setting and a vast array of themes, and whilst at times it is harsh it never forgets to be light-hearted in its ingenuity.\r\nMichiko to hatchin's story is rather unusually executed; my original impressions was that the series was episodic but upon completion that statement was afairly inaccurate description, but in saying that I still find that each episode is 'episodic' in its own way. Each episode does contribute to the story being told, but interestingly enough they also provide detail on many background details: such as the lives of a group of kids growing up in the slums Sao Paulo, or even settling in on the business motives of an organized crime network hosting a bullfighting tournament or a prostitution ring etc etc...\\n\\n\r\n To its credit these many moments scattered throughout the series helped maintain my interest throughout the series entirety; each scenario was new and refreshing, each life had something different to offer. Unfortunately, criticisms still need to be considered, as whilst all these many moments managed to pique my interest. I could only feel that they somehow seemed to be a foot-hold in grabbing the viewers attention because the actual story seems kind of trivial in comparison to many of the side-stories.\\n\r\n This observation still only further justifies why i believe this series to be good, as it came up with such a variety of side-stories that managed to maintain a consistently high level of quality, that made the long journey all the more worth it in the end.\\n\\n\r\n One thing that I wanted to point out upon entering this series, is that at the period of time in which Michiko to Hatchin is set. Brazil was going through a revolution. I was personally a little disappointed when I discovered that this series covered very little of that historic event. Not to discredit the series for this because instead of doing that, it's vivid portrayal of life in Brazil at the time seems particularly plausible and in many ways makes up for my disappointment. Underneath every garbage bin and behind every building, the place oozes with a deep sinister corruption. Everything from the police cover-ups and false justifications, money laundering, prostitution, you name it, this series probably has it.\\n\\n\r\n A positive to all this, is that the series doesn't try to make a bad name out of all of this. It simply lets its vision unwrap itself never bombarding its audience with moral preaching. This is the lives of these people, are they happy with it? Maybe, maybe not, but at least they are making a living out of what they got, and if what they have is morally ambiguous then why not use its absolute best.\\n\\n\r\n The actual story whilst being rather trivial as I mentioned earlier is twisted around with the many side-stories adding a bit to the series worth. What irks me though is the motivations behind the foundation of the story, our main character Michiko being one of the soul main characters comes across as ditzy and in many ways, really gullible which does little to help with story progression, and most of the story is moved forward by side-characters.\\n\\n\r\n Even with these criticisms, I still must say that Michiko to Hatchin's ending is probably one of the best conclusions to an anime series that I have ever encountered. One problem I have found with many shows is that they take too long to conclude or the exact opposite where they don't have a conclusion. Michiko to Hatchin falls fair and square into the middle. Covering everything that it had previously established and no noticable plot threads are left unresolved without seeming to rushed or too slow. \\n\\n\r\n One of the most notable things about Michiko to Hatchin's story is its interesting cast. The show takes the time and effort to construct a diverse quantity of personality and character traits. I do have a couple of issues with some minor and the main characters, some minor characters (not many) are occasionally used as plot conveniences but even these characters still get some level of development. Emphasizing that this series waste's no time in establishing its characters personalities, ambitions and motivations, which is certainly a good thing.\\n\\n\r\n One of the best things about watching this series was watching Michiko and Hatchin's characters develop as the series played out, they're an unusual and possibly eccentric combination of mother and daughter. Many times I began to wonder if they are even related, like at all, but as a member of the audience, I could feel a relationship present, whilst being slightly unorthodox it was not an impossible relationship to envision. It is entertaining to watch as they interact, learning from each others mistakes. Watching the unusually mature Hatchin take care of the naively reckless but caring Michiko, and vice-versa.\\n\\n\r\n My complaints with some of the characters, are that their motivations are occasionally very vague. A good example would be some of the interactions between Michiko and Atsuko, a few of the outcomes from there encounters are occasionally poorly explained and sometimes a little stupid. Without giving away any spoilers, there was one particular scene where I was screaming at Atsuko in my head for not carrying out a particular action that she had tried so hard to achieve but in the end didn't carry it out. The reason? Well I might have missed it because the motivation behind it was sort of precarious but the consequences for iit rendered their reasons completely arbitrary.\\n\r\n Our main character Michiko isn't without fault either, very prone to some questionable actions throughout the series, chasing someone who is clearly trying to get away from her just seems to be a motivation that is slightly beyond my comprehension.\\n\r\nOther than these complaints it was an interesting cast nonetheless and despite these people's shortcomings, these actions (even the ones that I previously mentioned) never felt out of character and becomes a small plus in my book.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art whilst not anything spectacular is very clean and this quality is constant throughout the entirety of the series. The most notable moments are seen in the many action sequences. Each scenes choreography was well animated rarely ever resorting to cheap techniques (and if the series did they were very well disguised). Each scene had a fluidity all on its own, it was fast-paced when it needed to be, retrospectively it was slow when demanded and normal between these many moments. Each frame never felt out of place when actions were being displayed. I mention this because the sheer breadth and style of the many action sequences in this series never lets up and the art knows how to dictate the adrenaline pumping moments and thus contributes to the series well-established atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\n  One of the best things about Michiko to Hatchin is the background designs. Never before have I seen a 3rd world/2nd world country presentation as detailed than I have in Michiko to Hatchin (with a possible exception of \"Flag\") in an anime/manga series. Everything from the large open spaces accompanying a desolate road; to the slum, crime ridden districts of Brazil's many cities, towns and communities. The level of detail that goes into many of the locations emphasize the tensions building in each district and community.\\n\\n\r\n The character designs across the board are very commendable, and I loved how all the characters have a degree of acceptable realism to them. Whilst Michiko the main lead has a busty accentuated figure, her figure is complimented by the shows diverse characters and as mentioned previously with their large range of personalities, the same can be said for each character's designs. Figures often appear in a versatility of chubby, well-groomed and formal, poor and hungry, old and young character types. Serving to make the characters far more relatable, increasing the series impact.\\n\\n\r\nOne particular aspect of the art that I wish to take into consideration is actually the opening and ending credits. One thing I loved about this series was the mesh of beautiful textures that I witnessed upon entering and leaving every episode. With a hint of photo-shop thrown into the blend of pseudo-phantasmagorical art reminiscent of a retro-American psychedelic hippie movement.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin's soundtrack is a well-made and thoroughly appropriate soundtrack with a collaboration of string instrumentals, mostly of the ukulele and acoustic guitar, with a common accompaniment of percussion instruments such as the timpani, bongos and such. A lot of the songs in the series ost are wildly and energetically presented, catering to the fun and adrenalin-soaked and occasionally sexually fused atmosphere that the series provides.\\n\\n\r\n Some of the tracks are particularly memorable, most notably the opening sequence with its bubbly bebop jazz style. Effectively melding its complex harmonics making it an absolute blast to listen to, with the show forcing me to listen to it every single time I started a new episode, and that is definitely a good thing.\\n\r\n Each track adequately sets the tone of each scene and never fails to boast an exciting entourage. Overall I see no reason to complain about the ost. It is effective, different and great to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show does have a couple of faulty points, where entertainment value can be somewhat lacking on a couple of occasions and at times I felt the characters make stupid decisions but they are few and far between. And as I mentioned before, rarely do those stupid decisions seem out of character, so if anything it helps benefit the series.\\n\r\n Altogether this series is a quality adventure taking place in an untouched landscape. It has a positively balanced story with non-repetitive scenario's, the show never tries too hard at what it does and loves to revel in its own world. It knows its limits and actively makes use of that boundary. It is a vision that is both refreshing and entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone who shares a delight in venturing into a world of interesting characters and constant thumping of a glorious beat in every background.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "Have you ever felt the need to watch an anime that butchers the Bechdel test in every episide, centered around two incredibly strong and well-rounded female characters? Then look no further. \r\nMichiko e Hatchin follows the two unlikely comanions on their journey to find a man from their pasts, and in the course of the show we see wonderfully written characters going through beautiful character development. \r\nThe two main characters - as well as many of the recurring characters - go through important character development, and it's so fabulously excecuted you don't really notice it until it hits you hard. \r\nAs well as being fullof female characters, the cast is diverse, showing a wast collection of characters from different races and backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the characters aren't everything in a show. The story is enjoyable and exciting and keeps your attention throughout the entire series. This is as much a story about finding oneself as it is about finding Hiroshi, maybe even more so. As both Machiko and Hatchin figure out who they are and what they want, the grow closer and learn the meaning of true love and understanding. \\n\\n\r\nThe story deals with various issues connected to living on the road, being poor, supporting a child etc., and it shows us that even an atypical family is a family, however small, and that even if you call yourself a family you may not actually be one. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Michiko e Hatchin is true feminist writing about finding oneself and eachother, and it's truly beautiful.",

            "content": "****As of Episode 11****\r\nStory - 9.1/10 (A-)\r\nFor the most part, the story brings you in from the first episode. A real good plot, some really well drawn out character backgrounds, a spice of latin flavor in each episode and the occasional boob shaking, finger flipping action, courtesy of Michiko. You're going to love the random yet plot focused action of the femine duo. Many twists and turns await, and as of episode 11, it's been a great ride.\r\nArt - 9.7/10 (A)\r\nWell, i haven't seen such colorful designs in..never. Each episode brings something as unimportant (Ex. Shoes, TV's, a gas station) to life. This has somethingto do with the setting, a great choice by the creator. You'll be amazed how well each piece of setting and backdrop is well animated. Michiko's design of a bad girl convict shows itself from the very beginning.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.3/10\\n\\n\r\n--OP/ED Theme: 9.0/10\\n\r\nThe Opening theme is a latin-flavored beat, &quot;Paraiso&quot; by Soul &amp; Pimp Sessions, it really shows the cultural stance of Michiko to Hatchin. An upbeat, fiesta that can show that a non-vocal song can be just as good as a vocal one. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ending theme brings the show down to a mellow, humble stop with &quot;Best Friend&quot; by Karutetto (Quartet). A moving song with a variety of different drawings in each part of the ending, something that can really leave you (almost) in tears. Beautifully well sung, the adding vivid images that accompany it also well done.\\n\\n\r\n--BGM: 8.3/10\\n\r\nThe BGM is really well played, from the town on the outskirts to the strip bar scenes, it blends well. Some of the lesser bgm will probably leave your mind the next episode, but it's still good while it lasted.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8.9/10\\n\r\nThere's a shortage of characters but the one's i can name are really well done. Aitsuko, the police chief and a (former) friend to Michiko, another bad girl cop with a no-nonsense attitude, how someone like her and Michiko ever became friends is still a mystery to me. Every character has a purpose for being there, and Michiko to Hatchin is one of those shows where they all come together in their own seperate and uniquely different ways. Now we have members of Monstro, including Satoshi. He's a real charmer..right. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Conclusion/Enjoyment - 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin is a show with a great future and a greater chance of becoming a hit show with a cult following, no doubt. It has the basic components that make a show and more. Only 6 episodes in, and i can tell you it's good and you WANT more. While every show that has been deemed &quot;perfect&quot;, it's highly unlikely. Every show has faults, Michiko to Hatchin is no exception. However, it's cultural upbringing and remarkable characters along with the homely latin-flavored music can easily overcome those tiny faults. If you want a change, vote Michiko to Hatchin (pun intended).\\n\\n\r\nOverall(Averaged): -8.8/10 (B+)",

            "content": "\"Michiko e Hatchin\" is a hybrid between Brazilian and Japanese culture that is best compared at first as a \"Cinderella\"/\"Prisoner 701 Scorpion\" mix, however the episodes that follow seem more like a Thelma and Louise story arch accept it's a mother daughter combo.  \"City of God\" was also mentioned by another reviewer and it's hard not to compare the Braziling like gang violence that occurs throughout this series. These comparisons are really loose references though, considering Michiko and Hana's relationship became much more dynamic as the series progressed. The artwork is very vibrant and fun, and the music has a spicy Brazilian edge andkeeps the tempo of this fast paced action drama melodically interesting.\\n\\n\r\nBackground Info:\\n\\n\r\nSayo Yamamoto's debut as a head director is full of promise. Yamamoto is no stranger to smash hits as he has directed episodes of Samurai Champloo, Eureka Seven and Ergo Proxy. Shinichiro Watanabe himself the director of \"Cowboy Bebop\" is lending a hand for his friend by producing the Music, and Seiki Tamura the art director of \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" and the Background art director of \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\", \"Princess Mononoke\" and \"The Grave of the Fireflies\" helps make this production definitely something that needs to be watched. \\n\\n\r\nStory and Character Analysis:\\n\\n\r\nAt the center of this anime is a story about a society in which two little girls  are forced to grow up early due to abuse and a world that won't let them have a childhood. Michiko(mother) and Hana(daughter) are both subjected to physical and mental torture from a young age. For Michiko, the need for love and reconciliation from the one person whom she believed loved her, husband Hiroshi, was originally the driving force to her existence.  Michiko deeply desired some normality in her life, since she was forced as a little girl to grow up fending for herself. The normal future that was ripped away from her by a crime syndicate was something she never forgot. This dynamic later switches from Hiroshi to her daughter Hana. \\n\\n\r\nHana's search for her father is one part escaping her original dismal and abusive situation but eventually evolves into a quest to gain her mothers love and some since of family. Through out this story the mostly painful relationship between her and Michiko occurs mostly because of Michiko's selfish nature and Hana's protective personality. The mother/daughter angst story arc plays out right until the end and made the series feel completed and more realistic in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe little criticism I do have revolves mostly around the other underdeveloped story arc's which included subtle but sometimes blatant lesbian implications. Definitely a story that can be appreciated by feminists, me included. \\n\\n\r\nGreat Series!\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show came out in October 2008\u2026\u2026..and yet I just found out about it or know its existence 4-5 years later. I did a little research about the show and wonder a few things about it, such as it was made by Manglobe, the same production studio who brought another favorite anime of mine, Samurai Champloo, and also it was the first anime directed by a newcomer by the name of Sayo Yamamoto, who later on went to direct Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine (which I heard good things about, although I don\u2019t keep track on the franchise) and I can seeit as a spiritual cousin to both Champloo & Cowboy Bebop with a Latin / Jazz flavor mixed in.\\n\\n\r\nHatchin is a girl raised by strict foster parents who has long given up her dreams of freedom. Michiko is a sexy criminal who escapes from a supposedly inescapable prison. When she suddenly enters Hana's life, these two very different women set off on a journey across a lawless land in search of a missing man from both their pasts.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this show does have similarities to the two shows I just mentioned earlier; most likely the former considering it is a type of show where the journey of finding this mysterious man named Hiroshi and traveling to the destination is more focused than the destination itself with these wild, crazy, and charismatic characters drawn in and the cities/towns they visit along the way. It\u2019s not really a show with a strong or overwhelming plot but it\u2019s more entertaining and thrilling where all you need is a simple premise but make it watchable on screen. As for the other surrounding factors, the anime is based more on realism than it seems with the cities, ghettos, rivers, deserts and of course, the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of that, I really loved the characters of Michiko and Hatchin as to me, they are like the badass and child pairing that wouldn\u2019t look right on the drawing board first, but it worked out. Michiko is like the female version of Mugen from Samurai Champloo with a bit of the same characteristics: A mysterious and dark past, someone who seems to be very unstoppable to anybody she faces, kind of an idiot to be around, and can be very harsh to their companion\u2026..at first. Hatchin or \u201cHana\u201d is that one character I was really rooting for to\u2026..well\u2026.survive. I wanted to say she\u2019s like Ed from Cowboy Bebop but she\u2019s actually more responsible than her and also the way she gets treated in the first 2 episodes by her foster family, I instantly wanted her to leave them because personally, I would\u2019ve left there sooner and knocking all of them out (and yes, I mean, all of them). Sure, Michiko is not actually World\u2019s Best Parent but she would be safer with her than them. Plus, the bond between them is very mother/daughter-like but the roles would be reserved and it\u2019s actually funnier that way. Other characters including Atsuko Jackson is the foil to Michiko mostly because she\u2019s always trying to catch her, yet she escapes and we all know that Atsuko has a soft spot for her as well, almost like the same connection as Michiko to Hatchin, a kindred spirit as you think about it.  In short, all of the characters do have their moments of clarity and rough development. Some may as innocent as you think or vice-versa, either way, they all evolve in some form.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, this is very scenic and gorgeous to gaze at and if this show was to ever air in HD, it would enhance the viewing pleasure. This is one of Manglobe\u2019s best looking shows to date, even better than most current shows (although the only shows from Manglobe I saw was Samurai Champloo, Deadman Wonderland, & House of Five Leaves) and let me remind you this was made in 2008 and I know it isn\u2019t vintage yet but it\u2019s something more unique than the usual anime and that\u2019s also been said before but it\u2019s true. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is another department where they succeed, especially with the opening, \u201cParadiso\u201d by SOIL&PIMP Sessions and this opening is very reminiscent of the classic anime opening, \u201cTank!\u201d from Cowboy Bebop and speaking of that, Shinichiro Watanabe happens to be the music producer of the series, which explains that Watanabe feel I was getting from the show itself. The music was by Brazilian musician Alexandre Kassin of The +2\u2019s and the background music is also very impressive with its blend of jazz, funk, psyche Delia & samba music. However, the ending theme wasn\u2019t bad, I just never think of that song when it comes to this series.\\n\\n\r\nNow, even though I am a dub watcher, I saw this in the sub\u2026\u2026mostly because this is no English dub (yet). As of the time of the review was written, FUNimation will release it this year with Monica Rial as the voice of Michiko & Jad Sexton as Hatchin. There isn\u2019t a clip of the dub released yet but the sub was an overall decent effort.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: I have found a new anime that really piques my interest and I really love this and I\u2019m pretty sure that when the dub comes out, I\u2019m going to love it as well but as of now, this is definitely a show I can recommend to most newcomers of anime and experienced watchers. \\n",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nWe often see in a lot of anime series either the same setting, Japan or an alternate apocalyptic distant future setting, well that happens most of the time in anime these days. Been a fan of anime I often ask myself: \"When are we going to see the setting of a story, crossing the Sea of Japan and reaching a different shore?\" Well Michiko to Hatchin is the answer. This series delivers in a single episode more of what you can see in anime these days, imagine all 22 episodes? The breathtaking locations, landscapes and scenarios are perfect; you will actually be transported into thisamazing country that has cultural traces from Brazil. I got to hand it to Sayo Yamamoto, this is her first directional debut, and what a job she has done, creating pure art. I am looking forward to see more of her work in the future. Studio Manglobe has done it again, form being highly involved in classics such as Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy, into creating one if not the best anime series this decade of 2000 has offered.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a story that focuses and tries to unite the two main character's differences into one goal. Suddenly everything becomes a wild adventure and you are there witnessing this entire phenomenal and unique bond between two people, despite the stepping-stones that awaits them in the road. The locations in the story left me speechless, there are scenes in rivers, deserts, cities, ghettos, and beautiful portrayed forest and jungles. You will see all kinds of characters in this story: from mafia syndicate leaders, to different kinds of gangs and hitmen, to robbers and cops, pimps and prostitutes, poor people and junkies. You will also see in the story unexpected characters to have good hearts, feelings and good intentions toward others. Every little detail in the story it is explain, there are no plot holes. The story is just to impressive and unique, even if it looks a little similar to the Hollywood film; Thelma and Louise, it's still way superior and also Michiko to Hatchin's story offers you way more, it is inspiring.  \\n\\n\r\n10 of 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Samurai Champloo's art and animation, then Michiko to Hatchin will not disappoint you, because basically it's the same people. Studio Manglobe did this series with passion and love, something they have done before. The art is superb and beautiful, almost like a goddess. Every character is treated unique in their art design. The action and adventure's art and animation is perfectly executed. Like watching Cowboy Bebop's or Samurai Camploo's art and animation, you never get tired because it's perfect. Thats why the animation clearly never fails in every episode. The opening of the series is very creative, it has a 70's and 80's style but really impressive and the colors used are stylish, like the series. The ending is not that colorful like the opening; it's a calmed and relaxing projection of the hidden side of the story. The landscapes they create and show you are literally the definition of art. You are transported into the scene, and you will believe that you are inside, because of how perfect this art and animation has been done.\\n\\n\r\n10 of 10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nEvery sound and music is perfectly sync and synchronized with every scene in the entire series. The seiyu in this series did one heck of a job, although the main cast is compose of more film actors than Seiyu, but they did a perfect job by lending their voices for those epic roles in this classic. Their voices match every character the play in the story. In this series when you hear gunshots the perception you feel is that they are real, because of how well the sound department has created them. The music composed is by a Brazilian music group called, Kassin + 2 and is also produced by Shinichiro Watanabe (Director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo). The music is great in the entire series, because it fits in every important scene. Kassin + 2 does a great job with the music taking us into the roots and lands of Brazil with their music. The opening theme: \"Paraiso\" by Soil & \"Pimp\" Sessions is a good song, it depends on your music taste, some might like it, and others might not. But if you liked the originality that Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts displayed in Cowboy Bebop's opening creating \"Tank\" then \"Paraiso\" will not be a disappointing song. The ending theme: \"Best Friend\" by Karutetto, is more passive than the opening, imagine the name says it all, but also a good song, also very original and not annoying. The sound and music of this series does not top the one in Ghost in the Shell SAC series or Eureka 7, but it takes another different direction, it takes you directly into the core of the cultural traces of Brazil.\\n\\n\r\n10 of 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things in a story, are the characters. Well let me tell you that in Michiko to Hatchin every character was literally develop to it's maximum. You never see a character get left behind in the story or plot like in other anime series. This is one of the great things that this series offers to it's viewers, also you get to see a lot of different points of views that every character offers you, so you can know him better thus in the end you can judge him differently. The names of all the characters are pretty solid and original. One of the main characters is named Hatchin (voiced by Suzuka Ohgo). She was a character that did deliver a solid performance, and left me speechless, she definitely earns a spot as one of the greatest characters in anime. All the characters are stylish; they have their own personalities and egos. Most of the characters in this story need innocence in order to prevail, that's something you see often in life. You will either feel a connection with one of the characters or one will automatically take you to feel his situation. That's how powerful the characters are develop in this story, they are memorable and not forgettable. One of the finest and best character developments I have seen since Cowboy Bebop.  \\n\\n\r\n10 of 10   \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that when you actually finish watching it, you will say I will put it again because every moment was enjoyable and unforgettable. The action scenes are highly enjoyable and never boring, you will see them over and over again. To the problems and situations the main characters get into, to the gun shots you see, to the fighting scenes, to the fast pace action car chases and to every detail you come across with. You will enjoy it and you will be asking for more at the same time, hoping it never ends. \\n\\n\r\n10 of 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI was thinking that Code Geass was basically the best series of this decade, but I was wrong. Upon discovering Michiko to Hatchin everything changed. This series is more than about freedom, it's about what we have in life and what do we do with it, and what it means to us every second and moment of our existence. Every episode teaches us something different about life, something you don't see frequently in anime these days. If you like Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, then think of Michiko to Hatchin as the fused version, of those two titans. Clearly Michiko to Hatchin takes a whole different direction in anime, going beyond and transcending what is called a classic masterpiece. That\u2019s why Michiko to Hatchin is the best anime series the 2000\u2019s has given us. It deserves to be called, the greatest anime of this decade.\\n\\n\r\n10 of 10\\n",

            "content": "After seeing the first few minutes of MtH, I hav enoticed the character design for Michiko. She doesn't look like 99.99% of anime girls (woman in her case) but she looks 99.99% better than them. The sexy, cute, strong, rowdy, independent woman is composed to perfection in her. And I am glad to say that she never uses her sex-appeal to get what she wants. \r\nAs you can probably see, Michiko is the strongest point in this anime, but that doesn't mean that the side characters are worthless. This is one of the handful of animes in which side-characters and \"villains\" have more depth inthem than 99.99% of the main characters in animes out there. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are times in the 22 episodes that can be so confusing that you just leave it be. Maybe it's because all the factions (including Michiko minus Hatchin) are folks who were born on the very bad side of life. But this is a good thing as well since it doesn't give the viewer a generic \"black and white\" that they have seen hundreds of times already.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, it's great. The characters move fluidly; The camera angles are perfect; the action scenes are strong. Music-wise, the music fits the poverty stricken side of Latin-America. And of course, the story. It's realistic and feels like real life which just makes the title feel different from your run of the mill anime. And yes, it does feel like Cowboy Bebop, except that MtH is a more realistic version of that.",

            "content": "_M&H_ is an adventure anime featuring a young orphaned girl Hatchin who is kidnapped from her foster parents by an escaped felon to look for her father, Hiroshi McGuffin. They travel from town to town in a quasi Mexico-Brazil, searching for him while evading the police; invariably, they discover the princess is in another castle and must leave town under hot pursuit. Every episode, someone beats Hatchin, scams her, tries to sell her, kill her, abduct her, or lie to her, while no plot happens. This goes on for 22 episodes.\r\nTo be blunt, _M&H_ is an astonishingly mediocre anime. The plot is astoundingly boring asMichiko and Hatchin kill time in random cities until something bad happens and they have to leave. The initial plot, finding Hiroshi, seems like it will be resolved within a few episodes and the series will get serious and deal with the incipient gang warfare, except, that turns out to be the *entire* series, dragging out endlessly as they miss Hiroshi skipping out on them like 4 times. Characters are brought in only to never play any particularly meaningful role (what was all that stuff with Satoshi Batista? it never went anywhere until he's casually killed off at the end). More time is spent ogling Michiko's breasts and stomach than trying any world-building so most of the time we're stuck watching the same Martian desert hellscape we've been watching for 15 episodes before. There is no dramatic suspense as we know that no matter how much Michiko screws up and no matter how many cops are after her, she will never be hit by their bullets and will somehow jump over all their cars in her motorcycle in sequences that have approximately 1.2% as much excitement or interest as a _Lupin the Third_ escape sequence. Did I mention that Hatchin is just treated absurdly badly by everyone in the whole series (including Michiko, and excluding the Chinese singer, who as far as I can tell is literally the only person in the series who actually treats Hatchin well - because even her 'friend' Rita somehow neglects to mention that the circus will sell her off).\\n\\n\r\nThe series is produced by Shinichir\u014d Watanabe and created by Manglobe (Ergo Proxy, Samurai Champloo), but while I kind of guessed as much since I was getting a _Cowboy Bebop_ vibe, _M&H_ highlights by contrast just how great _Cowboy Bebop_ is: CB was regularly punctuated by unforgettable music and scenes, from \"Green Bird\" to the finale; _M&H_ has totally forgettable themes except for the mildly interesting animation of the OP; CB had a hallucination episode which, aside from being amusing, deepened the characterization of the main characters and added foreshadowing, while _M&H_'s hallucination episode was just some wacky images; CB had semi-realistic combat scenes and jeet kune do inspired martial arts, while M&H just leaves us eyes rolling at a woman in high heels yet again beating up some burly men; CB had a spaceship which bled and suffered with the main cast, while M&H has a motorcycle which keeps breaking yet mysteriously keeps showing up; CB had a thought-out yakuza backstory driving the central conflict, while M&H has some random stuff in the early episodes which turns out to not even matter once Satoshi gets killed off; CB had distinct locations and worlds, from Mars to Earth to Ganymede, while M&H has just two locations, a seaside town and dusty baked-dry slums. M&H just comes off as bizarrely half-baked, as if some notes were taken on a possible anime but then the anime studio had to turn them into an anime overnight without any time to research locations or come up with interesting places to go or things to do. Whether it's bizarre Japanisms like ear-cleaning (I am pretty sure girlfriends in Mexico do not clean their boyfriends' ears with giant fluffy q-tips) or the lack of any understanding of racial politics or identities in Latin America/Brazil (no matter the color, everyone interacts the same) or rendering pointless character arcs (the cop Atsuko, Michiko's masochist lesbian friend, who is hunting Michiko but keeps assisting her and letting her escape, finally definitively breaks with her at the end, declaring Michiko dead to her, in one of the few moving scenes: 'the next time we meet, it'll be as strangers'. So *of course* in the final episode, Atsuko will go and free her again!) (Satoshi, the gang boss, seems to have some sort of goal or grudge, although he remains mostly a cipher despite enormous amounts of screentime, but of course he is killed before meeting Hiroshi) or bring out sudden swerves in plots (in a brief timeskip at the end, we find Hatchin living and working on her own... as a single mother. Despite Hatchin having been the only sensible character who worked hard or planned ahead in the series! Can we believe this? No, we cannot. Nor can we believe that Michiko somehow escapes from jail without anyone noticing and spends weeks refinding Hatchin, who is then going to go on wild road-trips with Michiko and her baby.) or are just pointless (Hiroshi, far from being some sort of Jay Gatsby figure, turns out to just be a loser who keeps scamming people and disappears as soon as they find him) (if Michiko isn't Hatchin's mother, who is? No answer is ever given and hardly anyone even asks) (what was up with those tomatoes anyway?).\\n\\n\r\nThe only two episodes which were any good was the bull-fighting episode, and the aforementioned Chinatown episode where the 'actress' rescues Michiko for Hatchin. (I was surprised to learn there were Chinatowns in Latin America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatowns_in_Latin_America I hadn't known there was significant Chinese emigration to any of those countries.)\\n\\n\r\nSo: the plot is boring and nonsensical; most of the characters uninteresting or undermined; the art would be OK if it ever changed; the music totally forgettable. It is a waste of an anime and worse than season 2 of _Kaiji_ or _Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro_.\\n",

            "content": "In a small Latin American town, a young girl dreams to be freed from her abusive foster parents. Her wishes come true when an escaped convict leaps through the dinner room window on a teal motorbike and asks her to help her find her mysterious father. Together, they travel the distance to find a man they thought they knew while experiencing the barren but lively existence shared by their fellow countrymen.\r\nIt's been a few seasons since the last promising title in this genre popped up--and Michiko to Hatchin certainly lives up to expectations. With deep Latin American vibes and subtle storytelling, the series manages topull the audience in for a look at several storylines loosely tied together through Michiko's (the vixen convict) past. While their search for Hatchin's father--Michiko's former lover--provides a stimulus for their journey, it acts more as a literary tool to pull the characters through a myopic look at the lives of their fellow countrymen. It is difficult for me to find a favorite among the subplots as they all took a decently honest and heartfelt look at how people in less developed nations survive--though I found the more dramatic subplots (i.e human trafficking) of rather mediocre execution.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko and Hatchin act as foils for one another: Michiko, the adult, acts childish and impulsive while Hatchin, the child, behaves responsibly. Most reviewers seemed to enjoy this chemistry but I found it lukewarm and underdeveloped. While Hatchin's character failed to impress(her relationship with her abusive parents never felt present and her \"maturity\" seemed a pretentious addition), Michiko was developed extensively throughout the series and the characters associated with her past succeeded in hooking my attention. In fact, I personally preferred watching the minor characters in the series--their stories were deeply entrenched in their impoverished situations, yet the livelihood with which they confronted adversity became truly inspirational.\\n\\n\r\nThe series boasts a strong soundtrack and voice acting, nicely echoing an image of a boundless road, sprawled before Michiko, Hatchin, and the people they met. The Latin traces are very apparent in the bold color schemes: cyan skies splashed with vivid turquoise and deep reds. The combination of brilliant sound and great animation certainly makes this anime worth watching, even if it falls short of the true geniuses in the genre (see Cowboy Bebop + Samurai Champloo). So be sure to check this out for a look at something different than your run-of-the-mill titles!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. After a quick check, Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo fame was indeed involved in the soundtrack. Sayo Yamamoto, who directed Michiko to Hatchin, also played an important role in the making of Samurai Champloo. Good to see that these people are still making shows >3.\\n\\n\r\nwritten for Minitokyo's Newsletter: MT-Maigetsu",

            "content": "Michiko to Hatchin, taking place somewhere in an eccentric, sandy, and unpredictable South American setting closely resembling Brazil, follows Michiko Malandro, a sexy and aggressive convict on the run, and 10 year old Hana Morenos, a shy, pale, mild mannered young girl living under the wing of a cruel foster family which has made her life a constant struggle for as long as she can remember. In a meandering and heart pumping trek across various South American cities filled with adventure, tragedy, and bloodshed, the unlikely duo stick together led by one common goal; the hope of finding Hiroshi Morenos, the man who Michiko fellhopelessly in love with before being sent off to prison many years ago, and the father who Hana had the chance to meet. Along the way, the two deal with a wide variety of characters in the various towns they stop in, ranging from a psychedelic underground surgeon, a child sex-trafficking ring disguised as a group of traveling circus performers, and various men from Michiko and Hiroshi's past as members in the infamous Monstro gang.\\n\\n\r\nThe somewhat episodic nature of this show, which in turn leads to a variety of characters and side stories found within it, will ultimately lead some to believe that the show has no direction, or is plagued with inconsequential filler. However, in most cases, these arcs add a lot to the overarching story, as the world building and character development achieved in them are an invaluable part of Michiko to Hatchin's success, and are usually quite entertaining in their own right. With each stop on the path to finding Hiroshi, as the two characters go off on their separate paths (only to begrudgingly meet up when it's time to move on), they find themselves in a variety of dangerous, romantic, and humorous situations. By these means, the viewer gets a glimpse into their heads that we ultimately wouldn't get a chance to experience without the 'episodic' nature the show lends itself to; we're forced to see how both Hana and Michiko behave and adapt to various situations when they're not in the company of each other, and by these means, what would have otherwise stood out as a duo with opposite personalities, becomes a portrayal of two very unique characters in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the development of the main characters that we get to see in this manner, an equally important aspect is the showcasing of the show's environment. The South American setting, an unfamiliar one to most anime fans, is expanded and broadened constantly by the various settings and personalities one comes across when following the escapades of the two; we see the ins and outs of each city, from the poverty stricken streets, to the underground gangs controlling everything from behind closed doors, to the struggle of the everyday man trying to earn a living, to the run-down apartments the characters are always staying in. Their portrayals, along with the show's detailed and distinct background art, jazzy latin style soundtrack, and beautiful character designs, do a great job of immersing the viewer into what would otherwise be an unfamiliar Latin American setting. \\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot itself is a solid one, though nothing mind-blowing. With each town the protagonists decide to rest in, we discover more and more clues regarding the whereabouts and backstory of their beloved Hiroshi, including many flashbacks explaining and highlighting his backstory as a powerful gang leader, which include some of the best scenes in the entire show. His shady history, and Michiko's quest to catch up with some of his old associates in a quest for clues to his whereabouts, make up most of what one would consider the show's \"central plot\". As the two delve deeper and deeper into things in a quest for the truth, and become more involved with various gangs, they find themselves facing an increasing amount of members who want their blood, and some who are after Hiroshi themselves. This dynamic, paired with the fact that the police are also after the two, makes for a fast paced story in which the characters are always on their toes, always ready to fight off or run from the various forces trying to bring them down.\\n\\n\r\nAlready having analyzed the show's strong points, there are a few flaws which need to be looked at with just as much conviction. Though they certainly weren't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the show, I couldn't help but feel that it could have been a lot better had a few glaring downsides been amended.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, and probably most disappointing considering the high production value and great character designs, were the action scenes. Despite the clever and suspenseful build-up leading to nearly each and every one of them, whenever the time came for shit to really hit the fan, the results were usually pretty underwhelming. These scenes had a overwhelming amount of mood ruining asspulls, the nonexistence of any antagonist who can seem to properly aim a gun, (at least when they're shooting at Michiko) and everyone's favorite, a police force chock full of bumbling idiots. The scenes which could have been a series of heart-pounding climaxes are usually done in a fairly uncreative manner, and they usually rely on the same exact tricks and situations as the last one; frankly, they felt lazy. Not over-the-top enough to make you really drop your jaw, but at the same time, not realistic enough to demand much attention from the viewer. Seeing as how this show took place in a setting dominated by cold blooded, gun wielding gang members, it's a pity that the action scenes couldn't have been stronger, and it definitely took some air out of the sails for me as the adventure went along.\\n\\n\r\nWhile my second gripe might seemingly be a bit of a contradiction considering the praise I gave the show's episodic nature earlier, I felt that they did a poor job of connecting the story arcs. While it may have just been an unavoidable consequence of the way the story was told, we'd often find one adventure end, only to find the characters in a completely different situation by the time the next episode started. Without getting specific, there are a few times where the stories just didn't seem to get enough closure, and the viewers are frustratingly thrust into a sort of \"square one\" type situation, where all previous events are forgotten, and our heroes are just on the road again per usual. Whether it's the result of the episodic structure, the 22 episode allotment, or just a case of bad directing, I would have appreciated a bit more flow between the individual stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other flaw I wanted to bring up is difficult to describe without spoiling anything, but I found the pacing in the final two episodes to be uncharacteristically rushed, with an ending that just didn't seem to match the tone from the rest of the series, and one that left a bad taste in my mouth, despite being adequate.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin is a show that managed to set the stage for an amazing story, with a set of likable and in-depth characters, brilliant thematic music and art, and a fantastic, believable atmosphere. While these strong points weren't exploited to their fullest thanks to a few pacing issues and some lacking action scenes, they make for one hell of an adventure that really shines when it shines, even if it's dragged down by a few murky moments.",

            "content": "Sayo Yamomoto, now somewhat well-known for her more recent show, Yuri on Ice, had her directorial debut with Michiko to Hatchin. After her infatuation with Latin American film and a trip to Brazil, she unleashed her creativity with a show about an escaped convict trying to reunite a gangster's daughter with her mysterious father. While there is an overarching plot, many episodes are spent in an unrelated locale, developing the characters and the setting and allowing the show to truly feel alive.\r\nThe art is stunning, both with its fluid animation and color composition (particularly in the OP). Action scenes are well-choreographed, and backgrounds suit eachepisode well. The characters consistently change outfits (sometimes multiple times in a single episode), again helping the show feel true to life. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST of this show is top-notch, blending club bangers like \"Papo Cafajeste\" with mellow, bossa tunes like \"Ritmo suado\" seamlessly. The OP is jazzy and colorful, the ED a feel-good tune to soothe the viewer after any particularly emotional episodes. In addition, the voice actors made each character feel alive, helped in large part by enlisting live-action actors (Ohgo Suzuka for Hatchin, Sakai Maki for Atsuko, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nEvery character served a purpose, whether it be for the development of the main cast or simply to inject yet another dose of realism into the show. Any character shown on-screen is unique and has their own moral dilemmas and motivations, but the viewer is often left to interpret these for themselves, a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't enjoyed a show as much as this in actual years, anime or otherwise. The strong female cast, the unorthodox setting (for an anime), the stellar script-writing from Ujita Takashi, it all coalesces into a near-perfect show. I have extremely minor qualms with it (namely deus ex machina that occurred several times), but I'm willing to overlook these in sense of the larger focus on the cast and their journey.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Highly recommended to fans of compelling female casts, Sayo Yamomoto, and loosely episodic series (a la Samurai Champloo) \\n\\n",

            "content": "Michiko to Hatchin was a pleasant surprise. After reading a few short reviews I was intrigued by the fact that a lot of people pointed out how the series turned out to be a much deeper drama rather than a simple action-driven anime that they were expecting.\r\nI was not disappointed. If you are looking for a series with interesting, complex characters, do not miss this. In fact, I will be go further and say that you should watch Michiko to Hatchin. \r\nThis series features some of the most deep and complex character portrayals I have ever seen in an anime. Be warned - the directorsdon't go to great lengths to explain characters' thoughts or motivations behind their actions and I see this is a huge plus. This ambiguity is what makes this story come alive and seem so believable - it is how we see people around us in real life - often strange, often unpredictable and hard to explain. Some episodes will leave you pondering and thinking \"why\", and like any great work of art most of us will come to different conclusions. This puts M&H to the top among the classics in my books.\\n\r\nThe story itself is not very original, it is quite simple and some episodes try to lighten the mood with side-stories that feel a little out of place. In a few rare places, it almost feels like directors tried a bit too hard to make this anime more appealing to the general crowd and gave it some attributes that it could have done without. For example, I couldn't help but wonder why so many characters have Japanese first names? Given that the story is set in an imaginary Latin American country, this detail is most peculiar.\\n\r\nIn general, I felt like the characters held the whole thing together, their presence compensated for some gaps in the plot and I was literally glued to the screen until the very last episode.\\n\r\nIt would be harsh not to mention what great job Manglobe has done here. Animation style is original and suits the setting very well, the music is superb and character designs are extremely well made. Without their creative touch this series wouldn't have been this good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I give M&H a 10. It is definitely one of the best series in the past decade and it has the substance to rival some of the greatest series ever made. It is a must see for all anime fans out there.",

            "content": ":STORY:\r\nThe story for this series is fantastic. What I seem to be noticing is that anime sort of has a niched appeal, which is okay. However, the problem is that those who are responsible for creating the anime are more responsible for putting in the stylistic elements in anime that anime fans enjoy than creating a piece of literature that can benefit humanity. This series, however, transcends that and truly is a piece of artwork that pays no loyalty to the traditional standards of what makes anime entertaining, but rather is loyal to getting the creator's message across in the most effective way possible. Inthis case his message is made quite well and movingly with this episodic story of a young girl and her hot, recently discovered biological mother search for the young girl's father. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the first clues that the the message was in fact made effectively is that the message can't be summarized very easily. What this means to me, is that every element of each episode is entirely necessary and has a purpose, and the message can't be made without them. Each run-in with a gang, or dealings with a stripper trying to escape, or a brief affair with a married man who smokes, all play a role to where the meaning of the series wouldn't be the same without each.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed it's discretion in the area of comedic relief. Nothing drives me up the wall in an anime than excessive and unnecessary humor, ESPECIALLY when it cuts off a serious moment that potentially could have a beautiful and lasting effect. This didn't have any of that but rather allowed the dark and depressing be dark and depressing and poking in some sophisticated humor only when it was due and this allowed it's emotional effect to be that much more poignant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is very literary and riddled with symbolism, and makes for an entertaining and moving story. It's one flaw might come from being too dense to where some meaning might get loss in translation or forgotten.\\n\\n\r\n:ART:\\n\r\nAnother spectacular aspect of this series. The character design, the setting, the colors, they all work together to set the perfect mood for the corresponding situation in the story. The environment, being in the colorful central america/south america was vibrant and beautiful to look at. All the characters finally evolve from the tired out, generic, ethnic-neutral style of other animes, and their appearance fits their character and personalities to a T. \\n\\n\r\n:SOUND:\\n\r\nI usually don't even bother with tihs section, but it is worth mentioning the soundtrack, written by the great Japanese neo-jazz group: SOIL and PIMP sessions. Like everything else discussed so far, the jazzy, dynamic soundtrack fits what's going on and works so perfectly with the tones throughout.\\n\\n\r\n:CHARACTER:\\n\r\nThere are so many memorable characters in this series, and not one of them is flat. All of their behaviors, as it pertains to their character is so over the top in a good way. It's almost surreal the way the characters behave and look and it's so wonderful to watch. \\n\\n\r\n:ENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nIt's true that one sort of has to have a mature sense of film and art to fully appreciate this series fully ( I hope that doesn't sound too pretentious or stuck up). It's not exactly a laid-back watch either, and somewhat requires your mind to interpret all that happens. By no means does that mean that there isn't enjoyment to be had, because absolutely there is enjoyment to be had by simply watching the drama and the emotional journey. I do recognize that in art series like this, there is a little more difficulty in pure entertainment, but I can't deny how invigorating this series is.\\n\\n\r\n(I'm sold after watching Ergo Proxy and now this, these guys need to come to America and make a film. It'll go over like gangbusters.)",

This bombshell has got will, brain, so much guts and na\u00efve feeling of love. The way she's so wild, she knocks and she fightsback..wow. I wish women with more personality like this would run more often in the Anime stories. Also, I found her funny: she made me smile whenever she's fighting with Hatchin, giving some back to antagonists and ignoring horny guys all the way.\\n\\n\r\nHatchin? Wouuuuh >_< I luved her. I luv luv luv this character, whether her appearance, her personality or her troublesome relationship with Michiko. She's a responsible fighter for a 10 yrs-old girl. I also liked the fact that she didn't get involved emotionally with the whole father story. Besides, she's cute u_u and even when she is older, she's cuter 8D\\n\\n\r\nThe story? Well, a relaxing exotic purpose to stay on the road on a motorcycle, be part of gangs' wars, get involved with other people's life or in the other way, passing by when you could have helped. The story is good even though I felt the writers could have come with better stuff and episodes if they weren't committed to the one-little-story-per-episode. In addition to this, I was expecting the end and it came as I figured it out..I knew the writers wouldn't screw up the scenario just to please happy-endings-moods. Besides, let's face it: an anime showing kids who hold guns and kill, grownups who abuse children in so many ways and people killing each other in the same way they'd say \"hello\"  can't have a clean end O_o.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko e Hatchin sets my motorcycle dream on fire and makes me feel good, either about my life or about the world we're living in. It makes me want to visit dirty Brazil and witness more of the other sides of things ^^. It's a pleasant exotic and original anime with impressing main characters and good homie supporting ones",

In anime there's so many things you can do with a story and characters buy sometimes it's good to see a realistic setting (other than Japan) with (semi) realistic action and adventure. The dub really gave a feel to this anime the sub didn't.\r\nMichiko and hatchin starts off with them on a quest to find hatchins father Hiroshi, sound familiar? It's more so about the ride and how the characters develop than an actual plot. Most episodes can standalone and still make sense of the story. Maybe 2 episodes kind of felt dragged but they were needfor character development so its not a big deal.\\n\\n\r\nThis series gives off a very bebop/champloo feel in the atmosphere. Action is present but is not the main focus of the anime. You'll appreciate it when it comes with how well its done.The colors and backgrounds are some so well which seems like a lost cause in some anime. Not only was their variety in scenery but the character designs were some of the best in a while as well.\\n\\n\r\nMany thimgs make this series great and antagonists is one of them. Love them or hate them in the end you may h\u00e0ve mixed emotions for them. From the police to the thugs it shows how violence and power can corrupt people and does a damn good job of that. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I give this ani e a 8.7/10 with its uniqueness and staying true to what it was to the end. If youre looking for a realistic action type series you may be disappointed but going in with a clear head you may love it as well",

Let's hope I'm not rambling anything so here is how I'll go...\r\nIf you are an action addict like me and only came here to see whether this is a great action anime look somewhere else but if you somewhat happen to want to delve yourself into an adventure that has some outstanding characterisation, art and sound set in Brazil (it's Brazil! What a change of setting for once!) then this might be that hidden gem you're looking for. \r\nStory 7/10\r\nAs the summary by MAL suggests this anime tells us of the adventureof two characters Michiko and Hatchin on a quest to find Hiroshi, a runaway. Now, this mediocre story sounds common right? Much like Samurai Champloo if you ask me but nonetheless everything is different in this anime... What I love about this story is the fact that it teaches you things about life along the way...especially the end. Life isn't a straight-line. This anime takes on a more realistic approach on things - one of the most realistic I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely fantastic. No doubt the visuals are appealing and the setting and surroundings reflect the themes portrayed in the show as well as the culture. Character designs are unique and very different to the \"usual\".\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is flawless imo. With a south-american influence no doubt was it catchy when it needed to be and boy was the OP song enjoyable. I always skip intro songs but in this anime it was an exception. The jazzy, hip hop and south american feels made me feel lost in enjoyment which steered away the anime intentions but it was that good! Music usually increases my enjoyment by a 3-fold in anime and as a musician by hobby I thoroughly enjoyed some tracks in this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nCharacterisation was above your average. Need I say more? The chemistry between Michiko and Hatchin was entertaining yet intriguing. I do believe some characters should have had a bit more screen time just so the audience could figure things out for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the journey and am glad I stuck through...if this anime had more action...alot more action this anime would be a 10/10 based on my preferences which is rather ignorant. No doubt this anime isn't one to skip or underrate. Manglobe studios did a marvellous job in this one. To sum it up it's experimentation at it's finest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10",

            "content": "Michiko to Hatchin was a fun romp through the various slums and deserts of fictional Latin American locales as Michiko and Hana press on their journey to find Michiko's ex-lover and Hana's biological father, Hiroshi Morenos. The series proved to be quite realistic in its exploration of the various locales within the series where crime and poverty are rampant with the police not able to do enough in halting both. Town streets are worn-down and derelict as a result of the nonstop crime and poverty faced within such slums and people resort to crimes such as child smuggling and drug trafficking to get by withinthe world of Michiko to Hatchin. Considering the harsh details I've heard about life within Latin and South America, I was quite impressed with how believably this series explored such issues.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, Michiko to Hatchin does do enough in fleshing out the show's prominent characters (Hana, Michiko, Atsuko and Satoshi) and whatever conflicts they face as they become connected to Hana and Michiko's search for Hiroshi. In particular, Hana and Michiko's bond is the central focus of the series making for both humorous and touching moments as they are frequently at odds with one another due to how different they are in personality and thinking, yet are the best thing both have had in their lives due to their harsh pasts. Adding to the show's comedy are episodes where the duo encounter some over-the-top characters within town slums such as a crackpot doctor, an eccentric Chinese restaurant cook and a cross-dressing opera singer.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's plot is mostly linear as Hana and Michiko journey in finding clues pertaining to Hiroshi's whereabouts, as well as some fillers where the two encounter said crazy characters and some focus on Atsuko's past. The show isn't afraid at making things become intense as Michiko and others get into some dangerous territory while confronting thugs, the police, assassins and mobsters leading to some crazy action sequences with car chases and gun fights. These scenes are quite fluid and jaw-dropping to see onscreen as vehicles and characters move smoothly enough during intense moments.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the presentation, the visuals of Michiko to Hatchin are bright and full of detail in depicting the various town slums and deserts that Michiko and Hana travel through. Such detail also went into character designs as they were designed in various ways, from being black to Mexican to fat to ugly to attractive. The soundtrack consisted of Latin and Carribean style musical choices such as salsa and jazz that fit perfectly well with the show's Latin American-like setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't without its imperfections. The show's first episode had the annoying habit of overemphasizing Hana's family abuse problems and the ending felt rather lackluster in addressing Hana's new life with Hiroshi due to the lack of background on his character. There are also some plot holes that the show doesn't bother to address such as who Hana's mother was, how Hana got her stomach tattoo and what ever happened to an assassin that helped Michiko towards the end of a later episode.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these gripes, Michiko to Hatchin made for a fun and touching comedy-drama thanks to the chemistry between Hana and Mitsuko, as well as their encounters with various criminals and crazy characters within various Latin American slums. This was one of the better unlicensed anime titles I've had a chance of seeing as of late.",

            "content": "Since its release in 2008, Michiko to Hatchin seems to have somewhat flown under the radar of many anime fans.  This is a real shame, because MtH is a great show.\r\nThe setting will draw you in right away for being really unique.  It takes place in an unnamed pseudo-Brazilian country, complete with favelas, tropics, and an enormous desert (that last part isn't in Brazil).  The setting is really well realized and feels like it could be an actual country in South America, but the fact that it isn't allows them much more artistic license with the setting.\r\nThe premise of the story issimple, you can read it up at the top of the page: Hana Morenos lives with an abusive foster family before escaped con Michiko Malandro shows up and saves her.  Together they set off to find Hiroshi: Hana's father and Michiko's old lover while being hunted by Atsuko Jackson, the Zenigata to Michiko's Lupin III (although less comic).  The series is mostly episodic, especially for the first half, concerning the duo's trials and tribulations as they track down Hiroshi.  I'm not a huge fan of episodic shows, but the overarching goal in MtH lends a nice sense of a direction to the show, and I will freely emit that there were many scenes throughout the series, especially near the end, that made me emotional.\\n\\n\r\nLike most episodic series, we've got a really strong character focus here, and thankfully it's not squandered on bad characters.  First off, the two protagonists are great.  The immature adult/mature child dynamic may not be the most innovative, but it's used very affectively here.  One of the problems I have with a lot of episodic shows is that there's often a lack of lasting character development, but MtH manages to gracefully duck that problem.  The best way of describing the development is as smooth.  They don't do the cheap thing where there's one revelation episode and then Michiko is like \"Oh man I'm not a very good mother figure for Hatchin\" and completely reforms, they develop gradually through a variety of experiences.  Y'know, kinda like real people?  Only when you look back on the beginning of the series will you really realize how far they've come and how much the duo have grown together.  Likewise, most of the side characters are also pretty well developed, especially the ones who show up throughout the series like Atsuko and mob boss Satoshi.  In fact, the only one who doesn't get much development is Hiroshi himself, but that probably serves the story better.\\n\\n\r\nMtH also excels wonderfully on the audiovisual side.  The audio is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe.  If you know that name you know that's basically a seal of quality.  The music fits the setting perfectly, with a great mix of jazz, bossa nova, samba, and other appropriate genres to give everything that exaggerated exotica flavor, without sounding cheesy.  Special mention goes to the great opening song Paraiso, by the most bizarrely named of all the jazz bands, Soil & \"PIMP\" Sessions.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals!  Visuals are also great!  The art is vivid and brilliant, capturing all of the many colors of the setting, from cheerful festivals to bleak alleys and seedy clubs.  The animation is definitely among the top tier I've seen in an anime, generally avoiding most of the budget cut pitfalls like characters standing perfectly still while their mouth waggles, or sliding motionless across the screen.  The animation and character designs both strike a nice balance between realism and exaggeration, being very expressive while still feeling like they could be real people.  Most importantly, characters actually change clothes!  Yeah, it's crazy, all of the characters will actually wear different outfits on different days.  This lends a bit of realism to the proceedings, as well as keeping the character designs fresh.  It has also completely spoiled me on 99% of other series.\\n\\n\r\nOver all, Michiko to Hatchin is a great show, a new favorite.  It's got an exotic setting, great characters, plenty of emotional bits, and fantastic art and music.  Check it out!  Really!  We can also toss it into the gateway anime pile along with Baccano and Cowboy Bebop.",

            "content": "Story:7\r\nThe story is it's weakest point. There is a main storyline, like the description says, where Michiko and Hatichin are looking for the man they are seeking. But in actuality, that is the background storyline, the main story, or I should say stories, are about their adventures together. Each story is episodic, with the storyline of the search for the man they are seeking the one thing that ties each story together. So while it's an on a running time lime, the events that unfold are more like miniature stories in each episode. This makes the story a wee bit fragmented, with what feels likefiller.  However, each individual story is pretty interesting, but ultimately it drags the plot somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is richly riddled with metaphors and subtle insinuations about philosophical topics. You can tell the writers really wanted the viewers to think about things, like the complications of life, love, growing up, etc.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nThe art is incredible.  I'm watching this in 2014, so it's been 5 years since it has ended, and even with 5 years of new art development, I'm still blown away by it. It's gorgeous to watch, and incredibly detailed. The backgrounds and scenery are amazing and richly detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nSound is great. Songs, sound effects, voice acting. Everything is spot on and fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nThe characters make this show very interesting. Each of the characters are very intricately written. It's a great show in the fact that the characters, and especially their relationships, are very multifaceted. The characters in this are definitely the type that don't fit stereotypes (though they may look it), and are not black and white, but display all the shades of gray in between. \\n\\n\r\nI think this series has some of the most complex characters I've ever seen in an anime. Not really a spoiler... but this all takes place in a society of abject poverty. Not just a poor area, but down in the dumps slums, third world hunger deal. So it's incredible to see the difference this kind of environment has on all the characters. They are all literally a product of their environment, who are all, ultimately, just trying to survive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nSo overall, enjoyment is a nine, because of everything listed. Not a 10, because of the story, as I stated above. I found myself fast-forwarding parts, or sneaking a look ahead because I was bored at times, with what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin is a beautifully hectic anime full of spunky, gorgeous cacophony. It's very much like real life. At times it's incredibly crazy, heartwarming, bittersweet, sad, idyllic... a whole bunch of different feelings and emotions, much like the complexity of real life.\\n",

            "content": "You know something, I love the anime Baccano! I consider it to be the Pulp Fiction of anime and I'm not saying that as a bad thing, not in the slightest. That's one of the reasons why it's so freaking awesome but all that wouldn't mean much if all Baccano! had going for it is that it was like a Quentin Tarantino movie. If the novelty is all it had going for it, it might humor you for a bit but in the end you'd just forget about it and watch Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs instead. Thankfully Baccano! is alot more clever than thatand it's able to stand on it's own. \\n\\n\r\nThe point is that being inspired by something or just being like something else isn't necessarily a bad thing (and Tarantino himself isn't exactly known for being the most original guy ever either) and if you can take already existing ideas and put your spin on them to make something great and unique on it's own then that's great, that's awesome but that's not really what happened with the anime I'm about to talk about: Michiko to Hatchin\\n\\n\r\nYou wanna know what else I love? Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. Of course I do, most people do, especially Sayo Yamamoto. So much so that she tries to do her own take on them with Michiko to Hatchin without actually thinking about why those two shows worked in the first place. Now I get why she made this anime. Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo were too good, Shincihiro Watanabe doesn't make that many animes and nobody from 2005 - 2008 (even now really) knew how to duplicate that lightning in two bottles that Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo were but Sayo Yamamoto tries, oh boy does she try. I'm going to reference Bebop and Champloo alot in this review and I don't try to compare every anime to those two, I really don't but it's warranted here because Ms. Yamamoto wants so obviously to be the next Shinichiro Watanabe\\n\\n\\n\r\nConcept/Presentation: Imagine if you took the episode Mushroom Samba from Cowboy Bebop, stretched it into a 22 episode tv series, and add in a Latin American sensibility to it, this is pretty much what you would get and it's a really cool idea and I'll admit I haven't seen that before. Sure, there's a ton of Blaxploitation and hell there's Afro Samurai so it's not even the first anime to do that but most Blaxploitation takes place in the south or in a domesticated city like New York. Either way some place in America, I've never seen anything in that genre take place in South America or many action pictures in general for that matter (I could be wrong but I've never seen it) so it adds in a cool twist to the genre of Blaxploitation and yeah we've seen a black person in an anime before, nothing new but in most animes, the black character's usually a supporting character at best and most of the characters could pass for white or asian. Here, there's only 2-3 characters I can think of at the top of my head that are white, everyone else is a different ethnicity and again props, that's not something you usually see in anime. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The music is fantastic. It's Funky, Jazz (Especially in the opening) with alot of electronic music, Hip Hop and a little Rock. I will say that while the show doesn't blow me away, the soundtrack certainly does and it's no wonder why it's so good since the man Shinichiro Watanabe himself is the music producer for this anime. I like that alot of the episodes have different music from each other instead of just repeating alot of the same music. Not to mention the opening to the show is one of the coolest anime openings I've seen in recent years. It's colorful, stylish, has alot of energy and is just plain cool. The music itself was composed by Alexandre Kassin. I don't know alot about Kassin but I look forward to hearing more from him 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is good, if you're looking for animation that'll make your eyes bleed, this isn't it but that's okay, it gets the job done but like I said nothing really about it really grabs you either. One touch I like about the show's design is that the characters don't wear the same clothes all the time like in most animatation, they wear different clothes which is how it would be in real life and that I liked 7/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: The show starts out with an orphan named Hatchin (though she prefers to be called Hana) who lives with her evil priest guardian. Him and his family all treat her like dirt, always bullying her and making her do work all the time. It's about as cliche as a set up as you can get and I get that they're trying to be ironic by putting this fairy tail like set up in a sorta action movie scenario but even that's kinda cliche. Anyway, an African-Brazilian woman crashes into the house with her motorcycle, claiming that Hatchin is her kid (Because they both have the same tattoo on their stomachs which makes no sense, who would put a tattoo on an infant? Why wouldn't the writers just have the two characters have a similar birth mark or something) but she's also an escape convict so all hell breaks loose, the cops are after Michiko, The priest is after Hatchin (I don't know why he's so gun ho about getting her back when he could just do nothing, not risk his life and just find another child to take advantage of but whatever) but after the two get away from all those people, they go off on a journey to find a man named Hiroshi who Michiko thinks is Hatchin's father.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's the story in a nutshell, like I said the first episode's really cliche and predictable but outside of that, the show's not nearly as cliche as that first episode which is good but sadly the rest doesn't have enough alot going for it. This is an example of the anime trying to be like Bebop and Champloo without actually getting them because it has a similar structure to those other shows. \\n\\n\r\nThere's an overall storyline but it's spread through out with a lot of stand alone episodes. It's about people who don't get along at first on a journey to find someone like Samurai Champloo but it's also suppose to be more serious like Cowboy Bebop which might sound good on paper but that's not exactly the best idea.\\n\\n\r\nCowboy Bebop works because since it's a drama, almost all the episodes are fascinating because they have to put a greater effort in telling a compelling story and while many of Samurai Champloo's stand episodes wouldn't make great Bebop episodes, they make up for it by having them being so over the top and hilarious but that's not the case with this show so in the end, we have a series that's not as dramatic or character driven as it wants to be and not as funny and energetic as it should be and because of that, there are alot of episodes in this series that are average at best and forgettable at worst. There's really only two that come to mind out of the stand alone episodes that really left an impression on me at all. One of them is about the dancing stripper girl who's trying to protect her sister and the one where they meet a fortune teller (again, watch Bebop and Champloo much?) and that's only because it's interesting how all these events occur to each other and makes you wonder how it's going to end if true or not.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I was very unimpressed with the first half of this show, it's only when about the 2nd half happens where the show starts getting interesting there's a thrilling chase between Michiko between all these assassins trying to kill her. There's a situation where they have to jump from bus to bus to try and get to a destination or else a lunatic will take them out, and there's a whole deal with a criminal named Satoshi who ends up taking care of Hatchin while her and Michiko get separated and how Satoshi's trying to reach higher up in the underworld. Unfortunately while the second half is where things get excited for once, the actually ending is pretty lack luster, the whole thing about finding Hiroshi (Hatchin's dad) is kind of a let down and I can't help but feel that if this was a 26 episodes series instead of 22, everything would've been wraped up alot neater but as is, it feels kinda cluttered. \\n\\n\r\nExample, that whole assassin subplot I brought up is dropped, they make such a big deal out of these assassins but then they're just gone and there's a relationship Michiko has with the cop chasing her named Atsuko who has a blondish afro (Hey, our lead has dark hair while her enemy that she use to be friends with has very light hair. Not at all like Spike and Vicious. Though nice twist for making the Vicious type character here a cop instead of the member of a crime syndicate) there's obviously alot of tension between the two outside of Michiko's an escape convict and Atsuko's a cop but again, there's not much of a big pay off between the two, I'm not expecting something big like The Real Folk Blues but it'd be nice to get something \\n\\n\r\nand finally Hiroshi, the whole story that revolves around this guy, I just don't find it all that impressive. We're told through out the series that he was an actor on tv (Which BTW folks when you're trying to runaway from your old life, be sure to act on television, that won't attract attention at all) but he also had a life working with this female scientist in making these weird tomatoes. That's a good idea: The man you're looking has lived multiple lives, can you even find him and if you do find him will he even remember or care about you? There's a great idea for a story there but much like everything else, there's not enough done with it. With Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the people that the main characters are looking for left for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nExample: Julia from Cowboy Bebop left Spike because she was forced to either kill the man she loved or be killed by the syndicate so she chose to be hunted\\n\\n\r\nHere Hiroshi just comes across as cowardly douchebag who left Michiko just because so I don't know why I should care if they find him or not and when they finally do find him, they just find him, they don't talk to him that much and he just lives his days with Hatchin. I don't feel like I know the man well enough to really feel satisfied about this situation.\\n\\n\r\nWith Fuu from Samurai Champloo, she wanted to find the Samurai Who Smells Of Sunflowers to get revenge but when she does find him, she's disappointed and realizes that she needs to stop dwelling on the past and live in the now and look forward to the future and Spike, there's was all this talk about Julia and he had this dynamic with Vicious, it all was leading somewhere (Not going into any more details because spoilers). Here, they just find the father and boom happy ending. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I find it kinda ironic that Sayo Yamamoto a woman, makes two animes where the main characters are women and yet in both animes, some of the male characters are far more interesting and more well written than the main character in both animes. Lupin, Jigen, and Goemon are written fine, it's just that Fujiko doesn't make a very good lead in my opinion and I'm not that crazy about Michiko either. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, I get what they're trying to do with her. She's basically a Mugen like character. Has a very \"fuck you\" attitude about everything, isn't afraid, is angry alot and who escaped from a prison like Mugen but with Spike Spiegel's past with a lost lover that she had a relationship with who left her and like I said earlier has a light hair arch enemy/old friend and once again, sounds like a cool idea for a character but again she doesn't hold a candle to Spike or Mugen, She's not as complex and cool as Spike and she's nowhere near as bad ass and fun as Mugen, in fact for such a tough chick, she gets her ass kicked alot. Now I don't need her to be this martial artist that can beat up a hundred guys but when you have a character who's not very nice and quite frankly has a big mouth, there has to be other features to back that up like being a major ass kicker or being funny (although she has her funny moments every once in a while) but as is she just comes across as someone who's all talk and has little less to back up her words and therefore not very likeable.\\n\\n\r\nHatchin is fine. Being tormented all her life but still stays strong spirited, Cool. She knows that Michiko stole her some shoes but she doesn't feel good about it so she tries to get a job and work for the shoes and her and the Chinese restaurant owner have some funny chemistry together but all Hatchin and Michiko ever do is fight and yell at each other so I don't really buy into the whole \"I'll protect you no matter what\" thing that Michiko keeps saying because they don't seem to get along at all. Yeah, the characters in Bebop and Champloo don't get along at first either but as both shows continue, the characters know more about each other and therefore understand and respect each other more even when they don't want to admit it. Here, Michiko and Hatchin love and care about each other as a family because the script says they do, not because they've naturally grown this mutual respect for each other\\n\\n\r\nNow on to my favorite character in this show, Satoshi (This anime is suppose to take place in Latin America yet everyone has a Japanese first name. You figure that one out). He's by far the best character in this show. For one, he's a bad ass, he's intimidating and unlike Michiko he can back up his words and kicks way more ass than she does. The reason he wants to find Hiroshi is because they were best friends and Hiroshi helped him through rough times when they were both kids, that I find way more believable than some dumb bitch who had sex with Hiroshi and he just up and left and what are Michiko's goals?:\\n\\n\r\nJust to find some ass who left her, run away from the cops, and raise Hatchin. \\n\\n\r\nOkay but Satoshi like I said wants to find his friend and he's in deep with the criminal underworld and he's trying to make his way to the top and become the big boss himself and while he's a vicious killer and it's not the most sympathetic goal, it's way more interesting than what Michiko's doing but what really seals the deal for me is the relationship between him and Hatchin. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, something happens that gets Hatchin and Michiko separated and therefore Hatchin's stuck with Satoshi and at first Satoshi threatens her, that he would kill her if it fit his goals but Hatchin isn't scared by him and he kinda admires that. As some time goes on they learn a little about each other and grow a strange respect for each other. So much so that Satoshi sacrifices himself to let Hatchin live, he doesn't talk non stop about how he's going to protect her no matter what, he lets his actions speak for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I would like this show soooo much better if it was about Satoshi and his relationship with Hatchin. That's a far more interesting story than the main one we've got here.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are okay but there's not much development for them\\n\\n\r\n6/10 It's only a 6 for Satoshi because he is awesome but everyone is pretty much a disappointment and it would be lower if it wasn't for him.\\n\\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\\n\\n\r\nYou know how in a Shinichiro Watanabe anime (and you really only see this in his work), there's different art work for the commercial break cards for each episodes? That's in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso remember how the opening is in every episode of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo except for the very last episode? Done here as well.\\n\\n\r\nand the opening (as awesome as it is) is filled with dark shadows and bright colors just like in Watanabe's work\\n\\n\r\nand to add all the other examples I gave through out this review \\n\\n\r\nSo spare me that \"I don't see the connection between these animes\" crap\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI don't want to be hard on Sayo Yamamoto, I really don't. She's really trying and especially since she's a woman director and that's pretty damn rare in anime let alone directing animes that would ordinarily go to a man but she's trying way too hard to fill Watanabe's shoes and her feet just aren't big enough, she needs to find her own shoes that fit her. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'd be easier on this anime if I hadn't already seen Lupin iii: A Woman Called Fujiko Mine first and hadn't already been so disappointed with that anime but since I did, I can't let the \"She's just starting out\" excuse pass, her third anime if she ever directs another one needs to really wow me for me to like her.\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving Michiko To Hatchin a 6/10. It has alot of potential and it has a great style to it but the pieces just don't fit for me\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations: The Boondocks, Django Unchained, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Black Lagoon, Lupin the 3rd: A Woman Called Fujiko Mine",

            "content": "*Light-medium character spoilers ahead!* (speaking of their development and personality throughout the show)\r\nQuite a few reviews praise the ability of the female cast, but I just had to say that I found them rather flawed, honestly, the entirety of the cast is flawed. It seems that in order to make characters w/o stereotypes, they just used characters that had strong personalities and very little to no grow for multiple episodes, which bothered me. Michiko is no doubt \"strong\" but extremely stubborn, and as others have mentioned, fails to move the plot forward in any way until someone has a lead on \"Hiroshi\" and his whereabouts.\r\nMyfavorite part of the show was when Satoshi Batista started to come into the forefront. Unlike a majority of the cast, Satoshi does whatever he sets out to do, and does not vocalize his regrets. I originally enjoyed seeing the human-\"ness\" of characters when they would express their disappointment in themselves vocally, but it got old rather quickly, part of the reason why I felt why the characters didn't grow is because they didn't learn anything from these mistakes. Satoshi is actually quite smart. He is extremely aware of his surroundings and the inability of being able to become boss of Monstro without help from Hiroshi. It seems they wanted him to be disliked at first, but later found some room to script sympathy for him.\\n\\n\r\nHatchin is super cute, and is probably the character with the most growth in the show. Her stubborness comes head to head with Michiko's quite often which is annoying after it happens the first few times.  Atsuko is.. disappointing. She just can't decide what kind of character she wants to be. She's alot like Michiko in that where Michiko can't get Hiroshi off her mind, Atsuko is always ironically there to bail Michiko out of all her sticky situations, basically the personification of plot armor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILERS*\\n\r\nTL;DR, Characters can be kinda frustrating!! ;( Honestly the sub characters are better than the main ones.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is amazing (love soil & pimp), Art is gorgeous, Dub is great. 7/10 should watch if you're bored and looking for something different.\\n",

            "content": "I remember seeing this as a recommendation a while ago, and didn't really look much into it. I only started watching it after I found out Manglobe had filed for bankruptcy, just to see if they had gone completely belly up. How wrong I was! This feels like the tryptic entry to Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, they all have a similar enough feeling to them and an incredible soundtrack to keep everything together.\r\nMichiko no Hatchin came out of the gate as quickly as Samurai Champloo, the first episode had me begging for more. The style is so similar, from the fluid movements and incrediblefight scenes to the snappy dialogue between snarky characters bound together on a journey. It also had a wonderful english dub, with a top notch cast that put an incredible performance into it. I'm starting to see how Manglobe put themselves into that much debt, because this show had a fantastic budget. You know a show has money to burn when the backgrounds on driving shots are just as good as the static ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe entirety of the show is this: Hatchin travels with Michiko to search for Hatchin's father, set in fake Brazil. It's largely episodic, with a Bebop \"getting into hi-jinx at every possible turn\" feel to it, from run ins with the police to shoot outs with slum kids and gang violence. The episodes are all entertaining in their own right, but where Michiko no Hatchin really shines is right there in the name, the two main characters and how they revolve around each other. In the beginning, both of their reasons for travelling together are completely selfish, and neither of them can stand each other. Through their misadventures and escapades, the two start to become friends and rely on each other more and more, but they'd never admit it. By the end, they honestly care about each other and in a way they need each other.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think this might be an even stronger series than Champloo, because there's less filler, and the finale is a lot more satisfying. The only problem with it is what do you do when it's all over? Please tell me if you figure that out",

This came from the same studio who did Samurai Champloo, and if you're familiar with that you can expect about the same from Michiko to Hatchin. The main story line being: it's not the destination, it's the journey. \r\nThis anime is so multicultural with beautiful art and flawless character designs,  seiyuus, the list goes on and on. You will have an attraction to almost every character in this show, that goes for the antagonists/cruel natured characters, andthe ones that stick around for one episode or less than that. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I'm on the fence about with this show is the ending, it's difficult to express my feelings about it without spoilers but basically; where I felt the end results were in character it just came across as a lot more than what I expected it to be. \\n\\n\r\nBut in a way, that's a good thing. It makes it more interesting, as it's a hard to predict show in general. It truly draws you in and keeps you entertained, and we need a lot more of these shows in anime that's for sure. Lots of 9 and 10 ratings from me.",

            "content": "Michiko to Hatchin starts out and finished strong and offers one of the most realistic, and believable portrayals of Latin America, Brazil in particular, that I've seen in anime. If you're on the fence about watching, don't hesitate, stop reading, and go watch! Since I've watched Samurai Champloo fairly recently and Manglobe produced both, I'll be referencing and making comparisons to Samurai Champloo throughout this review. \r\nThe story is engaging and thrilling from start to finish. The basic plot is quite simple and fairly reminiscent of Manglobe's prior original animation, Samurai Champloo, and also involves a series-long epic journey with the end goal of findinga missing person. Also just like Samurai Champloo, the series is somewhat episodic by nature, with entertaining mini-sub plots and memorable one-time characters. I'd say the main complexity of this series is generated from character interactions, rather than convoluted and confusing plot devices or conflicts, which definitely helps give the story a very human-like perspective that at times could confuse the reader as to the motivations of certain characters. \\n\r\nThe pacing is done quite well and rarely feels forced thanks to the many moments of refrain and reflection weaved in-between the frantic and speedy, yet fluid action scenes. The interactions between the brash Michiko and well-mannered Hana are enjoyable, comedic, and touching to watch. While both possess fairly different personalities and approaches to life, advances in character development are subtle, meaningful, and believable. The supporting cast is filled with strong, diverse, and unique characters that are rarely irritating or distracting. \\n\r\nThe ending, as another reviewer pointed out, is definitely bitter-sweet, but offers a very believable and realistic outcome, which is most fitting for a series with realism at its core. \\n\\n\r\nAs for visual and sound aspects, Manglobe has done it again and created an artistic masterpiece. Diamandara is as faithful an animated reproduction of the architecture and landscapes of Brazil that I've ever seen. Everything from the character models and clothing to the buildings, vehicles, and furniture is detailed and accurate. The use of spacing and colors are tastefully done and further reinforce the atmosphere. The setting is fairly dynamic and rarely feels dull with Michiko and Hana visiting cities, tropical forests, slums, market places, highways, Chinatown, and small towns. As mentioned before, action scenes are consistently fluid and well-animated, with good special effects. Characters have fluid movements and background scenes feel lively. Facial expressions are well-portrayed, subtle at times, and rarely over-done or over the top. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with the strong art, the music melds in perfectly with each scene, with touching vocal Latin inserts, blood-pumping action beats, heart-thumping build ups, and soothing Latin-inspired acoustic tunes. Not quite the unique, contrasting, hip-hop type of soundtrack that Samurai Champloo had, but definitely enjoyable and worked very well throughout all 22 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is well-done across the board, with the quality being high initially and masterful mid-way through the series. Each major character had endearing voices that fit with their visual depictions and emotions were well-conveyed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gotta say, don't hesitate to watch this series, especially if you enjoyed watching Samurai Champloo! You won't be disappointed. Sit back and enjoy the wild, yet touching ride that Michiko and Hatchin has to offer! \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The plot is inconsistent, like there was a subplot where Hatchin was chasing after a thief who took her shoes in episode 3 but by midway episode 4, that subplot is completely thrown out the window. Though, the main plot is a buddy road trip show about two young girls who clash a lot, the writer did put a fresh twist on it but it ended up being executed pathetically.\r\nMichiko and Hatchin\u2019s relationship is cliched, starting off not really liking each other but then growing to genuinely care for each other. None of the characters are particularly likeable, Michiko, while a refreshingly cool, badass blacklady is really hot-headed, immature, and irresponsible and Hatchin is aloof, dense, and bratty. They tend to fight a lot like young sisters, though that\u2019s toned down by the middle of the series. The characters are overall, mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming values are some of the comedy in it (though there are some corny ones). The music has a more latin/brazilian vibe to it, some of it is jazzy but it\u2019s nevertheless catchy. The voice actors did a fairly good job bringing fresh life to their characters (I watched the english dub) though the only downside is Hatchin sounds a little too whiny but it\u2019s not too big of a problem since she has a whiny, emotional personality. But she does sound like a 10-year-old instead of an adult trying to sound like one. And the charmingly beautiful art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nGood quality production values, fairly decent animation, fresh voice acting, and groovy music is wasted on a poor script. Too bad Watanabe is only part of the music department in this anime. If he had a more major staff role, this anime probably would\u2019ve been a lot charming. I can see why this anime was never that popular: It\u2019s too forgettable to be recommended. If you want something better by Watanabe, go check out Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, they are much more memorable with a more creative story, clever jokes, and likeable, realistic characters.\\n",

Michiko, an escaped convict from a high security prison, breaks into the house of Hatchin(Hana) one day and tells her to come with her.  When i say break in, i mean actually break through a wall on a motorcycle too!  That is the kind of eventful action that occurs throughout the whole series, it was definatly not lacking in that department.  The two then go on to find a man, Hiroshi, who is Hatchin'sfather and Michiko's lover.  The story follows them through what seems to be a south american style country while being chased by cops and gangsters.  The art is a unique mix of a lot coloring while maintaining a dark and gritty atmosphere.  This show actually reminded me of a mix between Black Lagoon and El Cazador de la Bruja...even Michiko was reminiscent of Revy, though not as violent.  The music was fantastic.  It really made you feel the spanish/south american setting.  The character's were also great.  The two main protagonist's are fun to watch together, whether arguing or running from gangsters and cops.  Also the side characters were very interesting, appearing and disappearing within one or two episodes.  Each personality was unique though giving spice to the interactions they had with the protagonists.",

            "content": "This is a show with much more potential than what it eventually delivered, and it is a real shame because this anime could have been a masterpiece if handled differently. The animation and music are absolutely fantastic, every scene is brimming with style, color and the cool vibes of Latin America, the heat, the tropics, the sleaziness. There is much that is one of a kind for anime, a story primarily about women and black people, the unique setting of pseudo-Brazil, the blacksploitation vibe, it\u2019s all wonderfully seedy. \r\nFor the first couple of episodes you are entranced by the atmosphere and the technical marvel, butthen, at least for me, the spell wore of, and you notice that it\u2019s just a mostly fine, but sometimes quit poor Watanabe-style story, but with Brazilians instead of Samurai or Space Cowboys. One might even go so far as to call it a knockoff. \\n\\n\r\nIs that even fair though, to call it a rip-off when it\u2019s made by the same Studio with a lot of the same staff, save Watanabe himself? Well that\u2019s the thing, it feels like a poor man\u2019s, or in this case, poor woman\u2019s Cowboy Bebop, despite that fact. All three anime have a frame story that is mostly irrelevant until the end, as their focus lies on the unconnected narratives of each episode, some of them sad, funny, scary, all their own little adventure, and it is absolutely moronic to call that filler by the way, it is the entire fucking point of those shows to be like that. \\n\\n\r\nBut where Bebop and Champloo succeed, Michiko and Hatchin sometimes fails. What makes Cowboy Bebop so great is that it manages to convey actual emotional and engaging stories in 20 minutes, and it succeeds because of its great writing. Sadly, Michiko and Hatchin is sometimes not very well written.  It\u2019s not all bad by a stretch, some of it is pretty good, but to waste such amazing production value with such OK writing is really painful to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple, angry criminal fuck-off heroin and girl with morals travel the country on a motorcycle in search of an elusive man and bond over the adventures they have. There are some pretty heartwarming moments, the ending is mostly great and emotional and it was subversive in a way I didn\u2019t expect. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem of the show is characters and especially their motivations. Again from the technical side, their designs are amazing, the outfits and hairstyles of every character change constantly and they without exception all look cool and not like typical anime-shite. \\n\\n\r\nBut dress-up can\u2019t be a replacement for good characters. Michiko is the best character of the show, you actually understand what she is about, she is a blast to watch, cool, funny, hardcore, but she isn\u2019t some uptight sex-weirdo tomboy like a lot of female action heroes. They made a female character who is certainly independent, but she likes to dress nicely, actually talks about sex, and her main drive, at first at least, is to find a guy she blindly loves. Her longing for him is conveyed rather successful, some scenes are even romantic. \\n\\n\r\nShe is by far the most nuanced of the cast, despite of all the ridiculous feats she accomplishes. Michiko is not that bright, among other things believes in esoteric woo-woo, which is a hilarious touch, but she has street smarts when it counts and does care for other people. Her character isn\u2019t that profound or novel, but she feels like a real woman, and she is so likable that the show manages to make me care about the action-scenes. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the other characters are not this good. Hatchin of course has moral qualms about how Michiko does things and they argue a lot, that is to be expected, but it sometimes feels so forced that she suddenly has misgivings with some specific of Michiko\u2019s actions, it seems as if the plot demanded that Hatchin got angry again and run away or do something dangerous, so Hatchin gets angry despite there being no reason. This happens a lot during the first half of the show. It does gets better later on, and there are some moments of actual pathos and emotion between Michiko and Hatchin. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is the Afro-70\u2019s-Blacksploitation-Detective-Lady, who is a distractingly terrible character. Her motivations flip around more than a ping pong ball, throughout the series her goals literately do a one-eighty multiple times on a whim. It is absurd and so badly done that I dreaded every scene with her after a certain point. \\n\\n\r\nThe last character that deserves mention is Satoshi, who is enjoyable, but again suffers from inconsistencies. On the one hand he does some heinous things, he is chilling and uncaring, but then he is also portrayed sympathetic in a jerk with a heart of gold way, and it is not like the character presents himself like this, no, the show presents this violent murderer like that. Despite that this character actually works great, his charisma and ruthlessness is highly entertaining in every scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe individual episodes range from pretty good to trivial, you definitely shouldn\u2019t expect some heart-pounding action or raw emotions every episode, and that\u2019s fine in theory, however in this case the more action-packed episodes are far more engaging than the slice-of-life episodes, because while the writing is sometimes subpar, the direction is very solid. Some of the episodes in the middle of the series do stand out as particularly not great, like the melodramatic story of Hatchin falling in love with some boy, or an awful episode which only features Afro-70\u2019s-Blacksploitation-Detective-Lady finding some shit in an ancient temple. \\n\\n\r\nOne other problem of the show is that it doesn\u2019t really know if it wants to be an idyllic adventure in a romanticized Latin America or a brutal crime drama in the ghetto. In the very first episode the viewer is presented some horrific abuse, there are references to fucking child-prostitution, brutal and sadistic murders, much poverty and barefoot children, but then there are also whimsical scenes where Hatchin get\u2019s drunk on orange juice, or there\u2019s a circus number, a bullfight, action scenes set to nice salsa dancing music. \\n\\n\r\nThis juxtaposition can work and create a really nuanced view of a place, but in this case it didn\u2019t, it just made the whole thing noticeably inconsistent. Michiko is a super badass who constantly evades the police force of an entire country and at one point pulls a grown man hanging from a rope up with her teeth, but she also gets the shit beaten out of her by a bunch of thugs with steel pipes so bad that her face is all swollen and she can\u2019t walk. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s all really a big shame, I love the originality, I love the vibes, I wanted to love this, and the woman who made it also worked on some legendary shows such as Texhnolyze, but I guess sometimes, things just don\u2019t work out exactly like you want to, which, in the end, is also the message of Michiko and Hatchin.",

The road-trip storyline is rather disjointed, and nothing extraordinary in its premises, but the two leads are flawed and strong willed girls you can't help but admire.\r\n  At its best, this show is wonderfully detailed, and shows thought patterns hardly seen before in anime, astutely. Hatchin's voice work ozes character, and a raw edge pervades the best scenes. Other plot elements, especially earlier, seem sadly ludicrous, and male characters are almost uniformly weak, but the leadsmanage to steer the show to an excellent conclusion.\\n\\n",

She rescues Hatchin, an orphan with a horrible foster home and takes her with her on her journey. To find a man named Hiroshi. Hiroshi is Michiko's long lost love and the birth dad of Hatchin. As they venture from town to town in a Latin based world. Like Mexico or Peru. Michiko is so hell bent on finding Hiroshi that she puts Hatchin in danger in almost every episode. But that seems to make Hatchin grow as a character. She goes from this littleinnocent girl in the first episode, to this powerful female character and almost takes over the last third of the show. Stealing it from Michiko who becomes a second breath. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is episodic, meaning it has this underlining story that gets sidetracked by little stories. You see this a lot in anime. Where there is a all around theme and goal the characters try and accomplish, but little side missions get in the way. Think like Cowboy Beebop. Spikes overall mission was to find Lucious, the man from his past and see his long lost love. But was sidetracked by mushrooms and floating fat men. Anyway, this is the same with Michiko and Hatchin. They stop in town after town meeting various characters that have nothing to do with the actual plot, but are interesting enough to keep you fully engaged and liking that each character has their own personality and are flushed out. Characters like Satoshi Batista to the circus girl who befriends Hatchin are all really good characters I had fun watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe show all around wasn't that great for me though. It didn't have anything that made it stand out from the crowd, just another comedy/action anime with a big boobed girl and cursing and to be honest, the animation was kinda ugly. Even though it had one of the best last episodes of any anime I've seen that was so gut wrenching and beautifully told. That was enough for me to give it eight stars. Because watching a really good show makes you feel like you've gone on this incredible journey with its characters. I 100% felt that with Michiko and Hatchin.",

            "content": "Anime industry always takes it easy when they define the setting of their stories. Mainly in their native land Japan. But sometimes when they decide to take it outside from the archipielago then it's something more interesting. Michiko to Hatchin is an example of how the industry should stop playing conservative and try new things instead of their  country. Because like that you can experience some forms of portraying a story and also give like a point of view of how they perceive difference places from a point of view that lives in another continent \r\nSTORY = 8\r\nFirst of all I'm a Latin Americanso knowing that this takes places in somehow Brazil was great. The story is very simple try to find the father of one of the protagonist by going through many parts of this country but one of them, Michiko, is a prisoner, while the other ,Hatchin, is living with a ''Christian'' family. While they will encounter with the many things latin american countries have: Narcotrafic of Children, weapons, thieves and many other problems they have go through just to reach that destination. The story is very cliche but the way of telling it, it's great. Because it's not just a simple adventure of let's go find him. No, here they have to go through many pleasures, temptations, and even one on one confrontations for knowing what they want. Making it very good so like that the characters can develop and learn from each other in this adventure. So for them to grow from a point of view of a young adult and little girl.\\n\\n\r\nART = 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is rather regular. It isn't that amazing but it's good. They did very well trying to represent the people with those dark skin tones and everyone of them look different from one and another. Also the scenery is very good. They portrait very well the tropical climates of this area with intense sunlight s and the dark times of rain. Its done well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part where this show is excellent. The Opening is one of the best openings I have heard in my life. That funky jazz but still somehow mix with tropical sounds like Salsa and Samba is great. Kassin is a great musician. The ending is meh. But very pasable. The osts are very awesome. Mainly the ones with Portuguese vocals. That just adds more attachment of knowing that the musicians try to convince you that the story is there. More with the song ''Desencanto''. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actresses are very good. More knowing that they are more actresses than doing voice over. That's a very good merit. The one who made it better for me was Michiko's actress Maki Yoko whose voice just sounds so great by giving Michiko that feminist actitude. It was very well directed. Thanks Mr Watanbe also for being there.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very great. The two main heroines are just like Ying and Yang in mostly every aspect. Michiko is this feminist girl that doesn't care about others and just ready to take what she wants even if it's by force. Although her past reveals many things that show why she acts like that and I must say it got to be hard to pass on. She is just great. While with Hatchin we have this educated girl that barely knows about the world because of her conservative family, but it's like the voice of reason between the two. She is rational, prepared for anything and even obedient for achieving her goals. This two just made the perfect combo. They love,hate,take care,worried and give all this feelings between one and another that doesn't make inseparable because both are meant to be with one and another and what they needed to feel better. That\u00b4s why they are some of the best pairs I have seen in anime so far. The rest of the cast is good and accomplished their roles. Mostly the police girl Atsuko who is the police girl trying to arrest Michiko and important life of her. They are a great cast.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 9\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this show a lot. Mainly with both characters adventures and their actions throught it. The action scenes are amazing. You got what you need: Guns, Vengeance, Betrayal and many more action scenes which I would spoil. Also one main factor that I enjoyed are some of the actions, traditions and stuff that represent this part of the world. For example the Narcotrafic of Children, Children of rural areas with guns and swearing, The mistism of believing things like a Statue, the Christian Faith, corruption and how violence the nations have been and some of them are still suffering. It was very well done I must say as a Latin american that they are sometimes true and even more cruel. The only main problem is the ending which I must say it wasn't satisfactory and mostly with the last scene what else I can say.But still very good portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 8\\n\\n\r\nWell this show was good. It will be memorable to me because it's like a little representation from what I see here. The action, the characters and the representations make it great. But if it wasn't for that ending it would have been a 9. But still I recommend it if you want to see a different point of view in Japan's animation.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review and good luck in whatever you do. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The main story of Michiko and Hatchin is relatively simple, but it has several subplots to fill it out. M&H has several stand alone episodes that range in quality from great to \"where is the rest of the episode?\" M&H is really good at creating questions that arouse the viewers curiosity; however, it also tends to leave a lot of questions without answers. Those questions, while not necessary for the story, leave the viewer wanting to know more at the end of the show. I think the show took the appropriate amount of time for the story the creators wanted to tell, neither too shortto create viewer investment, nor so long that the show would drag on. M&H has both a lighthearted side to it and an ultra dark and violent side that somehow manage to maintain a balance with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is great. The characters and setting look different from just about every other anime because of the show's South American style backdrop. The animation is smooth and the CG is barely noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't particularly like the opening and ending songs but they suited the show. The dub was great and none of the characters looked mismatched with their voices. There is no heavy use of music to manipulate the viewers emotions either.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the real gem of this show. Some are only seen for a couple of episodes and others are there for most of the show.\\n\r\nMichiko Malandro - One of the stars of the show. She is as badass as it gets. She constantly gets the crap kicked out of her and is like a greased pig. She is not the perfect parental figure and never becomes one but her interactions with Hatchin are great to see.\\n\r\nHana Morenos - The other star of the show grows from a shy and awkward kid to someone who has clearly been around Michiko for a while. She tends to take care of Michiko more than the other way around but she never gets to be annoying or obnoxious--completely the opposite of most child characters.\\n\r\nAtsuko Jackson - I think that her character can be pretty confusing at times. Her goal is to catch Michiko and apparently dislikes her for some reason that I feel never gets explained well enough to make sense.\\n\r\nSatoshi Batista - An old friend of Hana's father and a gang boss. He is an interesting character that walks a line between complete asshole and human being. I could never bring myself to completely hate him in spite of all his deeds.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show. I never felt the need to put it down or take a break from it. Its definitely different from most anime but if you like stuff like Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon there is a good chance you might like M&H. I recommend to anyone who enjoys seeing character relationships grow.",

            "content": "You ever open up the first episode of a show and you immediately get the sudden feeling this will be something truly remarkable? And right after you\u2019re done with finally getting to experience what most have called a ground-breaking classic, you realize that the show is just decent at best?\r\nWell, that\u2019s what happened with me and Cowboy Bebop. The story was just OK; the characters, while interesting, were also not THAT great; the world building left quite a bit to the imagination; but the music and animation were beyond excellent. Still, I was very disappointed with it. It did not blow me away at all.\r\nAfterthat, I watched Samurai Champloo. It is another work by Shinichiro Watanabe, who directed Bebop up there, which many have hailed as another classic. Now THAT was something. It shone brightly in all the departments where Cowboy Bebop did not excel. Samurai Champloo was a blast from the beginning right till the end. Even the filler episodes were absolutely well crafted.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the questions I asked in the beginning of this review; I felt like that with Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, and a couple of other shows too. Like Bebop, a number of them failed to deliver upon that feeling. And, like Champloo, the rest went directly into my list titled \u2018Annoy the crap out of people who haven\u2019t seen these so they finally crack and be subsequently amazed\u2019. You can guess which light novel I got inspired from.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin (\u2018to\u2019 \u2013 as in \u2018and\u2019) gave me that aforementioned feeling. But the catch here is this: did it also deliver?\\n\r\nIt did. Mostly.\\n\\n\r\nOther than my talk of that ambiguous \u2018feeling\u2019 I kept on about, the first thing to note about Michiko to Hatchin is that it\u2019s a lot grittier than both Bebop and Champloo. While Shinichiro Watanabe was involved with the anime, the actual directors are Murase Shukou and Yamamoto Sayo. There are a high number of shootouts, dead bodies, decisions taken by characters most viewers might not expect, and other \u2018whoah\u2019 factors. For an anime I\u2019d like to call \u2018the South American Bebop\u2019, it is the perfect combination of setting, theme, and tone. Take a Tarantino flick and turn down the eccentric-ness of the scenes down a notch and you wouldn\u2019t be far off with Michiko to Hatchin.\\n\\n\r\nHell, the very the first episode will bring out your rage when you see the kind of crap Hana, nicknamed Hatchin, is pulled out of when Michiko gets her hands on her. Think of the Dursley\u2019s treatment of Harry Potter and multiply it by ten.\\n\\n\r\nAs the episodes flow by the rage will subside very quickly and you will, being quite honest here, end up feeling a range of emotions from annoyance, genuine happiness, and a lingering sense of threat; to actual disgust. There\u2019s action. There\u2019s comedy. There\u2019s a thing for just about everyone. One episode is basically a chapter from the traditional South American soap-operas we all are so familiar with. Michiko to Hatchin grabs all of these ideas and adds its own sense of bloody yet wacky style giving us a, to my knowledge, authentic Latin American craziness.\\n\\n\r\nIt is plain to see from all this praise that Michiko to Hatchin has a story that we won\u2019t forget anytime soon but, it\u2019s still not perfect. The anime starts off really slow and it often feels things aren\u2019t really going anywhere. You\u2019ll see Hatchin and Michiko arguing about menial matters in the fourth or so episode and you\u2019ll see them do that again a few episodes later. It almost feels like they don\u2019t really learn from their time together until way later in the story. While this doesn\u2019t affect the story itself as much (things are always kept interesting) but the pacing and having most episodes start with our main duo arguing and making up in the end can feel a trite tiring. It did for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to bring attention towards before I move on to the characters is that plotholes in Michiko to Hatchin are plentiful. There are around two or three in the first episode itself. Exactly who was/is Hatchin\u2019s mother? Just what exactly did Michiko do to get ten years in prison? If there was a third then I recall it, I\u2019m afraid. Keep your eyes peeled deeper than an American stabbing Avocados for all of the other plotholes. It would make a neat treasure hunt, ehe.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, in my opinion, are the real meat of the anime. Discussing them for even just a bit would mean revealing major spoilers so I\u2019ll just briefly go through the main four.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering all the crap Hatchin\u2019s put up with for close to ten years while living with the unholy priest\u2019s family, it\u2019s fair to say that she is very different from most kids her age. Haughty, demanding authority, and law abiding (because she ain\u2019t havin\u2019 nunya dat shiet) make for one interesting non-shounen child character. She gets the most development in the series. Though, that\u2019s only in the first episode. She doesn\u2019t change or reflect on her actions even a little over the rest of the anime\u2019s duration. Which would normally be well and good if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the trait of \u2018ora?!\u2019 she keeps on pulling with everyone she meets, causing arguments, wasn\u2019t treated like some cheap gag.\\n\\n\r\nMichiko is\u2026 Well, she doesn\u2019t change much. Not much to say here. Keep an eye out for buddy cum nemesis Atsuko, though.\\n\\n\r\nHiroshi gets extremely shitty development. It\u2019s just all over the place. We barely get to know anything about him in episode 1 and and by the end of the last episode, we still know jack shit. He\u2019s treated like some mysterious macho-kindness ejaculating machine when he\u2019s really just very poorly written.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, finally, Satoshi (Hiroshi\u2019s once best friend). My favorite character of them all. The most interesting. You know you\u2019ve done great with a character when he\u2019s properly depicted as a male African in anime as we all know how black characters usually get treated in our weeaboo productions.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for a few, the rest of the characters are far from not being one-dimensional but they still manage to be interesting and fit in cozily with the brutal world depicted.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, technical stuff. Yippee!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is standard for the period. Some episodes have great detail while some look like the budget went into pockets of the designer who thought up all the many different hip threads our dynamic duo adorn throughout the anime. What all the episodes have in common is the wide range of bright color and pretty neatly choreographed action scenes. I reckon more than 23 testicles are demolished by all of the female characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack doesn\u2019t have many tracks, it still keeps things exciting and ears perked. Instant entry into the music library~\\n\\n\r\nMy original score for Michiko to Hatchin was a 9 but seeing as it\u2019s been a couple of days and the plot holes keep bothering me every now and then, I brought it down to an 8. I didn\u2019t really care about them while watching the show but now they\u2019re being a pain. Nevertheless, I still highly recommend Michiko to Hatchin \u2013 especially since virtually no one seems to fucking know about it. Sad, I know.",

It's rare that I actually feel a connection to the main characters, it's rare that I ever feel like I'm immersed in an anime and hope that there is a happy ending. Michiko and Hatchin is an anime that covered a culture of a country never really portrayed in anime: Brazil. The favelas are portrayed very well and the story values realism over fiction which is usually what makes a story memorable for me. I loved seeing people of color take such diverse roles inthis anime and I loved seeing a culture I could relate to for once. The music was superb, taking influences from great Brazilian artists like Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and the scenery was beautiful. Hatchin and Machiko's relationship are what really had me hooked and almost on the verge of tears at times because of their amazing bond. They would risk their lives for each other several times in the story and they needed each other, although they didn't know it or didn't want to admit at times. I felt like the ending wrapped their lives up well, and left enough out so that if they ever want to make a sequel they have plenty of material. It wasn't the ending that I enjoyed the most, but the journey on there. They love each other and show it in ways that I can relate to with my family. Instead of affection, we show love by arguing and making up afterwards just like Michiko and Hatchin. A beautiful anime I could relate to being Hispanic and one that everyone should watch.",

If you're a Shinichiro Watanabe fanboy (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo), you won't be disappointed. The music is excellent, the story is well-paced, and plotted out with a long term goal, just like his other productions. Yes, I realize all Shinichiro did was music production; despite that, the entire series plays out in his flavor.\r\nAnd, similarly, the ending is just as unsatisfying. But until you get there, the show'll keep you marathoning for more.\r\nIf you haven't seen the above-mentioned? Leave this on your going-to-watch list and watch those first. Typically, people hate one,and love the other, so if one of them just doesn't do it for you, swap over. If you end up hating both, congratulations, you're a rarity among viewers.",

            "content": "Michiko to Hatchin took me by surprise. A lot of stuff in the series is enjoyable, such as the characters, the art, the comedy, and that soundtrack that keeps the show going at a steady pace. Of course, there were some minor disappointments, like where it leaves you off, but I wouldn't let that small detail get in the way. Our two main heroes, Hana (Hatchin) and Michiko, were very enjoyable, and my personal favorite part about the series was the unusual, yet entertaining bond these two characters had, despite their age difference. A lot of side-characters were fun. However; they were easily forgotten aftera while, but that doesn't mean that character development was poor, in fact, I'd say it's some of the best I've seen in a long time. Now, to wrap this up, the show was great, and this one unlike other action-dramas, keeps a whole lot of the action subtle. As for the mood, sounds, setting, animation and artwork, it really makes this show quite an adventure. I'd give it another go.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like crazy humorous adventures with a good amount of action, this show would be for you.",

            "content": "Hey, this is Chas and this is my first anime review. Really hope you like it :)\r\nSTORY: The format of the this anime is simple, the story follows these two females, one is Michiko Malandro, a convit persumely in her 20's who resently escaped Diamandra, a high security prison, and is on a serious hunt for Hiroshi who is also the father of Hatchin Morenos, a 9-10 year old orphan who, to put it into better terms, lived a Cinderella life; cooking, cleaning up after them, being the occasional chew toy for her bastard siblings. That is until Michiko rode up in her house, crashingthrough the window at breakfast time, stealing Hatchin away and throwing her into a unforgiving side Brazil where people rely on crime, trickey and killing, people are hurt and taken advantage of like it's normal and people are either jerkasses or worse, it's basically as if Black Lagoon was located in South American instead. \\n\r\nAnd not only that but they also the the police force on their tail with one of them in particular seems to have a bone to pick with Michiko. \\n\r\nLet me just tell you that during this journey, Michiko and Hatchin do not get along right away withe the fact that their personalites clashes alot and have little to no common expects that they share the same tattoo and they are connect to Hiroshi Morenos in some way. But as the series progresses they begin to get closer to other another and appreicated each other...just a bit. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Michiko, what to say about this woman, this is one chick you do not want to cross. You try putting up a wall, she will tear that down with her motor scooter, you can try beating her ass but she'll come right back at you full force. You can talk as much shit to her as much as you can, she'll just sneer at your ass. \\n\\n\r\nThis female is on a mission ,okay, and she's not letting anyone get in her way. I'll telling you throughout this series you will see what juggernaut she is. \\n\r\nNow there's two ways; you can either admire her for her ability to kick so much ass, her spicy attitude bravado and her street smarts or shake your head in annoyance at her destructive nature and her irrational plans, her ways of taking care of Hana, her habit to throw violent tantrums and not doubting the fact the man she's still in love with all these years maybe dead or hell doesn't  even want her back. But trust me when I say she does get better....with Hatchin I mean. \\n\\n\r\nMichiko has done many sacrifices for Hiroshi but mainly for Hana since she is in her care and starts to genuinely care for her and her safety. There's this one time a episode where Hana's foster douchdad tried to get her back for childcare benefits...or maybe kill her.....no...I think so. Any who instead of shooting the jerkass down, she humiliates him by making him away like a little BEE-YACH and crash down on the pool table. \\n\\n\r\nDespite her many flaw since is a hopeless romantic of a villain, she is my favorite- because god dammit you gotta love what she can do on a scooter and she destroys a helicopter using a gun A HELICOPTER!  That's a crowning achieve of awesomeness!\\n\\n\r\nHatchin or Hana, fucking Hatchin, dear Lord don't this child need some prayer. Throughout this wild ride of turmoil and violence Hana gets injured, emotionally scarred, threatened with death, have her shit stolen, kidnapped, left on her own, mistreated by kids and adults alike and almost sold to slavery.\\n\r\nYou just wanna shove grenade down anyone's throat who wronged her, especially her douchbag of a Christian foster family. \\n\r\nI gotta respect her ability to stay headstrong and wise up in her new life as a run away whenever the shit hits the fan. Hell, she even cuts her hair to make her look more tough however it makes her look like Little Hiroshi or androgynous. However she does toughens up as the series goes on such as challenging a group of boys who stolen her stuff and charges fees for using the river to a swimming competition. She even knocks down two adults by kicking the fat lady on the face when shit was getting too real.\\n\r\nthe first half of the series Hana didn't really trusted Michiko, I mean you kinda would too despite the fact she did take her away from her bastard family Michiko is a convict with the police on the hunt for her. Plus she has been treated like crap most of her years so it would make since for her to not open up to new people so easily. But eventually she does, learning to rely on Michiko, her sense and quick thinking. Hana plays the role as the voice of reason, being more rational and observant than Michiko. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the ups and downs in their relationship, Hana cherish Michiko seeing her as a cool but delinquent aunt or mother figure.  \\n\r\nIn episode 18 she even chases a guy that looks exactly like her father and CHASES him while he was in the car ALL THE WAY HOME and eventually breaks into his house. Why? So she can help Michiko smile again, after feeling that Hiroshi doesn't love her. Let me tell you right now this kid will go through some seriously lengths to get what she wants.\\n\r\nI like Hana and you will too probably, for her bravery, her smarts and her innocence.....just don't give her any juice...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAtsuko Jackson,the leader of Brazil's Team Rocket tryin to capture that sexy Pikachu ehehehe.... that's sounds wrong, anywho, Atsuko is a professional police detective who has been hot on Michiko's tail ever since she broke out. Despite being on the police force she strikes deals with Satoshi from behind the scenes to get what she wants- and that is Michiko. \\n\r\nThe reason why Atsuko is so hanged up on this saucy Latina is because they use to be friends when they were living in a orphanage (hey that's something Michiko and Hana can relate to....srry) they were the type of kids where one was about that life; not giving a damn about nothing and being as carefree and rowdy as they can be and other...was not; having to be dragged along their friend's crazy scheme and sometimes being the one to blame for their friend's actions or taking the punishment because they weren't fast enough to escape. \\n\r\nAnd Atsuko was getting sick and tired of that so she blow her off and the two started to drift apart. \\n\r\nEven though Michiko is a criminal and she hated her after everything she did to her that she deed unfair, she helps her out of a bad situation. \\n\r\nAnd why is that? It said that Atsuko deep down had feelings for Michiko, so even after all  the crap she's been through; she still has some affections towards Michiko it's just that she doesn't know how to express it or she doesn't want to. Because maybe to her Michiko is a bad memory that she feels she needs to confront and finish it. And those feelings are making her confuse and angry and she can only express them by hurting Michiko. \\n\r\nWas she also hurt when Michiko choose Hiroshi over her? Does she regret not telling how she feels for her, for pushing her away and sometime soon into Hiroshi's arms? Is helping Michiko and Hatchin due to her feelings clouding her judgement somewhat how Michiko's feelings towards Hiroshi clouds her judgement after hearing such things about him? Is trying to bring Michiko to jail with her a way for her to keep a eye on her and bringing her closer to her?...............NAAAHHHH...maybe.. \\n\\n\r\nSatoshi Batista is someone you also don't want to fuck with, being a crime leader of a nasty syndicate Monstro Preto while Michiko was behind bars. Satoshi and Hiroshi were best friends after he saved Satoshi twice that is until boobies- I mean Michiko came into Hiroshi's life. Now after Hiroshi was declared dead from a bus accident, Satoshi continues to flourish and eventually becomes the baddest thug in Brazil. His reputation grows so much is that messing with his crew or with him in general meant certain death.   Just pray to God you didn't mess with this guy when he was young because he will remember you and use what you did to him against you; Manabe, the former leader of Monstro Preto learned that the hard way. \\n\r\nI'm going to say moments with this guy is very harsh. I mean he's one of them cool yet brutal crime lords that speak with a smooth voice and has no qualms using your face as target practice. And Michiko, he really really REALLY hates her ass after Hiroshi left him for her (not in that way though if you were thinking).  So yeah he's the type of villain I can respect, for being so dangerous awesome.    \\n\\n\r\nNow before I get to talking about Shinsuke Saci Rodriguez, I like to get this off my chest....-*clears throat*- BOI! Bring that ass here! I'm finna come at you from top to bottom. First let's start with the hair. Rodriguez did you really think you is getting any respect with em messed up corn rolls? You really thought you was bringing the bitches?! PSYCH! \\n\r\nYou look like you got crusty curly fires growing out of your head. O' pineapple face ass you look like some brocoili that got it's bush trimmed to hell. And that forehead! Yo shit got a xenomorph's forehead! You look like Roger from American Dad with dreadlocks. Your head looks like Megamind's after years of drug abuse. \\n\r\nAnd where the fuck are your eye brows? That person that thread yo shit done you dirty. Boy you look like Weird Al Yankovic gone punk. \\n\r\nAnd yo fucking neck! Shit's skinner than your boney ass, how's that supporting that big head?! Looks dainty as hell you need some god damn vitamins...................................................................................so Shinsuke is Satoshi's right hand man with a vicious temper and a apparent hunger for power. He and Satoshi used to be boys until Shinsuke's got Starscream-Symdrom, wanting to become SUPREME LEADER OF MONSTRO PRETO! Buuuttt in order to do that he has to have Satoshi killed. Does that work out?.........Find that out yourself!\\n\\n\r\nYeah the last one is Hiroshi and.....I don't want to talk about him.....I'm sorry it's just-I just don't. I want you to find out about him yourself, since he is the prime reason Michiko's hell bent on finding him. I will tell you this, he is a disappointment. I mean in the series they talk about how great of a guy he is but....he's not....he's just awful. Hiroshi's just so..ugh. Look if you ever get curious or anything you'll see what I'm trying to say here. But he is a just a flat out bad person to me and pretty much to anyone else who has seen the anime before. And it's not because he was in a gang or he does any killing, I mean the other stuff that he's done is bad but it's the major things in the show he has done that piss me off. \\n\r\nNot only that but to me he was bland, just a flat character. Yes, he's the thing that fuels Michiko and Hatchin on this journey but nothing really stands out. I mean the only thing about him is that he's very sexually active. That's it. I mean the reason about him being in the gang and getting involved with Michiko..I..I'll tell you this it fools you.  (btw I think I think the kid version of him in that one episode has more character than his adult form),  You'll see what I mean if you again ever get curious. \\n\r\n..........................yeah I don't like him.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also going to be supporting characters in this show that will either stand out, you'll like, you'll EXTREMLY dislike to the tenth power or just feel neutral about it. \\n\r\nDespite the majority of the characters in this show are asshole there are some that are nice like remember when I said about the boys charging fees for using the river and Hana challenges one of them in to a swimming match which resulted her almost drowning, well, those boys saved her and brought her back to her hotel and gave her her stuff back. \\n\r\nAnd that guy Hana was chasing after to make Michiko smile again, he helps her. Yeah, despite that she basically chasing after him like a mad woman and breaks into his house he helps her out. Hell he even dances with her! (I need to see that episode again that shit was crazy) I give the characters as a whole a 7.9/10 (not including fucking Hiroshi) \\n\\n\\n\r\nART/SOUND: One of the things I enjoy about Michiko to Hatchin is the music, mainly the opening and ending. 'Paradise' by Soil & \"Pimp\" Session is the series opener and I gotta say, it's freaking great. The opening is delicious, it gets you hype for the adventure you're about to receive, it gets you ready for all the action it's throwing at 'cha. It's telling you to stop what you're doing, shut the hell up and salsa. What I admire and am I real sucker for is backgrounds. \\n\r\nAnd there's a lot of visuals in the opening with colors just splash perfectly together in different shades, ranging from red to orange to yellow to blue to purple, brown and black. It's one of those shows that doesn't really change the songs as the series progresses but and it doesn't have any singing, just a man shouting out in some language, but the instrumental on it's own is just fine and groovy.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there \"Best Friend\" by Karutetto, which does the opposite. After having dealing with all the drama, topsy-turvy, exciting, daring activities; the song does its job by calming you down and bring your heartbeat back to it's normal pace. These songs will get you nodding your head or get you chilling on the bed or couch or floor...whichever.\\n\\n\r\nI know I should've said this before but I wanted to say it here, this anime is directed by Sayo Yamamoto who also did Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Space Dandy so the style bears much resemblance. Something that might catch your interest is the fact that there's some diversity in this anime, streaming from white, to Chinese, to black, to mix, to Latino. Despite looking fresh this anime came out in 2008 so this anime looks older than it....well looks. What you'll notice in this anime is how dated everything looks and I'm always intrigued how different buildings or places looks, how the people here are designed. There's going to vehicles that look like they're from the 1970's, TV broadcasting with a 80's style and architecture that looks rundown and sometimes raggedy. I give the music and the art style a 8.2/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: The anime scored 7.9 on MyAnimeList.net and on IMDb a 7.8, I'm not going to lie, it would make sense, but you know what I'm going to give this anime a 8/10 and I totally recommend it if you are a fan of action, adventure, drama, comedy, a badass female duo on the run then this my friend is for you! ^_^ This anime only has 22 episodes but it's worth taking a look at and believe me when I say, I do not mind taking a look at those episodes again. Thank you for listening to me ramble on about how I feel about this wonderful anime and I hope this sort of thing doesn't happened again. \\n\r\nUntil next time, CBCAnime signing off.",

She was really cool and sexy and loved her personality!\r\nI also loved the relationship between Michiko and Hatchin!\r\nEven though the anime follows the plot. Along the way, they meet new people and (spoiler!) Michiko gets to meet this guy who already has a wife. For some reason, this was my favorite episode.\r\nAnyways! There is a bunch of genres mixed together... but the main is friendship, (kinda) adventure, (slight) romance. \r\nAnd btw, this reminded me of the anime called Nana and Lupin the third...\r\nNana is about two girls who have the same name. And one Nana is just a normalcute girl and the other is a punk band vocalist who is really cool, beautiful (I just love her) . The punk band vocalist reminded me of Michiko so ya...\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Lupin the third is a good anime for you if you like to read comedy, adventure (it's about a playboy theif), and romance (with the main \"woman\" Fujiko) \\n\\n\r\nPlz Watch this Anime! It's amazing!",

            "content": "Story 9/10\r\nTruly interesting and unique premise. I felt like the story had a good flow, it catches you and you get interested on the goal of the characters: to find Hiroshi. You want to know if he is alive, how he is, etc. Nothing felt rushed of forced. \r\nArt 10/10\r\nGodness, the desings of the characters are wonderful, the style, the animation, the detailed backgrounds, everything was amazing. A characteristic about the director Yamamoto is that the clothes/hairstyle of the characters change through the series, and I loved that. It gives them another layer of realism and is artistically pleasing to see new desings with everyepisode. The ambient was so well made, the places, the language, the people, the vehicles, I truly felt like I was looking at brazil.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of the genre but damn, I grooved with some songs, mostly of the background songs on the episodes. The op is meh to me, but I could find myself humming it hahah. The ed is also ok, but I think all of the OST fits perfectly with the series. The sound effects where quite good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nThe main cast is great, you get attached to Hatchin because how strong is she (to the very end).  Michiko is a refreshing main character for the anime industry in my opinion. Getting to know all the new characters every episode was really enjoyable for me. The characters and their interactions made you remember how cruel is this world, and that nobody is totally a hero or a bad guy, and that actions have consequences. I felt like all of that makes them more realistic. And their backstories where told with such a natural flow to it, I liked that a lot, and I think that is important. First you need to care/get interested in this characters before hearing his backstory in order to fully enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI got catched up with the story even tho I'm not a fan of the genre, I was too curious about how everything would end, and I enjoyed the ride. I didn't cry or got too much excited (except with the last episode... oh man) but I really loved learning about the characters and their stories and relationships, listening to the music and the well made scenes (sometimes I could go \"damn... this scene didn't had any dialogue and it said so much in a smooth way) and also looking at the beautiful art.\\n\\n\r\nOveral 9/10\\n\r\nIt was just amazing, a hidden gem from 2008.",

            "content": "This is my first review. :) \r\n--\r\nSince I've re-watched this show many times, I think it's the right moment to write a review. But if you don't feel like reading this review, I'll break it down into a few simple words: Michiko to Hatchin is a unique show that's a must watch.\r\nStory - 10: Michiko to Hatchin's story truly pulled me in the beginning, and that's usually the best thing that you can get from a show; especially if it's 20+ episodes long. There's nothing \"predictable\" about the story, because I always found myself wanting to know what would happen next. I usually didn't findmyself confused about what was happening at the moment, because the characters could relate to what was going on back with short flash backs or briefly explain what was going on currently, although at times, it would seem a bit slow and I would find myself saying, \"What are the characters doing here...?\". Yet, I still loved everything about the story; I really felt like I was a part of the adventure the main characters were on. It's as if Michiko to Hatchin could have been a movie because of the plot, but even if there were multiple episodes or just 1 movie, I would have been able to enjoy it because the story was comprised so well. <3\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10: It's marvelous. The scenery really portrays how a Latin American country should look like(...even though I've visited to one, but besides that...).  There's lots of lively and colorful vibes from the art, which is usually a feeling people get from countries like Brazil. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9: The OSTs are great. The music also tends to put out that lively feel. I loved the opening AND the ending for sure; I even found myself falling in love with the band who composed the opening song. The music can go well with certain scenes and really draw you in, along with your emotions.. :')\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10: Ahh, I just LOVE the characters. I defiantly have a favorite character out of the show ((GOD, I love Michiko!!)), but I guarantee you that you're gonna fall in love with all the characters, or at least the majority of the characters. There's a good variety of them that you're going to be introduced to in different episodes. All of the characters are amazing and it's great to see how the cast of characters consists of so many different ethnicities. You can really see how authentic they all are and get a feel of who they are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall - 10: To be honest with you, I wish I could just forget about everything I saw in the story and just watch this over and over again; it's just so worth watching! I just can't find that many flaws. I literally binge watched the whole show and didn't even move on to a new show. I cannot emphasize enough how much I loved this show; the story, art, sound, characters, and enjoyment are just pieces that fit all together and make Michiko to Hatchin turn out to be a masterpiece. I'm 100% sure I would watch this again, because I've said it once and I'll say it again..\\n\\n\r\nMichiko to Hatchin is a must watch.",

The original post is linked right here.\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Toonami/comments/3wor9m/postseries_discussion_thread_michiko_hatchin/\r\nI thought it was alright, as I viewed it as Thelma & Louise if it was done by the people behind Cowboy Bebop. \r\nI'll admit that I enjoyed some of the action moments that were in the anime but while the drama was decently written, I wasn't fully into it. Mainly because in comparison to Bebop, I didn't really care for the setting and also while the characters were decent, they don't compare to the ones in Bebop in myeyes. Still, It was rather impressive seeing Monica Rial trying something different playing the spicy latina Michiko since I mostly see her range is mostly set to either Bulma or Stocking. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I thought it was a decent anime with a nice ending to counteract some of the bleak moments and flatout downer endings that occurred in the series but not something that I picture myself watching again.",

The animation is top notch, with each facial expression being artfully twisted to convey emotion, subtle body movements captured to reinforce speech\\n\\n\r\neach character seems to have their own unique way of carrying themselves, in fact, while I'm on characters and \"uniqueness\"; the character designs themselves are grounded in reality, as is the series as a whole. with that said, there is no over-the-top \"anime/fantasy design\" to the outfits the characters wear, which change every episode, further grounding the design in reality, which I absolutely respect in any media so that, alone gives it major points for me.\\n\\n\r\nthe characters are all memorable and shine in their own ways, especially as relationships between them start to intersect, at times this effects you as a soap opera does to its dedicated fans. you grow connected to certain characters and disdainful toward others.\\n\\n\r\noverall, watch Michiko to Hatchin if you want to watch the spiritual child of Cowboy Bebop, Lupin the Third and Brazilian drama, with a little american western film thrown in there, if so...you will NOT be disappointed\\n\\n\r\n10-10 and new favorite",

VERY different setting than most anime. i believe brazil. where naturally everyone speaks japanese.  very engaging characters. the plot follows 2 polar opposites who at first share  a common goal, but through their adventures and hardships they begin to understand each other and rethink what they really want. in this way (and in artform) i would liken this anime to samurai champloo (without the *common* goal part).\r\nThe character development is....slow; the first half of the titular pair doesnt show any truly meaningful emotional development till the very far into the series. butwhen it does occur, you grow to like them even more. the plot can also be confusing, with a VIP looking very similar to several others they run across and some convoluted side stories; but really, the plot is secondary to the character development, so this is somehow acceptable. what i mean to say is: watching the 2 main characters grow and bond seems to me the main goal of the anime; the story merely serves as a vehicle to guide this process. \\n\\n\r\nMost, if not all, anime writers seem to be unable to create satisfying and meaningful endings. Michiko to Hatchin is.....well, doesnt exactly fail this expectation, but still by far has one of the better endings than most (still not fantastic, but not as horrid as most, i mean). \\n\\n\r\njust give it a try. i very rarely am inspired to write a review for anything, but i was absolutely enthralled by this anime (by the end at least). its a journey in more ways than one, and youll be finding it harder and harder to not click \"next episode\" and go to bed already.",

            "content": "Actually this is an anime that I normally wouldn't watch, but because of personal reasons ( just an old nickname what happened to be Michiko, so I found it funny to watch an anime with that name in it) I started to watch it a few years ago. I don't really remember why, but I put it on on-hold after just 2 episodes. Last week I decided to watch the rest of it and it was as if I just started with a new anime, because I really didn't remember the first two episodes, but actually that didn't really matter because they explained a lotin the episodes that followed. \\n\\n\r\nThe story...\\n\r\nWell it is a story that takes place in Brazil and that was kind of different from the animes that I watched so far, so that alone was a really fun part about the anime. It was actually a kind of good story about a girl, Michiko, that wants to find Morenos Hiroshi, the love of her life. It was said that he died in an accident, but she believes that he still lives because of Morenos Hana, who most likely happens to be his daughter( even though she didn't met her father yet). Michiko promised her to protect her and together they search for Hiroshi. \\n\r\nI really liked that kind of idea, so that was a part that I really enjoyed. It's just that I'm not the type of person who enjoys war like animes. There was just a lot of blood, fights and death. I actually am not good with that at all, so I felt bad a lot of times. Even though I would have wanted to drop it because of that, the story itself was far to interesting to stop watching. I just had to know how it would end. I just had to know if her father really would be still alive and if he was, what kind of person he was. I don't regret watching it, but it isn't exactly the type of anime you should watch if  you're bad with an action genre. Because there is a lot of action in it. \\n\r\nI was interested in the story, and I kind of liked it, but there were a lot of times when I just felt totally annoyed because of what happened. And actually I didn't really like the ending, it wasn't what I expected, but it wasn't bad either though.\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing special with the art actually, I don't have anything to say about it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sounds, they weren't bad. I actually liked it that the voice actors of Michiko and Hana were only used in Michiko to Hatchin, because it felt kind of unique, but I actually really liked their voices ( especially Michiko's voice) so they should get more voice acting roles in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nabout the characters...I actually didn't really like much characters. I found a lot of them really annoying, but I totally loved Michiko and Hana wasn't that bad either, so that made up for the rest of the characters, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it that much though, there were episodes where I enjoyed the anime, but there were quite a lot episodes where I was bored too. A lot episodes felt like fillers, and that ruined it a little, but I wouldn't say that it was that bad though. In my opinion it's watchable, but not that great though.",

The story is usuallyset in one-part episodes, meaning that our two heroines meet a variety of characters, with all different backstories and personalites. Luckily, we don't go too in-depth with the side characters, so we aren't too lost.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is gorgeous on its own. Being made by Manglobe (i.e., Samurai Champloo and Deadman Wonderland) you'd expect nothing less. From the lights of the cities, to the rural countryside, the world of Michiko and Hatchin is one you might want to live in. A highlight of the art would be Michiko's bike, which is the main mode of transportation for Michiko and Hana.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound sets the mood for the show, as well. Only a few tracks stand out, and that is with the help of the scene. However, the music is good for what it is, despite it blending in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Michiko and Hatchin is a good anime to watch if you're looking for a visual treat, and strong lead characters. I recommend watching Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo after it, as many do the same. Plus, it's only 22 episodes long.\\n\\n\\n\\n",
