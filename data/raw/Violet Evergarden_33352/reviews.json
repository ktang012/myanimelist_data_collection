            "content": "There it is, a body on display, delicate fabric hugging its frame as if a part of its existence from the very beginning. Porcelain skin adorned with silk, the material complements the complexion. The figure stands there without concern for the wondering gaze of any passersby, a translucent wall erected between it and the endless faces. Society is kept at bay. The soft glow of light dancing on the surface of the sheet of glass serving as its imprisonment. It shimmers ever so slightly, creating prisms of color in the endless shuffle. The rays of light trails over the delicate frame of the figure. Beautyblossoming from a thing of tertiary value.  \\n\\n\r\nBut this is not Violet Evergarden I'm describing. \\n\\n\r\nLook beyond the object, beyond the fabric; zoom pass the crystalline glass wall, and suddenly, the true image of my purple prose takes shape. There it is, coming into focus, a JC Penny's mannequin positioned at the window front of a shopping mall district. The dancing lights, nothing but the cheap glow of neon signs from neighboring competitors adjacent to it. The wondering gazes, nothing but customers with money to spend.  \\n\\n\r\nIf embellishments for something so minuscule is all you need to be entranced by the item being described, then Violet Evergarden will not bother you. However, if you desire content equally as deserving of the words being used to describe it, then it might benefit you to move on to greener pastures, because like this opening paragraph, so too is the material on display hyper-stylized rendering of a truly insignificant thing. The main difference being the tool; flowery words traded in for audiovisual frontloading. Layered color gradients supplemented in place of proper diction. Lots of icing, very little cake. \\n\\n\r\nBut it's not all a lost cause. VE's story is one of relation. Or rather, everything surrounding it facilitates sentiments easy to relate too. One that practically writes itself. A person used as an instrument of war attempting to find ways to rekindle their lost humanity. An appointed position that gives opportunities to do just that. A girl disciplined in strict military decorum. A puppet with its strings cut loose, unsure as to what to do with her newfound freedom. She's a lost child, forgotten by society, forced to start from scratch. A holdover from a wartorn nation whose usefulness is brought to a crossroads. The story ends with the closing of one chapter, as we begin the journey of another. The journey is that of recovery. A journey aided by the guiding hands of someone not there in the flesh. Efforts made from beyond the grave for her betterment. One that will serve as her driving force towards improvement as well as the source of her grief as she draws closer to the answers she seeks.\\n\\n\r\nThrough her, we're introduced to this world. One made up like a quilt of different time periods and cultural influences, all stitched together to create something new. Victorian era structures serve as the city skyline while the undeniable look of early 20th-century technology takes the form of motor vehicles, as well as a wide assortment of widgets and trinkets littered throughout the environment. Our person of interest, Violet, equally as blended. Her appearance is that of an unassertive young woman, while her mechanical limbs tell a different story. One of violence and darkness. This temperament reflected in her personality. She only sees things in utilitarian ways; typewriters are weapons, school is a mission, her job becomes headquarters, saluting whenever given orders, requesting permission for all her actions. Social graces are completely lost on her. Her upbringing robbing her of the privilege to decide. There was only ever one path for her to take. Until recently, her actions were that of a blade, sheathed, just waiting for the time that its usefulness was required once again. An instrument of death whenever its wielder sees fit.\\n\\n\r\nHer new job changes that. She must write for others as an \"Auto Memory Doll,\" a profession where she's tasked to transcribe the feelings and thoughts of others, giving a voice for those that have trouble doing so on their own accord. A job where recorded sentiments are captured in a letter. A chance for an emotionally stunted girl to learn what feelings are. A \"doll\" wanting to become a doll, when in fact, the act of becoming one is what brings her closest to humanity.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the show writes itself. \\n\\n\r\nA self-oscillating arbiter of \"good content\" for anyone wanting to express why it's \"good content.\" The mere act of explaining its basic premise does the legwork for them. Except for the fact that when the content is lifted from the pages of its screenplay and brought to life by the magic of animation, it's equally as flaccid as the diegetic information would have you believe when following a character of such stunted social growth. It's a show perfect for overthinking, perfect for negating any naysayer, where issues are fended off as \"it's meant to be that way.\" Subject matter created to facilitate a drab character doing things in a drab fashion. A machine-like girl with mechanical limbs given a task to emulate empathy. Her stilted, often wooden personality is accounted for by her upbringing. She's that way because she's SUPPOSED to be that way. It's all very self-serving. \"To wear one's faults on their sleeve\" taken quite literally. \\n\\n\r\nIt would have worked too, had there been no viable means to circumvent such insular logic. But here's where knowledge supersedes those counterarguments. Where one's experience can allow criticism to stick. This isn't the first anime to house such themes. And of those that did so before it, there are definitive examples of \"better\" out there disallowing the open acceptance of wooden behavior solely for the fact that the character's given circumstances allows it. Humans aren't that flat. To enable such simple-minded evaluations in place of spotting genuine issues is to trivialize the complexities of the human race altogether.\\n\\n\r\nWe already know what it would be like for an apathetic person unable to function without the strict regiment of paramilitary life because we've seen it done with a pedigree of writing befitting the serious subject matter. People that carry the baggage of their actions, the haunting memories of the things they've seen, unable to let go, to fully allow oneself to be integrated into society. We know what this looks like because well-developed personalities like Kazuki Fuse from Jin-Roh exists. Major Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell exists. Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist exists. PTSD is not a scapegoat for underwritten performances, and it should never be accepted as one. \\n\\n\r\nThese issues are made visible by VE's very crowning achievement. Pristine art and animation that ends up highlighting the thin veneer of its inherent value. The undeniable look of sterile sleekness. The artifice of humanistic warmth made bare by the prim and proper order towards everything on display. Everything and everyone is made beautiful. Age, circumstances, genetics; none of it matters. Mandated aesthetics dictate this world. You die beautifully. You get angry beautifully. You get beaten up with style. Even tears are delivered with streams of diamond-like orbs, with the owners' faces made for the camera. Everyone in this world like that of runway models, all given a chance to play civilians. Realism made implausible when all inhabitants look like they should be doing photo ops for H&M brochures. Any attempt at realism placed further on cease-and-desist when glimpses of battles are depicted with shounen-like fight sequences. A place where even the grim outcome of war must be performed with a sense of commissioned poetics, all done to appease the vision of a director too busy with their pursuit for a particular aesthetic to let the content speak for itself. Content that effectively gets in the way of its own vision because it's never granted the chance to breathe. \\n\\n\r\nNatural light emulation that aims for Call Me by Your Name but lands somewhere along the lines of The Visit. How an anime could suffer from overexposure is beyond me. Goes to show you that when you emulate without understanding, the issues are copied as well. Time-lapse photography used in every episode, not for any purpose other than to show off. Lens blur effects used for flashbacks and present-time, not because there's a reason to but because the director can. Everything is in service of this perfectness. This very unnatural attempt at being \"natural\" utterly self-defeating of its intentions. \\n\\n\r\nThis is equally true for moments underlined with genuine character outbursts. \\n\\n\r\nSilence is powerful. Playing music over every scene is amateur. Words drowned out by plucked strings, the steadily held notes of a violin, piano keys dolled out just as quickly; all of this without concern for what the characters are saying. Entire dialogue exchanges where silence is appropriate is washed out by a wall of sound. It doesn't compliment the material; it hijacks it. There's a time and a place for everything, this anime never come to realize that fact. \\n\\n\r\nIt may take drowning out its content before one take notice of what good is there, but in that regard, Violet Evergarden is not without merit. Our protagonist may be an empty vessel with flickers of humanity tucked inside, but thankfully we're not made hostage by her presence, as every chapter in VE is in service of someone else. People of far greater interest than herself. Their emotional range not limited\u2014even when presented with the same aesthetic brushstrokes that everything is painted in\u2014their humanistic tendencies find a way to radiate outward. And as a vessel, Violet is given a chance to charter her clients' emotions to those on the receiving end of the expressed affection, and through that task itself, is able to find a way to expound upon her own feelings in return. The broad spectrum of accumulated emotions serving as the proxy towards finding her own. The idea itself is very appropriate. I would even go as far as saying that it's thoughtful. It also operates with a pace befitting the subject matter, even if that pace is considered to be a problem to some. These things need time to happen. Thankfully, Violet is alotted that. \\n\\n\r\nIt's all told through carefully selected vignettes, being brought together by motifs relating back to nature, its seasons, and the various foliage that comes to represent them:\\n\\n\r\n\u25b8The story of Iris, a girl named after the flowers in bloom in her small village, seeking out an existence away from her meager upbringing. Unwilling to accept rejection, an act of stubborn pride catalyzes her steps forward. \\n\r\n\u25b8The story of Luculia, a pleasant disposition befitting the flower she's named after. She puts the feelings of her loved one ahead of herself. Hoping for their eventual emotional recovery from a tragedy that robbed them both of normalcy. \\n\r\n\u25b8The unofficial sigils of two kingdoms: one a white rose, the other red. Lovers-to-be and penpals brought together by political circumstances, but share a love that aligns beyond the expanded power and peace of their union. \\n\r\n\u25b8The final days of a mother, the autumn leaves fall as a countdown to her departure from the land of the living, wanting nothing more than to find a means to comfort the daughter that she's leaving behind. \\n\r\n\u25b8The blanket of snow that covers a warring nation in frozen stasis. People refusing to move forward. Like their winter surroundings, they too remain cold towards each other, leaving their country in a state of civil unrest.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the story of Violet herself, named after a wildflower in bloom; she's plucked out of the custody of a heartless man and into the care of one that sees beyond her reduced form. A disheveled mess, only treated as a tool, one meant to be used and later disposed of; the man sees differently. He wants her betterment at any cost, even if that means paying the ultimate price. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a beauty here when you view the intentions behind every chapter. The problem stems from the execution itself. Beautiful on paper doesn't translate to well-done in reality. Funny enough, the doll-like nature of the protagonist and her initial attempts at writing serves as a sort of meta-commentary for the content on display: \\n\\n\r\nHer intent is earnest, she wants to understand the expressions and feelings being directed her way, but like her mechanical limbs, so too is the show written with a sense of artificiality. An emulation of real-life that can't muster up to being anything more than that. \\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a beautiful plastic rose with stuck-on water droplets. It's well-kept. Never finding the beauty in decay. Never needing to accept the full spectrum of life simply because its creators are wholly content with being \"perfect.\" True beauty is found in the blemishes. Within the scuffle of humanity's futility towards greater ambitions. True beauty comes from the majesty of life itself making mankind a mere moment in a pool of infinity. True beauty is humbling. \\n\\n\r\nIt's through the imperfections that true beauty is emitted. Violet Evergarden is pretty to look at, but with the absence of this understanding, it could never be the real thing, it could never be \"true beauty.\"",

            "content": "Waking up one day and discovering Violet Evergarden getting an anime adaptation by Kyoto Animation should be a blessing. At least that\u2019s what it looked like on the surface. The light novel series earned the grand prize from the Fifth Kyoto Animation in the novel category. Even with two volumes, my expectations going into this anime was high. In particular, the sheer visual quality is a sight to feast on. However, Violet Evergarden isn\u2019t exactly just known for that but does that mean it\u2019s something to be praised?\r\nWritten by Kana Akatsuki, the light novel series is a story about Auto Memory Dolls. They are dollsare made by Dr. Orland, a scientist who used them to assist his wife in writing novels. However, these dolls were also rented out to others for service. The main plot revolves around an Auto Memory Doll named Violet Evergarden as she tries to discover her purpose in life.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who came into this series half prepared (I have read parts of the light novel), I felt I was ready enough. The first few episodes came in as anime originals and that left me with some mixed reception. However, I will say that the pilot episode was a terrific picture. Beyond the lush quality and the visual magnificence, Violet Evergarden presented a story with heavy emotions. It synchronizes with the drama and melancholy of what I had anticipated. However, the main selling point of the show is titular character Violet Evergarden herself. The story feels like a character study that puts over her above the rest of the cast. Every episode focuses on Violet in some way through her role in the story, her interactions with others, and how she develops as a character. The conflicts she experiences tests her feelings and how she responds to them by trying to understand others. It draws viewers into asking questions about how she can develop as a character and in a lot of ways, I think the show did do that quite well. For instance, Violet displays a lot of human characteristics and tries to understand others. The most prominent scenes features her desperately trying to learn what \u201clove\u201d is and to me, this series chronicles her experience like a life journey of discovery. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really say that the first few episodes were well thought out in characterizing Violet as a memorable character. Beyond her expressions and role, it seems the show repeats a lot of the same things over and over. The example includes Violet expressing why she is an Auto Memory Doll and it gets tedious fast. It also doesn\u2019t help much that the other side characters seemingly react in similar ways to Violet. My main concern for the first few episodes were mainly how this can keep viewers interested with such a way of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the series does get better and puts emphasis in some of the side characters. While the plot feels non-linear at times, some of the other characters do get spotlight through effective background storytelling. For instance, one of the episodes featured a 14 year old princess who gets engaged to a prince and while this seemed like a cheesy love tale at first, it resolved in a very emotional way. It gave me the impression that certain side characters are worth investing time into. In the meantime, the series does eventually step into the light novel adaptation territory as we learn more about Violet\u2019s past and connection with someone very important to her. That person would be Gilbert Bougainvillea, a major in the Leidenschaftlich Army and someone that influenced Violet a lot since she met him. As we look at Violet\u2019s past, we learn how they met and how much he treasure her like a person rather than a doll. It\u2019s also important to note that Violet feels comfort whenever she is around him and not lonely. The anime in the present timeline portrays Violet as a very lonely character and doesn\u2019t have someone to depend on. In doing so, it establishes Violet as a character that has a hard time understanding others. This is especially true for her after she heard Gilbert\u2019s final words. The show dedicates time to explore Violet\u2019s change since the past and how she reflects her experiences in the present. As I mentioned before, the series takes a lot of time into examining Violet as a character and getting viewers to understand her. The side characters play important roles in later episodes to make Violet reflect on her past deeds. To me, it\u2019s effective storytelling as it really made me understand her behavior. The more I understood her, the more compelling her character became. I don\u2019t know if this was the creator\u2019s intention from the start but honestly, it does come together as a well delivered plan.\\n\\n\r\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking of the story contains too much drama for its own good. In some ways, it does but in other ways, it\u2019s also important for the main story. You have to remember that the timeline takes place after a war that Violet was previously involved in. Stories about war often involves pain, tragic memories, and even death. For Violet, she experienced the realities of war. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be a lot of drama and its effect on the storytelling can be received with mixed receptions. I had some mixed feelings in general about Violet\u2019s past as while it can definitely evoke emotions, it doesn\u2019t feel unique enough to be memorable. In other words, I\u2019m more interested in how she develops as a character in the present rather than focusing on her past. Even if it\u2019s significant for her characterization, the drama presented in the background stories doesn\u2019t always feel too impactful. I get it though. Some people will probably point fingers and say that it\u2019s necessary. Others may agree with what I mentioned here. To me, I\u2019m still more interested in Violet\u2019s development in the present than who she is in the past. Otherwise, Violet\u2019s role in the show feels more than just a protagonist. She is the character.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone watching this series will easily recognize the powerful production of the show. This is perhaps one of Kyoto Animation\u2019s best work yet in terms of technical quality. The world setting has natural and lush landscapes with European style architecture detailed with vivid colors. Every camera shot feels impactful and there\u2019s no drop in quality in any episode. Body movements are also timed precisely well to highlight every fine detail such as Violet\u2019s character expressions and role as a doll. Speaking of which, Violet\u2019s character design makes her look very elegant. If you haven\u2019t known about her background story, it\u2019s hard to recognize her as a former soldier. Her signature hand is also a trademark animated with impressive features. It communicates the message to viewers as what she is. Other characters in the show also stand out with their human characteristics. While there\u2019s no fan service in the show, there are characters such as Cattelya that can be very pleasing to the naked eyes. It\u2019s clear to me that Kyoto Animation and the creative team poured a sheer amount of effort into making this series as a whole. The theme songs also highlights a sensitive feeling of melancholy to match the series\u2019 tone while character voice mannerism for the majority of the cast are able to keep up with their momentum. The music and OST also hits the mark to deliver what's intended especially for the emotional drama.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s definitely a series that felt different to me compared to some of other Kyoto Animation\u2019s recent works. This one was an emotional storyteller that gave us a reason why we should care about Violet Evergarden; not just the story but Violet\u2019s own journey of discovery. While I can\u2019t say it\u2019s always an effective tearjerker, it\u2019s still a show that\u2019s worth investing time into. Well done, Kyoto Animation. You gave me a better hope for your future.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden, the anime that has been hyped for a year, has finally arrived with controversy and concern. Is it the masterpiece that\u2019s deemed from most? Certainly not. That does not mean VE could not deliver. I\u2019m not gonna try to defend the anime just cuz it\u2019s KyoAni and it\u2019s highly placed by many, but I will give credit where credit is due. So let\u2019s get started.\r\nThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that VE is visually appealing and accompanied by a great OST. However, do the characters and plot live up to it? So far, it\u2019s too early to say despite 4 episodes still out.But we can kinda take a guess at this point. However, I do find the setting to be quite interesting and how the characters act seem to be somewhat realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s many reasons why people can rant on about this series, and no, \u201cIt\u2019s KyoAni\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Overhyped\u201d aren\u2019t some of them despite people using these as reasons regardless. Violet\u2019s introduction left many questioned, many thinking \u201cShe\u2019s not interesting.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s Bland\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s 1-Dimensional.\u201d But to be quite honest, the fact that she\u2019s uninteresting and bland means there\u2019s room for growth, and anyone can figure that out considering this has been done quite a lot. The start of the anime really showcases violet and her imperfection. Monotone, Boring, Lacking. Which is all the more reason for me to look forward to the end result of her character after upcoming development. Sure, maybe the way it was executed or presented seems questionable, but what the hell do you expect from a child that's been practically raised in war, got constant blood on her hands, and kills people without batting an eye? Anyways, I believe there\u2019s a bigger picture to this and that this sort of direction has a purpose. Or it could be just bad directing, but I\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\n\r\nI see no reason to give lack of growth or undeveloped as reasons to criticize characters so early on. It\u2019s like people expect 14 episodes worth of developed from Violet in the first couple episodes. There\u2019s reasons why developments exist, and it\u2019s to further a character and make them more interesting as people would expect to see. However, it\u2019s how they go about this development that makes me question the series a bit. The direction it\u2019s taking can go either way, so we\u2019ll have to see.\\n\\n\r\nLike I\u2019ve said, there\u2019s so much room to give more proper development on violet\u2019s character and the rest, but if it\u2019s accompanied by mediocre writing, then this development would be half assed. Now the writing isn\u2019t horrible for what it\u2019s worth, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to care about what dialogues these characters decide to use. There\u2019s only a lack of substance since it\u2019s still too early for its full potential to be known. So there\u2019s really no \u201csubstance\u201d to rate upon anyway. But that\u2019s why although I\u2019m not fond of the writing so far, I look forward to the conclusion and hopefully they successfully develop the characters enough for us to sympathize or to understand them much better. I think people expected this to be somewhat deep and thought-provoking. But this is somewhat a simple story about a girl trying to find herself. Just that it takes on a more dramatic approach.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the inner contents of the series itself, it definitely does the outer contents right. To the art style, the character design, the colours and background, as well as character movement, which makes them feel more realistic and humane. Sometimes the interactions between characters are fun to watch as well.\\n\\n\r\nI think that VE is one of those shows that needs time and a slower process to really form the bigger picture and its true purpose. Although the pacing seems...awfully slow, I wouldn\u2019t go as for to deem it \u201cboring.\u201d For me, I don\u2019t think that at all. It makes me curious for more and how they decide to execute the given scenarios and how each character grows from it. Sure some of the drama hasn\u2019t been so impactful or meaningful thus far, but it\u2019s been mentioned many times here that with enough time, I believe the drama then will carry more impact and weight than before. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think people should try place this anime on some sort of pedestal because it\u2019s simply KyoAni or it looks amazing. Violet Evergarden is FAR from perfect, but it\u2019s also not horrible at the same time. It\u2019s been mentioned before, I believe it\u2019s one of those anime that requires time to be able to fully understand VE\u2019s potential. So I recommend lowering your hype level of this series and treat it like any other show this winter, because you'll probably ruin the show for yourself if you don\u2019t. Violet Evergarden doesn\u2019t offer much but great visuals and soundtracks along with it. Look at what type of series it is and see if it interests you. I understand many people feel obligated to watch it because it\u2019s solely KyoAni (Me Included tbh). But see if it truly catches your interest. If it doesn\u2019t, then don\u2019t bother. \\n\\n\r\nI think VE may carry a simpler story than one might think. Not insanely thought-provoking or riveting, but I believe that since this show focuses on Violet\u2019s Character, we\u2019d be able to go more in depth on her past life and her adventures later on. We will see Violet grow as a character as she learns from others\u2019 experiences. That\u2019s her job after all, to deliver letters to people and to fully express their emotions onto a piece of paper. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Violet Evergarden has caught my interest personally and although it\u2019s hanging on the edge, I do hope that the staff finds a way to really bring out the full glory of the series into its full light and shows us a great series with fine narratives and well-developed characters (although sometimes the development is being dragged out a bit too much). Not sure why some of the side characters are original, but I suppose they add a bit to Violet's character.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, I\u2019ve learned not to give a damn about MAL scores a long time ago, because those \u201cscores\u201d used to influence me whether to watch something or not. I don\u2019t give a fuck if VE ends up in the 6\u2019s or low 7\u2019s once this is over. If I enjoyed it personally and loved it, then that\u2019s that. But again, my opinion on this can change easily. I\u2019ve only read a couple chapters of the source material so I can\u2019t really determine how well the adapatation is so far. But VE shows promise, it\u2019s up to the staff to live up to the promises and opportunities they\u2019re given. Both the OP and ED were beautiful and the OST's are just great, really not much to talk about there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (as of Episode 12):\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I truly believe Violet Evergarden can come out as one of the best from Winter, dare I say year, if it\u2019s done right\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf. \\n",

            "content": "\"As human beings, we all mature physically from childhood to adolescence and then into adulthood, but our emotions lag behind.\" - Bernard Sumner\r\nThis is the most memorable quote that had gone through my mind whenever I watched Violet Evergarden, and led me to ask myself this question: how do you learn an emotion? \r\nExperience? Knowing its definition? Or perhaps... By writing letters for others? Thus is VE's answer.\r\nStory: 7\r\nI liked the novel, so obviously I liked the story. They did make me get worried with those original episodes at the start but later on they managed to adapt most of the best chapters. There arequite a few which are standalone: 5,6,7,10,11. The rest involved Violet and her co-workers. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half didn't look that promising, but the second half improved a lot. I think it's because they put in a lot of her adventures in the second half, only involving Violet and the customer, which gave a lot more room for growth instead of being surrounded by the other workers. She's the type who learns fast when she's alone, you could say. Watching her change bit by bit  a girl from emotionless and to some extent irritating to one who is able to experience emotions was very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is not unique in the sense that she's trying to find the meaning of \"love\", but as it unfolds she learns other feelings as well, and soon enough we don't get the \"I want to know the meaning of \"I love you\"\" line.\\n\\n\r\nPacing has sometimes been a problem, for example episode 6, where I barely got to know about Leon. They could've done more but I guess you have to expect that when you've got less than 20 minutes to cover an adventures. But in most cases they provided us with the right flashbacks and details to get to know the customers well. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime did remove parts of the novel which were pretty bad: I'll start with witchcraft, a giant battle axe almost twice the size of Violet. I just couldn't believe that she could maneuver the axe so well, before she even got those robotic arms. Glad they got rid of that. They also made Violet very pacifistic compared to the novel, which helped to emphasize her growth even more, but this was at the cost of making her fighting scenes towards the end of the series ridiculous, since she chose to go head on without weapons at all, but still managed to take them down.\\n\\n\r\nOther reviews have pointed out the technological and cultural inaccuracies in VE, but personally it didn't affect me that much except maybe for those robotic arms which seem to be more advanced than one we have today... Rather, I was more annoyed by the battle scenes: a 14/15 year old girl fighting against trained soldiers, sometimes without weapons... I get that she is OP, but... the way her adventures unfold so conveniently at times was one of the main weaknesses of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some parts of the novel I would've liked them to include, for example Hodgins was supposed to visit Violet quite a few times when she was in the hospital and that helped to develop a parent-child relationship. They kind of tried to fit it in in between the adventures, but I don't think it was sufficient. The other thing is Violet's origins. They didn't go deep enough on that, and made people think that she became emotionless because of her time in the army. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThis is probably the best part and what made VE get such high expectations.  The face expressions were great, the landscapes were great... If I was to point out the best ones, I'd say the scenes of the starry night (Ep 6), street lamps and the city of Leiden as a whole. I also liked the way they included flowers a lot throughout the series (especially Ep 5, you could see one almost very 5 seconds). The reason I'm mentioning this is because flowers are an important theme here: if you look at the names of most of the characters, they're all related to flowers.\\n\\n\r\n\"People\u2019s names always have some sort of meaning.\" \u2014Akatsuki Kana (author of VE)\\n\\n\r\nIf I was to point out a negative... Sometimes, maybe this was just once, they put too much emphasis on scenes which didn't really deserve it. In Episode 4, when Violet was first introduced to the villagers, they suddenly went all out with the animation, including sudden gusts of wind and leaves dancing everywhere. It was amazing, but not really worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI liked the OP and ED, but that was about it. It didn't make me listen to it over and over again like Aimer's Ref:rain (best ED for me this season). The background music was alright, but they were often hit or miss: they would sometimes repeat it for too long and in other cases the music just didn't match the mood at all. But still enjoyable overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nFrom the blind obedience to kill to the development of a conscience which can heal, Violet's growth was truly remarkable, with the difference between her past and present crystal clear. Her blunt and fearless character had often been an obstacle against her success as a doll, but as the series progressed she managed to use them in the right circumstances. Her military salutes, her formal language, her expressionless face... They all changed. This is what the novel couldn't provide, those subtle details that show signs of growth.\\n\\n\r\nOnly disappointment is the development of the other characters, especially Hodgins, Cattleya and Benedict. The novel lacked this as well, but I guess it was expected since so much was invested into Violet and her customers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nGood, but not a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend you to read the novel? Give it a try unless you hated this. But there are going to be differences, both good and bad.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't be bothered reading the novel but still want to know what happens, you can PM me.",

Finding the right words for the dear ones isn\u2019t easy and Violet learns that through her encounters with different people who have a story to tell.\r\nThe story is made with words, words on a piece of paper that can save a dear brother from despair, can show the love and carrying of a mother for her child even after she is gone, can make the parents understandwhat their child wants to do with his future, can connect two distant hearts that yearn for each other, can bring news of happiness or sadness to someone dear and finally can make people come to a mutual understanding. \\n\\n\r\nThe letters that contain those words are the key to unlock the locket on people\u2019s heart and break the iron shackles that put a restrain on their emotions. Each letter needs to be delivered to its destination because each written word represent the genuine feelings of its senders for the dear ones.Violet having a past filled only with cold words slowly starts to experience new words during her journey as a Auto Memory Doll, warmth words filled with compassion, affection, and love. Those words melt the ice around Violet\u2019s heart and contribute to her growth as a human being. \\n\\n\r\nDuring her journey the world is filled with bitter words too not only happy ones but that doesn\u2019t discourage her despite bringing back sorrow memories, in fact she comes to accept those words as part of her and grows stronger. She does her best every time to understand the meaning behind those words and give the right words to the persons in need of them. A sweet girl that lost the dear person to her on the battlefield, she stands up, raises her head from the ground, takes the first step and moves on in life despite the pain that weights a lot on her shoulders. I love you Violet!\\n\\n\r\nThe pace is slow fitting for our characters and Violet\u2019s growth, because life isn\u2019t meant to be hurried, each happy moment needs to be savored and each hardship needs to be overcome, life is a battlefield were each of us has its own fight, it\u2019s all part of being alive.

Thematically rich, visually breathtaking with alluring ost Violet Evergarden is a gem that may be hated by many viewers or hold a special place in the hearts of its audience, can bring peace of mind and sooth your hearth, it\u2019s a show that needs to be savored for its special flavor called LIFE.\\n\\n\r\nAs any journey that comes to an end it\u2019s time to say farewell to our main heroine Violet who has reached her final destination but her fight with life will continue as long as she doesn\u2019t give up, so my review of this enchanting show has come to an end. I wanna thank all of those who allocated a little of their time to read the words that I put on paper to create something that I hope will make a little change and give this show a try.    \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Violet Evergarden doesn't talk much, but she has the power to restore people.\"\r\nThis quote perfectly sums up Violet Evergarden and what the show is trying to get across. After reading the synopsis of the show I was intrigued to see just how they are going to portray this type of character. In my opinion, they've done it almost perfectly. Knowing nothing but war, pain and suffering. Showing us how she finds meaning in these new emotions and how she experiences them for the first time.\r\nStory:\r\nStarting off with the story. We follow the journey of a girl named Violet Evergarden. Who has been in the armyas  \"the weapon\" from a very young age. Knowing nothing apart from how to follow orders. The story starts in a hospital where we discover she was greatly injured in the war costing her both arms. When she wakes up we find out the 4-year war has ended and this girl who missed pretty much all her childhood now needs to discover emotions for the first time and so her journey begins to discover the meaning of these emotions. Although you might think the story seems pretty simple it's actually the exact opposite. With flashbacks to show what happened to her in the war as well as meeting new characters and dealing with new emotions with every person. This actually turns into a pretty complex storyline. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first few episodes may suggest this is a generic anime with stunning visuals I can pretty much guarantee that it's not. The story might also seem very basic to people but the way its executed is honestly astounding. You can really sense what the author is trying to get across in every scene. The studio really outdid themselves when trying to make every scene perfect. Each scene has something to be learned from... not just Violet but even the viewers can take away these emotions. You can find yourself emotionally sucked into the story within the first few episodes. Even if you don't like how the story develops you still want to know how she turns out in the end. Which just proves how excellent the story writing is for the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI don't believe there is a word to describe the visuals in this show apart from mind-blowing. It's stuff you would expect from a movie budget. I'm definitely glad they focused on the art in the show. It's needed to flush out some of the emotions the character is trying to develop. One example is in one scene she looks out on the city during a sunset. Now that scene wouldn't have worked at all without amazing art. It just wouldn't show why the character appreciates it. Now it's not just the environment that has amazing art the characters also have amazing detail even just people in the background. The show does an excellent job of capturing facial expressions since is especially needed when trying to convey new emotions across. The fact this show has 14 episodes and keeps this type of art up is honestly astonishing to me. I would honestly recommend the show just for the art. Best I've seen for the budget of a show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis part is definitely the weakest of the show. Don't get me wrong it's still good but compared with the writing and art it just doesn't compare. The show does still deliver excellent soundtracks and the voice actors fit perfectly for the roles for both dub and sub versions of the show. They perfectly express the emotions the characters are feeling. However, I feel like the soundtracks are more just background music rather than dramatic music helping to convey emotions. Although it's still better than must it just isn't as good compared to other shows.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe story is focused solely on the development of one character and that being Violet Evergarden. At least that's what you would expect. However, that's not the case. Violet has this tendency to change the way characters think and feel showing us great character development throughout every episode. With new characters being introduced for a short time and some long-term character which we can see progressively change throughout the entire show. One of my favourite things about Violet Evergarden. Now I don't know if it was done on purpose or just how I perceived it but she was given the personality of a machine. Knowing nothing but how to follow instruction and orders similar to computers. Then we find out both her arms are mechanical which for me was a massive nod towards her being a machine emotionally. This was amazing character design if it was intended. Her full character is based on being this good soldier knowing only how to follow orders and getting things done according to what was specified. Which is shown a lot in the show like typing at a certain speed when doing a letter. Then we begin to see her develop new emotions and rekindle ones she didn't know she had like love which is a major development in 14 episodes especially when she started with pretty much nothing just a blank canvas if you will.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show definitely gives me amazing enjoyment looking forward to every episode each week knowing its going to be better than what I expected. Each episode brings old and new characters into the mix allowing for new storytelling and new emotions to be developed and sitting watching her develop these emotions is honestly so entertaining. I couldn't praise it more it keeps me coming back every week wanting to know what will she discover this week. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nNow there are a few things people may dislike about the show which will ruin there experience so here are the main problems people are having with it. The first major problem is the story feels dull and slow which can ruin some peoples experience so try to keep in mind this isn't a fast show. It likes to go slow and let the characters built up progressively rather than being rushed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major point would be the character development which goes hand in hand with the story. It feels slow and underwhelming. Making people dislike the show straight from the first few episodes. So if you aren't a fan of slow shows I would suggest staying clear of this show or a least give the first 3 episodes a try.\\n\\n\r\nNow my last negative point isn't too much about the show itself it's more for other people's comments on it. A lot of people were really hyped about this show and feel let down by its performance so far. I would suggest just giving the show a try regardless of what they say. Usually, if something is hyped up too much it just can't reach what people are expecting. So try to go into the show with an open mind and if you don't like it by the end of episodes 3 then its probably not for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis show is a much watch for any person looking to get emotionally invested in a show for a complex storyline. With amazing visuals and stunning character development. There are few negatives I can give this show apart from the pacing feeling off in some early episodes. However, this is soon fixed after a couple of episodes and we are left to completely get sucked into her world and what she will discover. If anybody is thinking about watching the show but not sure. Highly recommend watching until the end of episode 3. I think by that point you should have a clear direction for what type of story the show is trying to get across. This definitely has the potential to be the best anime this winter. That now concludes my review of the show. Feel free to add me if you want to comment on my review or discuss anything.Thanks for reading.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Scores:\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4/10 (Very Good)",

            "content": "\"When I die, I want KyoAni lower me down in my grave so they can let me down one last time.\" \r\nFrom the dome of quality differences comes Violet Evergarden. Show half episodic, half character-driven, half story-driven. Yet all these halves barely make one show. \r\nWe mainly see try-hard attempts on making the viewers cry with melodrama. Most of the time it feels like spoon-feeding. Open your mouth, the emotions are coming! Let's take a bite whilst this every-sad-piano-song-ever plays on the background. \r\nThe show does bring some interesting topics on the table, but instead of trying to do much with little, instead of developingthe characters and playing around with all the good things the series already had, it starts expanding itself with irrelevances, 3rd parties and events so unnatural it felt like Hachimitsu no Clover S02 all over again. The focus always being on emotions, yet 0 emotional depth is present. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters on the other hand are bland and make no sense whatsoever. Violet comes with different personality and reaction based to the current episodic plot. Emotionally dead, hysterically crying little girl, I AM A WAR MACHINE - CYBERNETIC ORGANISM - LIVING TISSUE OVER ENDOSKELETON. Just choose your favorite version. Mine was the one in episode 6 who liked stargazing. I wonder where that personality disappeared for the remaining episodes.\\n\\n\r\nGilber's brother makes even less sense. \"You will be my brother's dog.\" And 3 episodes later \"There is no emotional bond between my brother and you.\" Who wouldn't bond with their own dog? I don't get it. Does this guy hate dogs or what is he even saying. What a cunt. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Bialetto Evelugalden is a common drama series to this industry, and its saddest part is not the actual drama writing, but the waste of potentiality, the single thought about -not only how much better this series could have been- but how much better it should have been.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden is the best looking show of the new year. Yet, beneath its alluring veneer lies something \r\ngrotesque. \r\nArt & Animation: 10/10 (\"Outstanding\")\r\nThe art is stunning and consistent with its pseudo-European world. Hard work has gone into to animating even the most mundane moments, adding brief glimpses of humanity to otherwise lifeless characters.\r\nSound: 8/10 (\"Very Good\")\r\nThe Orchestral music is apt. Yet at times the music clashes with scenes, taking away from moments are best left quieter. Some of the best moments in cinema and animation have relied on sound effects over dialogue and music.\r\nStory: 3/10 (\"Poor\")\r\nSome changes must happen when adapting a lightnovel to anime. Yet, the changes made in adapting Violet Evergarden are lackluster and timid. The writers must have recoiled when faced with a story that begins in medias res. (Lit. \"Into the middle of things\") So instead they altered the flow of events. Even if it was disruptive and even if scenes no longer made sense. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFurther, the anime has taken a complete departure from the adaptation. In fact, it would be best to say there is no central narrative. The directors have instead chosen to adapt Violet Evergarden as an omnibus. (By their own admission.) As a result, Kyoto Animation has opted to abandon foreshadowing. These changes have weakened the story on the whole. It has become something that is disposable and lacks character. Kyoto Animation's use of brute force and crude manipulation is unsuitable for a story about post-war recovery.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10 (\"Pathetic\")\\n\r\nAs bad as the story is, the characters are worse. A weak story makes weak characters. The shuffling and omission of events make attachment to any character difficult. Violet's desire to learn what \"I love you\" means is too grandiose to empathize with. The scope is too far removed from reality to be the sole string which ties the omnibus together. So, each episode Violet manages to feel less and less human. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I find this show guilty. It is guilty of being bad despite the clear hard work and talent that went into it. In some ways Violet Evergarden is a bigger travesty than a bad anime which had no effort put into it. This show could have been great, but it isn't, and nothing after these first four episodes can repair it. This show is a solemn reminder not to judge a show based on the quality of its original content, animation studio, or appearance. \\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation is to read the light novel, or watch Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu instead.",

            "content": "I'll start by saying that after watching 9 episodes I was compelled to write my first review for an anime on this site. \r\nIt's true certain aspects of a show can appeal more favourably to people depending on what they value. In saying that, I will focus on what this show does so well for me and why I consider it one of the best I've seen.\r\nStory: \r\nThe introduction of Violet can understandably come across as odd due to the monotone way in which she addresses other characters. This may be off putting to viewers as I've noticed in some other reviews, but this setup is to a soon to be deeper story is just that: a set up. From what seems to be an ordinary show with a simple premise, rises one with humanity and heartfelt emotion. The character Violet is the canvas and each one of her encounters adds another layer of life to her story. I respect the writers for having the capacity to create these memorable moments through subtle recalling of other plot points that makes the show feel tied together. On top of that the dialogue has this poetic nature to it, whereby it doesn't attempt to add unnecessary complexity but simply lays bare the message it wishes to communicate.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere is so much I would like to say about the music of this show but I will keep it to a minimum. What music should do well in any show is add to the emotion the story is trying to communicate. VE does this exceedingly well, providing a different variety of sounds depending on the situation. There are those intimate moments where it's often accompanied by one or two instruments, and there are more intense moments accompanied by orchestra. Overall there's a large variety of well written melodious music, and it has to go down as one of the best anime soundtracks I have heard to date.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nYou only have to watch the first episode to understand the quality of the visuals, and I would have to put this anime in my number one spot for that department because it is truly beautiful. It's only after watching VE have I realised the full extent in which visuals and sound can make the watching experience better. The colours are vibrant and there is a consistency of detail in every scene which keeps your eyes fixated on the screen in awe. Detailed facial expressions make the heartfelt moments of the show much more impactful. There is also this tendency to cut to exquisite detailed sceneries whether it be the backdrop of a starry sky or a field of flowers. But it doesn't stop there because these moments are scattered across every scene, with the environment, objects and camera perspectives adding unbridled levels of detail. If I didn't like the story, I would still be looking forward to seeing VE because of how aesthetically pleasing it is for the viewer. I applaud the artists of this show for the work they have done, as you can see the amount of love and effort they have put into it. This show is an artistic masterpiece in it's own right and I have no problem making that claim to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI can't say too much without giving away plot points but the focus of the show is almost entirely on Violet, with additional characterisation given to those that appear from episode to episode. I have invested in this journey Violet is on, as I can see how her character grows each week as she experiences more of a beautiful world she has never seen. I believe that everyone who watches the show will relate to Violet in some way as we have all seen the world through the lens of beauty or wonder at some point, and we are all on a similar path of discovery. Episode 7 is a particularly memorable episode and is a contained story featuring just Violet and two other characters. Minimal characters and concise well-written stories allow this show to shine and provide something that many anime's take several episodes to build up towards. It is a bold attempt at providing viewers a sense of fulfilment in just over 20 minutes, and I can say that it has given me that almost every week. When I began VE I thought of it as something that was 'pretty' and had potential, but now I look forward every week to see where it will go next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe scores I am giving are based on what I have seen to date. If I was to review the first 3 or 4 episodes, certain scores would have been lower. Story for example, picks up significantly from about episode 6 and is now consistently outstanding in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Scores:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 \\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was surprised when I saw the top 3 reviews for this anime were all negative because quite frankly I have nothing negative to say about VE and I'm on episode 10. If I'm being honest I think most of the people trashing VE are doing so because they want to be contrary and \"cool\" for not liking a popular anime. You know, the same old pretentious anime fans we all love (if you can't sense the sarcasm, you've misunderstood).\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nViolet is about a young woman who was used as a war machine having to learn how to live a \"normal\" life after thewar ends. The series is episodic with the main overarching focus being on how Violet grows as a person. Maybe the only negative I can say about VE is that, yes, some episodes are predictable but I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode introduces a new character and their struggles, and ends with how those struggles get fixed or dealt with, typically with Violet helping to the best of her abilities despite struggling herself.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big crier but I'll admit episode 10 made me tear up. VE has a wonderful way of making you care about characters and a story in just one episode. Kyoani always has pretty decent anime, but they really show their talent in VE. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs per usual Kyoani delivers amazing visuals. Absolutely nothing worth complaining about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nUsually I don't pay much attention to music in anime honestly, but I will admit VE has a way of putting the perfect music to make sad scenes even sadder.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor one, I love Violet. The more the series go on and the more she grows, the more I want to protect her like she's my own child. The other characters could do with more development, but on the other hand since the series is episodic and has to spend time making you care each episode for a new story it's understandable our mains don't get much time themselves, but they all have wondrous potential. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is easily becoming one of my favorite anime of all time. That's all I have to say. Please don't listen to the negative reviews and watch VE for yourself. You will understand why I feel so passionately about this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain the only anime to ever get a 10 out of 10 from me and it's not even finished yet.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden feels like the anime equivalent of Oscar bait. It's big and sweeping, trying desperately to convince you that its sappy story really means something, but it's ultimately shallow and entirely surface level. Everything that really matters, the meat of the story - its characters, its themes, its ideas - are so basic that it actually brings down the visual presentation. You're wasting this incredibly detailed art on this story, of all things? Why?\r\nViolet Evergarden is a story about a girl who is some sort of superpowered golem woman (?) who somehow has just been given robotic arms (??) despite living in a settingwhere most people are illiterate and typewriters are still the new hotness (???). She was used as a soldier, but now she's a glorified traveling secretary, writing letters for others in the hopes that she can answer one nagging question: What is love? (Baby don't hurt me)\\n\\n\r\nThere are problems with this setup. The setting is a mess, and I have been struggling to try and get a grasp on it. I'm all for alternate reality settings based on Europe (Fullmetal Alchemist nails it) but the schizophrenic tech levels and people's relatively muted reactions to Violet's robotic arms makes it hard to get a sense of anything. There\u2019s other weird inconsistencies, like a scene where characters apologetically bow in a Japanese manner or when a character gets Chinese takeout, paper box and all. Violet herself is also confounding, as the show has yet to make her origin clear, and while that might sound like the setup for a mystery, it certainly doesn't feel like one when every character seems to take her existence for granted.\\n\\n\r\nViolet's character is also a major hindrance. If you've seen one \"robot wants to be human\" movie, then you've seen all she has to offer. She's dull and monotone and utterly uninteresting to watch because she\u2019s got nothing else to her. I can literally summarize her character in two words: \"Muh Major.\" The emotional core of her arc is her relationship with her now-dead Major, but it's hard to care when they seem to be dragging out Violet's discovery of his death and we only see him in quick flashbacks. His story seems a lot more interesting than anything going on in the present; it's a shame the whole show couldn't have just been set around him as he trained Violet.\\n\\n\r\nShe's a weak anchor for the show, and the rest of the characters around her are even worse. For a show that presents itself so ostentatiously, it's really jarring when all of her coworkers are immature, one-note anime cliches that could be from any generic shounen or slice of life show. There's no chemistry among the cast, either, so I have absolutely no interest in learning their \"deep and mysterious backstories\". Episode 4 was probably the best so far because it actually fleshed one of the cast members out, but her story was predictable and thin so it's not like it makes her all that much more interesting. If that\u2019s the level of quality I have to expect from the rest, I\u2019m not holding my breath.\\n\\n\r\nYou can have all the pretty visuals in the world, and some of these landscapes really are gorgeous, but if you don't have a good story or characters to carry it through, what's the point?\\n\\n\r\nAnd actually, I do want to take aim at the story's visuals - or, rather, the directing. I don't think enough people are ragging on this point, but this is not a well-directed anime. There are so many laughably overwrought sequences that it feels as if the show is desperately overcompensating. I was giggling during the opening of the first episode when Violet's letter flies out of her hand and then proceeds to fly around the city in GRAND, MAJESTIC shots until we've apparently gone from the country to the motherfucking ocean. It's like the opening shot of the feather in Forrest Gump, except whereas in Gump that feather is a visual metaphor for the course of his existence, in Violet Evergarden it's just a way too obvious attempt to impress the audience.\\n\\n\r\nAnother galling example is in episode 4. Violet gives another character a curtsy. This is not an important interaction, she's basically just saying hi, and there is nothing pivotal about the moment. Despite the mundanity of the gesture, however, we suddenly get a million cuts and the animation goes into maximum overdrive as a massive gust of wind causes her dress to flutter like the show is announcing, \"This is the most important thing ever!\" It's completely over the top. Look, being over the top can be great, but it's all about tone, and it totally does not gel with the feel of that particular scene and the general \"serious\" tone the show so desperately wants to convey.\\n\\n\r\nThe directing is a mess because it never seems to know when to stop or when to pull it back. It\u2019s as if the director is convinced that if you make it look epic enough, then you trick people into thinking it\u2019s actually deep and resonant. Instead, it has all the emotional resonance of a fucking Michael Bay product.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while I'm bitching, can I bitch about the soundtrack? The musical choices (big, blaring orchestras) sometimes come in at the most inappropriate times, or the music is mixed so poorly as to drown out the characters' dialogue. The ED is complete trash, and sounds as if the singer dared herself to perform the song entirely through her nose. From Kyoto Animation, who usually nail the soundtracks and sound designs of their shows, this is just baffling.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Violet Evergarden\u2019s biggest sin is that it\u2019s mostly boring. Everything this show has to offer has been done a million times better elsewhere. Even the \u201csakuga\u201d isn\u2019t all that enthralling because, in the end, it\u2019s in service to nothing. I can appreciate moving wallpaper as a screensaver, but I\u2019m not going to enjoy watching it for 24 minute chunks. I guess I\u2019ll keep watching to see if it ends up going anywhere, mostly because I don\u2019t want to think Kyoto Animation would fuck up this badly, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend this show to anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019ll be wrong. Maybe it\u2019ll get better. And maybe I\u2019ll win the lottery and they\u2019ll finally announce Nichijou Season 2 and Donald Trump will fulfill his campaign promise of making anime great again. Fingers crossed, everybody!",

Furthermore, the degree of sentimentality and pathos one feels when watching is able to override any logical fallacies or flaws a story may have. Because of their poignant effect, these \u201cfeels\u201d are often used and abused by anime to hide a plethora of writing problems underneath obvious emotional manipulation on the viewers. But whilst there are shows that come off mawkish and melodramatic,there are certainly those where sentiment is deserved. Violet Evergarden is the most recent anime that struck a chord with the community, practically built as a masterpiece before the first episode was even released and I could see why: an award-winning light novel getting an adaptation by Kyoto Animation \u2013 a studio adored for their gorgeous art style and animation \u2013 sounds like a perfect match to many. But does Violet Evergarden live up to its expectations? And, perhaps more importantly, is the emotional ride warranted?\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden follows a titular young girl whose purpose was to be nothing more than a weapon bred for war; a dog of the military, actions akin to a beast fighting for survival. She was never taught how to speak, write or communicate at all, only to kill. Treated as property by the military she was gifted to Gilbert, a major in the army who feels sorry for her, taking it upon himself to teach her valuable skills so that someday she may live the life of a normal girl. As time goes on their relationship grows stronger with her initial animalistic nature subdued and instead displays a more robotic-like behaviour in public. A romance between the two also brews, but their responsibility as soldiers of war takes priority and their affection for each other forced into stagnation. Unfortunately, war holds no mercy on the battlefield and results in Gilbert\u2019s death. His last words: \u201cI love you\u201d \u2013 words that she doesn\u2019t understand from the man who gave her the name of a wildflower in bloom, Violet.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned acts as backstory to the main plotline that is not revealed until later, whereas the series begins with the aftermath: Violet is found in hospital, bed-ridden with prosthetic arms. The war is over and her purpose fulfilled, now she must adopt a civilian lifestyle. She meets Claudia, a former army commander who had befriended Gilbert during the war and is now president of a postal company that provides mail and ghost-writer services. Initially hired as a postal worker, she witnesses how the ghost-writer department works and wishes to become an Auto Memory Doll \u2013 a ghost-writer for those unable to write in order to learn the meaning of words and the feelings of others. The beginning is honestly a poor first impression, coming off sappy, predictable and acts as a shoddy introduction to each of the characters. Violet especially comes off almost insufferable here; her backstory is barely referred to with most of the details left in the dark, effectively throwing viewers into her moment of crisis without any proper context. It\u2019s a perplexing choice on behalf of the staff, considering that Violet\u2019s personality here leaves her a bland, dreary main character to follow from the start, lacking enough reason to care about her struggles to begin with. This is made worse with how the story begins at such a slow pace, making it hard to judge whether the show is worth continuing. However, Violet Evergarden is not a show that should be judged from first impressions, as there certainly is merit to be found.\\n\\n\r\nOver the next few episodes Violet finds herself working and learning from other Auto Memory Dolls from their interactions with clients. The contrast between Violet and her fellow workers easily shows how far Violet truly is from her goal: currently emotionless and blank in her interactions, yet her desire and drive to understand the clients shines across the screen. This is further touched upon as Violet attends a training school and is unable to convey one\u2019s feelings onto a letter. On her own, she is still unable to properly recognise emotions, but through those around her she slowly begins to grasp what they feel and how they express such. Here Violet\u2019s bland personality acts like a blank canvas where those around her can leave their mark on her, allowing for parallels between side characters and herself to cause short instances of growth in Violet and a resolution on the side-character\u2019s behalf. However, the show is never able to capitalize on these instances well. Rather than take adequate time and focus to let these small but important moments have appropriate build-up and climax to truly have a resonant effect, the show just treats them as merely parts of the plot that could very well be considered isolated from each other, devaluing each achievement Violet makes in her development as the show goes on. I personally found it appalling with how Violet finally learns to effectively convey feelings in an extremely short and concise letter, then not even a few episodes later she is extremely proficient in her writing. If only writing IRL was that easy \u2639\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s at this point where the pacing takes a sudden shift and the shows changes to an episodic format, focusing on Violet\u2019s travels away from her workplace for different clients, each with their own set of issues to overcome, but all revolve around the idea of awakening their true feelings. As an Auto Memory Doll her job is to help her clients express what they feel, but here Violet sees the inner conflict present and aims for them to address and come to terms with it, with her acting as a catalyst when necessary. Whilst doing so, Violet continues to gain more appreciation for different forms of communication and gradually shows more signs of human behaviour. Her facial expressions able to tell more and more with each passing episode. It also gives a greater sense of the importance of society learning to feel again, accepting the tender aspects of individuals and its value. Relearning traits such as kindness, compassion and knowing how to best care about each other, so that when her time comes, Violet will be able to do the same for the own problems. Knowing this, these episodes should be lovely short stories to sit through, but that\u2019s not the case. The way emotions are expressed here sound all well on paper, but in practice come off sterile \u2013 a \u201cclinical\u201d sense with how an entire spectrum of emotions are presented. There\u2019s certainly logical reasoning behind why each feeling is portrayed, but as a viewer, these sensations are only being observed, never experienced. A sense of detachment always lingering beyond the screen, breaking any chance to bond with what is happening in the narrative. The series never tries to be melodramatic in its attempts of sentiment and I can respect that; through sheer visual flare it seeks to emulate like none before it, only to end up feeling artificial for the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to get passionate about a series like this with such a lack of connection, but following Violet\u2019s journey to self-discovery holds enough value that\u2019s worth mentioning. Understanding her background and circumstances is crucial in understanding what Violet Evergarden is trying to achieve. She is initially a tool for battle, completely devoid of human emotion and understanding, simply bred to kill. It is only when she is away from the battlefield where she is aware of her apathetic nature and slowly starts to change. Her development can come off sappy, but it\u2019s justified here in my eyes; slowly grasping how to sympathize and feel for others regardless of her actions in the past. It\u2019s a war with herself, can her bloodstained hands really be used to help others? Is she worthy to? Constantly told she is on fire, it\u2019s when she finally learns about her former lover\u2019s death does the burning sensation set in and eat away at her soul. She gives in to despair and unsuccessfully tries to end her own life. Just when hope looks bleak, she finds a letter sent specifically to her. It\u2019s her colleagues; they miss her. Violet decides to help deliver letters at night, and witnesses the people that anxiously wait for these letters. Cheerful, elated to receive words from those they care about, their emotions key to her understanding her newfound purpose as a ghost-writer. Her hands that destroyed so much \u2013 can now bring people together. While the supporting characters will come and go at the drop of a dime, it is Violet who blossoms through the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe production of Violet Evergarden is constantly praised for the exquisite animation and beautiful art design, both of which are well deserved. Kyoto Animation once again prove why they are one of the best in the industry and raise the standard for TV animation to new heights. Everything looks beautiful\u2026 almost too beautiful. The fluid animation, impressive character designs and attention to detail are all obviously here, but I would not consider it all to be a positive. Violet Evergarden draws a fine line between breathtaking beauty and over-stylization; scenes are \u201ctoo overloaded\u201d with their artwork and digital effects, with the first few episodes smothered in excessive brightness, chromatic aberration and filters than hinder the great animation on display. When a pen is dropped, it doesn\u2019t just fall, it descends in dramatic fashion! It\u2019s overwhelming. Part of the problem falls to the directing which is just blatantly amateurish at times, as if the man in charge is unable to grasp feelings himself. There\u2019s a natural beauty to be found in subtlety when it comes to emotionally-driven shows that Violet Evergarden lacks. The need to present itself in such grandiose fashion manages to expose itself to how amateur the artistic choices taken are; techniques such as depth of field and time-lapse photography are used with the sole purpose being imitation to previous works that did them better. Don't get me wrong, Violet Evergarden still looks visually pleasing, but rather than a home-grown garden gleaming with a myriad of colourful flora, the flowers are plastic, and knowing such loses its lustre.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with having finished Violet Evergarden, my thoughts are as followed: I rarely laughed, I never cried and this certainly will not change my life, but there is value here worthy of one\u2019s admiration. While it lacks on an emotional level to me, the intent is pure and still holds a sense of beauty that deserves to be seen. It\u2019s a nice show one can easily sit through to pass time, but unfortunately I can\u2019t say much more. It\u2019s just a shame that for a story aimed at learning empathy, this message never reaches past the screen. For it desperately wishes to be as perfect an emotional experience can be, it\u2019s the stories holding imperfections that have the most powerful impact.",

Although many side characters seem quite flat, they really help boost the story in one of the best climaxes of a coming-of-age emotional anime I have ever seen(if you are wondering, it's episode 9). Major Gilbert and Claudia really develop as characters, gaining dimension in episodes 6-9, and it is just a joy to see Violet grow and learn how to express emotions.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni. Do I have to say anymore?\\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, have you seen the graphics? They are STUNNING, and boost the show in so many ways.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very wonderful, and the orchestral music is very moving. I just think that some of the music is lackluster compared to others. AMAZING ending song, though. Michishirube is so beautiful and emotional, and fits the show so well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nI can see where some may be turned off. Violet is flat and uninteresting in the first few episodes, but if you can take this as Violet just being inexperienced with emotions, all the flat main and side characters really develop. But I can understand why some may give bad ratings for this show having only watched 3-4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just such a joy, and I look forward to each Thursday when I can watch the next episode. Violet's maturing is so heartwarming, and the side characters slowly becoming accustomed to Violet gives this show so much charm. I really recommend this anime for its enjoyable nature, if not for anything else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you can accept that Violet is just mot emotionally mature at first, this show becomes a feels trip and a beautiful, heart-melting anime that is worth every episode. Looking back on the first episodes, having watched later ones (especially episode 9), there is a feeling of satisfaction and happiness just seeing how cold and unemotional she was before, and seeing how well she grew. I absolutely recommend this anime to anyone looking for great music, visuals, and a charming story that will surely make you cry.",

Despite that, I am drawn in by everything that goes on in every episode. I believe everyone who has written a review claiming thatthe story and characters are shallow fails to see what this anime is about and why it exists. Violet Evergarden is not a show that will keep you on your toes or enthrall you in a typical sense as there are several subtle themes throughout.  This is an anime for those who wish to observe and feel something. Despite what I said earlier about feelings, this show is made by how the characters portray different feelings. I truly feel sorry for those who cannot see that. Rarely do I believe that writing a review for an anime is worth the effort, but I felt as thought for this anime, Violet Evergarden, it is necessary.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden is an anime series adaptation of the novel light with the same title from Kyoto Animation.\r\nSource material of this series is the winner of the Kyoto Animation Award 2014 in the novel category. Given that status, this series became the most awaited anime by the community for the winter of 2018. Compared to other series of the season, this series can be said to have the best animation, something that is expected of the anime from Kyoto Animation. With the premise offered is the post-war recovery of the main character, this series becomes one of the drama series that is able to fillus all with feelings\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : 8/10\\n\r\nI never read the source material of this series so I judged the storyline of what was shown in the anime. The premise offered is actually interesting. Self-rehabilitation of Violet who was created only as a weapon of war without having the slightest feeling and desire. But since the Major gave the last sentence, she began to look for what the meaning behind that sentence by becoming an Auto Memory Doll. Walking to one place to another meets the client's request. The journey unknowingly begins to make herself understand the feelings of a human being. The problem of each client who wants to pour into a letter is that slowly build the character Violet for the better. Until finally he understood the loss of someone and began to understand what it means to love. From a soldier who moves only if given the command to a human being who can shed tears. An interesting premise for a drama series derived from the light that lately is mostly filled by isekai genre\\n\\n\r\nDIRECTION : 6/10\\n\r\nThis series begins its story from  Violet's condition after the war and what she will do to find the meaning of the last sentence of Major. Then entering Episode 2-7 the direction of this series turns into episodic. Violet goes somewhere to answer client's request. Each episode is actually presented with the client's first point of view instead of Violet as main character. Every client has their own problems and from this problem Violet's character grows more human. With the direction of this story. Not everyone will understand how Violet character develops every episode. In fact, we will focus more on the client's problem. For example when most of us cry at the end of episode 10, but maybe many of us are not aware of the Violet character changes at that time. Episode 8-9 direction changes back to focus on the major plot. The transition from episodic episode clients to major episodes that has linear progress is poorly executed. I'm sure not everyone can understand how the story of this series if not paying attention to every sentence and scene with care. That was disturbing me in enjoying this series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : 9/10\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a character with the greatest development among all the characters that exist in this season. Starting from a soldier who even just to eat should be given orders by Hodgins to be a human being who is even determined not to lose the life of someone as she once did. The thing that I love about Violet's character is that she develops not because she is being advised by others, but she learns by listening to the client's problem. she began to understand a feeling precisely after knowing what problems hers client was experiencing. So after knowing facts that \"facts\". She understands the meaning of losing someone. The scene in episode 11 when Violet performs the \"last request\" of the soldier also shows how she began to understand the meaning of affection. Perhaps what she's been doing lately is naive. But it shows that Violet has changed from a heartless weapon into a human who understands the sense of losing someone.\\n\\n\r\nART : 10/10\\n\r\nThis series is a series with the best animated quality in winter of 2018. My favorite scene of course when Violet tried to pass the lake using an umbrella. The scene really shows the high quality animation presented by Kyoto Animation. The character design and color selection in this series reminds me of the Koe no Katachi film which is also made by KyoAni. Even for a television series, Violet Evergarden has the same quality as Koe no Katachi. Each frame is well drawn so the animation runs smoothly. Details on the character design also shows the hard work of key animators in making this series. Every female character feels so beautiful and every male character feels so manly through the way key animator draws each character. The selection of colors taken fits perfectly with the theme of this series which is thought to be similar to the period after the second world war in time and technology. Plus the quality of backgrounds such as clouds and water are so beautiful to the eye. Overall, this is one of the best quality anime other than Kimi no Na Wa and Koe no Katachi\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : 8/10\\n\r\nMaybe what makes us sad and cry when watching this series is not because of Violet's personal problems, but the client's problem. But still this series still able to make us shed tears. The existence of the soundtrack in every sad moment in this anime really strengthens the atmosphere. Without proper selection and soundtrack composition, sad moments are not necessarily can make us shed tears. It also should be appreciated is the sound effect. Especially when the scene is related to the war. The sound of weapons, bombs, airplanes or even the sound of a soldier dropped from a shot. My favorite part in terms of sound effects is when an army is shot. Everything feels so fast that we do not realize that someone has been shot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series provides  best animated quality and also provides an interesting story premise. But direction in this series can make us confused in following Violet's journey to find his true self. So not everyone will judge the story in this anime executed properly or not. But for a drama series. This is an anime with good character development. Violet is the character with most massive development among all the characters in the winter of 2018.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden was one of the most anticipated anime of the winter season, with its stunning promotional material showcasing beautifully animated scenes and character designs. It could be said that in that regard it was amazing and lived up to expectations. However, when it comes to the characters and overall narrative, sadly it isn't nearly as good as it could have been. The main problem can be associated with a lackluster cast of characters in combination with a seemingly aimless narrative.\r\nThe anime is based around Violet, a young girl that knows nothing else than war: when the Great War ended, she was left with noother option than to adapt a civilian life. By joining the Auto Memory Doll postal service, she will embark on a journey of self-discovery. Quite an interesting premise so far right? The different travel destinations the protagonist undertakes, offer each a diverse story of the client and their needs, while simultaneously developing Violet. These serve to shape the setting, as well gaining an understanding of the sociopolitical climate the story takes place in, helping viewers immerse themselves. Sadly, for a Victorian setting, Japanese customs are too prominent, making it a bit harder to engage with the narrative. In addition, the various stories on different episodes are quite predictable and clich\u00e9 - some good, others not as much. Lastly, the narration lacks in continuity, and therefore coherence,  as each episode jumps from one story to the other. As standalone episodes, they work, but as a package, it needs more context.  One such example is where a character of apparent importance is introduced to the viewer, making them wonder what will happen next, just to fully ignore said character for the following episodes. This leaves a bad taste in the mouth, especially considering that the episodes, in general, feel slightly random. These aren't necessary issues, as characters play the most important part in Slice of Life/Drama anime, yet somehow they were lackluster as well. Allow me to elaborate.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the main character is bland and boring, robot-like; which is not counterproductive in such cases (when done correctly), since that is the whole point of the anime. However, character development of Violet was done poorly, where the actions she performed felt forced, often falling back on her main motivation to do this ordeal in the first place, which may appear as a cheap copout. Another slight problem is that she seemingly gains emotions, then to suddenly just lose them for the convenience of the plot. It could be argued that it is natural for an emotionless human being, although personally, I'd disagree, especially when taking into account how little it does to the plot. In addition, little effort is made to make her a likable character, whether it be through interactions with her surroundings or just some simple characteristics of her that could be expanded on.\\n\\n\r\nProtagonists aren't necessarily the foundation of a character-driven story: secondary/supporting characters can fulfill that role too. Disappointingly, it even fails in this regard. The whole cast is generic as it can get, with not a single interesting personality to root for - they simply lack identity. Character interactions with the supporting cast are scarce, and when done, lack meaning. The anime tries to flesh these out with the limited screen time they get, but quite frankly, it leaves much to be desired. Admittedly, there are a few background stories that could be relatable to the audience, whether it be the reason why people work for the sake of working, or how people regret things only after they lose it. As a whole, the character dynamic problem lies in Violet hardly having any meaningful relationship with any of the cast, making hard to invest oneself. Such dynamics are not a necessity since, for example, Mushishi manages to do this perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Violet Evergarden is stunning as mentioned earlier: after all, it is done by KyoAni, a studio renown for its gorgeously animated scenery and character designs. The studio makes good use of close-ups (whether it be objects or actions of the characters) to emphasize the meaning of the scene together with the different emotions it wants to evoke. The used color palette works great for the format, although it must be mentioned that the occasional grey filter that is applied feels unnecessary. The opening and ending are beautifully drawn and shown, albeit offering little addition to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a good job on their respective roles, including the monotone voice for Violet that embodies her character - anger, despair, sadness, and exhaustion were conveyed in a graceful manner, although in some in instances it felt forced. As for the soundtrack used, it is befitting of the anime with the use classical instruments, such as the violin, piano, etc. These are reminiscent of Ghibli-like works, which I personally am a fan of. It does a fantastic job to immerse the viewer into the story of this Victorian like era.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden as a whole was a beautifully animated work but lacked considerably in the most important parts, characters and story, causing a significant clash in immersion: the characters made it hard to feel engaged in it, while the animation and sound work invited to do so. For a slice of life anime, it fulfills its purpose, yet for a supposed story of self-discovery, it is arguably dull. This doesn't necessarily mean its bad/unwatchable; it simply could have been more than it ultimately was, since, despite all the issues mentioned in the review, I found myself enjoying the whole journey. All in all, Violet Evergarden had potential, but its shortcomings made it your average seasonal anime that comes and goes, just to be forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n",

Your brother is truly relieved to finally be able to breathe freely again; my fellow citizens, too, let out a collective sigh of relief. The alleys are filled with a comfortable bustle like they used to be; people\u2019s faces don\u2019t display a worrisome gloom anymore. Businesses are booming throughout the whole town and your brother, too, has found a place of employment in a mail and ghostwriting company. There, it is my job to deliver the letters ghostwritten by our so-called Auto Memory Dolls\u2014women who listen to one\u2019sinquiries and needs for a written letter and put one\u2019s feelings to paper.\\n\\n\r\nDuring my time working here, I have come into contact with many of the aforementioned dolls; and one of these women in particular piqued my interest: with her elegant, golden hair and doll-like demeanor, she fits the job perfectly, and she used to act the part just as well. However, what interested me about her the most wasn\u2019t her looks but rather the fact that she had many stories to tell, be it from house calls or other, similar events.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the stories themselves weren\u2019t all too intriguing. It may be because I\u2019ve lived through several years of war, but many of them felt like something I had heard before, had seen before. While the fates of these people are definitely cruel and while I really wish they had met a better fate, I can\u2019t help but think of the many who have fallen in war. Thus, the stories of these people whom I\u2019ve never met don\u2019t leave as much of an impression on me as they might have used to; while hearing this beautiful woman describe equally beautiful sights and sceneries brings with it a certain feeling of tranquility, they aren\u2019t what makes these stories interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does make these stories interesting aren\u2019t the stories themselves, but how they affect the one experiencing and\u2014later\u2014telling them. She used to be a child soldier unable of speaking, reading or human emotion. Trained as nothing more than a weapon of war, her doll-like demeanor stems not from indifference, but her time as a soldier. Due to her unusual character, she ran into trouble trying to extract the emotions out of the client\u2019s words, but over time she learned how to understand these feelings and, most importantly, how to feel, herself. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes, upon reciting what had happened just a few days prior, her feelings slowly welled up inside, to then finally overflow. Suddenly, she learned how to smile, laugh and cry; she learned of emotion and empathy.  These unadulterated feelings coming from someone formerly unable to feel moved me to my very core every time; it was during these everyday epiphanies of hers that I felt like I was really watching something grow, giving shape to a human rather than a husk.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, newfound feelings are both a blessing and a curse. They may make life more interesting and worth living, but at the same time they can accumulate and overwhelm a person\u2014even more so someone hitherto engaged in the cruelty of war as she was. After realizing what she had done, she slowly gave in to sadness and sorrow. Her cold, metallic hands that killed so many, her blood-stained self burdened with guilt\u2014they started a fire, engulfing her. Her state of mind turned into a complete chaos; she decided to strangle herself with her abhorrent hands and end it all, but she failed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat saved her was a mere letter, this one sole letter I slipped through under her door. Filled with the feelings of her colleagues who missed her dearly, this letter saved her from her sorrow and herself. It let her reflect on what she had done: both her misdeeds in war and her profession, which brought together and still connects so many. Her actions might be irrevocable\u2014but that isn\u2019t a bad thing. Her burn marks may never heal, but really, they don\u2019t need to. After realizing this simple truth, she learned to accept herself and finally became a complete person.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at her now, I can\u2019t help but feel a somber sadness. Her metallic hands that killed so many and her brooch which reminds of the loved one she lost in war\u2014they make me feel melancholy. Just like the eponymous flower, Violet Evergarden is beautiful. While the stories she tells might not be as impactful as intended, her own very much makes up for it. Once you come visit me, I shall relay it to you whole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYours, Roland.\\n\\n\r\n(Score: 65)\\n",

Now after a solid year of waiting, I was giddy as a 5 year old to see a story that was full of nail-biting moments and action. But no, what I got was a simple story of a young woman trying to understand the society she was denied by the war as a child and a quest to find love.\r\nIt may sound like a cheezy overused plot point, even more so in a high budget anime likethis, but it's not. This is a character-driven anime. At first glance, Violet may seem like a boring MC, emotionless, robotic and stale, but in my opinion, watching her develop slowly into a more understanding person is so interesting. In this case, the blandness contributes so well to the other characters all in a way where they are helping her find the truth she deserves, about love. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style and soundtrack of this anime are just beyond words, KyoAni's best work by far imo. Character-wise, they do not really have amazing traits that stand out, all in the fact that it contributes to the show's simplicity. But the main personality is Violet's. she has to put this show on her back as it progresses, watching her grow while she handles tough situations is gonna be one hell of a ride.\\n\\n\r\nI can't think of a reason why you shouldn't watch this show, even if you are not a fan of simplistic shows, just stay for the visuals, you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "\u201cLetters are among the most significant memorial a person can leave behind them.\u201d  \u2015Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\r\n\u201cA letter always seemed to me like immortality because it is the mind alone without corporeal friend.\u201d \u2015 Emily Dickinson\r\nYou must be thinking, what the hell is wrong with this guy? Whats with all the \"letter\" quotes?\r\nThat's right!!! This anime actually gives you a perfect definition of letters, you must have heard of people in other reviews mentioning War, love story, Auto memoirs doll etc., Or at least got the feeling it would be one judging from 1st 2 episodes, but I would warn you guysthis isn\u2019t what you think it is, in fact, there isn\u2019t a straight story at all.\\n\\n\r\nThis is rather a story or rather a slice of life(SOL) of a girl (named Violet Evergarden) who is a weapon in war, trying to adjust in society post-war by writing the letters for people and understanding the feelings of the sender and receiver.\\n\r\nSo why does she want to write the letters? That\u2019s because she wants to know the meaning of \u201cI love you\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026.You must be thinking\u2026.wtf???? Yeah, that\u2019s true, this must have been the dumbest reason for anyone to learn writing letters (even the lieutenant Hodgins says that in the series), but you will understand that in the long run it kinda makes sense :P\\n\\n\r\nSo then there is no story and lots of negative reasons stated above (most importantly who would want to know about \u201cletters\u201d?), then\u2026\u2026 why is there a damn 8 in the rating????\\n\\n\r\nWell, even though there are lots of negative factors, at the end of the day it is able to deliver what we need in an anime, i.e the enjoyment, the emotional connection with the scene and mainly the importance of letters, i.e from a \u2018small sentence\u2019 to uniting couples with \u2018long letters\u2019, the letter has the power to move people's heart, that's the power of letters, which is really depicted well here.\\n\\n\r\nAlright cutting everything short, It is a collection of short stories with Violet in each episode is interacting with different people and changing their lives and also herself knowing what it is to be a human, what it feels like to lose a human and even you might get motivated from Violet as she tries hard learning to understand what human feelings are.\\n\\n\r\nThe main beauty of this anime is the ART, the animation, and camera view. All characters are so beautiful that everyone looks like a doll. You wouldn't even know for half of the series whether Violet is actually a doll or a human.\\n\r\nThe setting is historic, most probably during world war I  (The robotic arms of Violet seem too much advanced for that time or even present). The background, the colors, the time lapse, the sky, the flowers, the stars and even wine, every detail is so beautiful and so colorful that it gives you realistic appeal and makes you feel as if you were at that place.\\n\\n\r\nThe SOUNDTRACKS are another awesome tool for making this anime nostalgic. The classic orchestral music and emotional soundtracks are really awesome which resonate perfectly and sync with the situation bringing out the emotions out of you.\\n\r\nThe opening song is also used differently and is introduced in 3rd episode (seems this style is called progressive)  is a great song and matches perfectly with the situation. While the ending is also good which is introduced in the 2nd episode.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nWell coming to the final opinion, which matters the most!!! This show definitely has lot of flaws from dodging bullets like Flash(Superhero), executing a person with sword while having a gun at hand, to writing public love letters and many dramatic scenes which I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil you, which are made to make you emotional but when you think later logically, it might seem kinda dumb but still at the time of watching it makes you forget the flaws and makes you immerse in those lies, that's the beauty of this anime, making you connect with characters without much development just like Mushishi or kino no tabi. Therefore stating all various reasons,even though the anime Violet Evergarden is not suited for the likes of many, but still, it is definitely worth watching, at least once :P\\n\\n\r\nFor some, it would be \"that most hyped series\" or for others it might be \"that hyped series which lived to its reputation\", well, either way, it is going to be remembered lol.\\n\\n\r\nAnd my advice for you is, at least watch 5 episodes before you drop ( If you feel like dropping) and Don\u2019t binge watch it, because either your heart will melt or it might harden into a stone basing on your response.\\n\\n\r\nI have put out all the negative things about anime for you so that you might not be surprised and drop it out in middle. Did it give negative thoughts to fans?? I don't think so, because they will like it even if there are many flaws besides this.\\n\\n\r\nwell, that's the end of the review, you could stop here or read below for FAQs and more detailed Analyses of the series and character development, of course, it is spoiler-free. :D\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nDub or sub? : Personally, I feel that sub is a lot better because, at the actual point of creating an emotional moment, in the dub, the words are uttered as if they were read from Google translate. While the sub has better words which suit the dialogue. But in rest of the situations, the dub is also good.\\n\\n\r\nAnalysis of Story:\\n\r\nOne thing is good in this anime, It keeps you guessing what this anime might be turn out to be ? just when you are thinking of being fed-up or you made up your mind what this anime is gonna be? , that's when the story changes because, at present, you might observe that the genre of this anime is listed as SOL but it wasn\u2019t the case when this series was airing, everyone used to talk how the series might turn out to be(Forums). In detail, first 2 episodes are like a slight introduction to the current state Violet is, with focus given more to the surrounding places, the anime setting, the camera views etc, for example, The starting scene is just like the scene from Assassin's creed where the eagle flies and the camera shifts with respect to it while here a paper or perhaps the letter flies in its place.\\n\\n\r\nThen slowly from episode 3, the slice of life starts and by the end of episode 7 just when you are thinking this series is full of it, writing letters blah blah, the flashback or Violet\u2019s past kicks into play, and you get to see it for about for 2 episodes making you think, well we might get to watch a war anime perhaps, but it stops there and again the SOL begins, So by the time you reach episode 11 it makes sense that this anime is all about letters and its significance but its not really about violet's past, well that\u2019s where you are wrong again, just watch the series and know what it is :)\\n\\n\r\nDifference between Light novel and anime?\\n\r\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t read the novel but from the opinion of others, few other characters were introduced, Violet is more humane and less aggressive here and most of the unrealistic parts were removed like Violet with a battle axe. But the only fault is the 12th episode which gave a negative response from Novel fans by mentioning novel version was better and had more realistic feeling for that part. \\n\\n\r\nDifference of experience between new and old watchers of this series:\\n\r\nFor anyone new to Violet Evergarden, as I mentioned earlier you can observe that the genre is SOL, drama. you can have that premeditated feeling of watching a SOL. There is both negative and positive effect of it, the positive part is that you know that you are going to watch a SOL so you are mentally prepared not expecting much of a story but the negative part is that you wouldn\u2019t have that suspense what this series may turn out to be? \\n\\n\r\nComing to Characters:\\n\r\nWe all know that Slice of life means character development or vice versa but this isn\u2019t the case here, as violet meets new people in every episode, so there isn\u2019t much possibility for character development. That being said, I'll talk about few prominent characters which need to be noticed:\\n\\n\r\nViolet: People might either hate her due to her PTSD traits, inexpressive nature, and a bad example of Saber ( Fate series) 'OR' love her as innocent, fragile and she strives to be a better person and also fans of Saber might like her. This show is basically about Violet so you need to watch the show and understand about her, leaving here coming to another major character, \\n\\n\r\nMajor Gilbert: There are huge amount of novel fans who might love him, but his character is just developed for about 2 episodes in anime and you can observe his and Violet\u2019s relationship to be similar to like that of father and daughter, He is the main cause of Violet\u2019s change of behaviour or character due to the fatherly love is shown by him. Many people(novel readers) say that he loved her like a partner but I didn\u2019t feel the same. His role is very less, then there is his friend:\\n\\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Hodgins: I felt him to another good guy, he is more developed then Gilbert lol, he also plays a major role in supporting Violet, by getting her a job, taking care of her and even give the right amount of comfort to her as per Gilbert\u2019s request but he doesn\u2019t feel burdened.\\n\\n\r\nThe only controversial person who seemed out of character every-time in new episode is Gilbert\u2019s brother Dietfried. In one episode he seems harsh on Violet (Ep 5), in other episode he thinks her to have changed (Ep 8) and again in 12th episode it is shown that he still doesn\u2019t believe in Violet still but takes her advice or saves her and many more weird multiple unstable traits are exhibited by him,\\n\r\nother than that rest all characters are developed for an episode or two and left, For example, characters like Benedict ( postman), Luculia, Iris, Erica (Dolls)etc are used just for the sake of story\u2019s progress in latter small and significant parts which might make many people angry for not developing them or using them properly, since we are mainly focused on Violet\u2019s point of view I think its better to ignore the rest.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you like this kind of writing style in which I seem like interacting with you and I hope this review motivated you to watch it \u270c\\n\\n\r\nI hope I didn't bore you with all the praises, I did want to criticize and write a review like a critic, but every time I re-watched the series, I kept falling in love with it and most probably you are gonna too :)",

The story is outstanding I mean the concept of meaning of love and what difference feelings make. Characters are amazing each and every one of them. Theme of the anime is 90's type which is less now a days. Animation is outstanding. sound track is amazingly soothing, and the music just makes the atmosphere so real. The last anime I watchedlike this was your lie in April. the rating is underrated I think",

            "content": "There it is, a body on display, delicate fabric hugging its frame as if a part of its existence from the very beginning. Porcelain skin adorned with silk, the material complements the complexion. The figure stands there without concern for the wondering gaze of any passersby, a translucent wall erected between it and the endless faces. Society is kept at bay. The soft glow of light dancing on the surface of the sheet of glass serving as its imprisonment. It shimmers ever so slightly, creating prisms of color in the endless shuffle. The rays of light trails over the delicate frame of the figure. Beautyblossoming from a thing of tertiary value.  \\n\\n\r\nBut this is not Violet Evergarden I'm describing. \\n\\n\r\nLook beyond the object, beyond the fabric; zoom pass the crystalline glass wall, and suddenly, the true image of my purple prose takes shape. There it is, coming into focus, a JC Penny's mannequin positioned at the window front of a shopping mall district. The dancing lights, nothing but the cheap glow of neon signs from neighboring competitors adjacent to it. The wondering gazes, nothing but customers with money to spend.  \\n\\n\r\nIf embellishments for something so minuscule is all you need to be entranced by the item being described, then Violet Evergarden will not bother you. However, if you desire content equally as deserving of the words being used to describe it, then it might benefit you to move on to greener pastures, because like this opening paragraph, so too is the material on display hyper-stylized rendering of a truly insignificant thing. The main difference being the tool; flowery words traded in for audiovisual frontloading. Layered color gradients supplemented in place of proper diction. Lots of icing, very little cake. \\n\\n\r\nBut it's not all a lost cause. VE's story is one of relation. Or rather, everything surrounding it facilitates sentiments easy to relate too. One that practically writes itself. A person used as an instrument of war attempting to find ways to rekindle their lost humanity. An appointed position that gives opportunities to do just that. A girl disciplined in strict military decorum. A puppet with its strings cut loose, unsure as to what to do with her newfound freedom. She's a lost child, forgotten by society, forced to start from scratch. A holdover from a wartorn nation whose usefulness is brought to a crossroads. The story ends with the closing of one chapter, as we begin the journey of another. The journey is that of recovery. A journey aided by the guiding hands of someone not there in the flesh. Efforts made from beyond the grave for her betterment. One that will serve as her driving force towards improvement as well as the source of her grief as she draws closer to the answers she seeks.\\n\\n\r\nThrough her, we're introduced to this world. One made up like a quilt of different time periods and cultural influences, all stitched together to create something new. Victorian era structures serve as the city skyline while the undeniable look of early 20th-century technology takes the form of motor vehicles, as well as a wide assortment of widgets and trinkets littered throughout the environment. Our person of interest, Violet, equally as blended. Her appearance is that of an unassertive young woman, while her mechanical limbs tell a different story. One of violence and darkness. This temperament reflected in her personality. She only sees things in utilitarian ways; typewriters are weapons, school is a mission, her job becomes headquarters, saluting whenever given orders, requesting permission for all her actions. Social graces are completely lost on her. Her upbringing robbing her of the privilege to decide. There was only ever one path for her to take. Until recently, her actions were that of a blade, sheathed, just waiting for the time that its usefulness was required once again. An instrument of death whenever its wielder sees fit.\\n\\n\r\nHer new job changes that. She must write for others as an \"Auto Memory Doll,\" a profession where she's tasked to transcribe the feelings and thoughts of others, giving a voice for those that have trouble doing so on their own accord. A job where recorded sentiments are captured in a letter. A chance for an emotionally stunted girl to learn what feelings are. A \"doll\" wanting to become a doll, when in fact, the act of becoming one is what brings her closest to humanity.  \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the show writes itself. \\n\\n\r\nA self-oscillating arbiter of \"good content\" for anyone wanting to express why it's \"good content.\" The mere act of explaining its basic premise does the legwork for them. Except for the fact that when the content is lifted from the pages of its screenplay and brought to life by the magic of animation, it's equally as flaccid as the diegetic information would have you believe when following a character of such stunted social growth. It's a show perfect for overthinking, perfect for negating any naysayer, where issues are fended off as \"it's meant to be that way.\" Subject matter created to facilitate a drab character doing things in a drab fashion. A machine-like girl with mechanical limbs given a task to emulate empathy. Her stilted, often wooden personality is accounted for by her upbringing. She's that way because she's SUPPOSED to be that way. It's all very self-serving. \"To wear one's faults on their sleeve\" taken quite literally. \\n\\n\r\nIt would have worked too, had there been no viable means to circumvent such insular logic. But here's where knowledge supersedes those counterarguments. Where one's experience can allow criticism to stick. This isn't the first anime to house such themes. And of those that did so before it, there are definitive examples of \"better\" out there disallowing the open acceptance of wooden behavior solely for the fact that the character's given circumstances allows it. Humans aren't that flat. To enable such simple-minded evaluations in place of spotting genuine issues is to trivialize the complexities of the human race altogether.\\n\\n\r\nWe already know what it would be like for an apathetic person unable to function without the strict regiment of paramilitary life because we've seen it done with a pedigree of writing befitting the serious subject matter. People that carry the baggage of their actions, the haunting memories of the things they've seen, unable to let go, to fully allow oneself to be integrated into society. We know what this looks like because well-developed personalities like Kazuki Fuse from Jin-Roh exists. Major Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell exists. Scar from Fullmetal Alchemist exists. PTSD is not a scapegoat for underwritten performances, and it should never be accepted as one. \\n\\n\r\nThese issues are made visible by VE's very crowning achievement. Pristine art and animation that ends up highlighting the thin veneer of its inherent value. The undeniable look of sterile sleekness. The artifice of humanistic warmth made bare by the prim and proper order towards everything on display. Everything and everyone is made beautiful. Age, circumstances, genetics; none of it matters. Mandated aesthetics dictate this world. You die beautifully. You get angry beautifully. You get beaten up with style. Even tears are delivered with streams of diamond-like orbs, with the owners' faces made for the camera. Everyone in this world like that of runway models, all given a chance to play civilians. Realism made implausible when all inhabitants look like they should be doing photo ops for H&M brochures. Any attempt at realism placed further on cease-and-desist when glimpses of battles are depicted with shounen-like fight sequences. A place where even the grim outcome of war must be performed with a sense of commissioned poetics, all done to appease the vision of a director too busy with their pursuit for a particular aesthetic to let the content speak for itself. Content that effectively gets in the way of its own vision because it's never granted the chance to breathe. \\n\\n\r\nNatural light emulation that aims for Call Me by Your Name but lands somewhere along the lines of The Visit. How an anime could suffer from overexposure is beyond me. Goes to show you that when you emulate without understanding, the issues are copied as well. Time-lapse photography used in every episode, not for any purpose other than to show off. Lens blur effects used for flashbacks and present-time, not because there's a reason to but because the director can. Everything is in service of this perfectness. This very unnatural attempt at being \"natural\" utterly self-defeating of its intentions. \\n\\n\r\nThis is equally true for moments underlined with genuine character outbursts. \\n\\n\r\nSilence is powerful. Playing music over every scene is amateur. Words drowned out by plucked strings, the steadily held notes of a violin, piano keys dolled out just as quickly; all of this without concern for what the characters are saying. Entire dialogue exchanges where silence is appropriate is washed out by a wall of sound. It doesn't compliment the material; it hijacks it. There's a time and a place for everything, this anime never come to realize that fact. \\n\\n\r\nIt may take drowning out its content before one take notice of what good is there, but in that regard, Violet Evergarden is not without merit. Our protagonist may be an empty vessel with flickers of humanity tucked inside, but thankfully we're not made hostage by her presence, as every chapter in VE is in service of someone else. People of far greater interest than herself. Their emotional range not limited\u2014even when presented with the same aesthetic brushstrokes that everything is painted in\u2014their humanistic tendencies find a way to radiate outward. And as a vessel, Violet is given a chance to charter her clients' emotions to those on the receiving end of the expressed affection, and through that task itself, is able to find a way to expound upon her own feelings in return. The broad spectrum of accumulated emotions serving as the proxy towards finding her own. The idea itself is very appropriate. I would even go as far as saying that it's thoughtful. It also operates with a pace befitting the subject matter, even if that pace is considered to be a problem to some. These things need time to happen. Thankfully, Violet is alotted that. \\n\\n\r\nIt's all told through carefully selected vignettes, being brought together by motifs relating back to nature, its seasons, and the various foliage that comes to represent them:\\n\\n\r\n\u25b8The story of Iris, a girl named after the flowers in bloom in her small village, seeking out an existence away from her meager upbringing. Unwilling to accept rejection, an act of stubborn pride catalyzes her steps forward. \\n\r\n\u25b8The story of Luculia, a pleasant disposition befitting the flower she's named after. She puts the feelings of her loved one ahead of herself. Hoping for their eventual emotional recovery from a tragedy that robbed them both of normalcy. \\n\r\n\u25b8The unofficial sigils of two kingdoms: one a white rose, the other red. Lovers-to-be and penpals brought together by political circumstances, but share a love that aligns beyond the expanded power and peace of their union. \\n\r\n\u25b8The final days of a mother, the autumn leaves fall as a countdown to her departure from the land of the living, wanting nothing more than to find a means to comfort the daughter that she's leaving behind. \\n\r\n\u25b8The blanket of snow that covers a warring nation in frozen stasis. People refusing to move forward. Like their winter surroundings, they too remain cold towards each other, leaving their country in a state of civil unrest.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the story of Violet herself, named after a wildflower in bloom; she's plucked out of the custody of a heartless man and into the care of one that sees beyond her reduced form. A disheveled mess, only treated as a tool, one meant to be used and later disposed of; the man sees differently. He wants her betterment at any cost, even if that means paying the ultimate price. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a beauty here when you view the intentions behind every chapter. The problem stems from the execution itself. Beautiful on paper doesn't translate to well-done in reality. Funny enough, the doll-like nature of the protagonist and her initial attempts at writing serves as a sort of meta-commentary for the content on display: \\n\\n\r\nHer intent is earnest, she wants to understand the expressions and feelings being directed her way, but like her mechanical limbs, so too is the show written with a sense of artificiality. An emulation of real-life that can't muster up to being anything more than that. \\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a beautiful plastic rose with stuck-on water droplets. It's well-kept. Never finding the beauty in decay. Never needing to accept the full spectrum of life simply because its creators are wholly content with being \"perfect.\" True beauty is found in the blemishes. Within the scuffle of humanity's futility towards greater ambitions. True beauty comes from the majesty of life itself making mankind a mere moment in a pool of infinity. True beauty is humbling. \\n\\n\r\nIt's through the imperfections that true beauty is emitted. Violet Evergarden is pretty to look at, but with the absence of this understanding, it could never be the real thing, it could never be \"true beauty.\"",

            "content": "Waking up one day and discovering Violet Evergarden getting an anime adaptation by Kyoto Animation should be a blessing. At least that\u2019s what it looked like on the surface. The light novel series earned the grand prize from the Fifth Kyoto Animation in the novel category. Even with two volumes, my expectations going into this anime was high. In particular, the sheer visual quality is a sight to feast on. However, Violet Evergarden isn\u2019t exactly just known for that but does that mean it\u2019s something to be praised?\r\nWritten by Kana Akatsuki, the light novel series is a story about Auto Memory Dolls. They are dollsare made by Dr. Orland, a scientist who used them to assist his wife in writing novels. However, these dolls were also rented out to others for service. The main plot revolves around an Auto Memory Doll named Violet Evergarden as she tries to discover her purpose in life.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who came into this series half prepared (I have read parts of the light novel), I felt I was ready enough. The first few episodes came in as anime originals and that left me with some mixed reception. However, I will say that the pilot episode was a terrific picture. Beyond the lush quality and the visual magnificence, Violet Evergarden presented a story with heavy emotions. It synchronizes with the drama and melancholy of what I had anticipated. However, the main selling point of the show is titular character Violet Evergarden herself. The story feels like a character study that puts over her above the rest of the cast. Every episode focuses on Violet in some way through her role in the story, her interactions with others, and how she develops as a character. The conflicts she experiences tests her feelings and how she responds to them by trying to understand others. It draws viewers into asking questions about how she can develop as a character and in a lot of ways, I think the show did do that quite well. For instance, Violet displays a lot of human characteristics and tries to understand others. The most prominent scenes features her desperately trying to learn what \u201clove\u201d is and to me, this series chronicles her experience like a life journey of discovery. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really say that the first few episodes were well thought out in characterizing Violet as a memorable character. Beyond her expressions and role, it seems the show repeats a lot of the same things over and over. The example includes Violet expressing why she is an Auto Memory Doll and it gets tedious fast. It also doesn\u2019t help much that the other side characters seemingly react in similar ways to Violet. My main concern for the first few episodes were mainly how this can keep viewers interested with such a way of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the series does get better and puts emphasis in some of the side characters. While the plot feels non-linear at times, some of the other characters do get spotlight through effective background storytelling. For instance, one of the episodes featured a 14 year old princess who gets engaged to a prince and while this seemed like a cheesy love tale at first, it resolved in a very emotional way. It gave me the impression that certain side characters are worth investing time into. In the meantime, the series does eventually step into the light novel adaptation territory as we learn more about Violet\u2019s past and connection with someone very important to her. That person would be Gilbert Bougainvillea, a major in the Leidenschaftlich Army and someone that influenced Violet a lot since she met him. As we look at Violet\u2019s past, we learn how they met and how much he treasure her like a person rather than a doll. It\u2019s also important to note that Violet feels comfort whenever she is around him and not lonely. The anime in the present timeline portrays Violet as a very lonely character and doesn\u2019t have someone to depend on. In doing so, it establishes Violet as a character that has a hard time understanding others. This is especially true for her after she heard Gilbert\u2019s final words. The show dedicates time to explore Violet\u2019s change since the past and how she reflects her experiences in the present. As I mentioned before, the series takes a lot of time into examining Violet as a character and getting viewers to understand her. The side characters play important roles in later episodes to make Violet reflect on her past deeds. To me, it\u2019s effective storytelling as it really made me understand her behavior. The more I understood her, the more compelling her character became. I don\u2019t know if this was the creator\u2019s intention from the start but honestly, it does come together as a well delivered plan.\\n\\n\r\nNow you\u2019re probably thinking of the story contains too much drama for its own good. In some ways, it does but in other ways, it\u2019s also important for the main story. You have to remember that the timeline takes place after a war that Violet was previously involved in. Stories about war often involves pain, tragic memories, and even death. For Violet, she experienced the realities of war. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be a lot of drama and its effect on the storytelling can be received with mixed receptions. I had some mixed feelings in general about Violet\u2019s past as while it can definitely evoke emotions, it doesn\u2019t feel unique enough to be memorable. In other words, I\u2019m more interested in how she develops as a character in the present rather than focusing on her past. Even if it\u2019s significant for her characterization, the drama presented in the background stories doesn\u2019t always feel too impactful. I get it though. Some people will probably point fingers and say that it\u2019s necessary. Others may agree with what I mentioned here. To me, I\u2019m still more interested in Violet\u2019s development in the present than who she is in the past. Otherwise, Violet\u2019s role in the show feels more than just a protagonist. She is the character.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone watching this series will easily recognize the powerful production of the show. This is perhaps one of Kyoto Animation\u2019s best work yet in terms of technical quality. The world setting has natural and lush landscapes with European style architecture detailed with vivid colors. Every camera shot feels impactful and there\u2019s no drop in quality in any episode. Body movements are also timed precisely well to highlight every fine detail such as Violet\u2019s character expressions and role as a doll. Speaking of which, Violet\u2019s character design makes her look very elegant. If you haven\u2019t known about her background story, it\u2019s hard to recognize her as a former soldier. Her signature hand is also a trademark animated with impressive features. It communicates the message to viewers as what she is. Other characters in the show also stand out with their human characteristics. While there\u2019s no fan service in the show, there are characters such as Cattelya that can be very pleasing to the naked eyes. It\u2019s clear to me that Kyoto Animation and the creative team poured a sheer amount of effort into making this series as a whole. The theme songs also highlights a sensitive feeling of melancholy to match the series\u2019 tone while character voice mannerism for the majority of the cast are able to keep up with their momentum. The music and OST also hits the mark to deliver what's intended especially for the emotional drama.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s definitely a series that felt different to me compared to some of other Kyoto Animation\u2019s recent works. This one was an emotional storyteller that gave us a reason why we should care about Violet Evergarden; not just the story but Violet\u2019s own journey of discovery. While I can\u2019t say it\u2019s always an effective tearjerker, it\u2019s still a show that\u2019s worth investing time into. Well done, Kyoto Animation. You gave me a better hope for your future.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden, the anime that has been hyped for a year, has finally arrived with controversy and concern. Is it the masterpiece that\u2019s deemed from most? Certainly not. That does not mean VE could not deliver. I\u2019m not gonna try to defend the anime just cuz it\u2019s KyoAni and it\u2019s highly placed by many, but I will give credit where credit is due. So let\u2019s get started.\r\nThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that VE is visually appealing and accompanied by a great OST. However, do the characters and plot live up to it? So far, it\u2019s too early to say despite 4 episodes still out.But we can kinda take a guess at this point. However, I do find the setting to be quite interesting and how the characters act seem to be somewhat realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s many reasons why people can rant on about this series, and no, \u201cIt\u2019s KyoAni\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Overhyped\u201d aren\u2019t some of them despite people using these as reasons regardless. Violet\u2019s introduction left many questioned, many thinking \u201cShe\u2019s not interesting.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s Bland\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s 1-Dimensional.\u201d But to be quite honest, the fact that she\u2019s uninteresting and bland means there\u2019s room for growth, and anyone can figure that out considering this has been done quite a lot. The start of the anime really showcases violet and her imperfection. Monotone, Boring, Lacking. Which is all the more reason for me to look forward to the end result of her character after upcoming development. Sure, maybe the way it was executed or presented seems questionable, but what the hell do you expect from a child that's been practically raised in war, got constant blood on her hands, and kills people without batting an eye? Anyways, I believe there\u2019s a bigger picture to this and that this sort of direction has a purpose. Or it could be just bad directing, but I\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\n\r\nI see no reason to give lack of growth or undeveloped as reasons to criticize characters so early on. It\u2019s like people expect 14 episodes worth of developed from Violet in the first couple episodes. There\u2019s reasons why developments exist, and it\u2019s to further a character and make them more interesting as people would expect to see. However, it\u2019s how they go about this development that makes me question the series a bit. The direction it\u2019s taking can go either way, so we\u2019ll have to see.\\n\\n\r\nLike I\u2019ve said, there\u2019s so much room to give more proper development on violet\u2019s character and the rest, but if it\u2019s accompanied by mediocre writing, then this development would be half assed. Now the writing isn\u2019t horrible for what it\u2019s worth, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to care about what dialogues these characters decide to use. There\u2019s only a lack of substance since it\u2019s still too early for its full potential to be known. So there\u2019s really no \u201csubstance\u201d to rate upon anyway. But that\u2019s why although I\u2019m not fond of the writing so far, I look forward to the conclusion and hopefully they successfully develop the characters enough for us to sympathize or to understand them much better. I think people expected this to be somewhat deep and thought-provoking. But this is somewhat a simple story about a girl trying to find herself. Just that it takes on a more dramatic approach.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the inner contents of the series itself, it definitely does the outer contents right. To the art style, the character design, the colours and background, as well as character movement, which makes them feel more realistic and humane. Sometimes the interactions between characters are fun to watch as well.\\n\\n\r\nI think that VE is one of those shows that needs time and a slower process to really form the bigger picture and its true purpose. Although the pacing seems...awfully slow, I wouldn\u2019t go as for to deem it \u201cboring.\u201d For me, I don\u2019t think that at all. It makes me curious for more and how they decide to execute the given scenarios and how each character grows from it. Sure some of the drama hasn\u2019t been so impactful or meaningful thus far, but it\u2019s been mentioned many times here that with enough time, I believe the drama then will carry more impact and weight than before. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think people should try place this anime on some sort of pedestal because it\u2019s simply KyoAni or it looks amazing. Violet Evergarden is FAR from perfect, but it\u2019s also not horrible at the same time. It\u2019s been mentioned before, I believe it\u2019s one of those anime that requires time to be able to fully understand VE\u2019s potential. So I recommend lowering your hype level of this series and treat it like any other show this winter, because you'll probably ruin the show for yourself if you don\u2019t. Violet Evergarden doesn\u2019t offer much but great visuals and soundtracks along with it. Look at what type of series it is and see if it interests you. I understand many people feel obligated to watch it because it\u2019s solely KyoAni (Me Included tbh). But see if it truly catches your interest. If it doesn\u2019t, then don\u2019t bother. \\n\\n\r\nI think VE may carry a simpler story than one might think. Not insanely thought-provoking or riveting, but I believe that since this show focuses on Violet\u2019s Character, we\u2019d be able to go more in depth on her past life and her adventures later on. We will see Violet grow as a character as she learns from others\u2019 experiences. That\u2019s her job after all, to deliver letters to people and to fully express their emotions onto a piece of paper. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Violet Evergarden has caught my interest personally and although it\u2019s hanging on the edge, I do hope that the staff finds a way to really bring out the full glory of the series into its full light and shows us a great series with fine narratives and well-developed characters (although sometimes the development is being dragged out a bit too much). Not sure why some of the side characters are original, but I suppose they add a bit to Violet's character.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, I\u2019ve learned not to give a damn about MAL scores a long time ago, because those \u201cscores\u201d used to influence me whether to watch something or not. I don\u2019t give a fuck if VE ends up in the 6\u2019s or low 7\u2019s once this is over. If I enjoyed it personally and loved it, then that\u2019s that. But again, my opinion on this can change easily. I\u2019ve only read a couple chapters of the source material so I can\u2019t really determine how well the adapatation is so far. But VE shows promise, it\u2019s up to the staff to live up to the promises and opportunities they\u2019re given. Both the OP and ED were beautiful and the OST's are just great, really not much to talk about there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (as of Episode 12):\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I truly believe Violet Evergarden can come out as one of the best from Winter, dare I say year, if it\u2019s done right\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf. \\n",

            "content": "\"As human beings, we all mature physically from childhood to adolescence and then into adulthood, but our emotions lag behind.\" - Bernard Sumner\r\nThis is the most memorable quote that had gone through my mind whenever I watched Violet Evergarden, and led me to ask myself this question: how do you learn an emotion? \r\nExperience? Knowing its definition? Or perhaps... By writing letters for others? Thus is VE's answer.\r\nStory: 7\r\nI liked the novel, so obviously I liked the story. They did make me get worried with those original episodes at the start but later on they managed to adapt most of the best chapters. There arequite a few which are standalone: 5,6,7,10,11. The rest involved Violet and her co-workers. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half didn't look that promising, but the second half improved a lot. I think it's because they put in a lot of her adventures in the second half, only involving Violet and the customer, which gave a lot more room for growth instead of being surrounded by the other workers. She's the type who learns fast when she's alone, you could say. Watching her change bit by bit  a girl from emotionless and to some extent irritating to one who is able to experience emotions was very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is not unique in the sense that she's trying to find the meaning of \"love\", but as it unfolds she learns other feelings as well, and soon enough we don't get the \"I want to know the meaning of \"I love you\"\" line.\\n\\n\r\nPacing has sometimes been a problem, for example episode 6, where I barely got to know about Leon. They could've done more but I guess you have to expect that when you've got less than 20 minutes to cover an adventures. But in most cases they provided us with the right flashbacks and details to get to know the customers well. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime did remove parts of the novel which were pretty bad: I'll start with witchcraft, a giant battle axe almost twice the size of Violet. I just couldn't believe that she could maneuver the axe so well, before she even got those robotic arms. Glad they got rid of that. They also made Violet very pacifistic compared to the novel, which helped to emphasize her growth even more, but this was at the cost of making her fighting scenes towards the end of the series ridiculous, since she chose to go head on without weapons at all, but still managed to take them down.\\n\\n\r\nOther reviews have pointed out the technological and cultural inaccuracies in VE, but personally it didn't affect me that much except maybe for those robotic arms which seem to be more advanced than one we have today... Rather, I was more annoyed by the battle scenes: a 14/15 year old girl fighting against trained soldiers, sometimes without weapons... I get that she is OP, but... the way her adventures unfold so conveniently at times was one of the main weaknesses of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some parts of the novel I would've liked them to include, for example Hodgins was supposed to visit Violet quite a few times when she was in the hospital and that helped to develop a parent-child relationship. They kind of tried to fit it in in between the adventures, but I don't think it was sufficient. The other thing is Violet's origins. They didn't go deep enough on that, and made people think that she became emotionless because of her time in the army. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThis is probably the best part and what made VE get such high expectations.  The face expressions were great, the landscapes were great... If I was to point out the best ones, I'd say the scenes of the starry night (Ep 6), street lamps and the city of Leiden as a whole. I also liked the way they included flowers a lot throughout the series (especially Ep 5, you could see one almost very 5 seconds). The reason I'm mentioning this is because flowers are an important theme here: if you look at the names of most of the characters, they're all related to flowers.\\n\\n\r\n\"People\u2019s names always have some sort of meaning.\" \u2014Akatsuki Kana (author of VE)\\n\\n\r\nIf I was to point out a negative... Sometimes, maybe this was just once, they put too much emphasis on scenes which didn't really deserve it. In Episode 4, when Violet was first introduced to the villagers, they suddenly went all out with the animation, including sudden gusts of wind and leaves dancing everywhere. It was amazing, but not really worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI liked the OP and ED, but that was about it. It didn't make me listen to it over and over again like Aimer's Ref:rain (best ED for me this season). The background music was alright, but they were often hit or miss: they would sometimes repeat it for too long and in other cases the music just didn't match the mood at all. But still enjoyable overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nFrom the blind obedience to kill to the development of a conscience which can heal, Violet's growth was truly remarkable, with the difference between her past and present crystal clear. Her blunt and fearless character had often been an obstacle against her success as a doll, but as the series progressed she managed to use them in the right circumstances. Her military salutes, her formal language, her expressionless face... They all changed. This is what the novel couldn't provide, those subtle details that show signs of growth.\\n\\n\r\nOnly disappointment is the development of the other characters, especially Hodgins, Cattleya and Benedict. The novel lacked this as well, but I guess it was expected since so much was invested into Violet and her customers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nGood, but not a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend you to read the novel? Give it a try unless you hated this. But there are going to be differences, both good and bad.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't be bothered reading the novel but still want to know what happens, you can PM me.",

The emotional atmosphere combined with the subtle visuals and gorgeous ost  created around the character\u2019s stories draw forth the raw emotions of its viewers and tears will be spend as an exchange.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a letter of love addressed to life, a lesson about the hardships and happy moments in life, it\u2019s about getting up and moving on despite the obstacles that await for you and it gets better after each episode like the taste of a wine as it gets better with age. Thematically rich, visually breathtaking with alluring ost Violet Evergarden is a gem that may be hated by many viewers or hold a special place in the hearts of its audience, can bring peace of mind and sooth your hearth, it\u2019s a show that needs to be savored for its special flavor called LIFE.\\n\\n\r\nAs any journey that comes to an end it\u2019s time to say farewell to our main heroine Violet who has reached her final destination but her fight with life will continue as long as she doesn\u2019t give up, so my review of this enchanting show has come to an end. I wanna thank all of those who allocated a little of their time to read the words that I put on paper to create something that I hope will make a little change and give this show a try.    \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Violet Evergarden doesn't talk much, but she has the power to restore people.\"\r\nThis quote perfectly sums up Violet Evergarden and what the show is trying to get across. After reading the synopsis of the show I was intrigued to see just how they are going to portray this type of character. In my opinion, they've done it almost perfectly. Knowing nothing but war, pain and suffering. Showing us how she finds meaning in these new emotions and how she experiences them for the first time.\r\nStory:\r\nStarting off with the story. We follow the journey of a girl named Violet Evergarden. Who has been in the armyas  \"the weapon\" from a very young age. Knowing nothing apart from how to follow orders. The story starts in a hospital where we discover she was greatly injured in the war costing her both arms. When she wakes up we find out the 4-year war has ended and this girl who missed pretty much all her childhood now needs to discover emotions for the first time and so her journey begins to discover the meaning of these emotions. Although you might think the story seems pretty simple it's actually the exact opposite. With flashbacks to show what happened to her in the war as well as meeting new characters and dealing with new emotions with every person. This actually turns into a pretty complex storyline. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first few episodes may suggest this is a generic anime with stunning visuals I can pretty much guarantee that it's not. The story might also seem very basic to people but the way its executed is honestly astounding. You can really sense what the author is trying to get across in every scene. The studio really outdid themselves when trying to make every scene perfect. Each scene has something to be learned from... not just Violet but even the viewers can take away these emotions. You can find yourself emotionally sucked into the story within the first few episodes. Even if you don't like how the story develops you still want to know how she turns out in the end. Which just proves how excellent the story writing is for the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI don't believe there is a word to describe the visuals in this show apart from mind-blowing. It's stuff you would expect from a movie budget. I'm definitely glad they focused on the art in the show. It's needed to flush out some of the emotions the character is trying to develop. One example is in one scene she looks out on the city during a sunset. Now that scene wouldn't have worked at all without amazing art. It just wouldn't show why the character appreciates it. Now it's not just the environment that has amazing art the characters also have amazing detail even just people in the background. The show does an excellent job of capturing facial expressions since is especially needed when trying to convey new emotions across. The fact this show has 14 episodes and keeps this type of art up is honestly astonishing to me. I would honestly recommend the show just for the art. Best I've seen for the budget of a show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis part is definitely the weakest of the show. Don't get me wrong it's still good but compared with the writing and art it just doesn't compare. The show does still deliver excellent soundtracks and the voice actors fit perfectly for the roles for both dub and sub versions of the show. They perfectly express the emotions the characters are feeling. However, I feel like the soundtracks are more just background music rather than dramatic music helping to convey emotions. Although it's still better than must it just isn't as good compared to other shows.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe story is focused solely on the development of one character and that being Violet Evergarden. At least that's what you would expect. However, that's not the case. Violet has this tendency to change the way characters think and feel showing us great character development throughout every episode. With new characters being introduced for a short time and some long-term character which we can see progressively change throughout the entire show. One of my favourite things about Violet Evergarden. Now I don't know if it was done on purpose or just how I perceived it but she was given the personality of a machine. Knowing nothing but how to follow instruction and orders similar to computers. Then we find out both her arms are mechanical which for me was a massive nod towards her being a machine emotionally. This was amazing character design if it was intended. Her full character is based on being this good soldier knowing only how to follow orders and getting things done according to what was specified. Which is shown a lot in the show like typing at a certain speed when doing a letter. Then we begin to see her develop new emotions and rekindle ones she didn't know she had like love which is a major development in 14 episodes especially when she started with pretty much nothing just a blank canvas if you will.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show definitely gives me amazing enjoyment looking forward to every episode each week knowing its going to be better than what I expected. Each episode brings old and new characters into the mix allowing for new storytelling and new emotions to be developed and sitting watching her develop these emotions is honestly so entertaining. I couldn't praise it more it keeps me coming back every week wanting to know what will she discover this week. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\nNow there are a few things people may dislike about the show which will ruin there experience so here are the main problems people are having with it. The first major problem is the story feels dull and slow which can ruin some peoples experience so try to keep in mind this isn't a fast show. It likes to go slow and let the characters built up progressively rather than being rushed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major point would be the character development which goes hand in hand with the story. It feels slow and underwhelming. Making people dislike the show straight from the first few episodes. So if you aren't a fan of slow shows I would suggest staying clear of this show or a least give the first 3 episodes a try.\\n\\n\r\nNow my last negative point isn't too much about the show itself it's more for other people's comments on it. A lot of people were really hyped about this show and feel let down by its performance so far. I would suggest just giving the show a try regardless of what they say. Usually, if something is hyped up too much it just can't reach what people are expecting. So try to go into the show with an open mind and if you don't like it by the end of episodes 3 then its probably not for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis show is a much watch for any person looking to get emotionally invested in a show for a complex storyline. With amazing visuals and stunning character development. There are few negatives I can give this show apart from the pacing feeling off in some early episodes. However, this is soon fixed after a couple of episodes and we are left to completely get sucked into her world and what she will discover. If anybody is thinking about watching the show but not sure. Highly recommend watching until the end of episode 3. I think by that point you should have a clear direction for what type of story the show is trying to get across. This definitely has the potential to be the best anime this winter. That now concludes my review of the show. Feel free to add me if you want to comment on my review or discuss anything.Thanks for reading.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Scores:\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4/10 (Very Good)",

            "content": "\"When I die, I want KyoAni lower me down in my grave so they can let me down one last time.\" \r\nFrom the dome of quality differences comes Violet Evergarden. Show half episodic, half character-driven, half story-driven. Yet all these halves barely make one show. \r\nWe mainly see try-hard attempts on making the viewers cry with melodrama. Most of the time it feels like spoon-feeding. Open your mouth, the emotions are coming! Let's take a bite whilst this every-sad-piano-song-ever plays on the background. \r\nThe show does bring some interesting topics on the table, but instead of trying to do much with little, instead of developingthe characters and playing around with all the good things the series already had, it starts expanding itself with irrelevances, 3rd parties and events so unnatural it felt like Hachimitsu no Clover S02 all over again. The focus always being on emotions, yet 0 emotional depth is present. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters on the other hand are bland and make no sense whatsoever. Violet comes with different personality and reaction based to the current episodic plot. Emotionally dead, hysterically crying little girl, I AM A WAR MACHINE - CYBERNETIC ORGANISM - LIVING TISSUE OVER ENDOSKELETON. Just choose your favorite version. Mine was the one in episode 6 who liked stargazing. I wonder where that personality disappeared for the remaining episodes.\\n\\n\r\nGilber's brother makes even less sense. \"You will be my brother's dog.\" And 3 episodes later \"There is no emotional bond between my brother and you.\" Who wouldn't bond with their own dog? I don't get it. Does this guy hate dogs or what is he even saying. What a cunt. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Bialetto Evelugalden is a common drama series to this industry, and its saddest part is not the actual drama writing, but the waste of potentiality, the single thought about -not only how much better this series could have been- but how much better it should have been.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden is the best looking show of the new year. Yet, beneath its alluring veneer lies something \r\ngrotesque. \r\nArt & Animation: 10/10 (\"Outstanding\")\r\nThe art is stunning and consistent with its pseudo-European world. Hard work has gone into to animating even the most mundane moments, adding brief glimpses of humanity to otherwise lifeless characters.\r\nSound: 8/10 (\"Very Good\")\r\nThe Orchestral music is apt. Yet at times the music clashes with scenes, taking away from moments are best left quieter. Some of the best moments in cinema and animation have relied on sound effects over dialogue and music.\r\nStory: 3/10 (\"Poor\")\r\nSome changes must happen when adapting a lightnovel to anime. Yet, the changes made in adapting Violet Evergarden are lackluster and timid. The writers must have recoiled when faced with a story that begins in medias res. (Lit. \"Into the middle of things\") So instead they altered the flow of events. Even if it was disruptive and even if scenes no longer made sense. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFurther, the anime has taken a complete departure from the adaptation. In fact, it would be best to say there is no central narrative. The directors have instead chosen to adapt Violet Evergarden as an omnibus. (By their own admission.) As a result, Kyoto Animation has opted to abandon foreshadowing. These changes have weakened the story on the whole. It has become something that is disposable and lacks character. Kyoto Animation's use of brute force and crude manipulation is unsuitable for a story about post-war recovery.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10 (\"Pathetic\")\\n\r\nAs bad as the story is, the characters are worse. A weak story makes weak characters. The shuffling and omission of events make attachment to any character difficult. Violet's desire to learn what \"I love you\" means is too grandiose to empathize with. The scope is too far removed from reality to be the sole string which ties the omnibus together. So, each episode Violet manages to feel less and less human. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I find this show guilty. It is guilty of being bad despite the clear hard work and talent that went into it. In some ways Violet Evergarden is a bigger travesty than a bad anime which had no effort put into it. This show could have been great, but it isn't, and nothing after these first four episodes can repair it. This show is a solemn reminder not to judge a show based on the quality of its original content, animation studio, or appearance. \\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation is to read the light novel, or watch Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu instead.",

            "content": "I'll start by saying that after watching 9 episodes I was compelled to write my first review for an anime on this site. \r\nIt's true certain aspects of a show can appeal more favourably to people depending on what they value. In saying that, I will focus on what this show does so well for me and why I consider it one of the best I've seen.\r\nStory: \r\nThe introduction of Violet can understandably come across as odd due to the monotone way in which she addresses other characters. This may be off putting to viewers as I've noticed in some other reviews, but this setup is to a soon to be deeper story is just that: a set up. From what seems to be an ordinary show with a simple premise, rises one with humanity and heartfelt emotion. The character Violet is the canvas and each one of her encounters adds another layer of life to her story. I respect the writers for having the capacity to create these memorable moments through subtle recalling of other plot points that makes the show feel tied together. On top of that the dialogue has this poetic nature to it, whereby it doesn't attempt to add unnecessary complexity but simply lays bare the message it wishes to communicate.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere is so much I would like to say about the music of this show but I will keep it to a minimum. What music should do well in any show is add to the emotion the story is trying to communicate. VE does this exceedingly well, providing a different variety of sounds depending on the situation. There are those intimate moments where it's often accompanied by one or two instruments, and there are more intense moments accompanied by orchestra. Overall there's a large variety of well written melodious music, and it has to go down as one of the best anime soundtracks I have heard to date.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nYou only have to watch the first episode to understand the quality of the visuals, and I would have to put this anime in my number one spot for that department because it is truly beautiful. It's only after watching VE have I realised the full extent in which visuals and sound can make the watching experience better. The colours are vibrant and there is a consistency of detail in every scene which keeps your eyes fixated on the screen in awe. Detailed facial expressions make the heartfelt moments of the show much more impactful. There is also this tendency to cut to exquisite detailed sceneries whether it be the backdrop of a starry sky or a field of flowers. But it doesn't stop there because these moments are scattered across every scene, with the environment, objects and camera perspectives adding unbridled levels of detail. If I didn't like the story, I would still be looking forward to seeing VE because of how aesthetically pleasing it is for the viewer. I applaud the artists of this show for the work they have done, as you can see the amount of love and effort they have put into it. This show is an artistic masterpiece in it's own right and I have no problem making that claim to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI can't say too much without giving away plot points but the focus of the show is almost entirely on Violet, with additional characterisation given to those that appear from episode to episode. I have invested in this journey Violet is on, as I can see how her character grows each week as she experiences more of a beautiful world she has never seen. I believe that everyone who watches the show will relate to Violet in some way as we have all seen the world through the lens of beauty or wonder at some point, and we are all on a similar path of discovery. Episode 7 is a particularly memorable episode and is a contained story featuring just Violet and two other characters. Minimal characters and concise well-written stories allow this show to shine and provide something that many anime's take several episodes to build up towards. It is a bold attempt at providing viewers a sense of fulfilment in just over 20 minutes, and I can say that it has given me that almost every week. When I began VE I thought of it as something that was 'pretty' and had potential, but now I look forward every week to see where it will go next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe scores I am giving are based on what I have seen to date. If I was to review the first 3 or 4 episodes, certain scores would have been lower. Story for example, picks up significantly from about episode 6 and is now consistently outstanding in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Scores:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 \\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was surprised when I saw the top 3 reviews for this anime were all negative because quite frankly I have nothing negative to say about VE and I'm on episode 10. If I'm being honest I think most of the people trashing VE are doing so because they want to be contrary and \"cool\" for not liking a popular anime. You know, the same old pretentious anime fans we all love (if you can't sense the sarcasm, you've misunderstood).\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nViolet is about a young woman who was used as a war machine having to learn how to live a \"normal\" life after thewar ends. The series is episodic with the main overarching focus being on how Violet grows as a person. Maybe the only negative I can say about VE is that, yes, some episodes are predictable but I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode introduces a new character and their struggles, and ends with how those struggles get fixed or dealt with, typically with Violet helping to the best of her abilities despite struggling herself.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big crier but I'll admit episode 10 made me tear up. VE has a wonderful way of making you care about characters and a story in just one episode. Kyoani always has pretty decent anime, but they really show their talent in VE. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs per usual Kyoani delivers amazing visuals. Absolutely nothing worth complaining about here.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nUsually I don't pay much attention to music in anime honestly, but I will admit VE has a way of putting the perfect music to make sad scenes even sadder.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor one, I love Violet. The more the series go on and the more she grows, the more I want to protect her like she's my own child. The other characters could do with more development, but on the other hand since the series is episodic and has to spend time making you care each episode for a new story it's understandable our mains don't get much time themselves, but they all have wondrous potential. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is easily becoming one of my favorite anime of all time. That's all I have to say. Please don't listen to the negative reviews and watch VE for yourself. You will understand why I feel so passionately about this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain the only anime to ever get a 10 out of 10 from me and it's not even finished yet.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden feels like the anime equivalent of Oscar bait. It's big and sweeping, trying desperately to convince you that its sappy story really means something, but it's ultimately shallow and entirely surface level. Everything that really matters, the meat of the story - its characters, its themes, its ideas - are so basic that it actually brings down the visual presentation. You're wasting this incredibly detailed art on this story, of all things? Why?\r\nViolet Evergarden is a story about a girl who is some sort of superpowered golem woman (?) who somehow has just been given robotic arms (??) despite living in a settingwhere most people are illiterate and typewriters are still the new hotness (???). She was used as a soldier, but now she's a glorified traveling secretary, writing letters for others in the hopes that she can answer one nagging question: What is love? (Baby don't hurt me)\\n\\n\r\nThere are problems with this setup. The setting is a mess, and I have been struggling to try and get a grasp on it. I'm all for alternate reality settings based on Europe (Fullmetal Alchemist nails it) but the schizophrenic tech levels and people's relatively muted reactions to Violet's robotic arms makes it hard to get a sense of anything. There\u2019s other weird inconsistencies, like a scene where characters apologetically bow in a Japanese manner or when a character gets Chinese takeout, paper box and all. Violet herself is also confounding, as the show has yet to make her origin clear, and while that might sound like the setup for a mystery, it certainly doesn't feel like one when every character seems to take her existence for granted.\\n\\n\r\nViolet's character is also a major hindrance. If you've seen one \"robot wants to be human\" movie, then you've seen all she has to offer. She's dull and monotone and utterly uninteresting to watch because she\u2019s got nothing else to her. I can literally summarize her character in two words: \"Muh Major.\" The emotional core of her arc is her relationship with her now-dead Major, but it's hard to care when they seem to be dragging out Violet's discovery of his death and we only see him in quick flashbacks. His story seems a lot more interesting than anything going on in the present; it's a shame the whole show couldn't have just been set around him as he trained Violet.\\n\\n\r\nShe's a weak anchor for the show, and the rest of the characters around her are even worse. For a show that presents itself so ostentatiously, it's really jarring when all of her coworkers are immature, one-note anime cliches that could be from any generic shounen or slice of life show. There's no chemistry among the cast, either, so I have absolutely no interest in learning their \"deep and mysterious backstories\". Episode 4 was probably the best so far because it actually fleshed one of the cast members out, but her story was predictable and thin so it's not like it makes her all that much more interesting. If that\u2019s the level of quality I have to expect from the rest, I\u2019m not holding my breath.\\n\\n\r\nYou can have all the pretty visuals in the world, and some of these landscapes really are gorgeous, but if you don't have a good story or characters to carry it through, what's the point?\\n\\n\r\nAnd actually, I do want to take aim at the story's visuals - or, rather, the directing. I don't think enough people are ragging on this point, but this is not a well-directed anime. There are so many laughably overwrought sequences that it feels as if the show is desperately overcompensating. I was giggling during the opening of the first episode when Violet's letter flies out of her hand and then proceeds to fly around the city in GRAND, MAJESTIC shots until we've apparently gone from the country to the motherfucking ocean. It's like the opening shot of the feather in Forrest Gump, except whereas in Gump that feather is a visual metaphor for the course of his existence, in Violet Evergarden it's just a way too obvious attempt to impress the audience.\\n\\n\r\nAnother galling example is in episode 4. Violet gives another character a curtsy. This is not an important interaction, she's basically just saying hi, and there is nothing pivotal about the moment. Despite the mundanity of the gesture, however, we suddenly get a million cuts and the animation goes into maximum overdrive as a massive gust of wind causes her dress to flutter like the show is announcing, \"This is the most important thing ever!\" It's completely over the top. Look, being over the top can be great, but it's all about tone, and it totally does not gel with the feel of that particular scene and the general \"serious\" tone the show so desperately wants to convey.\\n\\n\r\nThe directing is a mess because it never seems to know when to stop or when to pull it back. It\u2019s as if the director is convinced that if you make it look epic enough, then you trick people into thinking it\u2019s actually deep and resonant. Instead, it has all the emotional resonance of a fucking Michael Bay product.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while I'm bitching, can I bitch about the soundtrack? The musical choices (big, blaring orchestras) sometimes come in at the most inappropriate times, or the music is mixed so poorly as to drown out the characters' dialogue. The ED is complete trash, and sounds as if the singer dared herself to perform the song entirely through her nose. From Kyoto Animation, who usually nail the soundtracks and sound designs of their shows, this is just baffling.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Violet Evergarden\u2019s biggest sin is that it\u2019s mostly boring. Everything this show has to offer has been done a million times better elsewhere. Even the \u201csakuga\u201d isn\u2019t all that enthralling because, in the end, it\u2019s in service to nothing. I can appreciate moving wallpaper as a screensaver, but I\u2019m not going to enjoy watching it for 24 minute chunks. I guess I\u2019ll keep watching to see if it ends up going anywhere, mostly because I don\u2019t want to think Kyoto Animation would fuck up this badly, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend this show to anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019ll be wrong. Maybe it\u2019ll get better. And maybe I\u2019ll win the lottery and they\u2019ll finally announce Nichijou Season 2 and Donald Trump will fulfill his campaign promise of making anime great again. Fingers crossed, everybody!",

            "content": "\u201c\u266b\u266b\u266b When you try your best but you don\u2019t succeed\u2026\r\nWhen you get what you want, but not what you need\u2026 \u266b\u266b\u266b\u201d\r\nEmotions play a powerful part in storytelling; holding the capacity to tell more through expressions than words could ever hope to achieve. Furthermore, the degree of sentimentality and pathos one feels when watching is able to override any logical fallacies or flaws a story may have. Because of their poignant effect, these \u201cfeels\u201d are often used and abused by anime to hide a plethora of writing problems underneath obvious emotional manipulation on the viewers. But whilst there are shows that come off mawkish and melodramatic,there are certainly those where sentiment is deserved. Violet Evergarden is the most recent anime that struck a chord with the community, practically built as a masterpiece before the first episode was even released and I could see why: an award-winning light novel getting an adaptation by Kyoto Animation \u2013 a studio adored for their gorgeous art style and animation \u2013 sounds like a perfect match to many. But does Violet Evergarden live up to its expectations? And, perhaps more importantly, is the emotional ride warranted?\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden follows a titular young girl whose purpose was to be nothing more than a weapon bred for war; a dog of the military, actions akin to a beast fighting for survival. She was never taught how to speak, write or communicate at all, only to kill. Treated as property by the military she was gifted to Gilbert, a major in the army who feels sorry for her, taking it upon himself to teach her valuable skills so that someday she may live the life of a normal girl. As time goes on their relationship grows stronger with her initial animalistic nature subdued and instead displays a more robotic-like behaviour in public. A romance between the two also brews, but their responsibility as soldiers of war takes priority and their affection for each other forced into stagnation. Unfortunately, war holds no mercy on the battlefield and results in Gilbert\u2019s death. His last words: \u201cI love you\u201d \u2013 words that she doesn\u2019t understand from the man who gave her the name of a wildflower in bloom, Violet.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned acts as backstory to the main plotline that is not revealed until later, whereas the series begins with the aftermath: Violet is found in hospital, bed-ridden with prosthetic arms. The war is over and her purpose fulfilled, now she must adopt a civilian lifestyle. She meets Claudia, a former army commander who had befriended Gilbert during the war and is now president of a postal company that provides mail and ghost-writer services. Initially hired as a postal worker, she witnesses how the ghost-writer department works and wishes to become an Auto Memory Doll \u2013 a ghost-writer for those unable to write in order to learn the meaning of words and the feelings of others. The beginning is honestly a poor first impression, coming off sappy, predictable and acts as a shoddy introduction to each of the characters. Violet especially comes off almost insufferable here; her backstory is barely referred to with most of the details left in the dark, effectively throwing viewers into her moment of crisis without any proper context. It\u2019s a perplexing choice on behalf of the staff, considering that Violet\u2019s personality here leaves her a bland, dreary main character to follow from the start, lacking enough reason to care about her struggles to begin with. This is made worse with how the story begins at such a slow pace, making it hard to judge whether the show is worth continuing. However, Violet Evergarden is not a show that should be judged from first impressions, as there certainly is merit to be found.\\n\\n\r\nOver the next few episodes Violet finds herself working and learning from other Auto Memory Dolls from their interactions with clients. The contrast between Violet and her fellow workers easily shows how far Violet truly is from her goal: currently emotionless and blank in her interactions, yet her desire and drive to understand the clients shines across the screen. This is further touched upon as Violet attends a training school and is unable to convey one\u2019s feelings onto a letter. On her own, she is still unable to properly recognise emotions, but through those around her she slowly begins to grasp what they feel and how they express such. Here Violet\u2019s bland personality acts like a blank canvas where those around her can leave their mark on her, allowing for parallels between side characters and herself to cause short instances of growth in Violet and a resolution on the side-character\u2019s behalf. However, the show is never able to capitalize on these instances well. Rather than take adequate time and focus to let these small but important moments have appropriate build-up and climax to truly have a resonant effect, the show just treats them as merely parts of the plot that could very well be considered isolated from each other, devaluing each achievement Violet makes in her development as the show goes on. I personally found it appalling with how Violet finally learns to effectively convey feelings in an extremely short and concise letter, then not even a few episodes later she is extremely proficient in her writing. If only writing IRL was that easy \u2639\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s at this point where the pacing takes a sudden shift and the shows changes to an episodic format, focusing on Violet\u2019s travels away from her workplace for different clients, each with their own set of issues to overcome, but all revolve around the idea of awakening their true feelings. As an Auto Memory Doll her job is to help her clients express what they feel, but here Violet sees the inner conflict present and aims for them to address and come to terms with it, with her acting as a catalyst when necessary. Whilst doing so, Violet continues to gain more appreciation for different forms of communication and gradually shows more signs of human behaviour. Her facial expressions able to tell more and more with each passing episode. It also gives a greater sense of the importance of society learning to feel again, accepting the tender aspects of individuals and its value. Relearning traits such as kindness, compassion and knowing how to best care about each other, so that when her time comes, Violet will be able to do the same for the own problems. Knowing this, these episodes should be lovely short stories to sit through, but that\u2019s not the case. The way emotions are expressed here sound all well on paper, but in practice come off sterile \u2013 a \u201cclinical\u201d sense with how an entire spectrum of emotions are presented. There\u2019s certainly logical reasoning behind why each feeling is portrayed, but as a viewer, these sensations are only being observed, never experienced. A sense of detachment always lingering beyond the screen, breaking any chance to bond with what is happening in the narrative. The series never tries to be melodramatic in its attempts of sentiment and I can respect that; through sheer visual flare it seeks to emulate like none before it, only to end up feeling artificial for the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to get passionate about a series like this with such a lack of connection, but following Violet\u2019s journey to self-discovery holds enough value that\u2019s worth mentioning. Understanding her background and circumstances is crucial in understanding what Violet Evergarden is trying to achieve. She is initially a tool for battle, completely devoid of human emotion and understanding, simply bred to kill. It is only when she is away from the battlefield where she is aware of her apathetic nature and slowly starts to change. Her development can come off sappy, but it\u2019s justified here in my eyes; slowly grasping how to sympathize and feel for others regardless of her actions in the past. It\u2019s a war with herself, can her bloodstained hands really be used to help others? Is she worthy to? Constantly told she is on fire, it\u2019s when she finally learns about her former lover\u2019s death does the burning sensation set in and eat away at her soul. She gives in to despair and unsuccessfully tries to end her own life. Just when hope looks bleak, she finds a letter sent specifically to her. It\u2019s her colleagues; they miss her. Violet decides to help deliver letters at night, and witnesses the people that anxiously wait for these letters. Cheerful, elated to receive words from those they care about, their emotions key to her understanding her newfound purpose as a ghost-writer. Her hands that destroyed so much \u2013 can now bring people together. While the supporting characters will come and go at the drop of a dime, it is Violet who blossoms through the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe production of Violet Evergarden is constantly praised for the exquisite animation and beautiful art design, both of which are well deserved. Kyoto Animation once again prove why they are one of the best in the industry and raise the standard for TV animation to new heights. Everything looks beautiful\u2026 almost too beautiful. The fluid animation, impressive character designs and attention to detail are all obviously here, but I would not consider it all to be a positive. Violet Evergarden draws a fine line between breathtaking beauty and over-stylization; scenes are \u201ctoo overloaded\u201d with their artwork and digital effects, with the first few episodes smothered in excessive brightness, chromatic aberration and filters than hinder the great animation on display. When a pen is dropped, it doesn\u2019t just fall, it descends in dramatic fashion! It\u2019s overwhelming. Part of the problem falls to the directing which is just blatantly amateurish at times, as if the man in charge is unable to grasp feelings himself. There\u2019s a natural beauty to be found in subtlety when it comes to emotionally-driven shows that Violet Evergarden lacks. The need to present itself in such grandiose fashion manages to expose itself to how amateur the artistic choices taken are; techniques such as depth of field and time-lapse photography are used with the sole purpose being imitation to previous works that did them better. Don't get me wrong, Violet Evergarden still looks visually pleasing, but rather than a home-grown garden gleaming with a myriad of colourful flora, the flowers are plastic, and knowing such loses its lustre.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with having finished Violet Evergarden, my thoughts are as followed: I rarely laughed, I never cried and this certainly will not change my life, but there is value here worthy of one\u2019s admiration. While it lacks on an emotional level to me, the intent is pure and still holds a sense of beauty that deserves to be seen. It\u2019s a nice show one can easily sit through to pass time, but unfortunately I can\u2019t say much more. It\u2019s just a shame that for a story aimed at learning empathy, this message never reaches past the screen. For it desperately wishes to be as perfect an emotional experience can be, it\u2019s the stories holding imperfections that have the most powerful impact.",

Although many side characters seem quite flat, they really help boost the story in one of the best climaxes of a coming-of-age emotional anime I have ever seen(if you are wondering, it's episode 9). Major Gilbert and Claudia really develop as characters, gaining dimension in episodes 6-9, and it is just a joy to see Violet grow and learn how to express emotions.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni. Do I have to say anymore?\\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, have you seen the graphics? They are STUNNING, and boost the show in so many ways.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very wonderful, and the orchestral music is very moving. I just think that some of the music is lackluster compared to others. AMAZING ending song, though. Michishirube is so beautiful and emotional, and fits the show so well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nI can see where some may be turned off. Violet is flat and uninteresting in the first few episodes, but if you can take this as Violet just being inexperienced with emotions, all the flat main and side characters really develop. But I can understand why some may give bad ratings for this show having only watched 3-4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is just such a joy, and I look forward to each Thursday when I can watch the next episode. Violet's maturing is so heartwarming, and the side characters slowly becoming accustomed to Violet gives this show so much charm. I really recommend this anime for its enjoyable nature, if not for anything else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you can accept that Violet is just mot emotionally mature at first, this show becomes a feels trip and a beautiful, heart-melting anime that is worth every episode. Looking back on the first episodes, having watched later ones (especially episode 9), there is a feeling of satisfaction and happiness just seeing how cold and unemotional she was before, and seeing how well she grew. I absolutely recommend this anime to anyone looking for great music, visuals, and a charming story that will surely make you cry.",

I believe everyone who has written a review claiming thatthe story and characters are shallow fails to see what this anime is about and why it exists. Violet Evergarden is not a show that will keep you on your toes or enthrall you in a typical sense as there are several subtle themes throughout.  This is an anime for those who wish to observe and feel something. Despite what I said earlier about feelings, this show is made by how the characters portray different feelings. I truly feel sorry for those who cannot see that.

            "content": "Violet Evergarden is an anime series adaptation of the novel light with the same title from Kyoto Animation.\r\nSource material of this series is the winner of the Kyoto Animation Award 2014 in the novel category. Given that status, this series became the most awaited anime by the community for the winter of 2018. Compared to other series of the season, this series can be said to have the best animation, something that is expected of the anime from Kyoto Animation. With the premise offered is the post-war recovery of the main character, this series becomes one of the drama series that is able to fillus all with feelings\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : 8/10\\n\r\nI never read the source material of this series so I judged the storyline of what was shown in the anime. The premise offered is actually interesting. Self-rehabilitation of Violet who was created only as a weapon of war without having the slightest feeling and desire. But since the Major gave the last sentence, she began to look for what the meaning behind that sentence by becoming an Auto Memory Doll. Walking to one place to another meets the client's request. The journey unknowingly begins to make herself understand the feelings of a human being. The problem of each client who wants to pour into a letter is that slowly build the character Violet for the better. Until finally he understood the loss of someone and began to understand what it means to love. From a soldier who moves only if given the command to a human being who can shed tears. An interesting premise for a drama series derived from the light that lately is mostly filled by isekai genre\\n\\n\r\nDIRECTION : 6/10\\n\r\nThis series begins its story from  Violet's condition after the war and what she will do to find the meaning of the last sentence of Major. Then entering Episode 2-7 the direction of this series turns into episodic. Violet goes somewhere to answer client's request. Each episode is actually presented with the client's first point of view instead of Violet as main character. Every client has their own problems and from this problem Violet's character grows more human. With the direction of this story. Not everyone will understand how Violet character develops every episode. In fact, we will focus more on the client's problem. For example when most of us cry at the end of episode 10, but maybe many of us are not aware of the Violet character changes at that time. Episode 8-9 direction changes back to focus on the major plot. The transition from episodic episode clients to major episodes that has linear progress is poorly executed. I'm sure not everyone can understand how the story of this series if not paying attention to every sentence and scene with care. That was disturbing me in enjoying this series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : 9/10\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a character with the greatest development among all the characters that exist in this season. Starting from a soldier who even just to eat should be given orders by Hodgins to be a human being who is even determined not to lose the life of someone as she once did. The thing that I love about Violet's character is that she develops not because she is being advised by others, but she learns by listening to the client's problem. she began to understand a feeling precisely after knowing what problems hers client was experiencing. So after knowing facts that \"facts\". She understands the meaning of losing someone. The scene in episode 11 when Violet performs the \"last request\" of the soldier also shows how she began to understand the meaning of affection. Perhaps what she's been doing lately is naive. But it shows that Violet has changed from a heartless weapon into a human who understands the sense of losing someone.\\n\\n\r\nART : 10/10\\n\r\nThis series is a series with the best animated quality in winter of 2018. My favorite scene of course when Violet tried to pass the lake using an umbrella. The scene really shows the high quality animation presented by Kyoto Animation. The character design and color selection in this series reminds me of the Koe no Katachi film which is also made by KyoAni. Even for a television series, Violet Evergarden has the same quality as Koe no Katachi. Each frame is well drawn so the animation runs smoothly. Details on the character design also shows the hard work of key animators in making this series. Every female character feels so beautiful and every male character feels so manly through the way key animator draws each character. The selection of colors taken fits perfectly with the theme of this series which is thought to be similar to the period after the second world war in time and technology. Plus the quality of backgrounds such as clouds and water are so beautiful to the eye. Overall, this is one of the best quality anime other than Kimi no Na Wa and Koe no Katachi\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : 8/10\\n\r\nMaybe what makes us sad and cry when watching this series is not because of Violet's personal problems, but the client's problem. But still this series still able to make us shed tears. The existence of the soundtrack in every sad moment in this anime really strengthens the atmosphere. Without proper selection and soundtrack composition, sad moments are not necessarily can make us shed tears. It also should be appreciated is the sound effect. Especially when the scene is related to the war. The sound of weapons, bombs, airplanes or even the sound of a soldier dropped from a shot. My favorite part in terms of sound effects is when an army is shot. Everything feels so fast that we do not realize that someone has been shot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series provides  best animated quality and also provides an interesting story premise. But direction in this series can make us confused in following Violet's journey to find his true self. So not everyone will judge the story in this anime executed properly or not. But for a drama series. This is an anime with good character development. Violet is the character with most massive development among all the characters in the winter of 2018.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden was one of the most anticipated anime of the winter season, with its stunning promotional material showcasing beautifully animated scenes and character designs. It could be said that in that regard it was amazing and lived up to expectations. However, when it comes to the characters and overall narrative, sadly it isn't nearly as good as it could have been. The main problem can be associated with a lackluster cast of characters in combination with a seemingly aimless narrative.\r\nThe anime is based around Violet, a young girl that knows nothing else than war: when the Great War ended, she was left with noother option than to adapt a civilian life. By joining the Auto Memory Doll postal service, she will embark on a journey of self-discovery. Quite an interesting premise so far right? The different travel destinations the protagonist undertakes, offer each a diverse story of the client and their needs, while simultaneously developing Violet. These serve to shape the setting, as well gaining an understanding of the sociopolitical climate the story takes place in, helping viewers immerse themselves. Sadly, for a Victorian setting, Japanese customs are too prominent, making it a bit harder to engage with the narrative. In addition, the various stories on different episodes are quite predictable and clich\u00e9 - some good, others not as much. Lastly, the narration lacks in continuity, and therefore coherence,  as each episode jumps from one story to the other. As standalone episodes, they work, but as a package, it needs more context.  One such example is where a character of apparent importance is introduced to the viewer, making them wonder what will happen next, just to fully ignore said character for the following episodes. This leaves a bad taste in the mouth, especially considering that the episodes, in general, feel slightly random. These aren't necessary issues, as characters play the most important part in Slice of Life/Drama anime, yet somehow they were lackluster as well. Allow me to elaborate.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the main character is bland and boring, robot-like; which is not counterproductive in such cases (when done correctly), since that is the whole point of the anime. However, character development of Violet was done poorly, where the actions she performed felt forced, often falling back on her main motivation to do this ordeal in the first place, which may appear as a cheap copout. Another slight problem is that she seemingly gains emotions, then to suddenly just lose them for the convenience of the plot. It could be argued that it is natural for an emotionless human being, although personally, I'd disagree, especially when taking into account how little it does to the plot. In addition, little effort is made to make her a likable character, whether it be through interactions with her surroundings or just some simple characteristics of her that could be expanded on.\\n\\n\r\nProtagonists aren't necessarily the foundation of a character-driven story: secondary/supporting characters can fulfill that role too. Disappointingly, it even fails in this regard. The whole cast is generic as it can get, with not a single interesting personality to root for - they simply lack identity. Character interactions with the supporting cast are scarce, and when done, lack meaning. The anime tries to flesh these out with the limited screen time they get, but quite frankly, it leaves much to be desired. Admittedly, there are a few background stories that could be relatable to the audience, whether it be the reason why people work for the sake of working, or how people regret things only after they lose it. As a whole, the character dynamic problem lies in Violet hardly having any meaningful relationship with any of the cast, making hard to invest oneself. Such dynamics are not a necessity since, for example, Mushishi manages to do this perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, Violet Evergarden is stunning as mentioned earlier: after all, it is done by KyoAni, a studio renown for its gorgeously animated scenery and character designs. The studio makes good use of close-ups (whether it be objects or actions of the characters) to emphasize the meaning of the scene together with the different emotions it wants to evoke. The used color palette works great for the format, although it must be mentioned that the occasional grey filter that is applied feels unnecessary. The opening and ending are beautifully drawn and shown, albeit offering little addition to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a good job on their respective roles, including the monotone voice for Violet that embodies her character - anger, despair, sadness, and exhaustion were conveyed in a graceful manner, although in some in instances it felt forced. As for the soundtrack used, it is befitting of the anime with the use classical instruments, such as the violin, piano, etc. These are reminiscent of Ghibli-like works, which I personally am a fan of. It does a fantastic job to immerse the viewer into the story of this Victorian like era.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden as a whole was a beautifully animated work but lacked considerably in the most important parts, characters and story, causing a significant clash in immersion: the characters made it hard to feel engaged in it, while the animation and sound work invited to do so. For a slice of life anime, it fulfills its purpose, yet for a supposed story of self-discovery, it is arguably dull. This doesn't necessarily mean its bad/unwatchable; it simply could have been more than it ultimately was, since, despite all the issues mentioned in the review, I found myself enjoying the whole journey. All in all, Violet Evergarden had potential, but its shortcomings made it your average seasonal anime that comes and goes, just to be forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.\\n\\n",

            "content": "To Mrs. Sa\u2014\u2014, Leiden.\r\nLeidenschaftlich, Dec. 11th, 17\u2013\u2013.\r\nYou will rejoice to hear that the war has officially ended. Your brother is truly relieved to finally be able to breathe freely again; my fellow citizens, too, let out a collective sigh of relief. The alleys are filled with a comfortable bustle like they used to be; people\u2019s faces don\u2019t display a worrisome gloom anymore. Businesses are booming throughout the whole town and your brother, too, has found a place of employment in a mail and ghostwriting company. There, it is my job to deliver the letters ghostwritten by our so-called Auto Memory Dolls\u2014women who listen to one\u2019sinquiries and needs for a written letter and put one\u2019s feelings to paper.\\n\\n\r\nDuring my time working here, I have come into contact with many of the aforementioned dolls; and one of these women in particular piqued my interest: with her elegant, golden hair and doll-like demeanor, she fits the job perfectly, and she used to act the part just as well. However, what interested me about her the most wasn\u2019t her looks but rather the fact that she had many stories to tell, be it from house calls or other, similar events.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the stories themselves weren\u2019t all too intriguing. It may be because I\u2019ve lived through several years of war, but many of them felt like something I had heard before, had seen before. While the fates of these people are definitely cruel and while I really wish they had met a better fate, I can\u2019t help but think of the many who have fallen in war. Thus, the stories of these people whom I\u2019ve never met don\u2019t leave as much of an impression on me as they might have used to; while hearing this beautiful woman describe equally beautiful sights and sceneries brings with it a certain feeling of tranquility, they aren\u2019t what makes these stories interesting.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does make these stories interesting aren\u2019t the stories themselves, but how they affect the one experiencing and\u2014later\u2014telling them. She used to be a child soldier unable of speaking, reading or human emotion. Trained as nothing more than a weapon of war, her doll-like demeanor stems not from indifference, but her time as a soldier. Due to her unusual character, she ran into trouble trying to extract the emotions out of the client\u2019s words, but over time she learned how to understand these feelings and, most importantly, how to feel, herself. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes, upon reciting what had happened just a few days prior, her feelings slowly welled up inside, to then finally overflow. Suddenly, she learned how to smile, laugh and cry; she learned of emotion and empathy.  These unadulterated feelings coming from someone formerly unable to feel moved me to my very core every time; it was during these everyday epiphanies of hers that I felt like I was really watching something grow, giving shape to a human rather than a husk.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, newfound feelings are both a blessing and a curse. They may make life more interesting and worth living, but at the same time they can accumulate and overwhelm a person\u2014even more so someone hitherto engaged in the cruelty of war as she was. After realizing what she had done, she slowly gave in to sadness and sorrow. Her cold, metallic hands that killed so many, her blood-stained self burdened with guilt\u2014they started a fire, engulfing her. Her state of mind turned into a complete chaos; she decided to strangle herself with her abhorrent hands and end it all, but she failed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat saved her was a mere letter, this one sole letter I slipped through under her door. Filled with the feelings of her colleagues who missed her dearly, this letter saved her from her sorrow and herself. It let her reflect on what she had done: both her misdeeds in war and her profession, which brought together and still connects so many. Her actions might be irrevocable\u2014but that isn\u2019t a bad thing. Her burn marks may never heal, but really, they don\u2019t need to. After realizing this simple truth, she learned to accept herself and finally became a complete person.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at her now, I can\u2019t help but feel a somber sadness. Her metallic hands that killed so many and her brooch which reminds of the loved one she lost in war\u2014they make me feel melancholy. Just like the eponymous flower, Violet Evergarden is beautiful. While the stories she tells might not be as impactful as intended, her own very much makes up for it. Once you come visit me, I shall relay it to you whole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYours, Roland.\\n\\n\r\n(Score: 65)\\n",

            "content": "I will admit I was on the fucking hype train on this anime, like full force going Crunchyroll's \"Anime of the Year\" when it wasn't even released yet. Now after a solid year of waiting, I was giddy as a 5 year old to see a story that was full of nail-biting moments and action. But no, what I got was a simple story of a young woman trying to understand the society she was denied by the war as a child and a quest to find love.\r\nIt may sound like a cheezy overused plot point, even more so in a high budget anime likethis, but it's not. This is a character-driven anime. At first glance, Violet may seem like a boring MC, emotionless, robotic and stale, but in my opinion, watching her develop slowly into a more understanding person is so interesting. In this case, the blandness contributes so well to the other characters all in a way where they are helping her find the truth she deserves, about love. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style and soundtrack of this anime are just beyond words, KyoAni's best work by far imo. Character-wise, they do not really have amazing traits that stand out, all in the fact that it contributes to the show's simplicity. But the main personality is Violet's. she has to put this show on her back as it progresses, watching her grow while she handles tough situations is gonna be one hell of a ride.\\n\\n\r\nI can't think of a reason why you shouldn't watch this show, even if you are not a fan of simplistic shows, just stay for the visuals, you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "\u201cLetters are among the most significant memorial a person can leave behind them.\u201d  \u2015Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\r\n\u201cA letter always seemed to me like immortality because it is the mind alone without corporeal friend.\u201d \u2015 Emily Dickinson\r\nYou must be thinking, what the hell is wrong with this guy? Whats with all the \"letter\" quotes?\r\nThat's right!!! This anime actually gives you a perfect definition of letters, you must have heard of people in other reviews mentioning War, love story, Auto memoirs doll etc., Or at least got the feeling it would be one judging from 1st 2 episodes, but I would warn you guysthis isn\u2019t what you think it is, in fact, there isn\u2019t a straight story at all.\\n\\n\r\nThis is rather a story or rather a slice of life(SOL) of a girl (named Violet Evergarden) who is a weapon in war, trying to adjust in society post-war by writing the letters for people and understanding the feelings of the sender and receiver.\\n\r\nSo why does she want to write the letters? That\u2019s because she wants to know the meaning of \u201cI love you\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026.You must be thinking\u2026.wtf???? Yeah, that\u2019s true, this must have been the dumbest reason for anyone to learn writing letters (even the lieutenant Hodgins says that in the series), but you will understand that in the long run it kinda makes sense :P\\n\\n\r\nSo then there is no story and lots of negative reasons stated above (most importantly who would want to know about \u201cletters\u201d?), then\u2026\u2026 why is there a damn 8 in the rating????\\n\\n\r\nWell, even though there are lots of negative factors, at the end of the day it is able to deliver what we need in an anime, i.e the enjoyment, the emotional connection with the scene and mainly the importance of letters, i.e from a \u2018small sentence\u2019 to uniting couples with \u2018long letters\u2019, the letter has the power to move people's heart, that's the power of letters, which is really depicted well here.\\n\\n\r\nAlright cutting everything short, It is a collection of short stories with Violet in each episode is interacting with different people and changing their lives and also herself knowing what it is to be a human, what it feels like to lose a human and even you might get motivated from Violet as she tries hard learning to understand what human feelings are.\\n\\n\r\nThe main beauty of this anime is the ART, the animation, and camera view. All characters are so beautiful that everyone looks like a doll. You wouldn't even know for half of the series whether Violet is actually a doll or a human.\\n\r\nThe setting is historic, most probably during world war I  (The robotic arms of Violet seem too much advanced for that time or even present). The background, the colors, the time lapse, the sky, the flowers, the stars and even wine, every detail is so beautiful and so colorful that it gives you realistic appeal and makes you feel as if you were at that place.\\n\\n\r\nThe SOUNDTRACKS are another awesome tool for making this anime nostalgic. The classic orchestral music and emotional soundtracks are really awesome which resonate perfectly and sync with the situation bringing out the emotions out of you.\\n\r\nThe opening song is also used differently and is introduced in 3rd episode (seems this style is called progressive)  is a great song and matches perfectly with the situation. While the ending is also good which is introduced in the 2nd episode.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nWell coming to the final opinion, which matters the most!!! This show definitely has lot of flaws from dodging bullets like Flash(Superhero), executing a person with sword while having a gun at hand, to writing public love letters and many dramatic scenes which I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil you, which are made to make you emotional but when you think later logically, it might seem kinda dumb but still at the time of watching it makes you forget the flaws and makes you immerse in those lies, that's the beauty of this anime, making you connect with characters without much development just like Mushishi or kino no tabi. Therefore stating all various reasons,even though the anime Violet Evergarden is not suited for the likes of many, but still, it is definitely worth watching, at least once :P\\n\\n\r\nFor some, it would be \"that most hyped series\" or for others it might be \"that hyped series which lived to its reputation\", well, either way, it is going to be remembered lol.\\n\\n\r\nAnd my advice for you is, at least watch 5 episodes before you drop ( If you feel like dropping) and Don\u2019t binge watch it, because either your heart will melt or it might harden into a stone basing on your response.\\n\\n\r\nI have put out all the negative things about anime for you so that you might not be surprised and drop it out in middle. Did it give negative thoughts to fans?? I don't think so, because they will like it even if there are many flaws besides this.\\n\\n\r\nwell, that's the end of the review, you could stop here or read below for FAQs and more detailed Analyses of the series and character development, of course, it is spoiler-free. :D\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nDub or sub? : Personally, I feel that sub is a lot better because, at the actual point of creating an emotional moment, in the dub, the words are uttered as if they were read from Google translate. While the sub has better words which suit the dialogue. But in rest of the situations, the dub is also good.\\n\\n\r\nAnalysis of Story:\\n\r\nOne thing is good in this anime, It keeps you guessing what this anime might be turn out to be ? just when you are thinking of being fed-up or you made up your mind what this anime is gonna be? , that's when the story changes because, at present, you might observe that the genre of this anime is listed as SOL but it wasn\u2019t the case when this series was airing, everyone used to talk how the series might turn out to be(Forums). In detail, first 2 episodes are like a slight introduction to the current state Violet is, with focus given more to the surrounding places, the anime setting, the camera views etc, for example, The starting scene is just like the scene from Assassin's creed where the eagle flies and the camera shifts with respect to it while here a paper or perhaps the letter flies in its place.\\n\\n\r\nThen slowly from episode 3, the slice of life starts and by the end of episode 7 just when you are thinking this series is full of it, writing letters blah blah, the flashback or Violet\u2019s past kicks into play, and you get to see it for about for 2 episodes making you think, well we might get to watch a war anime perhaps, but it stops there and again the SOL begins, So by the time you reach episode 11 it makes sense that this anime is all about letters and its significance but its not really about violet's past, well that\u2019s where you are wrong again, just watch the series and know what it is :)\\n\\n\r\nDifference between Light novel and anime?\\n\r\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t read the novel but from the opinion of others, few other characters were introduced, Violet is more humane and less aggressive here and most of the unrealistic parts were removed like Violet with a battle axe. But the only fault is the 12th episode which gave a negative response from Novel fans by mentioning novel version was better and had more realistic feeling for that part. \\n\\n\r\nDifference of experience between new and old watchers of this series:\\n\r\nFor anyone new to Violet Evergarden, as I mentioned earlier you can observe that the genre is SOL, drama. you can have that premeditated feeling of watching a SOL. There is both negative and positive effect of it, the positive part is that you know that you are going to watch a SOL so you are mentally prepared not expecting much of a story but the negative part is that you wouldn\u2019t have that suspense what this series may turn out to be? \\n\\n\r\nComing to Characters:\\n\r\nWe all know that Slice of life means character development or vice versa but this isn\u2019t the case here, as violet meets new people in every episode, so there isn\u2019t much possibility for character development. That being said, I'll talk about few prominent characters which need to be noticed:\\n\\n\r\nViolet: People might either hate her due to her PTSD traits, inexpressive nature, and a bad example of Saber ( Fate series) 'OR' love her as innocent, fragile and she strives to be a better person and also fans of Saber might like her. This show is basically about Violet so you need to watch the show and understand about her, leaving here coming to another major character, \\n\\n\r\nMajor Gilbert: There are huge amount of novel fans who might love him, but his character is just developed for about 2 episodes in anime and you can observe his and Violet\u2019s relationship to be similar to like that of father and daughter, He is the main cause of Violet\u2019s change of behaviour or character due to the fatherly love is shown by him. Many people(novel readers) say that he loved her like a partner but I didn\u2019t feel the same. His role is very less, then there is his friend:\\n\\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Hodgins: I felt him to another good guy, he is more developed then Gilbert lol, he also plays a major role in supporting Violet, by getting her a job, taking care of her and even give the right amount of comfort to her as per Gilbert\u2019s request but he doesn\u2019t feel burdened.\\n\\n\r\nThe only controversial person who seemed out of character every-time in new episode is Gilbert\u2019s brother Dietfried. In one episode he seems harsh on Violet (Ep 5), in other episode he thinks her to have changed (Ep 8) and again in 12th episode it is shown that he still doesn\u2019t believe in Violet still but takes her advice or saves her and many more weird multiple unstable traits are exhibited by him,\\n\r\nother than that rest all characters are developed for an episode or two and left, For example, characters like Benedict ( postman), Luculia, Iris, Erica (Dolls)etc are used just for the sake of story\u2019s progress in latter small and significant parts which might make many people angry for not developing them or using them properly, since we are mainly focused on Violet\u2019s point of view I think its better to ignore the rest.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you like this kind of writing style in which I seem like interacting with you and I hope this review motivated you to watch it \u270c\\n\\n\r\nI hope I didn't bore you with all the praises, I did want to criticize and write a review like a critic, but every time I re-watched the series, I kept falling in love with it and most probably you are gonna too :)",

From the first episode and ongoing every episode i fall in love more and more.If you are into romantic calming types this is the one for you. The story is outstanding I mean the concept of meaning of love and what difference feelings make. Characters are amazing each and every one of them. Theme of the anime is 90's type which is less now a days. Animation is outstanding. sound track is amazingly soothing, and the music just makes the atmosphere so real. The last anime I watchedlike this was your lie in April. the rating is underrated I think",

            "content": "\u201cI do not admire greatness that has no substance.\u201d\r\nMary Balogh\r\nBefore the Winter 18 season had even began Violet Evergarden was set out to be one of the most anticipated animes of the year. It has been heavily advertised on social media anime websites as well as being first anime to be released weekly on UK Netflix. When I first saw the trailer for this show I was really excited because I thought this show would continue the Kyoani streak where they constantly gave us greats shows like Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, Sound! Euphonium 2 and A Silent Voice. Maybe I was expecting too much asthis point because I forgot that Kyoani is the origin of the style over substance shows where despite having great production values and music the story and characters simply don\u2019t hold well especially when you try to re-watch them. There are a few expectations such as Full Metal Panic, K-on, and the shows I just mentioned in the Kyoani streak but the end of the day I don\u2019t value Kyoani all that much compared to other studios like Bones, Sunrise, Madhouse and even J.C Staff.\\n\r\nSo how does this relate to Violet Evergarden you may ask? Simply put Violet Evergarden repents almost everything that is wrong with Knoani shows as a whole. It took everything that was wrong from past Knoani and makes them worse. Combined with the great production values and music that covers up the lackluster story and characters than you got a show that feels like a tech demo instead of a complete product. Seriously what the hell happened Knoani? You took 3 steps forward with Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, Sound! Euphonium 2 and A Silent Voice and now you\u2019re taking 5 steps back.\\n\r\nJust wow!!!\\n\r\nNow with all that said hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcomes to my review Violet Evergarden and with all said let\u2019s begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows a former young military girl named who after serving in the war is now crippled both physically and mentally where not only she lost both of her arms she also has temporary amnesia where she cannot remember anything. One day a person named Colonel Hodgins an old acquaintance of Gilbert arrives to pick up violet from the hospital so she can be adopted by the Evergarden family which Gilbert had already arranged. However since Violet cannot adjust to civilian life due to her military indoctrination and amnesia Hodgins hires Violet to being a postal worker. Shortly after she witnesses the Auto Memory Dolls which is a group of writers who carry people thoughts and converts them into words. While witnessing Auto Memory Dolls she remembers the words \"I love you\" that was told by Gilbert towards Violet. Wanting to meaning the words she decides to become a Auto Memories Dolls and from there here journey begins as she comes face to face with various people\u2019s emotions and differing shapes of love as well searching the meaning of the words \"I love you\" told by Gilbert.\\n\r\nThe story has quite a bit of decent things in it but at the same time a lot of bad.\\n\r\nOne of the things that I liked about Evergarden is its episodic nature in the beginning as Violet does her job as an automated writer who writes for others. I liked the concept of it. However, as the series progressed it, unfortunately, got repetitive and predictable and it got to a point where am watching the same thing over and over again in terms of how almost every episode ends. \\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I liked about Violet Evergarden that is not the great production values and music are the themes. No matter how predictable and shallow the show was Violet Evergarden least did a decent job exploring the themes of understanding one another, emotional and love. When this show is not predictable as actually having good writing it actually showcases how these themes can affect the characters especially with violet where at the beginning of the series where actually a living robot with no personality thanks to amnesia however as the series goes she's slowly starting to understand people emotions as well understanding true love. Am much I enjoyed how Violet Evergarden presented it themes I feel at times it got kinda preachy where certain characters just annoyingly preach how they don\u2019t understand people feelings and love etc. It just got really annoying and at times the show really tries to shove down its messages right down our throats.    \\n\r\nNow that\u2019s all the decent about the story let\u2019s get to the bad things about the story.\\n\r\nFor starters, most of the episodes are hit or miss. Some episodes were good and it was decently written while others episodes ranged from mediocre, boring to downright awful\\n\r\nAnother big flaw of Violet Evergarden is the terrible pacing. Good lord this show pacing is very slow but not in a good way. I know it\u2019s a slice of life show/ drama and all but did they really have to make it into a snooze feast especially in the first half. \\n\r\nNo wonder why me and my group of friends called this series Violet Everboring or worst No Man\u2019s Evergarden (No Man\u2019s Sky) because not only the pacing was terrible where it people to sleep but it was ultimately uninteresting thanks to its shallow writing emotional moments and characters. \\n\r\nI also didn\u2019t like the fact that it was trying to hardest to be a tearjerker. Excluding episodes 10 and 11 all of the emotional moments were pretty lackluster and had no real impact thanks to its dull characters and shallow/predictable writing.  It doesn\u2019t help the fact that this show directing is up there with the god-awful Transformers movies that were done by Michael Bay\\n\r\nBy far this shows biggest sin is that it's a another style over substance show where despite the having great production values and music the show\u2019s writing and characters are terrible and I hate shows when they do this. Okay, I will admit that this show at times has some substance where it does a pretty decent job with its themes\u2019 and developing a very small handful of its characters which other shows of its type don\u2019t even do it at all looking at you DARLING in the FRANXX. However, these good things come far between as this show throughout most of its run likes focus on showings of its production values and music while having subpar characters and writing.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIf the story a couple of decent things in it than I almost nothing positive about the characters in Evergarden. \\n\r\nViolet herself is a pretty alright character sure she starts off being very bland but as the show progresses she very slowly becomes quite a decent character that gets\u2019s good character development. However, I will admit she\u2019s a pretty hard character to relate due to her wooden personality especially in the first half of the series where she\u2019s literally unlikable. The rest of the characters are one note and they are just as interesting as watching grass grow thanks to the other characters being bland, boring, annoying to downright awful. \\n\r\nOverall despite Violet being a decently developed character I just cannot relate to her at all plus almost of the supporting characters are all generic drama that we all seen being before in better drama animes. I really wanted to like this characters cast but I couldn\u2019t due to the characters being utterly unlikeable and development with the expectation of violet who is decent characters at best despite her being unrelatable as hell.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\r\nVisuals and sound.\\n\r\nIf there is one thing that was great about Violet Evergarden it would be the visuals and soundtrack.\\n\r\nThis is quite simply one of the best looking animes I have ever seen in my life. The amount of detail that was showed in this show is insane. Characters designs were great, the background scenery was wonderful to look at and the color direction was great. Like with The Ancient Magus Bride this show has wonderful camerawork and lighting but its way better as this show has great shot composition.  As for actual animation, it\u2019s pretty amazing. Every scene is very well animated, all the scenes flow well to each other and it the movement was fluid. I have no complaints with the visuals whatsoever.\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack like the with the visuals, it\u2019s amazing. Every single track in the show was a joy to listen and it fits tones with the show for the most part.\\n\r\nThe opening theme \"Sincerely\" by TRUE is a pretty great opening theme that I liked.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Michishirube by Minori Chihara was pretty good but not as great as the opening theme, however, the ending that plays in episode 9 Believe in by Aira Yuuki was fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nThe sub is great as you expect as every Seiyuu did a great job with the roles that were given so I have no complaints with the sub. The dub, on the other hand, was actually surprising pretty good with a lot of good talented voice actors.\\n\r\n10/10 for both Visuals and Sound.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is just an another Oscar bait type of anime. It got a lot of attention from anime fans thanks to great advertisement and trailers. It also tried to convince the audience that this show is going to next big thing but it ultimately fells flat in almost every way possible if you don\u2019t count the visuals and music. The story was lackluster at best that is filled with subpar/predictable writing, shitty pacing, weak emotional impacts that at times was written by a 12-year-old. All of the characters besides Violet were pathetically bad thanks to them being clich\u00e9d as hell as well being very unlikeable. The only actually good things about this show are the visuals, music dub and some of the well-explored themes in this.\\n\r\nEverything else is pretty much a dumpster fire by comparison and it really made sad because I really wanted to like this show but this show just failed to deliver thanks to its on-going problems that never seem to go away and at the end of the Violet Evergarden is a beautiful train-wreck that barely has any substance whatsoever. \\n\r\nEasily the most disappointing anime I have seen from 2018 by far and I know it\u2019s pretty early to say that but once 2018 comes to a close this anime would be number 1 for most disappointing animes list.\\n\r\nDon\u2019t buy into the hype from people about this series because it\u2019s not worth it at all as it will heavily disappoint you.\\n\r\nFinal Score 4/10\\n",

            "content": "Dear Violet Evergarden:\r\nWith news of your arrival, you managed to rally up our community in a way no upcoming first installment title has before. The way you presented yourself was inviting, enchanting even. Few knew exactly what they were in for, but while not many expected a work as flawed as yourself, they knew to expect something beautiful. Your approach to conveying emotion is interesting, to say the least. Your intentions were rather wonderful: to show someone adjust to life after a war in which her entire existence was predicated towards, while trying to understand and convey emotions via letters and experiences in order tounderstand the last words of someone she loved. You take this robotic husk of a human being, slowly piece her past and how others are affected by said past, and have her grow as a person thanks to the people she encounters and the experiences she has. You showcase the brutality of war and the despair it has on civilians who will never see their loved ones again, all the while showcasing the struggles of adapting to civilization and coping with loss. On paper, it seemed to be a precious concept. While you seem to understand how to convey emotion, how to tie emotional moments together for maximum payoff, and how to truly utilize the audiovisual medium of animation to accentuate every emotional moment, you seem to have a difficult time earning emotional climaxes thanks to your pacing, how you like to spell out how a character, most commonly Violet herself, has grown, and the sheer lunacy you display in occasion. In a way, you\u2019re eerily similar to your main character.\\n\\n\r\nYou don\u2019t entirely lack subtlety per se, but you tend to spell out how Violet or another character has developed after an experience or what one of them is thinking that the audience is supposed to take away from a scene. It is the equivalent of Violet telling people how they are feeling. As they do not like it when she does it, it is bothersome when you do it. I like how you try to clue us into the fate of Violet's beloved major early on, simply with the characters\u2019 pauses, their expressions, and how they try to dodge the issue. If you were more like that, simply letting the visuals convey a character\u2019s feelings and what they mean in any given situation, you would\u2019ve been even more emotionally resonant, especially early on and in the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAnother hindrance to the power of what you convey is how you skip events. For example, in episode 3, Violet enrolls in a program to improve her skills, and by the halfway point, she still cannot convey emotions in her writing, so she fails the course. After one more exercise after an unknown amount of time has passed, after the course is over, she writes a small, satisfactory letter, and automatically passes. Moments like this feel far too sudden, too undercooked, and thus, unearned. Each story is episodic in nature, in that they begin and end by the end of any given episode. With the way you employed this style of writing, you failed to give yourself enough room for some of these stories to play out properly. As such, you resort to nebulous and/or blatant time skips such as a few month time skip in episode 5, which makes everything feel ridiculous and cheap. The progression of Violet herself is not only spelled out to unfortunate degrees, but erratic and unnatural. Her character builds with each interaction, each letter, and each new event she finds herself as a centerpiece of, but the effects feel ill-prepared. It does not feel disingenuous or forced, but it feels awkward and confused at times. The silliness and even stupidity of some of your situations and outcomes make it even harder to take these tear-jerking moments seriously.\\n\\n\r\nViolet is your primary focus, as she is molded by those around her. She is incredibly well-constructed, with every story hand-crafted to tie into her in some way, and make her grow as a person and understand emotions and love better than she did before each encounter, even if they sometimes feel like overdone conveniences for the sake of more tears. Additionally, her progression feels awkwardly handled, and as if she grew far too fast too quickly. The time skips make this even more apparent, such as in episodes 3 and 5. It is also a shame that the characters do not click as well as expected. You give us a few entertaining individuals such as Cattleya, but the rest feel less like distinct characters whose plights shake you to your knees, and more like people designed to get violet to grow and relate for the sake of pruning your doughy eyes. This would be fine if everything felt natural, but it doesn\u2019t, so the cast, while not inherently bad or weak, are not nearly as impactful as Violet herself. Even the rare comedic moment feels forced, and moments of Violet being blunt are somehow far more amusing. Some of the more asinine moments you showcase are equally hilarious, unintentionally so. At the very least, these side-characters generally do a satisfactory job at what they are intended, so emotional scenes work with them, but there is a surprising lack of chemistry between them and violet, or between each other. Some almost feel like they should never be allowed to interact with certain characters lest they become harder to put up with. Other characters can be borderline laughable or outright pathetic, such as miscellaneous military men in episodes such as 8, or the male tsundere in episode 6. Violet cannot carry the weight of your cast on her own, especially when some do the dolls don't even get their closure unlike the one-offs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as mentioned prior, you have a clear path you intend to tread, and you know exactly how to tie things together, even at the borderline frequent cost of the naturality and subtlety required for you to succeed at your goals. The purposeful irony behind your usage of \u201cdoll\u201d is brilliant, as Violet is described as a doll in a variety of ways, from her job description to her as a person. Each story reveals something new about Violet that causes her to relate to them, such as how she got her name, or feeling the warmth of knowing a soldier you care about is alive. These are thinly-veiled, however. They are small, fleeting moments strung together in rapid succession to build without realizing the time there must be set aside or how natural and unspoken the growth must be. Combined with the borderline confusing and barely explored world-building, you\u2019re ultimately a worse Mahoutsukai no Yome in this regard, and that's a shame given how you weave everything together to piece Violet more and more together each time, and how you utilized its audiovisual strengths to bolster your moments. These moments grow all the stronger, all the more painful in the second half, as things feel much more grounded, well-paced, and devastating on the whole, while the moments of nonsense stopped interfering for most part, ending entirely excluded.\\n\\n\r\nEvan Call, oft known as someone who composes good music for bad shows, seems to have broken that reputation thanks to you, as he furnishes you, an actually competent show, with a myriad of emotional pieces that compliment their scenes in a satisfactory way. A few pieces stood out, such as \u201cNever Coming Back\u201d and \u201cInconsolable\u201d for being the most emotional of them all, and \u201cTorment\u201d for being the only notable string piece full of violins and cellos. While none of his work here truly rivals his magnum opus \u201cOne More Time\u201d for an inferior show named Chronos Ruler, this is probably the best soundtrack he has composed overall. Where the music he has gifted you truly shines, however, is with the opening: \u201cSincerely\u201d, by TRUE. As one of the best opening of the year and one of the most emotional openings, even songs I have listened to, this song represents everything you hope to achieve, and moves me even more than your emotional climaxes do. Your ED theme, \"Michishirube (\u307f\u3061\u3057\u308b\u3079)\" by Minori Chihara, tries a similar approach, but the vocals can downplay the effects of the sad song.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the grievances I have laid down against you, I cannot deny your beauty. Kyoto Animation worked diligently to craft every scene with luscious detail, with gorgeous, intricate designs, subtle animation movements, and so much more. Even when the light saturation becomes intense at times, those moments have a distinct purpose. Even with the occasionally awkward CGI, it is barely present, so it barely detracts from your beauty. They may have gone overboard in terms of blurring backgrounds for the sake of depth of field, but it does not detract too heavily from what a sight you are to behold. The metallic hands, with all sorts of wonderful coloration, really feel as detailed as a fantastically animated anime film. Even with men that often look far too similar in face, the designs are as beautiful as the women you showcase. It is more than obvious that an immense amount of effort was put into the intricate craftsmanship of your appearance. The directing in some scenes, such as the graveyard scene of episode 8, or the first scene of the first episode, only strengthen the raw emotion being poured out in some of your best scenes. Even with the fight scenes that can only be described as competent, I can barely do justice to how gorgeous you are. Rest assured, as barring borderline insignificant moments and relatively understandable decisions and whatnot, you are one of the best-looking television productions I have ever laid eyes on.\\n\\n\r\nIn some ways, one might consider the hype surrounding you to have been incredibly excessive. In others, many seem to have been truly fulfilled by what you presented. Even with emotionally stunted and borderline laughable moments throughout the early half in particular, you succeeded at being impactful. Apologies are in order, as I cannot give you my happiest regards, regardless of your beauty and wonderful intentions. To the team that crafted you, I wish them luck in future endeavors, and on the prospect of making even better shows in the future. Enjoy the feelings you\u2019ve invoked, and the fleeting moments you showcased to the world, for you\u2019re under the service of many for now.\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, \\n\\n\r\nCattleya's secret admirer",

            "content": "[5.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nFilters, dolls, and grooming children Woody Allen style, the somewhat contentious Violet Evergarden attempts to do so much. From the precise, focused presentation by Kyoto Animation's art team to the messy, bloated, and ugly narrative, there is a lot to consume within the series. A lot to consume, but not a lot to digest. Like an airy, mediocre castella cake, it slips into your mouth with an initial hint of sweetness but once you really begin chewing it is just a piece of soft, bland bread. \r\nWith KyoAni's dark horse in the director's chair struggling desperately to milk every ounce of emotion from this series,we get a holistically fake experience. One, like the dolls presented, lacking all forms of nuance, subtlety, and pacing. It is too slow when getting through exposition, too fast when the trajectory is on the action, and ultimately a confusing, directionless mess of scattering debris and disappointing characterization with equally banal storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nIt looks pretty incredible though.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Beauty Hides the Beast]\\n\\n\r\nYeah, so Evergarden is unarguably a looker. It delivers in virtually every aspect of animation.  Kyoto Animation has, in my opinion, the most talented and proficient group of animators in the entire anime industry and then some. With a relatively small team, they release products that put every other televised anime to utter and hilarious shame. They even put some films to shame with this series. It really is that good looking.\\n\\n\r\nEvergarden's aesthetic exists in the minutia, too. Not just how time-saving techniques pioneered decades ago are virtually not present within this series, which might be one of the most captivating things about the show, but it is in the lighting. How meticulous the effects work is. How they managed to convey manga-level detail into fully animated characters is literally unlike anything else I've seen in the television anime hemisphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is solid, even if it is overbearing. We get backing tracks over almost every scene. Thankfully, a few of them are earworms and others are simply serviceable. The opening and closing tracks are pretty forgettable and I honestly ended up skipping past them when I could. \\n\\n\r\nEverything isn't perfect in the land of lens flares and filters, unfortunately. The direction is weak. I say weak in comparison to just about any other KyoAni product I've seen. Ishidate either struggled with restrictions or simply couldn't develop a coherent and unique style for himself, which is rare for the beautiful palate of directors KyoAni has the privilege of working with. The few episodes helmed by other names were substantially easier on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the direction is awful in the grand scheme of things. It is serviceable and this series is generally directed like a mediocre drama anime. We get all the famous, cliche, and boring shots that you'd expect from any other drama of Evergarden's ilk. I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The beauty here really masks the beast underneath, though. While the art is unquestionably jaw-dropping and audacious. There is a lot under the hood of this series that is decidedly not so. This leads me to the beast. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Beast]\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a super-soldier from an unknown location that is never explained or mentioned in any detail. The world here is a steampunky post-victorian England. She was trained to be nothing but a weapon. Violet is treated poorly by all the generic military men you can imagine until she is gifted, as a tool, to a random generic military guy that isn't a douchebag for some reason. This guy is Gilbert, a handsome blue-haired anime boy that is probably around twice Violet's age. He buys her a knick-knack and because this twelve-year-old girl has been treated like the gum on the bottom of a shoe by everyone but this one Gilbert fellow she instantly grows attached to him.\\n\\n\r\nHe proceeds to follow orders rigidly, throwing this twelve-year-old girl into battles where she promptly slaughters everyone. How does this twelve-year-old girl do this? Never explained. Regardless, she's overpowered as hell and probably has ninja-genes because she naruto-runs all over these redshirts. One thing leads to another and in a war-ending battle Gilbert is injured and she tries to save him. In the process, she loses both arms and he kind of maybe sort of dies. \\n\\n\r\nNow, post-war, she begins work as an \"auto-memory doll\", which is pretty much a ghostwriter for letters. She vows to find the \"meaning of love\", which is as corny as it sounds. Violet meets a few colorful characters, and by colorful I mean lacking personality but are literally colorful. After that, we are treated to a few vignettes that are presented throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nHere's how they go : \\n\\n\r\n--> Problem/Task is introduced.\\n\\n\r\n--> Violet needs to travel and write.\\n\\n\r\n--> Violet takes off her gloves and everyone goes \"OwO what's this?\" \\n\\n\r\n--> She writes something about this problem, which is somewhat related to her experiences in the past through virtue of thematic resemblances. \\n\\n\r\n--> Problem resolves in a way which is either bittersweet or mostly bitter.\\n\\n\r\n--> Someone monologues about something vaguely related to the story. \\n\\n\r\nIronically, these vignettes, barring episode five, are the best narratives of the series. There are two specific highlights. One is a sweet, albeit corny story of a struggling drunk playwright and how Violet reminds him of a lost loved one. The other is a short about an ill mother. Both of these hold a decent, saccharine emotional punch that genuinely is good enough for this series. Unfortunately, Evergarden quickly relapses back into the \"main narrative\" which actually unbearable. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I touch on that, I want to mention that episode five is honestly disturbing. In this vignette, Violet attempts to assist a bratty crybaby princess in writing letters to a prince she's \"in love\" with. This marriage they must engage with is political, clearly, but of course, she is head-over-heels for this guy. She's fourteen. He's twenty-four. The parallels here are beyond clear and they are quite creepy. More so because unlike a lot of anime which does include this kind of cringe-inducing nonsense and more, this series plays itself disarmingly straight with this. You are supposed to believe and connect with the idea of a fourteen-year-old girl being married to a twenty-four-year-old man. But to make matters worse, this princess recalls the first time she met him (and the only time), which prompted her to fall in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nShe was ten. He was twenty. We get treated with an absolutely delicious bone-chilling flashback to when she was alone, crying, and this twenty-year-old man comforts this girl. It wouldn't be creepy if they weren't getting married four years later. The excuse I see here is that this was \"Victorian England so it's fine! It's acceptable to promote child abuse!\" Yeah...no? That isn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nWe aren't making movies about slavery and painting that in a positive light just because \"oh it's a period piece!\" No. It was morally wrong then, it is morally wrong now. I don't enjoy how this series is promoting these issues as if it is some grand romantic statement. Violet goes so far as to say \"Love knows no age.\" Violet. Stop this. Stop it. If the argument here is, \"she's a dumb robot-Esq girl.\" Yeah, she is. But the whole point of writing something this abhorrent is to eventually correct her, not play every following scene as straight and supposedly romantic. Bad choices here. Bad. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Beast... on Further Review]\\n\\n\r\nThis leads us to the main narrative. We never get Violet's origins. The show bothers to explain them in maybe one or two vague lines that don't actually explain why a twelve-year-old on the battlefield is somehow socially acceptable to this decently structured and seemingly morally just society. I mean, I get a general being a cartoonishly inhuman asshole. What I don't get is soldiers not questioning this in any situation. It is downright silly and, due to this, no verisimilitude is created.\\n\\n\r\nIt is as if every piece of detail was forcibly thrust into the animation and presentation, but not the actual writing. Even the minutia begins to slowly fall apart under any critical lens. There is this strange facial-gag that Violet does a few times where she squeezes and pulls at her cheeks and forces this wonky looking smile. It is admittedly cute. It, unfortunately, makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nShe smiles. She smiles a lot in this series at crucial points. She isn't incapable of smiling. Why does she do this? This strange gag was included multiple times and there is no reason for it. It doesn't make sense and this already messy character becomes even messier. A gag isn't worth that pain. Pulling back, though, we get this limp story about almost nothing. Finding the \"meaning of love\" seems to be vague enough if it were given nuance to sprout. Unfortunately, it has been a dry season for nuance for Kyoto Animation's writers it seems. There is not a shred of it to be found. I get that character nuance is kind of a rarity within this medium, but this series gets really abrasive about not having it.\\n\\n\r\nI'm talking flashbacks to remind you of shit you should not be forgetting. Constantly. Constant barrages of flashbacks that utterly decimate the pacing. Everything is completely over-explained, especially the emotions. There are scenes where poor ol' Violet is bawling her eyes out but has the decency of explaining exactly what emotions she's feeling to us. No one else, just us, the viewer, gets a front-row seat for clunky expository dialogue anyone with half a brain can deduce. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Much Ado About Comparisons]\\n\\n\r\nThis season we had two series about girls who have to deal with the loss of a loved one. One being Violet Evergarden and the other being A Place Further Than the Universe. If you asked me, based solely on description and preview, which one of those would thoroughly trounce the other in almost every way? I'd have to go with Evergarden. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't have been more wrong. \\n\\n\r\nWhen this series decides it is a quasi-romance it is a very bad quasi-romance. I've seen some arguments regarding how Violet is supposed to be a \"daughter figure\" to this Gilbert guy, but unfortunately, when the first thing you parallel this relationship to is an underage and really creepy romance, I can't really drop the fact that it feels like a creepy romance. Even if it is thankfully never established explicitly as such. However, there are, as much as it pains me to write, even more flaws here. Firstly, I can't be brought to give a single shred of a fuck about Violet or this Gilbert Grape fellow. His personality is... \"Nice Guy\". While that might resonate with someone who also considers themselves to be a \"Nice Guy\" who wants nothing more than a semi-sentient doll-like girl to issue commands towards. For anyone else, I'm struggling to imagine a scenario where you'd connect with these two characters.\\n\\n\r\nThey have no chemistry. \\n\\n\r\nViolet and Gilbert are at odds as a couple or even as a father/daughter archetype. A father would do all he can not to send his percieved daughter into the midst of multiple battles whilst yelling such lines as \"Follow as she leads!\" Yes. Let us follow this emotionally stunted twelve-year-old during our siege on a castle. Great idea. If the argument here is that he was \"under orders\", then he isn't much of a caring father, is he? That he'd be willing to potentially lose this daughter figure if it meant getting a discharge from the military. Nothing about this felt realistic. I didn't buy these two characters being together and Violet's attachment to him was akin to a lost puppy rather than a loved one.\\n\\n\r\nThe second option here is that she is a marketing choice. Otaku seem to love this kind of character archetype, much to my surprise, and perhaps that is why she was created like this. I, personally, can't imagine someone who would want to marry or get to know this kind of person. Can you imagine how boring she must be on a date? What would you even talk about when she can hardly even speak? Regardless of my pondering on the logistics of waifuism in anime, the ultimate truth here is that her development, whilst unarguably there, is messy as hell. Most of her revelations are kept offscreen and reserved to the multiple time-skips in the narrative from episode-to-episode. She jumps from incompetent writer incapable of even understanding the basic nuance of human emotion to easily writing letters between royalty. It is preposterously paced. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nEvergarden really struggles. Both as a character and a series. There are moments of real highs, especially in two one-off stories that have a nice emotional punch to them. However, every single aspect of the narrative is either wholly underwhelming or utterly ludicrous. There isn't a shred of verisimilitude to be developed and this series often reaches too far for cloying emotional drama. \\n\\n\r\nIf you find yourself connecting with a lot of dramatic anime that usually have bombastic orchestral or J-pop insert-songs suffocating every ounce of dialogue that usually just amounts to girls crying a lot, then you might enjoy this if you look past some of the horrendous pacing. Otherwise, I'd, unfortunately, advise you give this show a skip.If you find yourself interested in the aesthetic, maybe sitting through the first episode is worth it. If you value aesthetic as much as I do it might be worth the entire series in and of itself. It truly is unlike anything else. It is like a tech-demo of the Kyoto Animation Engine at Ultra-settings running on a super-computer. This is how television anime can look. Mindblowing. Even with sub-optimal directing. \\n\\n\r\nThere are themes here. The seasons play a role and plenty of the characters have names that represent different kinds of flowers. It's sweet, really. I think in concept, with a sturdy hand and a sturdier pen it could've worked. These themes don't serve a purpose, though. They shouldn't even be brought up because apart from being frosting on a cake you can point your finger and ogle at, they are ultimately nothing. Scratch the dressing metaphor, they're like those plastic toys atop an expensive cake you'd think were edible but are proven to be nothing but hazards to your three-year-old. \\n\\n\r\nI think the aesthetic does wonders to carry just how upsetting and mundane the rest of the series is. So much so that I'd average it to being a wholly mediocre experience and not an outright bad one. Even if there is a depressingly large amount of crap to sift through, it looks great. It's like a Lamborghini transporting piles of horse manure. Keep your eyes trained on that astoundingly gorgeous ride and maybe you won't smell the shit.\\n",

            "content": "Hype culture has long been a continued series of back and forth. Something gets announced being based off of beloved material or having a gripping initial concept with the right people behind it, it trends in the community, people get excited for it, get into the material and when it finally comes out, fans and haters grab their pom-poms and torches, let their opinion be known, then move on to the next. Rinse and repeat. This happens for movies, TV shows and of course, anime. \r\nFor anime in particular, it seems like those riding the hype trains tend to pretty immediately want them to crash.Of the most popular anime for any particular season, there will always be objectifiers. They get the largest audience. Living up to said hype tends to be seen less likely by people, especially here on MAL where the critical reviews tend to be seen as more helpful. \\n\\n\r\nThis series, Violet Evergarden, in particular had a huge amount of hype, being made by beloved studio Kyoto Animation in the wake of A Silent Voice, promising gorgeous animation, and having a score of 8.9 for several months following a preview of episode 1. Naturally, once the public received episode 1, you got a ton of reviews calling it overrated or bad, saying Evangelion and Utena did concepts better than it, despite just comparing one episode to entire complete series. If you\u2019re going to criticize a poker player, at least wait until they play out their whole hand. THEN it is fair game. Speculation about what it will do turns into what it should have done. Contrarians step in for those sick of the hype cycle\u2019s repetition.\\n\\n\r\nBut now that the dust has settled and yet another hype train reaches its station, how did it turn out? Well, that\u2019s what you have me for. Warning: This will be one of my more controversial reviews.\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is the story of, well, Violet Evergarden. A young (14?) year old girl who spent time in the world\u2019s military, being seen of as a tool as opposed to a person. After a hard battle, she loses both of her arms, and lacking general human feeling, she hears her major, with whom she had been growing close with, say \u201cI love you\u201d, but she does not understand what he meant. After the war is over, she becomes a student-in-training to be an Auto Memories Doll: professionals dedicated to understanding emotion and writing letters to convey the feelings of one person for another. The show then puts its focus on mostly episodic storylines where she does this job for people to help them deal with current problems and becomes more emotional, with but brief snippets of her own past coming in every now and again. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, this refers to two of the show\u2019s biggest problems: \u201cepisodic\u201d and \u201cbrief snippets\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNow, being an episodic show is by no means a bad thing, and even this show doesn\u2019t do a bad job with episodic storytelling. Series like Mononoke, Mushishi, and the original Kino\u2019s Journey all pulled this off quite well. However, in this series, I think it hurts the overall package more than it helps. The only continuous thread amongst these episodes is Violet becoming more emotional overtime, something that, for the most part, feels more or less par the course for these types of stories. Other threads feel sorely lacking. The world doesn\u2019t feel expanded at all, the recurring side cast lacks needed attention, and as episodes go on with dramatic resolution after dramatic resolution, there\u2019s little in the way of progression. That\u2019s not to say all these episodic storylines were bad, as episodes such as the wonderful 5 and 10 show the respective strength and hardship an Auto Memory Doll must face, and several of the other episodes with episodic storylines DO have their moments, just that their impact is really only felt in slight disposition changes of the lead. 5 is also one of the few episodes to do some worldbuilding, showing off a map I wish had more significance. Others work less, but share the similar lack of progress aside from making tugs at the heartstrings of viewers. Some can debate if all these work as intended, but it would be hard to deny how little impact they have on what the show is being as a whole. It eventually does get around to focusing on that aspect, but when it does, it still makes it hard to care both by remaining needlessly vague about the world and the poorly designed enemy force that feels off in their attempted position as a foil to Violet.\\n\\n\r\nIt shares a similar problem to Death Parade: a show that aired three years prior. Focus was put on episodic stories with emotional denouements for basically all of the run, the recurring cast is generally left out to dry, and then by the end when they had to worldbuild and pick up the slack for the leads, it felt like too little too late.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Violet Evergarden feels vast but at the same time, not minimalist enough to pass for a show bouncing in episodic storylines. There\u2019s little in the way of a continuous ethos behind it, contrasting the English influenced outfits, Japanese honor codes, Chinese takeout, and indifference to technology with things like Violet\u2019s arms. Compared to the alternate Europe setting of Amestris in Fullmetal Alchemist, these elements do not blend very well, and it lacks visits to distinctly different areas to contrast. We see a pretty kingdom in Episode 5, which works for that episode, but isn\u2019t expanded upon beyond that, solely seen in a few shots. Most episodes are visits to random houses in nowheresville, and when something is mentioned, like a country dispute in episode 4, it feels like an afterthought for locations without character. Even the Auto Memories Doll concept isn\u2019t really explored to the best of the show\u2019s abilities, being explained in idea but hardly in execution. Referring to The Ancient Magus Bride, which aired alongside it with a consistent fantasy setting and many unique character designs, it just feels lesser. By the end, little about the world impressed me, a failure to provide proper context to the war left me apathetic, and taking on the direction of a grand, sweeping epic, this feels like a sin.\\n\\n\r\nDirection for this show similarly feels put into the wrong places. They got the director of one of Kyo Ani\u2019s most mediocre projects (Beyond the Boundary) on this, and it feels like he fails to......grasp feel? Everything is brought up to larger than life portions all the time, even when it really doesn\u2019t need to be. It\u2019s rare you see a story that has a quiet atmosphere to it. It unabashedly rolls around in heavy drama for the entirety but despite this, holds off the main conflict, Violet\u2019s conflict, like keys on a string. The moments in the world\u2019s military, for a war we don\u2019t know enough about to care for, are little more than, as I said, brief snippets. We don\u2019t know how Violet was recruited, why she was recruited, or see the relationship actually BUILD overtime between Violet and the Major. Instead, we are thrown immediately into Violet\u2019s moment of crisis, not built up to care about her impacts. For a 13 episode show, not nearly enough time is spent on this, as if the director did not understand the limits of his screen time. When the conflict based on the character your show is NAMED AFTER feels like an afterthought, that\u2019s not a very good sign, and it proves the sad prediction that the show would rely on showey emotions rather than relevant information, worldbuilding or continued characterization.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one of the biggest reasons why this show was so hyped up was the animation and presentation. And generally, the animation is wonderful, especially for TV. This continues to prove that Kyoto Animation is one of the best studios out there for visual polish. The designs are all nice and fairly detailed, and the animation when present lets hair (and much more uncommonly clothes!) move in the wind constantly. Wonderful moments like the water touch in Episode 7 happen. Backgrounds, while lacking in variety, also have a nice amount of visual detail and in the case of areas like the castle, are presented well in story boarding. It continues what I call \u201cdelicacy of character\u201d seen in many Kyoto Animation series, where subtle character movements with their hands or other body language do wonders in conveying feelings. Just a shame that\u2018s all covered by overglossness, with a ton of unneeded hair shine and brightness filters washing out the picture in several cases. KyoAni seemed to adapt it with Beyond the Boundary and keep it with series like Sound Euphonium and Phantom World, and I think it blocks out great animation from reaching its fullest potential. It isn\u2019t always a problem, but focusing less on lens and gloss would benefit the series, I believe.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is as well done as you would expect. Episodes have nice songs when required for the emotional climaxes, and the OP \u201cSincerely\u201d, with a hint of melancholy in the wording and tone, works well for the series. It\u2019s not exactly the most inventive, mystical or atmospheric soundtrack I\u2019ve heard, but it is functional and properly suits the show, so I can\u2019t really fault it for bad sound editing. Although I alternated between sub and dub, the dub was generally solid, with Alexis Tipton doing a fairly good job portraying Violet\u2019s slow emotional gain.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m surprised how much about the characters though, feels....missing. At least the main section. The episodic characters all generally range from fine to very nicely handled a notable exception being Iris in Episode 4, whose conflict feels unnecessary and poorly resolved. They come, they have their scenarios to write letters for, sometimes leave an impact then leave for all intents and purposes. Sadly it is often in a way where the viewer will remember the story of the character rather than the character themselves, which might\u2019ve been fine if the show was purely episodic but, again, it\u2019s not.\\n\\n\r\nThe core cast is, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, underdeveloped and poorly explored. Starting with Violet Evergarden herself, her arc of understanding emotion is the one consistent thread throughout the series, and it does that perfectly satisfactorily, but its execution leaves little to really think about. Through the many disconnected experiences, she goes from acting robotic and doing lots of monologuing to being less robotic, more willing to inflict self-harm upon herself but also more resolute and comforting. Fairly straightforward stuff. The lack of proper background leading up to her climax, again, hurts what could have been a stronger arc, but even the execution of this arc itself feels faulted. An early episode has Violet taking a class as an Auto Memories Doll. Because of her lack of understanding, she fails the class. However, because she did some form of connection with a student after the fact, she was allowed to pass anyway. This feels like lazy storytelling. If you fail a class, it should be a sign to actively improve on your own accord, not happen to come across a \u201cget out of jail free card\u201d idea. What we end up with is a character who feels like they exist for one singular purpose, and one purpose alone, with little variation and poor context.\\n\\n\r\nI have a very hard time thinking of any other recurring characters because well, none of them did anything, to the point where I had to look up most of their names prior to writing this review. Blue and Claudia seemed like at first, they would have a central role in helping Violet overcome her struggle and readjust to a post war society, but that idea was quickly forgotten, as were they aside from bit parts. Cattleya, aside from her fanservice appearance, fares similarly, popping in every once in a while, but not really doing anything relevant or having story impact. I will admit that Cattleya and Claudia had nice chemistry, provided it ever got to show. The Major\u2019s brother exists as little more than a scoffing reminder to Violet that the Major existed.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m surprised too! Usually a show gives me a lot more to talk about even in a one cour. And no, being a one cour is no excuse for characterization this lacking, because I can list at least 15 other one-cour series (or first seasons) with more interesting casts than this such as: \\n\r\nBlack Lagoon\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia S1\\n\r\nFate/Zero\\n\r\nMob Psycho 100\\n\r\nBaccano\\n\r\nGa-Rei Zero\\n\r\nAnohana\\n\r\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\\n\r\nMadoka Magica\\n\r\nBakemonogatari\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha\\n\r\nMade in Abyss\\n\r\nYuri on Ice\\n\r\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu\\n\r\nOr even this season\u2019s A Place Further than the Universe. The lack of any plot momentum really hurts the cast as a whole, creating one of the most lacking consistent casts I\u2019ve seen in quite a while for an anime. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nI would hardly say Violet Evergarden never had worthwhile writing. Episodes 5 and 10 have moments I genuinely respect their effort/commitment, and some other of the episodic, standalone episodes had some of the show\u2019s best moments, if pushed a bit heavy on the drama scale. Early on, I was intrigued about the show\u2019s world, Violet\u2019s past, visual variety and what all of the recurring characters would do to make the cast feel whole. However, the series frustrates me in how easily it discarded every big picture element about itself for the sake of grabbing at the feels card. My fear going in is that like Beyond the Boundary and Plastic Memories, it would substitute flash for substance and fill itself with substantively bare writing content to be a flavor of the week \u201cemotional experience\u201d (hell, I think KnK did a better job with character conflicts). To the point where the reliance on too many episodic stories more or less does position itself that way. While I do think the writing is better rounded compared to these two, Violet Evergarden couldn\u2019t decide whether it wanted to be about recuperation of one person in a unique fantasy society, or a study into the effects of society following a war, and it did neither. I expected a show like Fate/Apocrypha to continuously falter from the start, but seeing misused potential in the timeframe that really showed promise in its best moments is more disheartening. It is shows like these that leave hype trains followers with a bad taste. What we\u2019re left with is a series that occasionally gets the job done, but with about as much soul as Violet\u2019s metal arm. It looks shiny, is efficient when it needs to be, and won't do watchers too wrong, but it is hollow on the inside.",

It is a slow burn slice of life that makes up for its lack of narrative complexity with sincere, empathetic drama. \r\nA child soldier for the past four years, Violet Evergarden begins he journey with no place in a world without war. Upon awakening after the war's final battle with extensive injuries and no sign of her commanding officer Gilbert, she is truly in a world where she does not belong. Growing up as a soldier has not prepared her for a normal life. Unable to speakwithout a militant vocabulary and a solute, it became clear the everyday life is not suited to someone with her inclination. Incapable of living with the family she was expected to be adopted into, Violet seeks her only other option. She is taken in by former Lt. Colonel Hodgins, a friend of Gilbert, who now runs a private postal service. Upon her arrival at the office, she becomes intrigued by the branch known as the Auto Memory Dolls. \\n\\n\r\nComprised of young women similar in appearance to Violet, the Auto Memory Dolls transcribe their client's feelings into letters. These women may look similar to Violet in their opulent Victorian attire, however, their capacity to comprehend emotion far exceeds that of our protagonist. This understanding and Violet\u2019s metal arms divide them; a blunt metaphor for her robotic personality. The career of transcribing letters is entirely unfitting for someone who cannot express emotion. However, what Violet lacks in expression she makes up for in audacity. With the desire to understand the words \u201cI love you,\u201d said to her by Gilbert before they lost connection, she undertakes the endeavor of becoming an Auto Memory Doll. \\n\\n\r\nViolet\u2019s struggle is frustrating at first, but intentionally so. Affected by an undiagnosed mental disability, simply learning how to transcribe a single letter becomes her first great challenge. Her abrasively blunt personality leaves clients dumbfounded at best but furious at worst, occasionally creating understated comedic situations but also displaying how she can barely function in society. The fluid setting reminds us that this could be anyone's story, from any time. During the anachronistic time period this story takes place in, mental disabilities are undiscovered, and thus she is misunderstood by those around her. We as the viewers also misunderstood her, angered by her robotic demeanor. Not only is she isolated from the world she inhabits, but also from those of us who observe her story. This perspective on her character is what made me invested in her arc right away. Her visible turmoil motivated me to be patient with her, to give her the chance to grow at her own pace rather than one designated by us as unsympathetic onlookers. At any chance he gets, the director reminds us we must follow at Violet's pace. We're drawn into her mindset with the dense atmosphere and an abundance of metaphors to not feel put off from the initial slow starting speed.\\n\\n\r\nThe most potent example of visual metaphors in the early episodes are the vast negative spaces Violet is framed in; extenuating her loneliness even more. Complimented further by the atmosphere; brought to life through the excellent use of lighting, shadows, and layered colors giving the world a painterly appearance. At first, this dejected tone is what caused people to become alienated from the series.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden has a purpose beyond the detailed environments and impressive lighting, there is more to it than one may initially ascertain. Stemming from the core theme of emotions are vignettes; a single story for each episode after the first two which introduce the setting and Violet\u2019s life circumstance. The first of this episodic structure follows Violet taking classes to become a qualified Auto Memory Doll. Beyond her trained talent at calculated work, she falls short of the rest of her class in expression. In a surprising display, the series dives into social commentary for the first of many times to depict it\u2019s message while also connecting with us. Violet\u2019s teacher does not accommodate her mental disability, forcing a friend to step in and help her to pass school with an unusual teaching method. A reminder to us, the viewers, that it\u2019s hard for some people to communicate their emotions, some of us may need different means. \\n\\n\r\nA gripping realization that the world does not make it easy for us to communicate exactly how we feel. From this story of learning onward, we would come to see Violet gain more understanding of connection. Through the many clients she writes for, she grows gradually from robotic to self-aware. Through helping others, and in turn herself, she becomes a character embodying purely peace rather than the horrors that formed her life. Seeing Violet\u2019s life through the perspective of a young woman isolated, misunderstood, and struggling to conform to a society that has no place for her, forms a visible arc through the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThrough simply observing different connections like familial love, romance, friendships, and more, the puzzle pieces of human emotion fall into place in her mind. This enlightenment comes quietly and gradually, but one of the most satisfying character arcs I have witnessed. In the beginning, she is a tool for the army to mercilessly slaughter their foes, in the end, a bringer of love and prosperity with her letters. Like how the flower grows from bud into full bloom, she grows to be suited to the name Violet. \\n\\n\r\nThe clients she writes for have drastically more emotional lives than her, further highlighting how lacking Violet is. Over time, her demeanor rises to approach those of her clients in emotion. A change most visible in the way she speaks; bluntly never mincing words at the start and becoming subtler and more understanding of how others feel by the end. A series so drama focused as this was inevitably accused of being melodramatic, and this is a fair criticism. If you are only absorbing drama rather than the rich analysis, your experience with the series may become tiresome. For me, this was never a hurdle to overcome, because I never struggled to want to analyze the trail laid out for us while devouring the drama at its most impactful moments.\\n\\n\r\nNone of this would be possible without compelling characters, but thankfully there are plenty in this series. Each with a complex freely moving character design, being in varying stages of life, and of course, a problem in need of Violet\u2019s elegant emotion transcribing. The many different characters are woven together in the same quilt, each with a dramatic life experience forming their personality. A personality that is satisfyingly deconstructed when Violet enters their lives. Seeing the various side characters have their inner turmoils put on display then examined by Violet\u2019s blunt manner of speaking is incredibly cathartic. Her straightforward criticisms or encouragements of her client's personalities, unfiltered by concern for their reaction, create many satisfying moments of self-realization. Of the many characters, the protagonist receives the most development. Her inner turmoil is enrapturing. Grappling with her bloodstained past and peaceful present, switching between gory flashback and elegant transcribing within the span of a single episode. Once we finally understand what experiences crafted her robotic persona, it is supremely satisfying after all of the misunderstandings she has endured. Viewing the series week by week only enhanced this more; the hate fired at Violet finally turning into understanding added more impact to these final episodes of realization.\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes wrought the most cathartic moments sheerly through the long period of time it takes to build up. Her new life of peace is constantly haunted by the horrific deeds she committed in the past, without knowing how cruel she was until becoming an emotional comprehensive Auto Memory Doll. At many points throughout the series, she questions if she truly deserves to be writing letters of love rather than killing; even considering suicide in one of the most heartwrenching scenes of the series. Near the end of the show, her self-doubt takes the shape of a full episode flashback as well as others dispersed near the climax. The flashbacks showcase the base version of Violet, a pure killing machine who only takes orders. Booming explosions resound, overpowering any spoken words, pure chaos of fire and blood a perfect metaphor for the silencing of understanding the war causes. At the center of the cacophony lies Violet, like an angel dragged from heaven onto the hellish battlefield, wielded for evil by the morally bankrupt military. \\n\\n\r\nThrough these harsh moments, we learn who she really was at the very lowest point of her arc, emboldening the journey she has taken by now. This understanding we and Violet gain gradually is brought into the letter writing vignettes, making them even more emotional. Most notably the tenth episode\u2019s story is effective for its placement in the story and creating a powerful display of emotion that anyone could relate to. It presents the audience the routine vignette setup, a person suffering from an unclear turmoil is in need of Violet\u2019s work, but this story is more effective thanks to its placement at an advanced stage in her arc. The story presented is admittedly simple and predictable, but what mattered was Violet\u2019s new minor mannerisms that cued us in on the fact that she definitely understood her client\u2019s situation much more. She could use subtlety with them, and we could pick up on how, but most rewardingly we could pinpoint where in her arc she gained those minor mannerisms. In the tenth episode, rather than being unable to express much emotion. She visibly buries her feelings for the tragic scenario she had to assist with, only gaining reprieve when the job is over. And I\u2019ll admit, I wept just as she did. \\n\\n\r\nMany viewers will not have such a wonderful experience, especially if the dreamlike pacing and ethereal storytelling are not to their liking. For a narrative as wispy as Violet Evergarden\u2019s, you may find yourself tying it down with criticisms of lacking writing. This is simply the atmosphere of the show, flowing like a stream rather than a rapid. Unafraid of the slow pace necessary to convey the quiet emotions of its lead. Accompanied by soft orchestral music, perfectly parallel to the direction of the story. Every moment in this series is with purpose, nothing is lacking meaning, but of course whether you appreciate this meaning is up to you. The story highlights only moments necessary for conveying an emotional connection. Forming a vision of a character, typically archetypal seeing as they\u2019re typically only present for an episode, then crafting a vague image of their circumstance to which warrants a letter, then the execution.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the recipient reading the letter Violet transcribed comes a deeply resonant display of emotion in many of the episodes. The impact only increases as Violet expands her abilities from her initial one-sentence letter to the inevitably most complex expression of emotion in the finale. The music rises to ensure the moment hits with as much impact as possible. With an equally melancholic ending theme to carry the feeling through the credits, sung with a subdued voice similar to the lead's accompanied by a slow piano to not overpower the vocals. \\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden has some of the best visuals in an anime series to date, moreover, it deserves praise for is the power it has to convey empathy. Not simply a surface level emotion, striking a connection with the audience. Constantly conveying a universally necessary message, the value of understanding each other.",

What intrigue existed in episode 1 with Major Gilbert and Violet's roll in the war has been pushed too far into the background and feels like it won't be revealed for far too long, and in it's place we are forced to sit through some of the slowest, uninteresting character progression I've seen in a while.\r\nI wanted to like thisseries, but it's putting me to sleep. It's sad that such pretty visuals are being wasted on such a bland and excruciatingly slow paced story.",

            "content": "Okay, I've seen so much criticism befall this anime so I'm going to try and be as thorough as possible with this review. I won't include spoilers, however, and will try not to mention any major events which happen through the anime so bear with me if I sound a little vague.\r\nStory\r\nPardon me, but this anime is a bitch. It basically aims in any way possible to trigger those tears of yours. It's probably one of the few anime which made me cry this much that I can only think of another one. Just prepare your tissues and be ready because there is a highprobability that the onion ninjas will be paying you a visit.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the criticism I've mentioned earlier. There has been so much hate going around over this anime and from what I've seen I think most of it for the story being \"too linear\" . Yes, it's not like the usual anime you'd see most of the time, but it's all a matter of perspective really. I'll advice you beforehand; try and view it as a play and not an anime and you'll find yourself being immersed into it.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note though is that the beginning of the story is nothing like what's yet to come. The first three episodes, especially, are a prelude to the anime itself and emphasize on Violet's character and describing the setting in an orderly manner. Perhaps too orderly that you'd feel quite bored at times. Because of that, I thought that all this anime was is just some quality art and breathtaking scenery, but trust me that this is far too presumptuous so at least give it five episodes before you decide to continue with it or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story looks like England in the 80s, but the names of the countries, cities and even the language are all fictional to my knowledge. Since there is plenty of focus on the state of war the countries have gone through and what those wars have caused, the creators might have chosen not to mention anything that would bring up hard feelings into the story which is a wise decision if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so now that pretty much sums up the subtle details of the story and its general idea. Now for the story itself, Violet Evergarden is a girl of about 14 *cough*underage*cough*. Back in her childhood with no parents, name or feelings she was viewed by almost everyone around her as a killing tool or a loli weapon of mass destruction who knew nothing except how to kill. She didn't even know how to speak, but all of this changed once Gilbert took her in as a gift from his brother. From that point on she was intended to be Gilbert's weapon to be utilized in army as a weapon as usual. However, Gilbert disagrees greatly with this and chooses to treat her as a proper human being. He raised her, taught her, took care of her and eventually loved her. (\u309c\u30ed\u309c)\\n\r\nWhat happens is that Violet is currently trying to understand emotions; love to be specific. As the major in his last breaths' confesses his love to her, but Violet couldn't understand what his words meant. Thus, begins Violet's beautiful journey to pursue pure emotions and convey them to people as she starts to understand them herself as well.\\n\r\nLet me tell you this, she's going to be exploring emotions alright and you'll be exploring emotions just as much so don't forget those tissues of yours. You have been warned!\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nHoHoHo do I even need mention a thing here? The reason of all the hype before this anime came out is because of its art style. An artist's wet dream would be an understatement to its beauty. Just watch the trailer to get a solid idea of what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery are extra bright and the characters are very well-polished from tip to toe. Just look at their beautiful eyes when they're not full of tears! The usage of the art style varies by episode. There are some where you'll be awestruck by the beauty and others where you won't be as much. The characters' style isn't the main beauty of this anime, but they surely look beautiful and original and I think the latter is what matters the most.\\n\r\nThe scenery, however, will have you drooling waterfalls, which is another good reason for the tissues by the way, so unless you don't like those bright colors and overly detailed scenery, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development\\n\r\nI think most of what I'd say here would be redundant. Violet is probably the only character who has significant amount of development while the others don't even have that much screen time to begin with. The anime is split into two arcs, the main one where Violet faces her traumatizing history and all that she's been through and the secondary arc which is episodic to the characters Violet encounters through her journey. The secondary arc is a thousandfold more emotional than the main one and has plenty more of character development included, but that's to characters who'll only last for one episode so I'm not sure you can really call that \"development\". Nonetheless, their characters undergo drastic self-speculation which overflow with emotions so, if you ask me, I find it impressive how much they managed to fit into a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThis is such a vital part of this anime and I don't think it I could have appreciated the beauty of it without this beautiful soundtrack. Think of it as the adhesive which connects everything into the big picture. It's almost entirely on the classical side, which I'm fond of, so you might not like it if you hate classical music, but honestly, who does?\\n\r\nThe characters' voices are pretty good as well. I liked some more than others, but everyone fit his character and played it well. You can clearly tell the VAs were immersed in their roles and paid very close attention to the details. My favorite one was introduced in the last episode though, so I can't really say who she is without spoiling too much. If you do choose to view this anime as a play and let yourself immerse into it you'll certainly know who she is, though.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment\\n\r\nDespite the shed tears, spilled blood and fatal wounds, I can with all honesty tell you that this anime was indeed enjoyable. You'll probably need some light series to recover after you're done with it, but you won't regret a single moment and are sure to appreciate its beauty. It's certainly a piece of art you'll enjoy watching and an experience you'll cherish.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this if: You have high tolerance to onions, You're looking for breathtaking animation, You like Slice of Life, You want an anime presented in a new perspective.\\n\r\nDon't watch this if: You're not into drama(VERY DRAMATIC), You don't like slow-paced story lines, You're looking for action(Really mild here), You don't have tissues.",

            "content": "Oh, Violet Evergarden. Like a royal princess, your arrival was highly anticipated by the community. And just like a royal princess, many speculated over how beautiful and amazing you would be before you even saw the light of day, and others just waited to see you to be born and fail. And then when you were born and grow up, many still claimed you to be the most beautiful and fascinating princess ever born, some were disappointed that you didn\u00b4t manage to live up to their expectations, and some disliked you instantly because you were you. Where ever which category you belong to, one cansay for certain that Violet Evergarden took her place in the spotlight this past season. Usually I\u2019m not a royalist, but in my eyes Violet Evergarden (VE) were a fine princess, and definitely lived up to my expectations and more, both visually and substantively. So, let\u00b4s talk about the winter 2018\u00b4s most anticipated show, and why I thought it so good as I did.\\n\\n\r\nSlow paced dramas are not usually what I go for, they often bore me to death before going anywhere, but I got a positive feeling as soon as I read the synopsis and saw the PV for VE. And I was not disappointed, quite the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nVE takes place in a post-war, 1920\u00b4s Europe like continent, where the north and south just reached a fragile peace. It\u00b4s a time of healing and rebuilding, which leaves the young teenager Violet Evergarden at a loss. Probably orphaned or abounded at a very young age, Violet were brought up as a child soldier. On the battle field under Major Gilbert Bougainvillea\u00b4s command, Violet became infamous for her brutal and cold efficiency by taking countless lives without batting an eyelash. Now with the war ended, and no more orders to for fill, Violet\u00b4s hardest test begins. The very last battle left Violet without arms, which was replaced with some crafty automail. That\u00b4s not really the issue though, but rather the acclimatization to be a normal person, with a normal life. All her life Violet had just known violence and orders, so to say that she\u00b4s socially awkward doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it. The main theme of the show is Violet\u00b4s journey to understand her own and other\u00b4s emotions, especially what \u201cI love you\u201d means. She learns from others by working as an Auto-Memory Doll, which composes letters for others in their stead. It\u00b4s not like Violet doesn\u00b4t have feelings and emotions, she\u00b4s just very disconnected from them, and doesn\u00b4t know what they mean when she does feel them. I thought her journey was beautiful to watch, as she slowly experiences what it means to have different feelings, and how to express them. I think they tie up Violet\u00b4s past and future very smoothly throughout the show. The main part of the show is of an episodic nature, each in which Violet takes on requests at writing a letter for someone, and both Violet and that someone have an emotional exchange, often of the teary type. And just when you think that its all you are going to get, the show does something different towards the end, which in my eyes popped up the score one more notch. \\n\\n\r\nIs Violet Evergarden the most fascinating character ever made? Probably not, but I liked her a lot. Her blank persona, her robotic way of speaking is nothing ground breaking, but I liked how they slowly developed her without taking away that personality. Violet do look like the most beautiful doll, which together with that personality can be over the top and annoy people. I personally think it worked with the setting and all over story development, since the profession as dolls take a centre part. Violet\u00b4s inability to understand people\u00b4s emotions in the beginning forces her clients and colleagues to really explain their feelings and why they feel them, which forces them to grow as much as Violet at each encounter. I think that worked as a great red thread for the story, and made it more than just one-sided, which could easily happen when a story focuses so much on just one character. As for the other characters, they vary in importance and appeal, but overall, they fill out the story good. Some are more entertaining or interesting than others, such as Hodgins and the Bougainvillea brothers. They heavily influence Violet, as well as being interesting on their own. I can fully understand the ones who complain about the side characters, because VE is a one woman show, which is noticeable. So, if you\u00b4re not into Violet\u00b4s character, VE is probably not going to be an enjoyable experience for you.\\n\\n\r\nNo one in their right mind can say that VE looks nothing but stunning. And if some do say so, they just say that out of spite. Wherever you liked the story and characters or not, the visuals are colourful, detailed and beautiful from the beginning to the end. Kyoto Animation and Netflix has hold nothing back and shows how anime can look 2018. Everything from a bird\u00b4s view of a green hilled landscape, bathing in the orange light from the afternoon sun, to a view of a still autumn lake, sparkling with the sun\u00b4s rays and brown and yellow leaves, looked absolutely breath-taking. If you want to, you can positively drown in the characters eyes, as well made and pronounced as they are. In the rare occasions action do occur, its well-choregraphed, animated and left me with wishing for more. Could probably write a book about how good everything looks but let\u2019s just stop here. So, to summon up the art and animations part up - Top score, overly pleased, I want to bath in those colours.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is well composed and harmonic, with beautiful instruments which creates a calm and emotional atmosphere. Which in my opinion runs very well with the storyline and Violet\u00b4s journey. The VA\u00b4s (Japanese) do an amazing job of portraying their characters, big as small roles. Yui Ishikawa voices Violet and does a brilliant job of conveying Violet\u00b4s damaged character. Sound effects is spot on, from the klicks of tangents, the gust of wind, to the sound of an air plane closing in in the sky. Once again, bravo.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely understand that VE isn\u00b4t for everyone, but it is certainly for most. Like all princesses, VE can\u00b4t be loved by everyone, but boy does she shine like star. I enjoyed this show far more than I expected, teared up multiple times, and were fully invested in Violet\u00b4s emotional journey. I liked that they didn\u00b4t just displayed the positive side of feeling emotions, but what pain that can cause also. The shift in direction towards the end was a brilliant move and leaving me with the want for more. So, thank you Violet Evergarden, for showing me both such inner and outer beauty. \\n",

            "content": "It's hard not to dive into such a show without any expectations. I usually come into shows completely blank, barely even reading the synopsis, but even I couldn't help sneaking a peak at the trailer. And when the studio put so much work in the animation, surely they would create a story to match, right?\r\nNope.\r\nThe main character, Violet, is the most bland person I have ever seen in an anime. Her design in memorable but if you ask me about her personality? Can't tell you a thing. In fact that's all I can tell you about her, because there is nothing really to say.\r\nThe supportingcharacters have more personality than Violet, but that's not really saying much. The moment you hear a character speak for the first time you will already know everything about them there is to know. They also treat Violet like a kid while acting like children themselves. It's painful to watch, especially when the show wants you to take the drama seriously.\\n\\n\r\nI guess there's also a story in there somewhere, but I was busy counting missed opportunities. There were a few instances where Violet faced some hurdles she needed to overcome, but instead of her actually working for it, making the viewer want to root for her success, and her growing as a character as a result, she is given a pass on a silver platter, thus letting her remain as bland as possible and me unable to give a fuck.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's not a bad show, just a generic pretty looking anime. If you're ok with that, you'll probably enjoy this series a lot, if you want something more however, this will only be a huge disappointment.",

            "content": "Leiden, Leidenschaftlich\r\nApril 4th, 2018\r\nDear Reader,\r\nI hope this letter finds you well. Much time has passed since our last correspondence and I humbly apologize for going silent this long. However, rest assured your patience has not been wasted. I am now able to relay to you, in full, my truest insights and reflections of Violet\u2019s journey as I have experienced it. And in doing so, I believe you will be swayed enough to bear witness, yourself.\r\nVisually, first impressions of Violet were quite favorable. She sported a slender face, flowing blonde hair, azure eyes, and a quiet disposition. Many would compare her toan idealized version of a dress-up doll. But as you know, first impressions can be deceiving. Upon listening to her speak, I and those around her quickly realized the doll analogy was even more appropriate. Despite her fair outer appearance, she was a shell of a person: cold and unexpressive. Her emotional development up until this point had been terribly suppressed from years of brutality and armed conflict as a weapon. Allowing herself to feel was a sign of weakness and that left her potentially vulnerable during the war.\\n\\n\r\nBut in these newfound times of peace, with no battlefield to return to, Violet became a lost puppy desperately seeking out new orders from her Major, Gilbert Bougainvillea, to validate her existence. Thankfully, Colonel Hodgins was there to pick up the pieces and guide her towards a brighter future. Without him as a guardian, I daresay, she may have been caged emotionally for the rest of her life. Under the employ of his CH Postal Company, it is from here that Violet embarks on an emotional odyssey, the likes of which were an absolute pleasure to observe.\\n\\n\r\nWorking as an Auto Memoir Doll, Violet struggled, in the beginning, to transcribe her clients' feelings onto paper. Her letters more akin to combat reports, consisting of direct and machinelike replies. While she was quick to acquire mechanical typing skills, her ability to sympathize and be sincere were lacking. Realizing an ineptness to do her job, she goes to her senior colleagues, Erica and Iris, for help. They too had trouble finding ways to relate to Violet at first. Nonetheless, as time passed and they shared their issues in becoming dependable Dolls themselves, the two become friends with Violet and gradually she opens up to them about her pursuit to learn what the Major meant when he told her \u201cI love you.\u201d At this juncture, she does not possess the emotional shelving necessary to support a feeling as significant and complex as love.\\n\\n\r\nFurther along, Violet begins to build a foundation for understanding the different forms love can take and improving her skills as a Doll. Sibling love, a mother\u2019s love, a father\u2019s love, a friend\u2019s love, fated love, first love, unrequited love, blind love. With each new client interaction, Violet explores these feelings of love and unlocks another part of her emotions she previously kept sealed away. A few of these vignettes were awfully heart wrenching. In particular, the stories of Oscar, the playwright, who loses his only daughter, and Anne, a bluntly honest child whose mother is bedridden, had a profound emotional impact on me. I was reduced to a sobbing mess, even. Seeing Violet smile and cry for her clients, it is impossible not to empathize with their situations. \\n\\n\r\nAs her travels wind down, Violet gets to a point where she is able to recognize what her emotional state means as it connects to a more abstract understanding of what it means to feel. When Hodgins eventually reveals Major Gilbert\u2019s fate, she feels genuine anger and betrayal. In shattering her belief that the Major would one day return, a large part of her identity is lost. The scars of her past come back to burn her up inside now that she can contextualize her role in the war. Survivor\u2019s guilt, self-loathing, and grief plague her conscience to the point where she regrets ever having regained emotions.\\n\\n\r\nViolet\u2019s pain and suffering cause her to believe it\u2019s wrong for her to continue living. This leads to a climax where she speaks with Hodgins who forces her to confront the fact that just like the lives she has destroyed, the lives she has enriched cannot be undone. A difficult truth for anyone to face but it allows her to finally accept the reality. Despite still not fully grasping the Major\u2019s love for her, she understands his intent and finds the will to carry out his final orders to live for herself. Ghostwriting as an Auto Memoir Doll becomes her purpose and though the Major may not be alive, he lives on in her heart. \\n\\n\r\nPresently, Violet is one of the top Dolls in Leiden. There are constant requests for her to ghostwrite letters from people all over the country. While physical beauty does not beget an inner beauty, I can assure you that her emotional maturity has outshined any outward charm she possessed at the outset. She has become a wonderful, caring, young lady and I personally cannot wait to see what her future holds in store.\\n\\n\r\nBest Regards,\\n\\n\\n\r\nActivelee,\\n\r\nYour Comrade-in-arms\\n\\n\r\nIn appreciation of KyoAni\u2019s uniquely beautiful and detailed series, I chose to write this review in the style of a letter to prospective audiences. I wanted to have some fun and to give this a slight tinge of realism. I chose to focus solely on Violet and her character growth because a letter discussing sound and animation felt disjointed. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the art and music are both deserving of extreme praise. I feel they\u2019re best experienced for yourself, though. The show was not without its flaws but my gripes with the slow pacing, undeveloped side characters, and awkward action sequences didn't fit the letter either. Finally, it\u2019s important to note that this is all from the perspective of someone with no prior knowledge of the light novel series or its plot. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed reading this. :)\\n",

In episode 5 finally we get a \"sneakpeek\" of a very interesting background image of the main character and a most likely interesting future story (war based) . I won't vote the story yet because we don't know much of the series yet. Art and Sound are just incredible made especially the art is amazingly done. The characters are still not that amazing because I feel like we get some side character stories that we will never see again... but at least they dohelp violet to develop as a main character ( I think that's the purpose of those characters) . As for the rest of the \"main\" cast we havn't really got that much off them except maybe from 1-2. It's still early though. As an overall I would give it a 9 for now but none can have a complete opinnion if we don't get to see the whole season!!\\n\\n\r\nStory: ?

            "content": "The battlefield.\r\nLoud, deafening explosions numbing the senses. Rapid, unsteady breaths being taken by the soldier as they prepare for combat. With shaky hands they grasp their weapon tightly and launch themselves into battle. They quell the urge to run and steel themselves, for they know its either kill or be killed. The chaos of war and many a hectic skirmish have dulled their emotions and rendered them no more then a machine merely following orders until the bitter end. If by chance they are blessed with survival after the fighting has subsided, some troopers find themselves unable to regain their lost feelings even after returningto their peaceful lives at home. So even if they return alive and victorious, a part of their humanity died on the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nFor the soldier Violet Evergarden, she seemed to never have any emotions to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nMolded from the beginning to be nothing more than a weapon for war, Violet finds herself at a loss when the fighting ends and she is forced to assimilate with society. After starting her life anew, Violet discovers that there is much about the world that she doesn\u2019t understand. The most puzzling thing to her however are the final words she heard from Major Gilbert, her commanding officer: \\n\\n\r\n\u201cI love you.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nHaving no knowledge of anything outside of the battlefield and being unable to contact Gilbert, Violet embarks on a journey to discover the meaning of these three words, all while gaining valuable insights on life from those around her. And through these interactions, Violet unconsciously helps her companions develop as people as well. This is a story about a girl who gradually learns what it means to be truly human. \\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden has an appealing premise with beautiful visuals and sound to back it up, but is it able to deliver? Well, that depends entirely on whether or not you\u2019re able connect emotionally with the characters and plot of the anime. Now the show is designed in a way that tries really hard to tug at the heartstrings of its audience with each passing episode. However, Violet Evergarden isn\u2019t just a collection of shallow dramatic moments that have no meaning when thoroughly examined. Otherwise it would ultimately fail as an anime. Instead, the show attempts to bring the cast to life by illuminating their qualities through a variety of ways, such as providing viewers with their backstories or showcasing their beliefs and vulnerabilities. Finally, the anime puts these characters in a situation where they are able to interact with Violet, thus allowing for both Violet and the rest of the cast to help each other develop as people. This characterization is important, because without it, why would anyone watching care about the struggles that the characters face? However, even with this characterization, many of the supporting cast barely have any screen time, so despite receiving some growth, most of the time it wasn\u2019t enough for me personally to really feel for the characters. So then why did I find the anime\u2019s presentation to be successful? Simple. \\n\\n\r\nIt was because of the girl named Violet Evergarden.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the titular character, it would be odd for Violet not to be the best member or the cast. But her presence went beyond that. As I mentioned before, the troubles faced by the supporting cast really didn\u2019t affect me on an emotional level because although the anime desperately tried to paint them as tragic characters who viewers should feel sorry for, there just simply wasn\u2019t enough material on them for this to work in my opinion. What really touched me though was how Violet was affected by her interactions with these characters and how she was able to help change their lives for the better. In order to explain why this works for me, I\u2019ll provide some insight on Violet\u2019s character. First off, she seems to start out with no personality. Violet is, to put it bluntly, just like a machine in the eyes of others. Yet there is far more to her than initially meets the eye. Her journey begins when she decides to work for a former superior officer as an auto memory doll, which is basically someone who takes people\u2019s words and feelings and uses them to write letters to others.\\n\\n\r\nNow one of the issues that I personally had with the anime was its slow start. The first several episodes came across to me as quite slow, and I admittedly was initially bored with the whole Violet becomes an auto memory doll arc and was wishing that the anime would have instead showcased more of the war that Violet participated in. After completing the anime, I can now definitely say that my impatience was uncalled for and the direction that the anime took was superior to my own vision. This is because the beginning episodes were vital in showing Violet\u2019s determination to discover her humanity and how she believed that her work as an auto memory doll would be the most effective way to accomplish her goal. We see her consecutively try and seemingly fail to comprehend the complex nature of human feelings. But she never gives up. And throughout her journey, she gradually picks up bits and pieces from those around her about how to understand emotions, and Violet eventually blossoms into a truly beautiful person.\\n\\n\r\nThe pinnacle of the anime for me would have to be the flashback episodes covering the war. Their placement near the end of the anime as opposed to the beginning like I initially wanted was a good choice. That way, viewers got to first go on a journey with Violet during the previous episodes and start to connect with her as a person. Then, when she finds out what happened to Gilbert and we get to see her past with him, we feel for her and can really see how far Violet has come as a character. For right before the flashback, Violet is shown to be feeling genuine regret for all of the lives she took during the war. Because through writing and delivering letters conveying emotions from one person to another, Violet realizes that those whom she killed will never be able to share feelings with their loved ones again. It seems like she has come far from her initial emotionless state. But honestly, I feel like these scenes, especially the one in the flashback where Gilbert reveals his love for Violet, show that she has always had feelings. I don\u2019t believe that Violet was an empty husk who learned how to be human through her experiences, but rather a lost and confused girl who merely didn\u2019t know what emotions were. Violet always apologized to her companions whenever she was unable to understand what they were feeling and attributed it to her lack of humanity, yet, no matter how subtle, she always expresses emotions of her own. Whether it be feeling bad for a friend or crying over someone else\u2019s misfortune, the anime always showcases Violet feeling for others. Even if she doesn\u2019t understand them, she has always carried these emotions within her. For Violet is not a doll, but a living, breathing human being. And deep down, she has probably always known what love is. Because its the way that she has always felt about Major Gilbert.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden was an experience. While it may have overplayed the drama card, it still had many genuinely investing moments. Violet was a lovely character, and watching her develop as a person was truly heartwarming. Now some might think that the show is sappy, and others may feel like they can\u2019t connect with the protagonist. For me personally however, I was immediately drawn in by the breathtaking visuals, and the touching plot and immense growth of Violet kept me happily watching until the very end.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER\r\nViolet Evergarden, another anime of the popular studio KyoAni. Let's start. \r\nThe anime occurs after a war. Our MC is called Violet, a blond girl with prosthetic arms. She is working as a Doll (a woman that writes letters) because she needs to know the meaning of 'I love you'. Then, she will know many people in her journey. A nice story awaits us. What could go wrong? Everything! \r\nThe story. Most of the anime is episodic (3-8 and 10-11). The ploblem is that the writing is very bad and repetitive. No matter how good the production quality or the soundrack is,the writing is more important. If the writing IS bad, the anime IS bad. Every episode is just some forgettable, artificial and generic melodrama that tries so hard to be tragic/sad rather than telling a good story. Reasons: 1) I don't care about a character that i just recently met. 2) Every episode have the same repetitive formula: Violet showing her prosthetic  arms \u2192 the side character is surprised  \u2192 Violet writing the letter and the drama starts. 3) Many of that side character have no personality besides of being just plot devices. I'm going to explain this much latter. 4) Many episodes are a just wasted of time that barely affect Violet. That's not 'character development'. The anime relies too much on tragic backstories to the point of being unrealistic. Also the story is pointless when suddenly changes to a poorly explained war story. Finally, the show seems addicted to start with the stories of the side characters instead of giving more backstory to our MC first.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character. Violet is a cute, innocent and stoic girl, i cannot deny that. But that the only decent traits of her. The anime tries everytime to make her look perfect for the sake of the plot. The most clear example is in the third episode when Violet goes to the school to be a Doll. She doesn't pass the course yet she pass after write some letters. Violet could accept his mistakes and later do the course again. It's too convenient. Another trait is that she is a killing machine super soldier. She can -for unexplained reasons- kill many trained soldiers easily. How she can do that? We never know. The prosthetic arms have no purpose in the story besides being pure shock factor -the way of how she gotten them is not explained-. I supposed that she can kill many people because of that arms but the flashbacks say otherwise. His character development is almost nonexistent, even after she learns the truth about Gilbert. The worst part is how she loses both arms doesn't really make sense. First, did she feel pain after losing both arms? A normal person never could carry someone after that inmense pain. Second, didn't she passed out of blood loss? And finally, the enemies only shoot them one time before being killed by Violet and Gilbert, rather than shooting many bullets in the first place. If the they're smart, Violet and Gilbert will be killed in seconds. Another similar scene ocurrs in the episode 12: the train hijacking. A unarmed Violet -she doesn't want to defend herself despite that she can be killed by armed guys- defeats many armed soldiers. Many of them are armed yet nobody shoots until is too late. Why didn't they just shoot Violet on top of the train? That not making any sense.......Finally, the anime poorly explain the origin of Violet. She is just a Mary Sue.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bougainvillea brothers. Gilbert is an army major and the love interest/father figure of Violet. The anime doesn't make it clear. We only known of him is that he is nice and a good person to Violet. He is nice guy anything else?. And then, Dietfried, the opposite of Gilbert. He is mean, rude and hate Violet. Also, he is the man who found her. His only trait is being a dick to Violet because she killed his subordinates -the context was never explained- and blames her for the death of Gilbert -something that makes no sense-. That is a bad plot idea to keep it relevent. The worst part is that the anime attempts to paint him as an angsty asshole in every scene rather than giving him decent traits. \\n\\n\r\nThe CH Postal Company where Violet and other two Dolls works have some characters. The most interesting are Benedict and Cattleya. I like their chemistry and was one of the few decent moments in the entire show besides the animation. Sadly, they have limited screen time. It's feels like a wasted potential. Now, the other side characters that receive tons of screen time -in their episode- are merely plot devices or are poorly written. A random example from episode 6 with the character of Leon. He had discontent for Dolls, yet he was immediately enamored by Violet as soon as he laid eyes on her. Their only purpuse of is existence is to remind you that they are tragic people and nothing more. The animes fails to present a light-hearted story and gets repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nMrs. Evergarden is the worst side character in the entire show. The first episode give us to understand more interactions with her foster daughter. Too bad. She disappears for 7 episodes and returns to explain a plot point and then disappears again. What is the point of her character?   \\n\\n\r\nThe villains from the last three episodes are just your typical bad guys. That was clear when one of them wants to torture a side character and in another episode he is giving us a evil smile to reminds us that he is bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundrack is decent in most parts, sometimes is forgettable anyway.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, looking beyond the extremely good production (best of the season), interesting soundtrack, and amazing backdrops, there\u2019s just not much there.  \\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10 Bad written, emotionally manipulative, poorly paced and pointless. A lot of plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8.5/10 Very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 Passable soundrack, decent voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1.5/10 Generic, bad written, little to no development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3.5/10 Boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Not because of disparity or the scores, but because of the most stupid rule that has invaded the world of anime - the rule of three episodes. The idea that you can judge an anime series after just a handful of episodes is stupid and childish, born out of the idea that \"ain't nobody has time for this\". Tell me, if you don't have the time to watch anime, why do you even bother reviewing it?\r\nThe main aspect for which Violet Evergarden is being criticised is the story and main character. Judging these things after but3-4 episodes is unfair in this case. We start the story basically in the middle of the life of Violet, an emotionless girl about whom we know only that she has been in the war that ended not long before the show starts telling us the story. Often criticised elements here are the lack of backstory and a cold and empty vessel that Violet seems to be. We don't get the full story of what happened to Violet until about episode 8-9... wile up to this point the main character struggles to understand emotions of others as well as her own feelings. It is at the time we reach the episodes mentioned above that Violet finally breaks her emotionless shell fully. It is a genius move to push the backstory to a later time, as both the viewer and the protagonist have the time to acclimate themselves to the ideas presented here. The theme of love, loss and pain is strong enough to make even an asshole like me tear up. The way the story is presented eases the viewer into a false state of understanding the plot structure only to smash those expectations unexpectedly. It's some powerful stuff! \\n\\n\r\nVisually the anime is stunning. Backgrounds that most of the time are there only as decoration are vibrant and detailed to the point of trying a bit too hard. I couldn't find a single repeated animation loop in the entire show, so they're either well hidden or nonexistent. \\n\r\nSound, music, voice acting (both dubbed and subbed) are great as well. It shows that a lot of love and care went into making Violet Evergarden. For me, a standout will always be the ending theme that encompasses the character of Violet perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first heard of this anime I knew nothing of the hype behind it, source material or even the studio responsible for the show. I just saw it on Netflix and given poor anime numbers on legal streaming services in my country, added it to my list. Violet Evergarden is one of the best anime of the year so far. For me, however, it's already one of my most favourite anime shows ever created. Just get yourself some tissues before watching...",

            "content": "I have just finished episode 10 of Violet Evergarden and thought it was a great episode so I went to see on MAL if the ratings changed at all from this episode alone. It might have because before I saw it at 8.3 ish and now it's at 8.44.\r\nAfter checking the ratings I decided to check the reviews see what that got to offer. I was expecting lots of 10/10's at the top or at least half positive half negative. But instead I found literally all the top reviews to be negative and people have for some reason all found it helpful. Well you knowwhat fuck the guidelines cuz this is about to turn into a rant.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10: As someone who didn't read the light novel and who DOESN'T CARE about the light novel I have to say: The foundations of this anime is **FANTASTIC** fantasy world, Great war, Kingdoms lots of great settings. The anime talks about Violet living as a doll after serving the military and living through tragedies. People are saying that \"every episode is just trying to squeeze the feel out of you\" well first off there's so so so many \"good\" anime's out there that does the same thing and the entire foundation of Violet Evergarden is practically based on that (this is a sad drama anime believe it or not). Every episode might look like a filler but it really is not it develops on Violets character ever so slightly in various ways and all the CHARACTERS FITS IN TOGETHER (GETTING TO THAT LATER). Literally don't get people who hate the story it's quite simplistic, straight forward and interesting. This anime talks about serious topics and sad events that does happens in real life such as: Orphanage, Losing a loved one in war, Illnesses, Integration etc. I have no complaints on this story and I truly **ENJOY** (GETTING BACK TO THAT) it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: Astonishing. The settings just compliments this even more. Kyoani has been putting out great works recently in forms of Animes and Anime movies.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Amazing as well, fits the atmosphere and makes everything just more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: ANOTHER THING PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT WELL GUESS WHAT no. The characters has stuff that Violet never ever felt as a person and stuff that she can relate to. Such as having family, Being in love, Losing a loved one, Having a break down and many many other feelings and emotions. Also the characters kind of match up with the situation of Europe during and after the wars.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: Sad moments, happy moments, tense moments, Character development, many many many other aspects made me wanting a new episode every time I finish. This show really really struck me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10: I might be biased because I started writing this review from my enjoyment alone. That might be a good thing or a bad thing you can decide. I was really mad and angry about the other reviews which is also why I started writing this review so overall if anyone is pissed or angry about my review well uh dm me a response on MAL or Jessechugaga#6564 on discord. Hopefully some people got to read this xd.",

            "content": "RANT WARNING: Too many anime fans, apparently, have become accustomed to having things spelled out for them via some combination of long narration and excessively expository dialogue between characters.\r\nAlong comes Violet Evergarden, a show that dares not to hold its viewers' hands, and suddenly there's a backlash mob complaining about how the \"dialogue doesn't tell us enough\" and how supposedly that's an indicator of weak story. \r\nIt's laughably stupid, because the opposite is true. A great film/show is one that you can mute and still understand. A trash show is one where you could drape a blanket over the screen and still understand it. \r\nVioletEvergarden, even the haters will admit, is beautifully animated. Thank Kyoto for that. But what the haters seem to miss is that the animation itself is telling the story, which is HOW IT SHOULD BE. And it would be the norm if so many studios weren't sadly forced to operate on a tight budget that incentivizes them to give us boring stills while characters explain things for us. \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING. Watch the subtle facial expressions, the changing scenery, the moods that the different color schemes convey. Stop expecting walls of text to spell everything out for you, and you'll find there's a beautiful, tear-jerking story here. \\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden tells the story of a broken, scarred soldier who needs to find her place in the world. \\n\\n\r\nShe spent most of her life as a pawn who just took orders and wreaked havoc. She spends the course of the show learning how to express and get in touch with her own emotions. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, Violet's lack of emotions in the beginning can be a turn off for viewers. She is somewhat difficult to empathize with at the start. But that, it turns out, is the point, as this problem is remedied in a truly beautiful way. Starting around episode 3, Violet (and we the viewers) begins hearing the stories of more ordinary people. These stories are easier to understand, and when Violet herself is able to draw a connection between an emotion one of her clients is feeling to an emotion she herself felt at a certain time, it allows us to start \"getting\" who Violet is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's when the freaking water works start. Bring tissues if you're like me. Starting with episode 4, almost every episode that followed brought me to tears at some point. It's a good, ugly cry that they get out of you. Kyoto doing Kyoto things.\\n\\n\r\nThis is among the greatest things I've ever watched. You may not like it if you're used to easily digestable shows that tell you what to think/feel and have characters constantly spoonfeeding you exposition. You probably won't like it if you're only into giant robot battles. But if you're ready for a show that will make you feel, there is no better show to watch.",

            "content": "[This review is spoiler-free] \r\n[\"Violet Evergarden\" = anime title. \"Violet\" = the character]\r\nViolet Evergarden. Words that come to mind when I think about the anime's title is discovering one's true self, what their goals are in life, and would you be willing to do anything for that one person who holds a place in your heart? These are questions that Violet, the central protagonist of the story, who also shares the same name as the title, learns and experiences throughout this slice of life gem that Kyoto Animation, yet once again, delivers the audience to. You will laugh, possibly shed a tear or two, andwatch Violet's amazing character development throughout the show, all the way to it's conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nBut with that being said, let me just get this out of the way now: Violet Evergarden is no masterpiece. While delivering the positives of the show, mainly consisting of it's outstanding artwork, good characters and story, and keeping your interest throughout the short remainder of it's 13 episodes, it suffers in scoring from noticeable negative aspects. I'll be going over what I thought Violet Evergarden did right, and what it did poorly. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Violet Evergarden starts off fairly decent. We quickly get introduced to who the characters are, the situation that Violet's in after the war, and how she's offered a job as an \"Auto Memory Doll\", a person who ghostwrites letters for people. This becomes the main premise for the story: Violet's journey as a 'Doll' to find her true self after being used as only a weapon for the war, and to learn the words of someone she held dear to her heart. The story never managed to stray away from this concept, and was always on the linear path of making Violet the central figure for the anime (hence it's name). \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's pretty much all the positives. What we get as we advance through the story is a lot of unnecessary episodes of Violet helping various people type letters to help her understand how she can develop feelings and emotions. The episodes where there's not much going on for the main plot line also suffer from being pretty forgetful. With mediocre characters we only see once or twice again. I think if 2 or 3 of those filler-type episodes were cut, I would've enjoyed the flow of the story more than I did now. One thing that these episodes did do right however, was show Violet gradually start to understand feelings and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that was a double-edge sword for me was how Violet Evergarden tried so hard to make the audience feel empathy for the customers Violet visited. This was okay, for the most part. There's nothing wrong with an anime trying to get you to shed a tear and feel emotional for someone's back story. However, Violet Evergarden does this concept too many times, almost to the point where I could predict what the next situation would be like and mentally be prepared to start feeling emotional. Some people may like this, while others may not. I'm sitting on the fence and saying it was okay at times, and unnecessary for other times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story for Violet Evergarden manages to do a lot of things right: set up an unchanging plot line of Violet finding her new purpose in life, relieving the duties of her being a weapon for the war, and watch her great character development as she meets new people, while portraying emotional aspects to the audience. Some things it did wrong, however, were the almost pointless trips Violet made for customers. If she had been a character who had emotion and made these trips, these scenes would completely be useless from the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 (Masterpiece)\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Violet Evergarden, coming in at no surprise, delivers top quality artwork. Every scene from Violet Evergarden looked like a painting that took many weeks to complete. The environment of Telesis, the continent of the show, flourished with vivid colors and textures, and brought life to a beautiful looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe character models, face expressions, clothing they wore, buildings, streets, meadows, and nature of Violet Evergarden all looked fantastic and realistic. Character's pulled off meaningful emotion when they cried, laughed, and talked to one another. This was something I greatly appreciated while watching Violet Evergarden. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10 (Average)\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds for Violet Evergarden, on the other hand, are no where near as close to how the artwork was handled. This is by far the poorest aspect of the show, despite it having an average rating. There were no memorable soundtracks, other than the OP, that made me want to replay the scene again or listen to on Youtube. While the sounds themselves were decent, there was just nothing that caught my attention at all, which is a shame really. Also, I did not like the ending song, but that's just a personal opinion. The singer voice just, irritated me a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is what ultimately saves the sound from going into the bad ranges. Voice acting for the most part was portrayed well and had it's plentiful share of raw emotion it displayed. The voice actors for Violet Evergarden should pat themselves on the back.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that really had the most time put into was none other than Violet herself. This is to be expected, of course. However, what makes a truly great series is its use of various characters, and how they contribute their roles into making the story better. Violet Evergarden has a very weak set of cast. Some characters shouldn't even be in the show, as they served no direct purpose to help the story, and are just there for Violet's sake. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters that has no purpose or didn't do anything to help the plot of the show consist of the following: Benedict Blue, an employee of CH postal company, the place Violet begins her new job, Cattleya Baudelaire, another employee, Leon Stephanotis, a character Violet meets later on her travels, Erica Brown, not even from the source material, another employee, Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, a princess Violet meets through her travels and helps write letters... I think you get the point. None of these characters did anything significant nor had a purpose of just being filler characters for the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhat saves Violet Evergarden from having a very weak set of characters is Violet and her character development throughout the show. She starts off being very shy, having no emotions what so ever, to become more open to people, being a better writer, and starting to have a personality, and this is all done in a good pace when she's doing business and meeting new people, who have different problems in their lives relating to the letters Violet writes. Other characters that are good and actually did have purpose were Gilbert Bougainvillea, a very important figure in Violet's life, and Claudia Hodgins, the manager of CH postal company. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of Violet Evergarden remained not wasted throughout it's length. While suffering from some bad elements of the show, mainly it's filler episodes, lackluster soundtracks, and poor characters, Violet Evergarden manages to tell a good story of finding purpose for your life and that starting a new chapter in your life, while at first may seem scary, is very important, and helps you move on as a person. As well as the fantastic artwork, and 2 other good characters, I enjoyed Violet Evergarden quite a bit. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 7.0/10\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Violet Evergarden to people who are huge fans of the slice of life genre, as it managed to tackle lots of real life situations that people go through on a daily basis. It also delivers great artwork, good and bad characters that are a hit or miss for people, and good story telling. While Violet Evergarden could've been better, it managed to deliver what it sought out to try to be: an experience for the viewer that reflects on life and the choices we make. \\n",

            "content": "Note to Anime: It is very important to make sure your viewers can easily tell whether or not your characters are human or highly advanced robots, especially when your world is set in a steampunk Victorian era and their occupation is literally called \"Doll.\" \r\nSpoiler: none of the \"dolls\" are actually robots. Just girls training to ghostwrite. Why is it only girls? Dunno. Why do they have to be called \"doll\"? Dunno.\r\nViolet Evergarden. An anime that has all the glamour and musicality, but not a lot of sense. That was my review 2 episode into the series. The art is gorgeous, the music and voiceacting are top notch. Animations are fluid and subtle. A pretty house that is furnished with terrible, dated furniture. The premise is cliche and the story makes little sense at times and tries way too hard to be \"thoughtful\" and \"touching.\" \\n\\n\r\nHow have things fared since the start of the episode?\\n\r\nSpoiler ahead.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 2 we see violet send a letter that pissed off the client because she's a robot (not really but she acts like one and has robot hands). This was done in an extremely forced, and illogical way. For starter, Violet is new. And yet no one proof-readed the letter for her. They just let a complete newb, whom they know talk and act like a robot and have trouble fitting in, ghostwrite a letter on the company's behalf. Also, Violet was a soldier that relies on order. This being the first letter she ever wrote, you'd think she would ask someone if the content was okay. This is BS storytelling. Sacrificing logic for plot is weak writing and I honestly didn't expect it in an anime everyone has been raving about. \\n\\n\r\nHaving re-adjusted my expectation, I watched two more episodes with a less critical eye and just genuinely trying to have fun. Unfortunately, this anime tries very hard to be dour and serious and touching, but ended up being very boring and devoided of fun and genuine moments. \\n\\n\r\nThink of an anime like Neon Genesis Evangelion. Aside from being really dark and twisted (also features a heroine similar to violet in the name of Rei), Neon Genesis is also fun and subtly touching at times (not \"everybody crying all the time\" touching, except Shinji because he's a crybaby) You can argue that the series becomes increasingly convoluted, confusing and overtly religious towards the end, and I'd completely agree with you, but the series, for the most part, had a simplistic story to tell, had interesting side characters, had a focus... all the while being tonally dour and smothering.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden has a very similar tone. It is serious most of the time and almost completely devoided of laughter. I can count the number of fun moments I had between episode 3 and 4 with 1 hand. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode 3, we are introduced to a girl named Luculia, who is good-natured and wants to take care of her brother since he was the only family she had left. This storyline had a lot of promise and had they taken the time to properly set up her struggles and motivations, the payoff would've been far greater. Then, somewhere in the middle of episode 3, she cried. Then towards the end of episode 3, she cried some more. Her brother also cried.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode four focused Iris, one of Violet's hot-head coworker, and her trip to her hometown. 10 minutes into the episode she cried and got into a shouting match with her mum. (how dramatic.) Another 10 minute she cried after seeing some dude who rejected her from way back. \\n\\n\r\nThere is so much CRYING.\\n\\n\r\nHow is any of this \"touching\"? \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest mistake this anime makes is thinking that throwing a sad melody on top of someone crying automatically makes the scene touching. Nevermind letting the audience get to know the characters. Nevermind the circumstances. Just have them cry and your audience will cry along. Spoiler: It doesn't work this way. Instead, it ends up feeling really forced. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some good moments in episode 4. For instance, iris asking Violet not to send the letter, and the very next scene you see is violet sending the letter. The dolls at the post office declared to have an official party, only to completely leave out their boss. Moments like this are very welcomed, and sourly needed in a show so devoided of light-hearted moments. Almost all the characters are cardboard cutouts. You can describe them in less than 3 adjectives. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters talk, but you never get the sense that they're real people. Just mouthpieces to fabricate conflict. (except Luculia. She had Violet write a letter to her dead parents. She's the first real character I've seen on this show that felt real.) You barely get any meaningful insight into each of the character's life. What's iris like when she's not working? What does she like to do? It's four episodes in already and so far we barely got to know the main cast, beyond one or two descriptors. \\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is like a beautiful piggy bank. The art is fantastic. The characters are pretty to look at. Great music and soundtrack. The exterior of the piggy bank promises riches beyond your imagination, and if you shake the piggy bank ever so lightly, you might even hear a faint rustle of coins or see a glitter of gold through the slit. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you break it open, however, there's nothing inside but pebbles. No story to tell. No interesting character or dialogue to keep you engaged. What you have is a story that doesn't really say a whole lot, but isn't really fun to hear either. \\n\\n\r\nif you're a teenager and this is going to be your first anime (or one of the first) by all means, watch it. It is pretty to look at, with all that filters and DoF and melodramatic soundtracks. If you are someone who grew up on anime, you can give this a pass. \\n",

            "content": "\"I don't need to take orders anymore\"\r\nNo human is perfect. That is a lesson humanity is reminded of every time. Much like every human, different people have different shortcomings and there's no one who is perfect at everything, no, not even Sakamoto. Some people can't do certain tasks well, while in the case of fiction, some don't have emotions. This is where Violet Evergarden steps in. And boy it's a step in the right direction, even though it's pretty disconnected.\r\nMuch like every masterpiece, we have critics. \"VE is emotionally manipulative\" most of them say, as I have seen many reviews repeat this again and again.To be fair, Violet Evergarden is in between the two conflicting opinions. On one side it can be true because unfortunately Violet Evergarden stuck with an episodic route of focusing on the moving stories of people, but coming back to that point those scenarios are much more believable and better designed than most other \"moving stories\" like the much overrated Angel Beats and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, which were truly spectacular pieces of emotional manipulation, since they forced down half-baked 'moving' stories down the viewers throat and concentrated on the \"feels\" aspect a little too much. Violet Evergarden itself is also guilty of that, but to a lesser extent because it doesn't bring out an unrelatable or unbelievable story just to get the waterworks, but gets pretty believable scenarios and the types that we can all come to love, at least for people who have a heart, I mean I thought I didn't, but Violet Evergarden became another of the few anime that left me in tears. Now here's the thing, making people cry isn't what makes a good show, so we focus on the other parts, I already focused on their design and now will move on to the next part, Violet's past and present life.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it got the back bench for most of its run, Violet's story herself was very important and was amazingly done, but once again the fact that it focused too much on the moving stories it is pushed back. Unfortunately delving deeper into Violet's story will invite spoilers so I'll try to brush on the surface. Her interactions with the Major (who got really less screen time unfortunately) are what made her the person she was in the present time and her journey to discover herself and her true emotion showed us that Violet too wanted to understand the meaning of the words the Major told her, \"I love you\". She slowly comes to learn this as she notices and works with other people for the Auto Memoir Dolls headed by Hodgins (voiced by Takehito Koyasu, the award winning Voice Actor who played roles like Dio from JoJo and Takasugi from Gintama) and it's not just her interactions with people that moves the people, but she learns from the emotions and stories of the said people herself. This again sheds light to the human nature of sharing stories with one another and emotionally getting motivated to move on, do something or just give up when you need to.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of VE is one that got affected by the \"moving stories\" episodic nature. Like it or not. Now one thing is for sure, those stories aren't at all below the likes of other competitors in the moving stories department, but unfortunately they don't play a huge part in the actual plot and focus of Violetto-chan. This is why I mentioned that the opinion of Violet Evergarden being emotionally manipulative is both correct and at the same time wrong, it depends on which angle you look at. In the end, since I was a fan, I'll be taking the side of the positive opinion. Angles reminds me, Kyo-Ani has done it again with their art. Now I know Kyo-Ani purists will come to butcher me for watching Violet Evergarden in 720p from KissAnime but hear me out please before you butcher me up. It's art is just that magnificent that even in 720 my mouth dropped open in awe. Koe no Katachi had brilliant art, but goddamn Violet Evergarden took it to a whole new level. Much like how Fate Zero put other modern anime art styles to shame, I expect Violet Evergarden to lead the inspiration department for art style. Well done Kyoto Animation. The scenes looked so cinematic each time that when I watched a different seasonal my eyes bled because the difference in quality was as clear as day. The art department is a place where Violet Evergarden nails perfectly. No arguments. The sun, the sky, the stars, the sea, the city, the country, the characters, everything looked so cinematic and movie like that I ran out of words to praise it. VE's art is one field it excels in perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAnother place it nails perfectly is the OST. A classic tone added a dash of elegance to this already quite elegant anime and it spawned an endless set of covers on YouTube, especially from talented AniPianists like PianoPrinceOfAnime, who composed a composition for EACH episode. Truly a beautiful soundtrack. It played at just the right moments and instead of hinder the emotion, it further glorified it, a trait none of the \"critics\" like to point out, along with the spectacular art style. Apart from that I can't ignore to mention the enormous talent of the VAs for the show, EACH AND EVERY one of the staff were involved in a hugely successful anime and it just goes to show just how amazing VE is again, not to mention the quality of the staff. Yui Ishikawa played Violet, but her most famous role was as Mikasa Ackerman from Shounen frontrunner Attack on Titan (or Shingeki no Kyojin to you weebs), Daisuke Namikawa played the Major, his other famous roles being Hitotsubashi Nobunobu from Gintama\u00b0 and a huge amount of supporting roles for various popular anime. Kouki Uchuyama played Benedict and the fact that he played Devilman says a lot about his talent too, to say nothing of his other works. We already have these A listers and I already mentioned Takehito Koyasu's brilliance and experience in the industry, so we move on from the enormous talent in the staff and move in to who they played as well.\\n\\n\r\nSince VE focused on its episodic moving stories route, new characters kept showing up and although they did get development and were sent off, this meant the important recurring characters didn't get development at all. Unfortunately, it mostly felt like the side characters (aside from the ones I'll mention soon) were merely stepping Stones for Violet to cross and improve upon. The exceptions were Hodgins, the Major and Cattleya and Benedict to a certain extent. The former two played a noticeably important part in developing Violet as a character and they themselves improved a little too, but as I mentioned every other character was thrown away to make way for Violet's development. This isn't necessarily wrong (heck look at the title of the anime, of course they're gonna focus on Violet) but it certainly does mean that the supporting cast doesn't get the development they deserved. And that's not a good thing. Regardless, I like to give credit where it's due, and since this anime is centered on Violet, I can't be too harsh at least for this section (keyword: too, I'm cutting marks for the supporting characters' lost development).\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is an anime that is not perfect. Neither is that character. Far from it. But Violet Evergarden is a step in the right direction for the \"sad anime\" trope and for drama as a genre as a whole. I have a strong dislike of drama anime, and my list reflects that too, since it ranks 31st out of 34, but like with every list, it's not necessarily correct, or more accurately, there are always exceptions. This is what I have said time and time again. Violet Evergarden may not be an anime everyone likes and agrees upon (no such anime exists by the way, spoiler alert) but like it or not, Violet Evergarden is an anime that will bring change to the tired out genre of drama, at least in my eyes. And that's what matters to me. I don't care much about how Violet Evergarden ranks in people's eyes, I care more about how Violet Evergarden affects me as an anime watcher, and although it hasn't affected me as a person, as an anime fan, I'm glad to say I have restored some (keyword: some) faith in the drama genre as a whole and hopefully I get to see good drama in the future as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have said before, Violet Evergarden is a step in the right direction for drama, and it will hopefully inspire other studios to stop doing sub-par lame drama and get on with it. Is Violet Evergarden a 10/10 in my eyes? No. Certainly not, at least certainly not from an objective point of view. But that objective point of view doesn't make it look shit either. It's made its mark and will continue to do so. Violet Evergarden is a personal 10 for me, but even I know it's not perfect. But then that's what makes us humans doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8.2\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Wait we got a new project greenlit? Does this mean we're getting a proper adaptation? Or a sequel? I think it's the first but quite possibly both are wrong. Let's wait and see. Hoping for the best Violetto-chan, amaze me ;)",

            "content": "(The error in the entry of number of episodes for the review was due to the series previously marked as 14 episodes, as well as my own mistake of not doublechecking the error.. I had only recently discovered and remembered this mistakes just recently as of 8/8/2018, but I\u2019ve decided to leave it be.)\r\nThere are five main types of anime series that I recognize: \r\n-series that excite and appeal with their jam-packed action and jam-packed plot/conflict\r\n-series that intend to make us laugh our rear ends off or cringe in pain\r\n-series that are meant to be relaxing and fun while showing the characters\u2019 social activities\r\n-series thatdrag us through a complicated and sometimes exaggerated drama of romance\\n\r\nAnd finally:\\n\r\n-series that intent to take us on a roller coaster of feels with the intent to make us think deeper about life, learn important lessons, and/or watch a main character\u2019s 180 degree development.\\n\r\nSome anime series may combine two or more of these characteristics, either the right or wrong way.\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden, part of the bunch of highly anticipated anime series of 2018, has had quite the mixed feedback, mostly due to people having \u201cover-expectation\u201d or misinterpretation of what the series is supposed to bring. I\u2019m going to make it clear\u2026guys, if you're hating cause you're expecting action, action, action...then I'm sorry, but you've made a big blunder, and it's not this series' fault.\\n\r\nMe? I'm simply enjoying the journey as it goes....I really like....no, I love this series a lot, but I can completely understand why there are people who think it's overrated and/or bland. I'll be quick with the details about why Violet Evergarden is a must-watch, and why it purifies us as viewers:\\n\r\nSTORY: Again, expecting a whole bunch of action is a huge mistake, like I mentioned before, this series is something completely different. Granted, the pacing of the story is the only real weak point of this series, as it may seem slow, with the melodrama and the layout of the series consisting of character-specific episodes. \\n\r\nThe story is basically focusing on a former war veteran by the name of Violet Evergarden. Raised her whole life as a war soldier for WWI, she now struggles to find her purpose in life after war, as well as learn about emotions and why people are not honest about their own feelings often.  Her own upbringings were very rough, as she only had an instinct to follow orders and kill on command, having no real knowledge about normal life outside war, especially about having and understanding emotions. \\n\r\nAs the series slowly progresses and picks up the pace, the titular main character\u2019s journey to learn what \"I love you\" is\u2026turns out to be more than just a former vet finding a purpose and way to live. Does the series seem to force emotions onto the viewers? Probably\u2026but concerning the type of character Violet was at the start, it really is the near perfect setup for her development. How do you get a practically emotionless, blunt character to develop and progress to have his or her own emotions and change for the better? Give her exposure to the sad backstories and realities of the characters she interacts and encounters along the way. It's honestly a heartwarming and emotional trip meant to purify the viewers and showcase the realities of life and the kind of hardships and tragedies one can face. The series itself can really show us the big picture about the adversity of life and how we can still take the correct path even if the world is against us, especially to those of us who hate the harsh reality of life itself.\\n\r\nThis journey that Violet undertakes also develops her as a character little by little as she finds out and learns with each and every person she interacts with. In each specific arc, with the job of being a ghostwriter\u2026someone who writes letters for others who can\u2019t and/or unable to do it themselves\u2026Violet ends up having positive influence and impact on the people, changing their lives for the better, or at least granting their wishes. \\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that this series actually gives a lot of credit to even the support and minor characters, especially those who are significantly involved with Violet's story and/or development. Warning, though...be prepared for progressively increasing feels, and the slower pace of this series is the perfect setup for it. This series doesn\u2019t wind up for a punch of feels....it keeps jabbing harder and harder with each episode.\\n\r\nOne more thing to act: any action that does get featured is actually quite awesome. It\u2019s quite ridiculously breathtaking, imo, to watch Violet being a badass taking down multiple enemies in the heat of battle.\\n\\n\r\nART and SOUND: I feel like I have to put both categories together because both are something that can potentially blow you away. The animation of the series is arguably on a god tier level, detailing all the colors, shadings, and line details of the settings and the characters. Funny enough, it also had me to the point where I thought most of it was 3D, when it really wasn't...it is THAT good. You know the animation style is ace-worthy when there's so much given attention to make the scenes where the wind blows through a character's hair that awe-inspiring. The only real issues I had is with the ACTUAL CG, which felt somewhat awkward at times, but not as offputting as most other CG animations in countless other series I\u2019ve watched.\\n\r\nAs for the soundtracks, they do the absolute best, considering how this series is. From the emotional, tear-jerkers to the light-hearted melodies, they fit nearly single scene they're inserted in to near perfection. The soundtracks are also a kind of style that would fit a setting like that of Violet Evergarden, not exactly ancient or medieval, but not exactly near modern day, either.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: I probably touched upon this in the previous sections, but I\u2019ll say it anyway. I can understand why some people may find Violet as a boring character, especially from the early get-go\u2026due to her initial blunt personality. While I find Violet's lacking of understanding emotions a bit awkward at times, I really don't mind it that much. I mean, think about it....if you were raised like just to be a war soldier and nothing else, you'd probably be in about the same situation, more or less. Violet's development consists mostly of her learning about standards outside of the military as well as making friends with the people she's now more associated with...in addition to her search to know about \"I love you\". Additionally, while she's an individual of few words, she has been able to help others with their own personal strife. As for herself, her remarkable shift from a character with barely any emotions\u2026.to one full of emotions, is definitely a real payoff for the series, imo. The handling of the support characters, especially Claudia, Violet's current guardian, is adequate at the very least, though at times they can be left out too much. However, the series still does take a considerate time to focus on each and every one of the main members of the support cast.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: The sound and artwork alone had my enjoyment level at sky-high, though not in a same way as when I'd watch something like an action sci-fi or \"edgy card game\" series. It's a series where you just know you\u2019re in for an emotional roller coaster and get caught up in the drama and feels\u2026granted, this series doesn\u2019t play out drama quite like other melodramatic series. My enjoyment also comes from watching Violet's journey and development, to where I can understand and even relate to her and the other characters\u2019 experiences in this story. Within a few episodes, due to her good looks, heartwarming voice, innocent honesty, and desire to understand others, Violet has become one of my favorite anime characters of all time. I also had a rather weird feeling of being proud\u2026having watched the main heroine literally grow up before my eyes\u2026from a former tool of war that kills people\u2026to an individual that opposes violence and seeks to help others. The overall story itself is good enough to where I don't exactly try to nitpick any details to deny the fact that I'm enjoying the ride. This series has also made me cry for the first time in the longest while (I\u2019m not kidding). Violet Evergarden has easily become my #1 anime of Winter 2018 due to these reasons.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Don't listen to people saying this series is overrated saying it's lacking action, when it's NOT even an action series. If anything, their expectations are just being unreasonably high or they're thinking too pessimistic due to past disappointments. So unless you're too completely engaged in extreme action, fantasy, supernatural, and sci-fi, this series is a must-watch, period. In fact, I would suggest to even people who never experienced anime before to watch it. Even if the sound and artwork somehow doesn't take your breath away, the story and journey will keep you engaged. Granted, it's not for the weak-hearted...it is a \"feels trip\" as well, after all.",

            "content": "**WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS**\r\nFirst review, no promises of being good. TL;DR at the end for the anti-long readers.\r\nTo come from nothing.. No parents.. no siblings.. no pets.. no house. Having only 1 ability that keeps you alive and keeps you moving. That ability is to kill. \r\nViolet Evergarden, an emotionless child soldier with no background and no trust in her fellow man. She's renowned for her startlingly impressive skills as a killer and was often referred to as \"Gilbert's weapon\".\r\nWe meet our main character in a dream of hers with her Major, Gilbert. It happens to be one of many memories she cherishes of him becauseof a gift that shines the same color as his eyes. We then see Violet awaken from her memory-like dream and this is when our story with Violet begins.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is one, who knows only to kill, to do when there is no war and no need for killing? As a child soldier she will now have to learn how to become.. human or what the military kids these days call a \"civvy\" (civilian). The hands she used to take lives will now be used to bring lives together... in a sense. \\n\\n\r\n**{{SPOILER}}** \\n\r\n{{As Violet works within her new job she soon yearns to understand what the final words of her Major mean.. \u300c\u611b\u3057\u3066\u308b\u300dor \"I love you\" and so begins her journey to become an Auto Memory Doll.}}\\n\\n\r\nAfter Violet finishes her schooling (of course with some struggles along the way) she then travels with Iris, another Auto Memory Doll, to see what the work is like and to have an even better understanding of what her duties will be. As Iris and Violet arrive, Iris then realizes she wasn't hired by some unknown woman but instead hired by her mother. As Iris faces troubles with her family along with Violet not understanding why, the stubborn Iris finally gives in and explains her troubles and how she feels about the whole situation. \\n\\n\r\nAfter Violet helps Iris in her hometown she is soon hired by the Princess to help write a letter to her new husband. A man the Princess met a few years prior whom, she instantly fell in love with but never saw again. Violet is then tasked with writing letters of reply to the Prince but the Princess realizes that the letters, just like hers, are being written by another Memory Doll. The Princess, displeased because she knows these aren't the Prince's true words, opens up to Violet and at which then Violet asks for permission to overstep her position and help the Princess.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Violet finishes her help with the Princess and has gained some fame as an Auto Memory Doll she's then hired by the Shahar Observatory. (Basically a big ass library that contains books on astronomy. Books are important kids make sure you read them even if they're manga.) Her job is to help re-write the old and deteriorating books as her partner, a member of the Manuscript Division, reads off the words she has to write down. I'd like to go into further details of the two during this but that would ruin a fairly good episode on Violet and what she's come to understand about \"feelings/emotions\".\\n\\n\r\nThis next arc again, I would love to summarize here but there's so much that relates to Violet's past that even mentioning a few lines would spoil it but what I will say is that these 2 episodes (7-8) have taken some the questions I wanted to know and answered them along with the theories I came up with and debunked them. I now catch myself eagerly waiting for the next episode to come to see what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR \\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is not for everyone. It's about a child soldier who only knows 1 thing, becoming a human-being in heart and soul. Some will hate on it because it's slow, some will even try to poke holes in it's plot and then deem it sh*t, some will even try to say Violet is dead and not building as a character at all. I say ignore all that and watch the anime to see for yourself. If it caught your eye and you're debating on watching it, just do it. If you don't like it, drop it. If you like it, GREAT! Just because a few people don't like it doesn't mean you won't either. They aren't you and you aren't them. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!! \\n\\n\r\nNote: My rating isn't official I only put one cause well I had to. It's a rating on how I feel at the moment and that can change when the anime finishes. When the anime does finish, I'll be changing the score but not here.",

It's one of those things that you might see on MST3K. It is beyond me how little they invested on the writing for this show.\r\nSecretaries do more than these\"Dolls\" their function is to write letters in a world where many (most?) are illiterate but have the technology to make robotic limbs.

            "content": "At its core, Violet Evergarden is about the silver linings of loss. The story centers around Violet, an emotionally stunted war veteran finding her place in a peacetime society, working at a job that requires interacting with clients on a personal level; learning to know herself as she learns and explores emotional\u2013and often tragic\u2013experiences of others. We follow her as she grows as a person, eventually realizing and coming to terms with the toxic past she was forced upon, and seeking redemption for a brighter future... An interesting concept with execution that leaves to be desired. This show tries to implement too many things, butfalls short in some regards. The worldbuilding is sloppy at best; and some plot elements just don't seem to fit the mood of the anime other than for superficial reasons, ultimately feeling unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe 'strongest' aspect of the show, aside from the stunning visuals, is the characterization. Competently developed through both showing and telling, Violet is very literal, blunt and surprisingly perceptive depending on the context. She was used as a weapon her entire life and thus thinks of herself as one, she believes her value as a person is entirely dependent on her usefulness as a tool of war. At first, she is oblivious to her own shortcomings and flaws\u2013mainly her lack of touch and common sense\u2013causing problems for herself and those around her, but it is this dynamic that lets people see their own contradictory nature and allows Violet to peel out their fa\u00e7ade. Violet eventually develops her own sense of empathy, not by putting herself in other people's shoes, but vice versa. Projecting her own experiences and point of view onto other people in order to better understand the situation.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, there are several missteps when it comes to a few major characters and how they are presented, more specifically with Gilbert. 'The Major' is a very shallow and two dimensional character, we don't get to know a whole lot about him other than he cared and fell in love with Violet, all while being remorseful for using her as a weapon. His lack of development makes their relationship feel somewhat contrived. Honestly, he's more of a plot device, a catalyst for Violet's development. This would be OK if not for the fact that a big chunk of the show is spent trying to sell us their connection. Other major characters include Hodgins, Benedict, Cattleya, Erica, Luculia, and Iris. Some of these are fairly fleshed out considering the limited airtime they got; with their own history, internal conflicts and personal goals, but that end up being underused due to the episodic nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI also have some clear-cut complaints about several pieces of dialogue, nonsensical character actions, and even a couple of plot holes, but that would be getting into spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weakest points of this series has to be the worldbuilding, which was left mostly unexplored aside from some surface-level expositions about the previous war, some anti-peace group with cookie cutter motives, and the several countries Violet visits. There are plot elements that leave you with a petulant feeling of inconsistency: Technological marvels like robotic prosthetic limbs or speech-to-text machines that are beyond even our level of technology, all while the rest of this fictional world is stuck in a Belle \u00c9poque-esque time period, including weaponry and transportation. Violet's inhuman abilities make very little sense, and seem to be created solely to provide an impetus for more captivating action sequences, a task that in my opinion failed miserably, as the choreography, editing and overall mechanics of the action are overdone to the point of being ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is some of the greatest I've seen for a TV anime, but most importantly, they serve a narrative purpose, be it by subtle symbolism that is easy to miss, or setting a visual theme. An adept use of cinematography and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne to visually reinforce a certain state of mind or a specific theme, like conflicting ideas in upside down reflections, a room visually pushing down on a character feeling remorse, or the frame of a chair's backrest trapping someone as she questions her own abilities as an Auto Memoir Doll. The character linework is also very sharp and clean. My only nitpick is that the layouts tend to be somewhat safe, very much made-for-TV kind of deal, which is understandable.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Violet Evergarden reaches a bit too high for its own good, but still manages to provide a decent, albeit flawed experience.",

            "content": "I honestly just want make a simple but enough review for Violet Evergarden. I was one of those people that honestly didn't give in the hype of the anime when the trailer and episode 1 came out. I simply stay neutral because I know if you expect something more out of it, you'll simply JUDGE it more than the actual anime due to high expectations.\r\nWhen I was reading the reviews for Violet Evergarden, I see a lot of the people calling the story trash or it's slow. I think these are the people are the one that hypes it before it came out. I thinkthe story is simply relaxing to watch. The pacing of the anime can be slow but I can explain why they're going to that route. Many people thinks Violet is a robot girl in which SHE'S NOT a robot btw. I don't even know why people makes reviews and get that wrong. Violet is a girl that simply don't know any emotions due to the fact that she's been used as a tool for war for her life. She simply didn't know what are emotions are and only knew how to kill. She lost her arms in the war and got mechanical arms. This is where I found the story starts to be interesting. She wants to be a \"Doll\" (who writes letter to people) and want to learn and find the hidden emotions that people and she has. She want to know what's the meaning of love and how is it feel to be loved. Every time she goes on adventure, she learns people's emotion and understands how people feel. While she SAVES other people EMOTIONALLY UNINTENTIONALLY, she's actually SAVING herself. You'll understand what I mean if you actually took the time to watch the anime. This is why the pacing is so slow for the anime. You can't expect a fucking person with no emotions to know understand the difficulty of emotions in 2-3 episodes. The story is simply relaxing and it's worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nIf I do have to critique the series though, I'll have to say that they should have more episodes or find some way to wrap the series up because I don't think this anime should have a second season due to how the plot works. I hope they find a way to give a good ending that wraps the series up.",

            "content": "-------Violet Evergarden-------\r\nThis anime doesn't need a review because it's a masterpiece itself.\r\nArt 10/10\r\nThe scenaries are breathtaking and the character design are the greatest thing of this anime as for the art. The getup of people according to there age and time shown in this anime are just as they should be. The places are well animated. Overall animation and graphics according to it's genres is almost perfect. I gave it's art 10/10 because of the sceneries and character designing (I personaly love Violet's design but it doesn't matter).\r\nSound 10/10\r\nThe soundtracks of this anime makes the environment feel-able and describes what's going on in the scene.The opening and ending are very beautiful and peaceful they suites as the anime is. The songs and musics of Violet Evergarden is just perfect because it puts you into deep thinking according to scene if you listen to them closely!\\n\\n\r\n(All these soundtracks and songs work as a booster rocket for this anime.)\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nThe reason why I came here to review Violet Evergarden is it's story. The story or you can say the life of Violet Evergarden teaches us the meaning of true humanity which is most important fact than any other in this world for a human. When I first saw Violet Evergarden I said \"I am going to watch another tearjerker anime\" even though I was right I never knew the word I said \"another\" is too simple for this great anime. The anime Violet Evergarden teaches us what happens if a human don't have any senses, feelings and emotions. What are the effects of a feeling-less human on other people and there relationships. They showed us the purpose of all important facts about a human.\\n\r\n<spoiler>\\n\r\nThe story of Violet Evergarden is all about the journey of a weapon named Violet Evergarden to become a human. A person who don't have anyone in this world parents, family, relatives is living in an orphanage. Then fate sent an angel like solider named Gilbert who adopted her, gave her a name (Violet) and life while everyone took her as a living weapon without heart and soul but Gilbert say \"no\" because he never saw her other than as a human. Violet understand Gilbert and took him as if it is the only one she had left in this world. She always use to say \"Give me your orders\", \"I want your orders\", \"What's the next order\" and on the other side Gilbert always want her to get rid of thinking about the orders. Time passed and suddenly Violet lost her savior and both her arms in a war. The last thing Gilbert said to her is \"I love you\", that time she didn't know the meaning what he said, but she saved it in her heart. Now only thing she have left is Gilbert's memories, and the brooch of same color as Gilbert's eyes which is gifted by himself. She became an \"Auto memory doll\" and faced many difficulties and suffering in finding the meaning of \"I love you\". While searching she learned many things. She didn't know that she is teaching people more than she is learning from them. Every person she met she bring happiness to their lives. Thanks to the people who passed through her life, finally the day came when a tool who always say \"I want your orders\" and kill enemies like a \"heartless one man army\" is now became a \"girl\" who no longer needs any orders and say \"I don't want your orders\" and now even save her enemies from death.\\n\r\nNow she understands what Gilbert mean by \"I love you\"...\\n\r\n</spoiler>\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is a teacher itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nFirst I want to talk about the other special characters shown in this anime especially Gilbert, Hodgins, Luculia who have major role in building up Violet's life, they have the highest honor. I want to give 10/10 for character development for Violet and 9/10 for others . And now for the \"The Battle doll of Leidenschaftlich\" the title given by the enemies in the battle field to Violet, what more honor can you get than that?! Violet has many qualities or we can say Violet is a rare person. Violet is Kind, Violet is innocent, Violet is beautiful, Violet is cute, Violet has the best heart, Violet is intelligent, Violet is a sign of good luck, Violet is happiness, Violet is sadness, Violet is a teacher, Violet is a student, Violet is brave, Violet is cool, Violet is a warrior, Violet is one man army, They give her a title \"The Battle doll of Leidenschaftlich\" and the most important, Violet is \"Violet Evergarden\"...\\n\r\nI love Violet and all the special characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nHmmm... enjoyment...\\n\r\nI challenged myself to not to cry. I passed and didn't feel a thing till that episode when Luculia came. From then I failed in every episode very very badly - while watching, all the time my shirt went wet with my non-stop tears and felt heavy at my chest. I didn't even clean my tears, just punching myself at my chest (like soldiers salute in Shingeki no Kyojin) to stop tearjerking (even though people say I am a tough guy but now that's a funny fact for me because Violet ruined my toughness to ashes). This is the situation of me and many other people who enjoyed it the most. I think these tears and crying are because we understands what should be understand...\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThe life of Violet Evergarden is a lesson.\\n\r\nI took Violet Evergarden not as a TV show but as a life in the real world. I am a 22 year old boy and Violet is my ideal I respect her with the depths of my heart (because she deserves it) I learned many things from her that's why I love her, what she do, and everything about her. These are all the important things I wanted to say according to it's genre. Even there are many great animes in this world that are here and will come in the future but still Violet Evergarden is unique. Thank you everyone who watched this anime.\\n\r\nThanks Akatsuki Kana for creating this great anime! Thank you Violet for making me feel like a human...",

            "content": "\u201cLive free.\u201d\r\n\u201cIs that an order?\u201d\r\nNo anime has made me cry like this one has.\r\nThis is the kind of anime that takes it\u2019s time to get to the really good parts, but once it\u2019s good, it\u2019s GOOD. This is the kind of anime that you can't pause while in the middle of an episode. This is the kind of anime that despite its flaws, you can't help but love.\r\nI watched the first episode when it aired about a year ago and thought \u201cHm. This is awfully mediocre.\u201d Before moving on to another, more exhilarating anime. This was a huge mistake. Any of you who thought thesame thing, I encourage you: please give this show a second chance, I promise you will not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9/10]\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden tells a beautiful story of a girl who has only known war, and from that has become an emotionless shell. After the war ends, she has to find a way to live in the real world. She ends up with a job where she is forced to understand the emotions of others, inspiring her to learn more about what it means to feel emotions.\\n\r\nWhen told that, you would not expect this show to be told with a mainly episodic narrative. But, after watching the show, you\u2019ll understand that trying to tell this story any other way would have been wrong. Doing this allowed the show to develop the main character, Violet Evergarden, through her experiences while giving interesting and especially touching new stories every single episode. This also gives episodes focused on the main character much more impact, as it shows that what\u2019s happening in these episodes holds enough weight to take a break from the usual. The balance between one-off episodes and story-driven episodes is also perfect, giving the anime a steady, calming pace that brings the whole show together.\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re someone like me who cares a lot about the ending, this show is nothing to worry about. The ending turned out a perfect ending for this anime, an incredibly satisfying ending to an incredibly satisfying anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]\\n\r\nIf you know one thing about Violet Evergarden, it\u2019s that its visuals are beautiful. And that\u2019s not an understatement--this anime is downright gorgeous. Every moment in this anime is beautifully made, there\u2019s not a single moment at which the animation could be criticized. Although the beautiful landscapes and beautifully designed lighting and composition are not to be unappreciated, something that stood out to me greatly was the character design. Each character was designed incredibly well to match their personality and role, each design being diverse and visually beautiful. Another great aspect is the use of lighting: every single scene had lighting just where it needed to be, making each moment hit just that much harder, and setting the mood better than any dialog could. If choosing for the absolute best part of this anime, art definitely does take the cake.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]\\n\r\nAlthough outshined by other aspects of this show in my opinion, the audio for this show is still definitely satisfying and fitting. The choice of voice actors was incredibly well done, not one voice felt out-of-place or uncomfortable. When it comes to music, the soundtrack is astonishing, pushing the emotions in the anime that much further. Listening back to the OST after watching this anime left me amazed, and I had to come back and bump up my score from an 8 to a 9 after doing so. Along with the background music, the ED really stuck with me, mostly due to its well placed use in the show. My only complaint is that the music isn't terribly remarkable. Although the music is beautiful and fits gorgeously in the show, I would not be able to point out that a specific song was from the Violet soundtrack if I was not told previously. This hinders me a little, but I still love the soundtrack and would recommend listening to the it if you need a little more push to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\r\nOne of my absolute favorite parts of this anime is that almost no character is left undeveloped, with the highlight of development being the main character, Violet. Seriously, this anime does character development remarkably well. Every character seems to just fit right into the anime, each serving a purpose to the show. No characters felt like unnecessary side characters or like plot-devices, rather each character felt like a new personality, each one having some development throughout the series. This is so well done due to the story being told episodically, which allows for each episode to focus on one character and therefore develop the character thoroughly and easily. Yet even with the show focusing on one character per episode, the show manages to develop Violet splendidly, showing her development incredibly well throughout the series. The perfect intricacy and distinctiveness of each character contributed greatly to my enjoyment of this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]\\n\r\nOverall, this show is definitely worth a shot. It may take a little bit before the show gets great, but, the waiting is entirely worth it. My only faults with this show are that the beginning mispaints the show, and that there is a decision that I thought was quite problematic (in episode 5). Despite that, though, I could not get myself to rate this show lower than a 9/10, because I just love it so much. It\u2019s an incredible, touching, inspiring story that I wouldn\u2019t skip over, one that's incredibly worth waiting through a less eventful first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nInspiring, touching, heartfelt, beautiful.\\n",

            "content": "As you know already, Violet Evergarden has been the most talked about anime of this season and unfortunately it has become one of the mistreated anime on this site. Now I know this MAL after all and in all honestly I can understand why a lot of people find this anime disappointing. However, for someone like me, this anime does work for me while most others it doesn't. And the reason for this is because most people who have been criticizing this anime don't understand what kind of story this is and they don't take the time to try to understand. This is problem withthe anime community and today's generation for they have never a situation that Violet and some of the other characters have gone through.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is not your typical anime and it was never meant to be. This is an anime that has a far deeper story than pretty much any other anime out there. If you were expecting this to be some kind action show or even a war drama, then you were either misinformed or assumed too much. Now I myself have never read the LNs in which this anime is based on and I am aware that there are some differences such as the additions of character not in the original story, but at least let me give you an idea of what this anime is really about.\\n\\n\r\nEASY TO UNDERSTAND\\n\r\nWhile I did mention that this show is about self-discovery, it also about dealing with PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, originally known as Shell Shock. And considering that the anime has a post World War One setting, it makes perfect sense. Let me give you a little history lesson.\\n\\n\r\nPTSD is something that's existed since the beginning of mankind, but WW1 was where people really started to research it, hence the original term Shell Shock. If you look up any videos about WW1 veterans suffering from shell shock and saw how they reacted to sometime they either see or hear on the battlefield as the doctors and scientist were doing this research, you'd be pretty shocked yourself. Believe me, it's not a pretty sight. And there's usually two outcomes when it comes to dealing with PTSD. The person either recovers or commits suicide.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this anime doesn't go deep into this subject it still addresses both it and its effects, as is evident of episode with Luciuia's older brother. That man could have easily taken his own life due to his depression, but he didn't. And that was because Violet saved his with her not even realizing it. This is where the anime really does shine.\\n\\n\r\nEASY TO FOLLOW\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden herself is the most misunderstood character in this anime, just like Dorothy Catalonia is the most misunderstood character in Gundam Wing. The people who have been criticizing this anime put a lot of that blame on Violet. They either call her boring, bland, or both. Well, I hate to say it but those people are forgetting what Violet is. She practically is a robot at this point. She's been a soldier all her life and she know nothing else. Not only that she's been used and abused all her life. And to top it all off she's lost both her arms and the only person she's ever had a bond with is dead(presuming that he is) and his last words to her were, \"I Love You\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you really think about it, Violet is practically Darth Vader but with Data's personality. In Star Trek TNG Data was trying to discover what it's like to be human while living in a mechanical body. For Violet it's a more specific goal: Trying to discover what the meaning of \"Love\" is. Try putting yourself in her shoes. You've lived your entire young life taking other lives in violent ways while seeing nothing but death and destruction around you. Then your commanding officer dies, despite you trying to save his life, and he says those last words. You then wake up in the hospital and discover that you're part machine now but those fateful words are still with you. Wouldn't you want to discover what those words meant?\\n\\n\r\nEASY TO CARE ABOUT\\n\r\nWhat people are not understanding is that Violet is still a child, and a very innocent one at that. Yes, it may seem annoying to some people but until now she's had no mind of her own. Now she's starting wake up to that. So the question becomes as this series goes on is how she's going to deal with it when she starts to feel emotions?\\n\\n\r\nWhen I really think about it, the story isn't just about Violet. It is about the people around her in a world that is trying to move on from a devastating war. This is what the last episode of The Pacific was all about, showing the aftereffects of the war the characters fought in. If you grew up in military family like I did and spoken with veterans like I have you would understand this well. Violet has yet to realize that her existence and what she's trying to accomplish may bring a great deal of change in the world and bring peace to those who were effected by the war. \\n\\n\r\nA story like this has to take its time to develop and unfortunately this doesn't work for most anime watchers. With the way its going now it may look formulaic and even predictable. Some I'm sure will think that the episodes are nothing but filler, but I'm pretty convinced that the final delivery will be very much worth it in the end. If I were to provide an example of what kind of story this is I strongly recommend an old movie from 1946 called \"The Best Years of our Lives\". Watch that movie and then maybe you will understand this anime better.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very rare and very risky to make an anime that isn't what you usually see in this media. And that's the reason why I like this anime and why I will be sticking with to the very end. Hopefully you'll come to understand it as I have. For now I'm only going to give this anime an 8 since it's too early to tell if this show will be a masterpiece in terms of story telling. I do believe, however, that it has all the potential to be one.\\n\\n\r\nI'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned!",

            "content": "Empathy. That is the key characteristic of this anime. To empathise with people is understanding your own feelings and that is what Violet Evergarden skillfully achieves.\r\nThe show consists of short stories where Violet (MC) writes for people all around the country for various reasons. And their stories are sweet, sad, lovely with a dab of heart crushing. The writing and directing of the different forms of love, was so incredibly sincere and heartfelt, making Violet significantly grow emotionally as a character.\r\nViolet evergarden will be known for its great visuals but what struck me is its incredible sound design. So much care was put into everysound which really makes the world come alive. So much that the music can get distracting initially. But don\u2019t get me wrong the music is great, its soft and elegant, which just adds to the beauty to the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end these type of anime have their own genre, as slice of life, emotional, drama. And this anime will be the thumbnail for all of them.",

            "content": "Originally a light novel written by Kana Atsuki, Violet Evergarden won the grand prize in the 5th annual Kyoto Animation Award in 2014, which probably heavily contributed to its tremendous hype. Four years later, in 2018, when KyoAni, a studio highly regarded for its beautiful art and animation style (and for actually drawing noses...), started airing their adaption of Violet Evergarden, many viewers were left confused, with pretty controversial opinions regarding the show. Having just finished the show, I'd like to add my two cents on it.\r\nViolet Evergarden (further abbreviated \"VE\" for conveniency) headed into the 2018 Winter Anime Season with an enormous amount ofhype, even landing itself a place on MAL's top 30 anime list before it aired (if you care about MAL rankings). Personally, having not read the LN and judging the series solely on the synopsis (not a big fan of PV's), I honestly wasn't too hyped. Add this to the fact the Netflix bought the rights to it, I was looking forward to the new Hibike! Euphonium movies more than VE. \\n\\n\r\nNow when episode 1 aired, I was completely taken aback. Minutes into the first episode, I was completely entranced, when Violet's pen dropped, and the wind dramatically blew a letter she was writing (by hand) into the skies, where it fluttered around for quite a while in a Disney-esque manner, with KyoAni showing off their animation and background artwork (once again). Unfortunately, KyoAni didn't really follow a great first episode with a great second episode, but nonetheless, the feeling that the first episode gave me definitely stuck with me. This immediately became a show where I would eagerly await the next episode, even through the more boring episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow in regards to MAL's 5 rating categories, I will admit that I will look at everything both objectively and subjectively, but I assure you that I won't be unreasonable. So without any further ado...\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8:\\n\r\nFirst off, I'll probably save some of the story for the character sub-section, since characters develop because of the story.\\n\r\nThe story of VE was probably one of it's weakest links, that is, if and only if the watcher is looking for some overarching plot that connects the beginning to the end. Whereas VE does have this with Violet's journey which will \"reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully lead to self-discovery\" (MAL's synopsis), the end point isn't what makes the story of VE special. Instead, the anime adaptation takes an episodic approach. In other words, VE is a story less about how each episode manages to contribute to the plot, and more how each episode contains a story that happens because of the plot. To elaborate, it's not that Violet writes letters for other people as a doll that makes the story of VE great, but instead that because Violet is a doll, she is able to make the interactions with other people (that have quite a bit a \"feels\", IMO). Because of this, VE seems to sometimes lack a flow and direction (especially in the first few episodes). The episodic approach sometimes causes problems with the pacing, which makes sense, considering that some stories are better, more significant, more important, etc. than the some of the other stories, and giving them all equal screen time means the pacing might be off. Generally, however, I feel like the more touching episodes had pretty good pacing, and managed to use all 20 minutes wisely. Despite the simple plot of Violet trying to find out what love is, her interactions with people through writing letters for them really makes for a lot of emotion. Some might find these interactions melodramatic, and consider it to use way to much Pathos, but I found these scenes quite touching. Personally, the episodes that were good (pretty much everything past ep 4) managed to excuse some of the earlier episodes that weren't as good and some plotholes (more on this in character section), which is why I give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10:\\n\r\nHonestly, even if I found every single aspect of this show to be completely crap, I'd watch it just for the art- that's how good it is (looking at some other comments on the episode discussions and on other reviews, it does seem like there are people that feel this way anyways). Anyways, KyoAni always delivers, but even for them, this was one of their better works (possibly because of a higher budget from selling it to Netflix?). You can tell that a lot of detail was taken into drawing the characters (KyoAni should do more 19-20th century European style stuff) and the backgrounds were stunning as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9:\\n\r\nI've heard some people say that the orchestral and piano background music gets a bit repetitive, but for me, the background OST never really got boring. For the most part, the OST fit the scenes perfectly, especially in the more dramatic scenes. The OP, Sincerely (which was sung by TRUE), was pretty good, but I did feel like it got a bit boring after the first few times I heard it. I felt like Minore Chihara's Michishibure, the ED, fit the anime a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7:\\n\r\nI liked this show, so it's pretty hard for me to admit that the the \"character\" sub-category is one that could've been done a lot better. At first, Violet is quite the boring character, only knowing how to follow orders. Even to the end, I found it hard to relate to Violet, often finding that it was easier to relate to some of the side-characters, since Violet seemed to have little flaws, and just a personality which seems to be fake. The anime sure could've of done a better job of showing why Violet was the way she was earlier, and even in the episodes where we did get backstory of Violet's character, I felt that Violet's character could've been shown better. However, the anime adaptation does a great job of character development (which I've heard is one spot the light novel lacked at). The adaptation did show Violet learning how to write a letter, although it is strange that Violet went from being able to write a short sincere letters to being able to write long, beautiful ones. Again, Violet's interaction with others through working as a doll drives the anime again. Through this, Violet is able to grow as a person, and by interpreting other's thoughts and writing them as pure emotion, she learns emotions herself. She grows from a girl only able to obey orders to a girl that is able to fully express emotion and realize what love is. One key word you might notice is the last sentence: girl. Yes, Violet is only 14, yet is basically a superhuman ninja (to be fair it is marked as \"fantasy\"). Because of these points, I consider a 7 for character a fairly reasonable score for VE.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9:\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, VE was an anime that I looked forward it's release every single week. I found it entertaining, even through the more boring episodes. Yes, the spectacular Art and Sound do play a role in this, but I enjoyed seeing Violet being able to grow from episode to episode (whether it be a small growth or an big growth), despite not being able to fully relate to her as a character. I particularly enjoyed the latter half of the series, seeing bonds between lovers, parents and children, etc. grow. Even though there are plotholes, particularly in the character area, I have to admit that I started tearing up ep 9 and 10. I believe that, coupled with breathtaking animation and sound, Violet's growth by writing heartwarming letters that told wonderful and emotional stories brought us truly special, something to be cherished for the years coming.\\n\\n\r\nOverall~ 8.6\\n\\n\r\nNote: I haven't read the LN, but I have heard that the LN excludes Violet learning how to write letters, but does include more backstory. \\n\r\nAnother Note: This is my first review on this site, so I'll gladly welcome any feedback.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden has been hyped up to unreasonable levels that it could never hope to live up to over the past year. Let alone, scrape even the bottom of its potential. This anime is nothing more than a cheap, uninspired, husk of a drama that thinks it knows what makes other dramas work and try to replicate that. The author doesn't have a clear understanding of how to write good drama or what their work even wants to be at times. \r\nIts focus is split between making violet grow as a character from her traumatic experience in the war and the people she meets whohelp her in becoming an actual person. The problem is, it doesn't do enough of either to make you invested in the world or its characters. Everyone in the story is forgettable and doesn't have enough screen time since it keeps adding in new characters every episode. The post war setting is an interesting take as it's not heavily action focused and more on how it affects people thereafter. This could have been used as a great opportunity to focus on the economic side effects this has on the people but alas its attention lies elsewhere with nobles and artists whom you can't develop an attachment to. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is always moving and you'll be left wondering how months or seemingly years have passed with violet writing letters and she'll have suddenly developed to be more empathetic between episodes. This creates a pacing problem and disconnect between the viewer and violet's character. It's especially hard to latch on to violet as a compelling character since we're treated to such an agonizing first 3 episodes, that if you follow the 3 episode rule, you'll have dropped immediately. This is by far the weakest part of the show and makes enjoying the rest all the more difficult. \\n\\n\r\nIt finally starts to pick up in episode 4 and this is where the show for me, instantly became more enjoyable, comparing what we had before to now just made me happy we were getting somewhere. Unfortunately all the progress the middle half of the show makes, goes down the drain towards the end. It all falls apart again with it now wanting to be an action driven show once Violet has matured. This creates a jarring plot that is conflicted on what it wants to be. The soldier's fighting the rebels was what I would have liked the show to focus on earlier. If it was gonna do it at all and not half ass it to make a more action driven climax that it didn't need. This also leads me to believe the author doesn't have enough faith in his work to carry it all the way to the end. To top it all off, the \"big reveal\" that completely goes against the point of Violet Evergarden and shows once again, this author understands their work as little as the fans do.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also forgettable, it sounds like your typical drama soundtrack. it has emotion but unless you feel a deep attachment to the show, it won't stick with you. kinda like how fate is full of generic \"epic\" music. The art is the only standout thing in the show and is probably what caught your attention in the first place if you watched it. Being produced by Kyoto animation, this comes as no surprise. \\n\\n\r\nWrapping up, I'll admit i went in to the show with very high expectations, (no thanks to its fanbase who will swear up and down that its the greatest drama/character piece) and reacted as passionately with disdain for the show as the people who loved it. If there's any lesson to learn from Violet Evergarden, it's that hype can CERTAINLY be a bad thing and make you enjoy it even less than if you went in with no expectations at all.",

Every episode has its plot and every plot is amazing and has a meaning behind it, the plot were pretty dark, that was the reason I was crying every episode like I mentioned before. I've watched only 10 episodes so far, so this is not final score. I'll edit it when I will complete the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 ---> This is best art I've ever seen in Anime TV series... really. It is so stunning!!! And watching it in 1080p is just heaven!\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 ---> Again... best soundtrack ever in anime!! It's different soundtrack from other anime, but it just fit the art in this enviroment of this anime so much!!! So stunning. Sound made the feelings of the anime to the TOP!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 ---> Every character in this anime has its importancy in anime, every character is a bit different and they act really logical. Also, in every episode, I got introduced to a new characters, and they are made really well!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 ---> Enjoyment was amazing! It felt like I was watching really high budget movie in every minute. The sound... the art... PERFECT!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10",

            "content": "I'm surprised to see a lot of reviews with grades below 6 from people that didn't see more than 4 episodes. Violet Evergarden is a dialogue driven drama that became my \"weekly dose of uncontrollable crying\" since ep. 5. You can't expect a show about a girl that writes letters to be an action packed sakuga fest because you saw a trailer with some sequences of war. This is a psychological \"coming of age\" story about different forms of love and about overcoming ptsd. It is what it is, so it must be judged by that, not by vaguely founded expectations. The slow start isunderstandable. You can't expect a good story (at least in this genre) without proper character building. \\n\\n\r\nAbot my scores:\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nVery good story, good writing and a great deal of originality. You won't really find cliche character tropes. Violet is a complex continuously evolving protagonist and the rest of the cast is believable. This is as much as I go, because I'm struggling very hard to not go into spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, Violet Evergarden has the best art in the history of episodic show (close to film level quality).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OST has mostly soft and highly emotional pieces that generally feature stringed instruments. The songs are really well timed and greatly increase the emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nSince this show is about Violet, this mark is for her alone. Episodic characters are good, but Violet is the only one that matters when you think about character development in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAs I said, this is my \"weekly dose of uncontrollable crying\" .\\n\\n\r\nSo, just another thought: If you can't sit through dialogue and have a level of empathy lower than a rock, this show is not for you. But if you want something to make you spend all your pocket money on tissues, then you should definitely watch Violet Evergarden.",

            "content": "I hate Violet Evergarden. It feels so cartoonish and lazy. - Me, 2018\r\nOkay I was wrong. I was so damn WRONG! - Also me, 2019\r\nMy story of Violet Evergarden\r\nThis is one of those moments that can be described as a \u2018turn upside-down\u2019 situation for me. To be honest with you, I don\u2019t like Violet Evergarden at the first place (at least after watching the first episode). My friend first introduced me by giving one of its trailer, and holy what a beautiful and exquisite animation. I think it was somewhere between 3 or 4 months before the series got aired, and I\u2019m so mad hypeabout this \u2018Violet Evergarden\u2019 thing. Back then I was clearly thinking that this anime, this whatever so-called typewriter anime, could win the best anime of the year. I got chills, the trailer made me had some incredible goosebumps. Looking back at what KyoAni has achieved in the past years, I certainly believe that Violet Evergarden could be the next CLANNAD.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first episode aired, I\u2019m one of the first person amongst my -fellow anime watchers- friend to watch it. I gotta say, I'm terribly disappointed with it, to the part than I bashed this anime so hard by saying things like; \u201cExcuse me wtf?\u201d, \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d, \u201cKyoAni are you serious?\u201d, \u201cWhere is the characterization?\u201d. After sometime, few episodes have already available in the stream but I left this series unchecked, slowly forgotten by time. A good friend of mine confront me to give it another shot, he was convinced when he said \u201c Yeah, the series is getting better and better\u201d (at that time, it was episode 5). I objected his argument by saying that \u201cWatching this series is no more than a waste of time\u201d. And so on, he never tried to convince me again. \\n\\n\r\nSince then, Violet Evergarden never came to my mind. I never heard spoilers of it, not even a single line from its delicious \u2018quotes\u2019. It came to my mind after another friend of mine (from another group) was talking about anime, and he mentioned Violet Evergarden as one of his favourites. Reason? \u201cTear jerking\u201d, \u201cSad\u201d, and he ended up by saying, \u201cJust watch the damn show and you will understand\u201d. Stubbornly, I still quite convinced that he\u2019s just one of those weak personality who just can\u2019t deny melodrama bullsh*t that happens to air rapidly on the internet. \\n\\n\r\nIt was 3 months after that, I was confronted again by another friend, and this time he\u2019s damn sure I\u2019m going to watch this Violet Evergarden sometime in the future. Nope, that didn\u2019t happen. It was 2 months after that, I was convinced by another friend that just finished the series. He told me that the series was \u201cFFS IT\u2019S SO GOOD\u201d, so I finally decided to let go my ego and \u2018try\u2019 not to be a dick on this series (although I am for like the past, what, 8 or 9 months?). I watched episode one again, still not interested but the feel of that \u2018I\u2019m disappointed\u2019 is long gone. I remember watching the first four episodes on day 1, and I gotta say I got goosebumps. Pretty okay series for me, but this time it got my curiosity hard. \\n\\n\r\nDay two, I proceed myself to watch episode 5, and what a lot of content did I miss. \u201cHoly shit\u201d. That\u2019s what I said at the end of the episode. Say no more brother, I\u2019m binging this to the end. And then, I watched it until episode 10, then I stopped. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t have time to finish it, but I\u2019m tired.\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I tired? \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s beat it. This series was so miserably, tearjerkingly sad, that I cried like almost every episodes after episode 5 and reach the climax of climax on the tenth episode. It is by far, the most beautiful and touching anime I\u2019ve ever watched (to this day, I\u2019ve watched more than 85 series). The combination of everything, the music, the art, the characterization (which I bashed earlier), the flow, the, like everything composed extremely exquisite to the point of \u201cI don\u2019t want this series to end, but it has to end because my feelings can\u2019t take it anymore\u201d. I finished the rest of the series on the next day, and I\u2019m well fed with warmth and glorious unexplained feelings. \\n\\n\r\nI gotta say, I have mistaken myself on the first place by saying that this series is a bullcrap, lazy anime for dragging mainstream audiences by using cheesy, melodramatic sequences. No, I love Violet Evergarden, every single part of it, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s flawless. It\u2019s just I\u2019m flattered and surprised by how good this anime is. I know that some people are saying Violet Evergarden as a whack overrated slice of life, but hey, people have their own opinions. For me, the experience was indescribable, I was immensely invested as the series unfolds chapters of chapters from a different kind of storytelling. In the end, it was a memorable show, one that will not ever be forgotten easily by time. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry Violet, it was a let down at first. Rest assured, because now I\u2019ve seen the truth of yours, masterfully painted on a dimension we entertained of.\\n\r\nI really wish an Auto Memoir Doll could write this review for me.\\n\\n",

I only watch subbed because I am pleb and I don't understand Japanese fully yet, so I have only gotten to Episode 7, but so far this anime has been spot on and has much exceeded my expectations. I saw KyoAni, but I also saw Netflix Original, so I had my doubts. I have had very bad experiences with Netflix originals in the past, but this wonderful masterpiece has me stunned. Can someone let me know if this anime had any bad influence on themor something good? Any reply would be great really. I hope you all have a wonderful day.  (Please message me I have no friends.)",

            "content": "Emotion.\r\nOne of the most pivotal and important parts of our nature that makes us who we are. We feel things, good and bad, but these emotions are what makes us human, and can be very strong.\r\nWords.\r\nWhat we mostly use to convey emotions. Words give us ways to communicate and express ourselves to others, and is an a major gift that we humans created for each other.\r\nEveryday there are many messages that we tell others with the use of these two things, sometimes verbally, sometimes using text, like an email or chat. Most people often converse with people on a daily basis, and it\u2019s an importantpart of our lives, and nowadays we have the wonders of modern technology to give us long distance conversations without breaking a sweat. However, in the past, long distance conversations were not so easy, as we didn\u2019t have technology to achieve that. So what did we do back then? We wrote messages physically on a piece of paper, and those messages were called letters.\\n\\n\r\nBack then, when long distance conversing was more difficult. Letters were something sent only occasionally rather than constantly, and thus they were needed to contain and convey as many emotions and thoughts as possible through it\u2019s words. Thus, letters were an essential thing back then, as they were the object that could bridge the distance between two people and let them convey those emotions through words, and thus held a lot of power and importance.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden tells story is about a girl learning the truth and meaning of all these things, emotion, words, letters, and more. This is a coming of age tale, where a young girl named Violet sets out on a journey to about what emotions truly are, and why getting them across is so important. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nAfter a great war took place in the country of Telesis, the land is finally at peace, and returning to the state it held before the war. In this peaceful time, a girl wakes up, with arms of metal, devoid of emotion and waiting for orders. Our protagonist, Violet Evergarden, was originally a \u201cweapon\u201d that was given to Major Gilbert Bougainvillea to help win the war. He gave orders to the girl to do things, and she would execute them, mostly to kill or decimate certain troops. In the final battle of the war, both Gilbert and Violet were gravely injured, in where Gilbert told Violet the words \u201cI love you\u201d, and ordered her to live. Violet however did not understand these words, and collapsed in the battle.\\n\\n\r\nAwake now, a former commander in the army close to Gilbert named Hodgins Claudia tells her that Gilbert entrusted her care to him for now, and that she should do her best to find a job and live a normal life. She learns about the job of an Auto Memory Doll, an occupation where they will write things for people with a typewriter, often letters, scripts, and more. After learning about the occupation and how much it\u2019s tied to conveying emotions and words, she chooses to become one, and the show then follows Violet\u2019s journey as a doll, to learn more about emotions, and to learn the meaning of the words that Gilbert left her with. \\n\\n\r\nThis show starts off slow, and I mean sloooow. Half of the first few episodes are mostly worldbuilding and setting up the characters and their occupations, without giving much actual development into any of the characters. This does not help because Violet initially starts off being completely emotionless and blunt, to the point it could be frustrating how she can\u2019t do tasks or talk to people properly due to it. It is an obvious that it\u2019s an intentional detail, and it makes sense why, but that doesn\u2019t help make the show feel so slow at the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once the show hooks you in, it does a good job at keeping you in. After the first few episodes, the show switches more to an episodic nature, where Violet goes to different places to do her job at being a doll, introducing new characters and new stories that are concluded by the end of their episode. For the majority of the first 3 episodes does not develop very much, but by the end of the third episode, she shows her first sign of growth, as simple as it is. After that moment, the show begins it\u2019s episodic nature, and by each one, she slowly grows as a character and learns more about emotions. As that happens, she becomes easier to enjoy as it becomes a lot easier to emphasise with her through following her experiences. By episode 5, I was personally hooked, because Violet had finally shown enough growth where she was easy enough to care for her. \\n\\n\r\nDue to how episodic the show is, it has a lot of substories that take place, where each character has a problem and it\u2019s up to Violet to help them out of it, be it by writing messages, talking to the characters, and interacting with them. These mini stories tend to be extremely heartwarming, as most of them use close relationships people have with one another as a theme. They are relatable, and extremely engrossing at times, letting you care for the characters and their problems a lot in the short amount of time they take up. By the end of the episode, the characters end it satisfyingly, and it can get really emotional seeing the characters\u2019 state by the end of each one, but more on that later.\\n\\n\r\nIt had a slow start, but since then, it only got better and better with a few episodes slowing down the quality. I can only say, trudge through the first third or half, it might be hard, but it\u2019s intentional, and you\u2019ll find it absolutely pays off later. If you aren\u2019t hooked by halfway, feel free to drop it, but until then, let the show dig down it\u2019s roots. Because afterwards, the show will begin to really shine, and it\u2019s quality does not disappoint as Violet goes through great amounts of growth, and the stories she takes parts of can get extremely heartwarming or emotional. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 (Can\u2019t do an 11 damnit.)\\n\\n\r\nHoooo man this is pretty much as close as you can get to an objective doozie, no question about it. Alright, take A Silent Voice\u2019s animation, decrease the precision linework quality for the TV budget, and instead replace it with a more stylised, wavy, paint-like aesthetic. Add lighting and colors of that of an artist\u2019s painting, and give it impressive sakuga-like animation throughout the whole show that emphasizes all the small details and movements in almost every scene. What do you get from that? You get this show\u2019s art style, and it stays at that quality the ENTIRE TIME. \\n\\n\r\nI do not kid you when I say this is easily one of the best looking anime, if not THE BEST looking anime that I have ever watched. The art style is nothing less than amazing, it\u2019s like cocaine for your eyes. The animation is just downright gorgeous, from the color usage, designs, detail, and movement, it\u2019s almost like like an animated painting. I have honest to god trouble imagining how the heck Kyoto Animation did this, especially for the budget. They seem to have changed the art style to be more inconsistently-based yet remaining beautiful and stable, make it easier to animate rather than cut back on the art itself. \\n\\n\r\nThis show looks amazing, the actual art is full of details and touches that make it look so graceful. The lighting, I cannot emphasise how well they did the lighting, it is perfect, scenes look convincing and real. It\u2019s easily one of the best looking shows I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, and I cannot merely describe how amazing Kyoto Animation did on this. They have absolutely outdone themselves even more so than usual, and they deserve a serious bravo for their efforts.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects done by Kyoto Animation is completely solid, but first I\u2019ll talk about the score. The music tracks are mostly serene with really well played out tracks that use a variety of music. There isn\u2019t a lot of quick paced music, and only occasionally there are some dramatic tracks with orchestra for the scenes that require some intensity in it, but most of it works to either set the tone of the scene, or to pull at your heartstrings. Nothing really stands out especially, but I mean that in a good way, since the OST overall is extremely good and nothing is unfitting. \\n\\n\r\nI will say, the opening Sincerely is really well done. True\u2019s vocals are godlike here, reaching a smooth, classy tune that works well with the instrumental. The lyrics conveyed Violet\u2019s emotions so well, that as I watched the show, I found the song getting more emotional as I got to understand and get attached to Violet herself. The ending song also deserves mention, and while personally, I like the OP more, I can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s done just as well, with vocals that give it a feeling of nostalgia and maturity. The insert song Violet Snow is also an insert song that really helped some scenes shine, it had a feeling of youthful hope similar that of a fairy tale. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual sound effects and foley are really what pushed this thing to such a high score. Little details are realistic and well thought out, and sound convincing. I want to bring special mention to everytime Violet uses her metallic hands and the sounds that are made during their movements, Stuff like that elevate the sound to a high degree, even if most of the tracks themselves don\u2019t stand out with the exception of the few. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are simply amazing and absolutely made the show for me, although it\u2019s not apparent at first. In the first two episodes, Violet is absolute cardboard due to the way the story is structured, with no personality whatsoever, and blunt to the point it\u2019s inhuman (which is the point). The supporting cast in the first two episodes are the main recurring cast, and don\u2019t have a huge amount to them, you get to understand their character types, familiarise with them, but that\u2019s it. They don\u2019t have a lot of depth to them, and are admittedly for the most part, just supporting cast that occasionally plays a role in certain episodes depending on the circumstance. They don\u2019t develop often with the few (surprisingly notable) exceptions, and asides from their personalities, don\u2019t add too much in the initial episodes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what the recurring supporting cast lacks, is made up in the episodic supporting cast. Remember how I said a majority of episodes follow that episodic format? Where a shorter story takes place with characters that are only really relevant in that episode? Well, it\u2019s these episodes where we\u2019re introduced to the characters that really help make the show so great in terms of it\u2019s story, but to do that, I also have to explain the other factor.\\n\\n\r\nThat other factor, is Violet herself. As the show premise suggests, her goal is to learn more about emotions, and learn to understand the meaning of the words Gilbert left with her. As I\u2019ve stated multiple times before, she begins with no personality whatsoever other than pure, inhumane bluntness, and no self worth. She acts like a robot, a tool, which was exactly how she was meant to be, and Kyoto Animation portrayed her in that state perfectly, at the cost making her unrelatable, hard to emphasise with, and hard to like from the get go.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the show goes on, she slowly begins to develop. She slowly learns emotion, bit by bit, and how does she do that? By helping out the supporting characters with their problems through the letters and writings that she creates. She is the trigger, a catalyst that allows for the supporting characters to either develop immensely, or allow the viewer to emphasise with in each of their respective episodes. She helps them to conclude whatever problem they have by the end of their episodes, and through this, Violet herself develops by witnessing and helping these supporting characters. Eventually, she becomes more human and relatable as each episode goes by, learning more about emotions, what it means to be human, and what love truly is. She develops so much and learns so much, and by the end of it, both the supporting cast and Violet herself come out stronger than they\u2019ve been before the episode began, all because they were each there to help each other. \\n\\n\r\nThis dynamic made the show immensely heartwarming and enjoyable for me, to see so many touching scenes with the characters from the support of Violet, and for her to learn about what it means to be human through these events. This process was amazing and made for some extreme growth for both parties. I was able to emphasise with both the episodic supporting cast and Violet herself to an extreme level. Watching Violet grow so much in so many different ways, and see her learn both good and bad things, become stronger through that, and emphasise with her, has made her evolve into one of my favorite characters in all of anime, and that is something to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe first two or three episodes were really slow, and at first I wasn\u2019t having fun with the series very much. It was mildly entertaining enough, but due to the focus worldbuilding, in trade of lack of initial depth and relatability to any of the characters. Without any hook for my interest other than the art, I wasn\u2019t a fan of it at first. However this is an show that builds itself over time, and as that time goes on Violet herself and the supporting characters make this show what it is. After the initial slowness, once Violet starts her development, the show keeps improving by developing her every episode, letting her help others, let them grow, and in turn she grows more herself. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s when this happens, the level of enjoyment skyrockets far past the slowness of the initial two episodes, and it keeps that quality for the majority of the remaining run. The ending was also satisfying as hell, and while I could have some more stories of Violet doing her job, the show itself does not need anything more, as by the end, the story does everything it sets out to do, and ends on an extremely conclusive and satisfying note. It wasn\u2019t fun at first, but once I managed to enjoy myself, I could not stop having a blast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a show that really, really got to me in the end. Art-wise, no question about it, it is godlike and little will compare with it other than high budget movie animation, or Kyoani\u2019s future works made after the writing of this review. Story-wise It does have an extremely slow start, with no character to emphasise with at first, and only worldbuilding to go off of. It sets the tone and setting well, but does nothing to make you really care for it other than maybe the supporting cast\u2019s quirky personalities, or maybe the potential for the show to kick off later on.\\n\\n\r\nHowever as I\u2019ve said, the show absolutely kicks off later on. Once Violet begins that first step of growth, and sets out to do her job, the sub stories and the characters in it all make the show as good as it is. It\u2019s a mixture of the extreme overall development for the majority of the the characters that take part in the stories, the heartwarming tales that result from the problems that get resolved in each episode get more and more emotional as you see Violet grow and understand the true impact and meaning that emotions can hold. \\n\\n\r\nI randomly brought up two terms and explained them at the beginning of this review, words and emotion. That is because, this show has made me appreciate these two things so much more than I did before watching it. Emotions are what make us human, and as Violet has shown, allow us to emphasise, feel, and care for one another. Words, a tool for communicating to one another, allowing us to convey these emotions to one another. The way Violet uses her letters to change those around her, and change herself, is what makes this show an absolute masterpiece. The importance and meaning that these things possess in our lives is immense, and they can create some very impactful moments.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a story about the importance of emotions and conveying them through words. It\u2019s a story where people grow from the actions and support of others, and the importance of the relationships we have with one another. We affect each other\u2019s lives, and change each other, and that is why I hold Violet Evergarden in such high regard. By the end of the show, Violet has evolved so much, and it made me so proud to see the growth she had gone through when all was said and done. I highly, highly recommend it to anyone, even though you\u2019ll have to trudge through the first few episodes, because once you do, you are in for an extremely emotional, and touching ride.\\n\\n\r\nPS. I teared up quite a bit while writing this review, and became a sobbing mess while recalling all that made this show hit so close to home by the end. This was not an easy write up to go through, I'll tell you that much.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden has been hyped to the max for the past year so there was a lot of anticipation built up for this show. This may have turned people away once it started because while audiences unfamiliar with the source material (like myself) were expecting something a little less slice of life and a little more action/war oriented, they were thrown off by the plot of the show being a little tamer than originally expected. I am not sure why they were expecting that since it was Kyoto Animation after all that animated this series and 99 percent of what they do is slice oflife. That being said, nobody does slice of life as well as KyoAni and I must say that this is my second favorite series of theirs yet right after Hibike/Sound Euphonium (although it might be tied with Chuunibyou).  \\n\\n\r\nPlot/story: Violet Evergarden is a show about a young lady (around 14) trying to figure out what her commander meant when he told her \"I love you\". You see, Violet was taught at a very young age how to be an excellent officer and her entire life was dedicated to her commander, Major Gilbert. She only looked to him for orders and was completely lost without him to order her around. One day, although actually night, while fighting a battle, they are both wounded and the commander pushed violet to safety right before a pile of rubble fell around them, seemingly crushing the Major. \\n\r\nAfterwords, she becomes an auto memories doll, a person who writes/types letters at the behest of clients, whether it be a love letter or a simple delivery order. At first she isn't great at it because despite the fact that she is inhumanly fast on the typewriter, she has no empathy and thus can't transcribe the clients emotions into the letter. This series mainly focuses on Violets journey about her character development on learning how to emphasize with others through her letters. And this is where the series shines since it is done beautifully. We see Violets transformation take place throughout the series until the end when she figures out what love means and what the Major meant.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: What can I say other than Kyoto Animation continues to amaze me with their animation. Everything looks beautiful and the attention to detail is impeccable and the action is fluid. This may be their best looking show yet. The face expressions and body movement and the colors are enticing to watch and look very realistic. My only nitpick is that a few of the male characters are hard to tell apart because the designs and colors are similar.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST is beautiful and blends seamlessly into the show. I really like the OST Torment but the entire OST is amazing. The OP is amazing with a great song Sincerely by TRUE (who also sings both OPs of Hibike/Sound Euphonium). It really sets the mood for the show. The main ED, Michishirube by Minori Chihara is another nice fitting song although visually it isn't as interesting as the OP. The other vocal OST tracks are also nice to listen to and also seam well into the emotion aof the scenes that they appear. I haven't heard the original Japanese dub but I can say the I thought the English dub was good if not great. The only voice actor that bothered me slightly was Violets but not because it was bad but because it was her character to not be emotionally invested, but later in the series I didn't have a problem with the voice acting.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is where many have trouble liking the show because Violet is the only character with a good amount of screen time and in the beginning, she isn't a likable character. But if you stick it out past the first couple of episodes be prepared for one of the best cases of character development ever told in anime. It may seem hard to believe that Violet changes so drastically in under 13 episodes, but the show is so well paced episodically and the changes in character are shown so intricately, that it isn't just believable, but done as well as could be. Each episode Violet learns more about emotions and how to show them or what certain feelings within her mean. In the beginning, she needed orders but in the end she makes up her own mind and doesn't need orders anymore. The way she coped with the Majors death in the middle of the show and the end of the show were drastically different. In the end, instead of being helped emotionally by others, she helped others emotionally. I could really go on forever about Violets character but I will move on. There are other minor characters that get development but I don't think they contribute much to the story compared to Violet. I will say that Major Gilberts older brother gets some development. The other auto memory dolls don't get a lot of screen time but they are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This was a very enjoyable series which I could and will watch many more times in the future. I normally can't stand slice of life since I need to like the characters in order to be invested in what is going on but I am normally not sucked in by the characters. But this show pulled it off. I teared up multiple times throughout this show and I think everyone should watch it through to the end instead of dropping it at the first episode. Although a show can't be enjoyed by everyone, I really can't recommend this series enough. Watch it. It is on Netflix so it is easy to access legally. There is romance, drama, slice of life, action, and suspense so there is something for everyone to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nAdditional Comments: This show isn't perfect. I had small complaints occasionally and there was a lot of controversy in some moments. First, I hope there is a season two because there are plot threads which haven't been tied up yet. Second, there were times where Violet being only 14 (it is only an estimate in the show) was a tad unbelievable seeing what she did in battle at an even younger age and what she was doing in the show. Lastly, the anime strayed a little from the manga in certain aspects. Some good, like the lack of magic, but some more controversial like the fate of the Major (and I won't get into more detail except to say that I personally preferred the anime version than what happened in the manga). Also, I really like the world that this show is set in. I also really like the fact that there was a scene where a little girl confused Violet as a real doll as opposed to only an auto memories doll.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This show is unique and has something for everyone. While flawed with a weak beginning and controversial ending, it is definitely one of the more heart wrenching shows that anime has produced and I could watch this again and again and still enjoy it. I honestly believe from a technical standpoint (sound and animation), this show might be the best ever made. Please give Violet Evergarden a chance.  \\n\\n\r\nScore: 10: A masterpiece and so good that i would watch it again and again and again\\n\\n",

            "content": "A thrilling and sorrowful anime, Violet Evergarden. Once seen, never omit. Outstanding animation, fortuitously proficient in visual quality as if every episode was a movie. A fitting and adaptive story and much more. \r\nStory : 10/10\r\nThe story was marvelous. It mostly focuses on the main character of the anime, \"Violet Evergarden\". Although some scenes within the anime may be slightly timid due to the anime trying to adapt from the LN. The story is complex and it requires a fair amount of deep understanding. \r\nArt : 10/10\r\nI am speechless, I have nothing to say about the art. It is rigorously a masterpiece. This is literallywhat you would expect from a movie budget. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\\n\r\nSure, the anime's genre is \"Slice Of Life\" which means that it mostly focuses on the main character's development. However, some other important people within the anime are lacking character developments. For an example, Hodgins. He deserved more CD. Other than that, the main character, Violet Evergarden's character development was flawless. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending, as well as the soundtracks within this anime is  \"all right\". But it could've been better, sometimes the soundtrack in emotional moments are more like a background music instead of it expressing the condition of the scene. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10 \\n\r\nThis show is a perfection, I enjoyed it while it lasted. The main character is similar to me in real life, and it really touches me to see her develop as time passes. In which it inspired me to step out of my comfort zone. I shed tears in nearly all the episodes, sitting down on my comfy chair and watching Violet Evergarden is nothing more but an extravaganza.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is my most favorite anime of all time, although I have moved on and seen many other anime. My feelings for this anime have never changed. I recommend everyone out there to watch this anime, you won't be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThis concludes my review of the show \"Violet Evergarden\". Thank you. \\n",

            "content": "Welcome to another of Robert's Too Late Reviews! Only this time, we're not too late at all, really. I'm going to break with many of my fellow reviewers here and really thumbs up this anime for all I'm worth, and there's a reason for that. I am NOT coming from the viewpoint of a literary snob, critiquing the changes made from the novel or manga series. Being a literary snob in regards to American culture (do NOT get me started on Star Wars movies vs books) means I do understand where the criticism is coming from, and I don't take from it's value whatsoever. Butcoming in with 'virgin' eyes, I find a great deal to like, even love about this series. Will Violet make the RTLR wall or even shelves of greatness? Of note, we're as always doing dubbed. Let's do this thing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nI have read knocks not only on MAL, but also in other places too that say the story is unoriginal and lacking in inspiration. Well, let me tell you people, there is nothing new under the sun. That originality everyone seems to be chasing isn't original. Hell, take Game of Thrones, one of the biggest tv series around, good bit of it is based on history. For all intents and purposes, the story of a creature who wants to be more, or understand better can be dated at least back to 1883, with the invention of Pinocchio, if not even farther than that. Originality is nothing more than inspiration from sources you've not seen yet. Violet is a bit Pinocchio, a bit Spock, a bit Data, but yet still herself. To knock the story because it's derivative is juvenile in perspective. As a writer myself, I can promise you that your most cherished 'original' work borrows (or outright steals) from other works before it, only with a slightly new spin. That's how writing works. Don't mean all this vitriol at the beginning but to knock Violet's story is to take something away from the viewer, and Violet is a wonderful series overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is framed around Violet being presented as emotionless and desperately wanting to know what her Major meant when he said he loved her right before they were separated in a war tragedy. She takes a job as a scribe learning about feelings little by little until she reaches a point where it all makes sense. The problem with this setup is, almost immediately we see she does in fact know what love is. She loves the Major with all her heart, she just doesn't understand the words for the feelings she has. \\n\\n\r\nFor a character presented as being fairly emotionless, she has a great deal of emotions, though she is very poorly equipped to handle them. She knows loneliness, she knows grief and pain, and she even comes to know regret and guilt. The true story is Violet coming to terms with feelings she's had. At the beginning of the show, her new caretaker, and the Major's commanding officer, tells her she is burning. The point of the show is her coming to realize he's right. That she burns for her past mistakes, she burns for her past losses, that she burns from regret, and that the war left her terribly scarred. \\n\\n\r\nBecause she was a child soldier she was taught to suppress these feelings (we assume, this is never explicitly stated) and her life outside the war is coming to know what real life, and real feelings is all about. About how to handle feelings she was taught to ignore or not feel at all. She is like Pinocchio, in that she feels she's something different, and wants to know what love is, even though the answer's already inside of her. She is like Data and his quest to become human. And at times she's Spock, desperately trying to deny that side of herself. Watching Violet bloom into something more than a soldier, a weapon of war, a killer, is a thrill and a joy. Does she make it? Of course she does, it would be a shitty ending if she dressed in formal uniform and blew her own brains out. The happy ending is assumed. Like every other show where the happy ending is assumed, the joy comes not from the completion of the story, but the journey of getting there. Same hold true for Violet as she comes to understand people, and ultimately herself. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe show is STUNNING. The production values are sky high, and looks every bit of it. The only complaint I have about the artwork is that some of the men are slightly similar looking. The main offenders to me are two brothers (makes sense) and the superior that takes Violet in. Every here and there, I kind of got them mixed up briefly. Otherwise, the show is just jaw dropping. This is a new high water mark in animation, as far as I'm concerned. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe background music was very fitting, rising and falling at appropriate times, and the themes are well done. The voice acting is top notch as well, Violet herself is beautifully cast, her voice perfectly matching not only the rather monotone parts where she's stiff, but also the cries of pain and suffering as she comes to understand her own feelings. The other scribe girls all sound great, the outgoing one sounding cheery, the quiet one sounding reserved, so forth. For me it's the voicing that really shone through and made this a 10 for me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nMy one big knock character-wise, there's a matronly figure that is very familiar with the superior of Violets that has most of her breasts hanging out basically all the time. Sure fanservice is what it is, but there was no need for it. She looks rather whorish to me compared to the rest of the cast. This goes especially against the grain of prim and proper Violet herself. Big breasted is fine, I have big breasted women in my family, and as a man am a fan of large ones as well, but for Christ's sake, cover them up, especially in the Victorian like setting!\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a quiet, somewhat troubled girl in the scribe department I wish I knew more about. She is covered some, but only in regards to Violet's character building. I know it was a short series, but I kinda wish I knew more about this quiet girl. The outgoing girl gets her own episode with Violet, wish quiet girl would have gotten the same level of development beyond the fact she's afraid she's no good at her job. \\n\\n\r\nViolet herself as I said is misrepresented by the summaries and media out there. She's not a creature without emotions seeking to learn them, ala Commander Data. She is full of emotion, but she has no background or basis to understand them with. It's almost immediately apparent she loves the Major with all her being, more than just relying on him because he's her commander. She just doesn't have the grounding to know what love truly is, and is confused by her own feelings. She's less \"What does love mean\" and more \"Is this feeling I have inside me love?\" Her love for the Major falls deeply into co-dependency because one she learns he is likely dead she struggles with desires to take her own life. She feels lost and unsure on how to proceed. When you find someone you cannot live without, that's love, my friends. \\n\\n\r\nViolet's journey of self discovery is fascinating in that she doesn't really know how to do it, and is guided along by friends and clients that teach her the truths of what she is really feeling. Often times she brings such powerful emotions to those teaching her that it's very moving. I admit I got misty eyed quite a few times over this series. \\n\\n\r\nFinally Violet faces a question we all do, and ones soldiers in particular must deal with: do we deserve forgiveness? Do we deserve to live after hurting others? Soldiers really struggle with this, how can they live a happy life knowing they took away the happy lives of their enemies? That they took away the happy lives of their enemies entire families? When does the blood on their hands become too much to wash off? This is why in the real world we have so many veterans lost in the bottle or suffering from serious mental illness such as PTSD, precisely because they are in Violet's shoes, wondering how to make up for the suffering they've caused. Wondering if they can ever make up for it. It gives the whole series a tragic, yet very real feeling. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI love this anime because of the fact it's about emotions and dealing with them. I'm bipolar, severely enough to the point I'm disabled from it. I overflow with emotions all the time, many of them I don't have words for. Many of them that make me scream in pain. I have worn Violet's stoic mask. I am on fire too. Maybe not for the same reasons she is, but emotion can burn us all. Watching her come to understand who she is and realize what she is feeling really resonated well with me. Add to that beautiful animation and a solid voice cast, and you have one amazing show. I just hope someday I can openly admit I love myself as she did. \\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend this series more, again as a virgin viewer with no knowledge of the light novel/manga. Let me tell you, I agree the books are always better (with very few exceptions) so I get the disappointment some people have in the series. But without that foundation in the story, taking it for what it is, it is glorious and I could not recommend it more. As for the RTLR wall, of course she scores a spot, and I have her doll membership pen coming, gonna hang it on my curtain. Two thumbs way up!",

            "content": "Plot and Story Line\r\nIf I were to explain Violet Evergarden in one sentence I would say that it is an emotional tale of a girl finding her purpose in life and peace withing her self. Still, one sentence is way to little to explain the depth of the story and actually demeaning considering the brilliance of this work.\r\nViolet is firstly introduced to us lying in a hospital, heavily injured after her long battles in the Great War. For most of her life, Violet has only been a war-tool with one purpose only:\r\nto kill the enemy. Now with the war coming to an end, the onlyremainder of her brutal past are her two mechanical hands. After a falling out with her new intended guardian family, Violet starts working at the CH Postal Service and soon enough decides to peruse a career as an \"Auto Memory Doll\"-amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into letters. By doing that, Violet interacts with many different people and so learns more about her emotions and what they actually mean. \\n\r\nI find it very hard right now to turn my thoughts on Violet Evergarden into words considering how much there actually is to it. The main story, with Violet in the center is an emotional tale of a war-torn personality who is trying to finally find peace from the anger and guilt haunting her. Finding it hard to forgive herself for what she has done in the past, Violet starts a journey that would teach her to live with her past and find new meaning in life. \\n\\n\r\nIt is Violet's emotions and character development that are in focus of this extremely moving story. What is driving the story? Three words. \"I love you\" were the last words of Major Gilbert to Violet in their final battle and now Violet is trying to find out what those words actually mean. I did cry. A lot. But you know what's interesting? I cried in every single episode of this anime. It wasn't always a sad scene, the whole anime was just extremely moving. The side stories in this anime contribute to that as well. While writing letters for others, Violet gets to know so many people and drastically influences their lives without any intention to do so. \\n\r\nThe story of Violet Evergarden is in short a very emotional tale about forgiving yourself and learning to live with your past. It is, as I'd like to call it, a character-centered story. The plot on the whole might not be that interesting, and truth is that the story of Violet's and Major Gilbert's past is much more interesting, but the anime is trying to picture Violet's character development and puts a focus solely on her, without much happening in the story. But truth is, it gets pretty exciting from time to time, especially in the war flash backs and in the end of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nOne thing that I keep repeating in this section of my reviews is the development of the main character and how it affects the story of the whole anime. Violet undergoes a tremendous character development and it is because of it that we get such a brilliant, intriguing and moving story. In the beginning she is that destroyed person, that only knows to live by orders and nothing else yet in the end turns into a person who is able to influence the lives of so many other characters in the anime. In my opinion, it is her simple character and straightforwardness that makes people realize what is actually important in life. Violet's character was broken and torn apart by the horror of war. But episode by episode, Violet tries to put those peaces together and eventually finds peace.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to other characters in the story, the side characters, it is Major Gilbert who of course has in my opinion the biggest influence. He is is the only thing that Violet holds dear and the only person who doesn't think of Violet as a war-tool. His words are those that keep Violet alive, literary. He is definitely, next to Violet my favorite character, because he showed greatness by loving and taking care of Violet despite her past. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nUp until now, the anime which I consider had the best animation that I have ever seen was ufotable's Fate/ Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, but that has definitely changed after watching Violet Evergarden. As mentioned in the intro, just by seeing the teaser trailer like one ore even two years ago, I completely fell in love with this anime. The animation is magical, the style is gorgeous, the backgrounds are breathtaking and the character design is typically KyoAni. It has a bright and colorful scenery with a lot details. \\n\r\nThe animation was definitely the best thing about this anime and I will definitely watch it again some time just because of it. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nAn intriguing and extremely moving story that portrays the struggle of a person with a war-torn personality trying to find peace and new meaning to her life. An amazing character development that makes you realize that the past should not defy who we are today. A breathtaking animation that you have hardly ever seen before. That is all Violet Evergarden and so much more at the same time. I wasn't actually planning on writing this review because I knew how hard it would be to describe a masterpiece like this one. In short, I cannot express how great the story of the Auto Memory Doll Violet Evergarden is. You just have to experience it on your own. \\n",

            "content": "At its heart, Violet Evergarden is a show about empathy. Empathy for your friends, empathy for your enemies, and most importantly, empathy for yourself. And I've never seen an anime portray love, empathy and personal growth so well. Violet Evergarden absolutely blew me away in every possible way, from its incredible visuals to the heartwrenching but beautiful storyline.\r\nThe first thing one notices while watching is the art. KyoAni has done it again, making a warm and inviting pseudo-german world as Violet's backdrop. Everything from lighting to character design is done beautifully, especially Violet. I really cannot stress enough just how beautiful Violet Evergarden is. \r\nComplementingthe astounding art is the sound. On the musical side, soft classical pieces punctuate emotional scenes. The sadder pieces are powerfully evocative and fit perfectly with the artistic theme. The opening and ending are wonderful. The character voices are also beautiful - every voice suited their character and conveyed more than enough emotion to bring you to tears.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of tears - the storyline. Oh, the storyline. Violet Evergarden focuses on the growth of the titular Violet, on her journey to find out what love is. That's the way she describes it. As you watch, however, it's clear there's more to it than that. Violet wants to understand herself, and understand others. She wants to process her grief - to realize the 'fire burning inside her' and move on from it. The way she learns is by empathizing with others. On her travels she meets different people, all with their stories to tell. These stories are often incredibly sad, and many episodes had me sobbing throughout. Each character feels incredibly real, and their sadness intensely palpable.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden takes death seriously. There's no 'maybe they'll come back', no fakeouts, no near misses. Death is a part of life, but as Violet Evergarden shows, the grief that comes afterwards doesn't have to last forever. \\n\\n\r\nI cried lots watching Violet Evergarden. After about 6 episodes, I got wise and brought a tissue box with me to the tv before I started watching. However, despite the crying, I never came away sad. I came away with a strengthened love for the people around me, and a gratefulness for them.\\n\\n\r\nPlease watch Violet Evergarden. But have a box of tissues nearby.",

Before continuing, know that I will do my best to not spoil anything but do be warned of the possibility.(I don't think I spoiled anything)  \r\nI will not spend time debating the visuals or soundtrack as they are both excellent which is to be expected since KyoAni has been only getting better over the years. \r\nNo, what I really wantto talk about is Violet. Bland old Violet who might have well been replaced with a piece of paper for all the difference that would make, said past me. Oh, my darling I was so very wrong. \\n\\n\r\nViolet is actually a fantastic character. Yes, she is blank and frankly boring and since she is the MC that colours our vision of the whole show, and that's only natural. However, her bland personality is KEY for those first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nYes I can hear everyone else say that a story and by extension its MC should be able to grip you from the very beginning and to a large extent I agree. HOWEVER, I am willing to look past it in the case of Violet because it is this blandness which makes latter moments stand out so much more. Her slow journey towards realising that she's not just a bland doll-soldier. Her realisation, and subsequently our own, that she is HUMAN. Violet is brimming with emotions she was incapable of understanding and which she had suppressed for so long. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a ChaRacter driven show, it is a slow building show and so far it has demonstrated that the people behind it are great storytellers. They know when to deliver scenes, they know when to delay them. And I will highly recommend people to be patient with it, this show is well worth your time.",

Over the course of anime she slowly learns how to be human, and realizes all the wrongs shes done in the past.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art style is vibrant and full of color, boarder lines are thin and the backgrounds are wonderly drawn.\r\nSounds:\r\nFrom cannon fire tothe sound of Violet crying are expertly done in the Dub and Sub(infact i think the dub is better)When its raining and when bullets are flying the sounds can really immerse you into the world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nViolet - She is introduced in the beginning as an injured war survivor. However; you quickly learn she is no hero. Infact shes more like a weapon. During the war she couldnt talk or even think for herself.

When she get a job as a Auto-memories doll she slowly learns more about her past and how to be human and not a weapon.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMost episodes deal with her as she types up letters with people and learn about their past and their feelings of love and loss.

            "content": "Violet evergarden is easily the most anticipated anime of the spring 2018 season. I wasn't really excited for it since I never read the light novel, or was interested in it after hearing it looked visually appealing. I finally watched it because I wanted to see what the hype was about and it did look beautiful. For sure the art and animation lived up to the hype but the storytelling and characters were lackluster, which I expected going into the series.\r\nStory (6/10): The story mainly focuses on the main character, Violet Evergarden, and even though she is a human, she never really learned any humanemotions, since she was only ever used as a \"weapon\" in the war instead of a human being. This all changed after Gilbert, the major in the army, started to care for Violet like a regular human being. Unfortunately, Gilbert passed away and his last words to Violet were simply \"I love you\" which became a key part of the story as Violet becomes an \"Auto memory doll\", a typewriting job that conveys one's thoughts and feelings onto paper. Violet tries to find the meaning of the words \"I love you\" and also tries to develop human emotion through this job. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the story was pretty good but the way it was written and developed was very disappointing. Almost every episode, Violet meets a new client who wants letters written for their loved ones and that in turn was also a big part of how Violet's character developed. This however, became one of the most mediocre bits of the series because almost every character that was introduced only appeared for one episode and were put in a melodramatic sad scenario. They were pretty unlikable, thus why some episodes were flat out bland and boring. As for Violet, she was present for all of the story so the parts with her in it were at least entertaining. As expected, a melodramatic series would have a lot of cliches, especially if a series takes its sad moments very seriously, so thats another flaw of the series. I would have also liked to see more of the interactions with the Major and Violet, as these characters are why the story existed in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound(9/10): The art, as expected from Kyo Ani, was amazing, as well as the animation. Even though I never really cared for Kyo Ani works, it really was great. It had bright colors, beautiful looking character designs, and the music fit the melodramatic tone of the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(5/10): I thought a character like Violet had massive potential to be a great character but all I saw was a cliche character that didn't really have a personality. Her personality can be summed up by just saying she loved Gilbert, and thats really about it. Sure, I had a good laugh when she had robot-like actions since she didn't have any emotions but that didn't really add anything to her as a character. Violet's development was not forced but it felt a bit cheap because for me it was very unbelievable how Violet could learn human emotion so quickly as well as suddenly be able to write a letter filled with emotion. Emotion is not something that easy to learn, especially human emotion. The creators should have showed more of her development instead of fast forwarding through it a bit too quickly. Kind of like a math problem, only showing some steps to an equation but missing some key steps. It didn't help when the supporting cast who was supposed to help with Violet's development were boring characters that I couldn't care about or relate to.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my gripes with her, she was still the best character because she was the only one with development through all her experiences with her clients. The side characters, aka Violet's clients were all very one dimensional and the scenes where they where put into a sad scenario made me cringe. It was too much for me. It baffles me how the creators think people can fall in love with these characters by just having them appear for one episode. As for the characters who worked with Violet, they had nothing interesting to their character so I wasn't really invested in them at all. Gilbert was a \"good\" character. Good as in he was a very nice person to Violet. Other than that I think his character was a bit wasted because more interactions between him and Violet could have been shown instead of just letting him appear in a couple of short flashback. The characters were easily the most disappointing aspect of the series because a type of story like this is supposed to have strong characters that develop well as well as a strong set of side characters that help Violet develop her own character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10): I normally do not enjoy Kyo ani shows, as I think they are boring and the characters and story are usually really mediocre. I surprisingly somewhat enjoyed Violet Evergarden even though some episodes were also boring. I quite enjoyed the scenes with Violet but only the ones with comedy, not the scenes where she cried. (melodrama) As for the story I didn't enjoy it that much because after watching some episodes it felt like nothing significant happened in those episodes. Pacing was slow even though its only a 12 episode anime and only about 3 episodes were worth watching for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10): I honestly thought I would give a lower score but the series really wasn't bad at all. Just not nearly as good as people were praising it to be. There are no complaints for the art and animation but I didn't get how people could praise the mediocre characters and the story. Its one of those series that are supposed to be sad and use emotion to let the viewers relate to the characters or feel bad for their struggles but it failed to be that way because of the way it was written. I recommend this for people who already love the works or Kyo Ani but I don't recommend this for people who dislike melodramatic series.\\n",

Scratch that, Find a single negative review by anyone who's watched past episode 4.\r\nThe visuals and scoring of the anime are great, that's undeniable. However those alone set this anime up for a solid 8 at least. They serve only as a secondary device setting the atmosphere perfectly for what is to be a tear jerking drama. The characterization, considered a contextually, would come across as queer. However as the story progresses it allunfolds into a much greater commentary on a humans ability to handle trauma and their ability to overcome it.",

            "content": "This review was ,made after watching 8 of the 14 episodes.\r\nI never understood how people could enjoy episodic anime, where each episode featured different people, unrelated to the previous or upcoming episode. Anime like Cowboy Bebop, or Samurai Champloo I never really enjoyed due to them having the basic timeline of episode 1: introduce characters, episode 2-24: random adventures that feature \"character development.\" and finally the last 2 episodes having an actual backstory to them. It was boring, I didnt like it and I thought the character development was garbage. HOWEVER, Violet Evergarden is the perfection of this.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is somewhat basic but verysolid, a girl raised as a killing machine has lost the only person that was important to her and now she lives her life as a normal human. Each episode focuses mostly on the characters more than it does the story. Violet Evergarden's biggest perks are in the Character and Art sections so go read those. The story's main focus is Violet's character development and how she changes emotionally.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden in my opinion is the best looking anime to ever come out, period. Better than any anime movie, better than Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Budget Works, better than anything else by Kyoto. This is flat out the most beautiful anime I have ever watched. Even minor details like a flower moving or wind blowing, each motion is unique and not a repeated set of frames unlike nearly any other anime. The beautiful art style helps in conveying emotions and the mood of the scene, you wont understand unless you watch it, a good example of this is when her shoe is going through the water in episode 7, it was an extremely emotional moment and the beautiful animation just amplifies it. I can not give this anime enough praise on the animation and art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nJust like the art, the OST perfectly sets the tone for a powerful emotional scene, or sometimes there will be no music which sets this unsettling type of mood, in conjunction with the art, it works out perfectly. Both the opening and the ending are beautiful songs that fit in perfectly for where they are in the show, the opening gets you excited for the new episode and the ending is a slow piano song which is almost emotional, fitting in perfectly since nearly every episode ends on some emotional scene between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe biggest focus in Violet Evergarden is Violet's transition of being a heartless soldier that doesn't understand emotions, to her first smile, to her first tears, to her understanding of the darkness she has caused by killing so many people who had loved ones. The \"burning\" scene that was at the end of episode 7 had a huge impact and helped convey how she has changed from episode 1 to episode 7 (Ive mentioned ep7 twice now because it was just such a fantastic episode). The only issue I can find in Violet Evergarden's character department is that the side characters (basically everyone except Violet) don't seem to have that much depth to them as most of the screen time is spent on Violet herself. Basically, Violet gets A LOT of screen time while pretty much any other recurring character takes a back seat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nTypically I am more so the type that enjoys your generic magic/action/bits of comedy and romance type of anime. But Violet Evergarden's writing is just absolutely phenomenal. Every episode is an adventure, either with new characters or current ones. No other episodic anime holds a candle to Violet Evergarden, I have never watched an episodic anime that I absolutely loved until Violet Evergarden came around. Keep in mind not every episode features different characters, episode 8 for example focused on the previous events between Violet and the Major.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10.\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden displays the best art style and animation you will ever see in any anime, a perfectly fitting OST, various heavily emotional scenes and fantastic character development. Can you really ask for more?\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer:\r\nThis Review is      [ S P O I L E R   F R E E ]\r\nPlot:\r\nViolet Evergarden, raised alone in darkness and lonelyness is a wartorn veteran, only 15 years old. Not much details about where she came from is reveiled until now, however its safe to say, that Violet never had a place she could call home besides the battlefield. After the end of the war, now lost and not able to understand, who she actually is, she remembers the last words of her Major, the only person in her life, who ever stayed with her: \"Live.Live free. I love you.\"\\n\r\nTo understand this deep feeling inside her, that these words awoke, she begins to write letters. Letters for people, who have lost their words somewhere or still can't write. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I beginn? This show is hard to capture, hard to understand and although it clearly has its flaws, it manages to captures something, that is very rare among animes. For almost 1 1/2 Years I've been waiting for this show to come out and when it first aired, I couldn't be more fascinated. Not ever before, not even in an anime movie, I got to see such beauty.\\n\\n\r\nFor now, I'd say that my review is NOT completed. It can't. The show didn't finish yet so I can't possibly write a full review on it. However I think for what we've seen until now, its clear to say, that Violet Evergarden will be on the Anime of the Decade list. If not for its very human and realistic approach of a journey to selfacceptance, then for its way of showing us this world. Sometimes it are the very small things in life, that give it its bittersweet spice, other times we encounter something, that shapes us. May it take 10 years, may it take 50 years. On one fateful day we all have to decide, who we are. Who we want to be. And until this day come, we are on our journey. The journey which starts somewhere before the beginning and ends somewhere after our death. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAlthough I find the very realistic and tender approach of the world in which Violet Evergarden finds herself unbelievably beautyfull, I see a big problem at the beginning of this show, that might return in later episodes. It lacks of depth for other people. While each character introduced gets his very own chapter with and by the side of Violet, we do not really get to see what the world for them looks like. Each episode just ends with the fact, that these persons find their luck and joy again. What the story does not tell us is for how long. This is the problem; I do not think that a single meeting for sometimes a few days, sometimes maybe 2 or 3 weeks can truely change a persons life forever. And even if it does; what then. Will they remain lucky and joyfull forever? No. Of course not. Thats not how life works. Violet Evergarden however tries to lull us with this premiss. Its a hit or miss; if you can connive this, then the show will make you happy. Happy in a way, that no other show probably can and will. BUT, for some people (me included up to a certain point) this is a real issue. And it kinda ruines the mood you got after each episode. Therefore I had to deduct a point here. The other one got removed because of some really annoying stereotypical moments that didn't fit.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWell there's nothing to say. The animation is fluid as fuck, the visuals probably the best ever in any anime series as well as movie and the cinematography is an absolute beast. KyoAni really pushed the limits with this one to the next level (as if they weren't already like 10 steps ahead of all other studios tho xD)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Soundtracks are beautiful and make me happy >^< I like the dub as well as the original very well (German, french and english were taken into account)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Until now all we got to see was Violet. Don't get me wrong, she's a very interesting character, but she defenetely needs some more depth. If not, I will have to come back and deduct another point here. For the other characters: They have interesting background stories but aren't really anything very remarkable (we also only see them for one episode or at the beginning/end). If this changes, I will also adapt my review.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell I waited for 1 1/2 years. I guess you can say that I was hyped (and I fucking still am)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTo be concluded",

            "content": "When I was a kid there was a lot I didn't understand... I mean obviously right? No one understands jack shit as kid, but what I REALLY didn't understand was why people got so emotional all the time. I was a very stoic child and I never really had any particular interests, I just sort of...existed for a while, not really coming into my own being until mid to late teens. Why did people cry all time over things that shouldn't matter?\r\nNow, I'm a older person. I have likes, dislikes, goals, and ideas. It feels great to feel like you're doing something, instead of beingan emotionless blob. It also feels great to be able to empathize with someone whom you have a fondness for, that feeling of similarity is very empowering.\\n\\n\r\nThis series' enjoyment for me is mostly based on the amount of empathy I carry for the main character Violet, I can relate to pretty much everything she goes through in her development as a person. She is fantastically written and her whole arc really hit home for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut now regardless of my obvious bias in favor of Violet's character, everything else is real good in my opinion. It doesn't need to be said that literally everything looks and sounds orgasmic, as for the story itself there isn't too much to say without spoiling anything. Its a drama, and if that's whats your looking for I would absolutely recommend it to you.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden is the culmination of everything anime could and should be. For start, its grand production is something truly magnificent to behold. Every frame, every storyboard, every character design is bewilderingly stunning, creating a world so vibrant and so beautiful that leaves you awestruck at how it is even possible. Production aspects aside, the stories this anime tells is splendidly painful. It's the stories of loss, of self-growth and most importantly, of the meaning of love. Each episode of Violet Evergarden is a journey through emotions. Like a composition, Violet builds up its notes slowly and meticulously, so that when it hits the crescendo,the resulting experience feels profoundly impactful, even cathartic. Of course, it does not hit that wonderfully high mark all the time, even coming short on a few occasions; but when it does, the aftermath is devastatingly powerful, one that will surely leave some viewers bawling dry of tears. Violet herself is also one character of amazing allure, whose development is utterly beautiful yet heartbreaking to watch, a development from what is essentially a doll to a person who the audience can cry and empathize for, a tale of growing up that one has to see to believe. Aided by the incredible writing that not only builds up the episodes so well but also intertwines them so elegantly with Violet's own poignant development, and the mesmerizingly gorgeous soundtrack by Evan Call, we're ultimately left with a show that will leave one sobbing not only for its lasting impact, but also its unforgettable beauty.",

Everything about Kyoto Animation\u2019s light novel adaptation screams cinematic ambition.\r\nSimilar to what you\u2019ll see in something Death Parade, much of the series follows an \"episodic\" format in which each episode pretty much has its own independent conflict introduction and resolution, but in one way or another it contributes to the development of a much larger story arc that spans the entirety of the series.\r\nThere are a couple minor issues with the narrative itself. Like many dramas, there\u2019s a certain coincidental convenience that occurs at key plot points.For instance, particular characters showing up in particular places at just the right times to meet just the right people. These moments require a little willingness to go along, but in exchange for some added emotional effect.\\n\\n\r\nWe can debate over whether or not the story and characters themselves were written in the best ways possible, but one thing that cannot be refuted (fight me) is the high quality of production. The direction is excellent, the music is captivating, and the animation is superb.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a human interest story. It\u2019s not trying to comment on some moral or philosophical dilemma, nor is it trying to keep you on the edge of your seat from week to week with gratuitous bouts of action or suspense. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, look elsewhere. BUT, if you\u2019re even remotely interested in the idea of a fantastical drama with themes of war, love, loss, empathy, or personal growth, consider giving this one a watch.",

The main character, Violet Evergarden, after which the series is named, is one of the most cringy characters I have ever seen. She shows no emotion whatsoever. The series desperately tries to make her as cute as possible, but what they've actually done is making Violet nothing more than an empty shell with no brains. (or soul for that matter, she is just there for people to drool over) What a horrible cliche. Don't be lured in by the beautiful graphics, these made me stick around for 5 episodes after which I could not handle theshallowness of this anime anymore.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nLast year we got Youjo Senki, which focused on the aspects of war from the MC's perspective. This year we get Violet Evergarden, which has our MC try to live a new life in a post war world.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe story is about a young girl named Violet Evergarden, who has been fighting in the Great war and has sustained major injuries. Now with the war over Violet must now live in a world completely different from what she has been used to.\r\nWhat I really loved about the story, is how it took it's time with Violet's character because this show is really abouther and how she can cope and adapt to a post war world.\\n\r\nThe first half does start off a little slow, with Violet waking up from her injuries and being taken in by Claudia who offers her a job as an Auto memory doll. Seeing the way Violet reacts to stuff and the people around her was pretty funny as she is seeing new things that she hasn't seen before and still operates in a military fashion which does surprise people often.\\n\r\nOver the next few episodes however, the show goes in a sort of story per episode type fashion, much like Cowboy Bebop or Trigun where Violet goes on random missions meeting a new person each episode to help them write letters or documents. Each of the episodes did feel satisfying as the people Violet met helped her understand certain emotions she wanted to know and started to become more human than the machine she used to be.\\n\r\nThe first half of the series felt a little slow, but it was a nice buildup to the second half as the episodes previous always ended in a happy way, but the second half is where the emotions really start to kick in.\\n\r\nEpisodes 7 onwards concentrates more on the relationship between Violet and Major Gilbert, who was the only person that treated her as a human being and not a weapon. So when Violet finally finds out that he died in the final battle, you feel sorry for her as she had lost the only person who cared about her and she wonders whether her life is worth anything now that she has lost the only hope in her life.\\n\r\nShe eventually moves forward from this and some of the other missions she went on followed very closely to what she had experienced, making some of the later episodes feel like big tear jerkers.\\n\r\nThe final couple of episodes really show how much Violet has come as a person, as she ends up in a situation where she has to fight an old enemy, she comes to the conclusion that she doesn't need orders to be useful and doesn't want to kill anyone anymore.\\n\r\nI felt satisfied with the ending as Violet has finally accepted who she is and is moving forward from the death of Gilbert, by being useful as an Auto memory doll so she can help create emotional letters for her clients.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the amount of supporting characters, the show is mainly about Violet and honestly she is the only one worth talking about. This doesn't mean the others characters are bad or anything, their just not easy to describe other than being a support character.\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a very well done character, her evolution from a simple killing machine, to someone who understands emotions, how to express them and is able to make her own choices in life is an extraordinary journey. She starts feeling more machine as human since she still operates under orders and feels like this is her only way of doing things. The people she meets overtime really build her character up as she experiences new emotions and finds out the meanings for them, she develops more and more especially during the second half. By the end she has become a confident and positive person who can make decisions for herself and is ready to experience the world in front of her.\\n\r\nThere is a huge amount of supporting characters in this show, who help move the plot forward and develop Violets character. True there are some that stand out like Claudia, Benedict, Cattleya, Erica, Iris etc who often appear from time to time sicne they work with Violet. However they only felt like guides and emotional support for Violet and never really got expanded upon further than this. This doesn't mean they are bad or boring characters, they were just devices used to make the main character better.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is definitely one of the more beautiful looking anime's from this year. The setting felt like it was in Europe, but it's actually on an island so a different range of environments brought the world to life in this show, the detailing to the 1920's buildings, cities, clothes and other objects was incredible, it even had a few other things thrown in to make it look like it's from another distant place.\\n\r\nViolet was designed really well and the motions on her arms felt good too and didn't look like crappy CGI, there was actual care put into the motions of her metal arms and her look and fashion made her stand out too. The other characters were ok, but you could tell they were just there for the sake of it.\\n\r\nThere was surprisingly more gore than I was expecting from the war scenes, but it comes to show just how gruesome and horrifying war can be, even if it is one that never existed.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really loved about the OP and the ED is how simplistic they were, most anime OP's these days keep trying to be flashy and one up each other yet Violet Evergarden decided to go for a more scenery look, where we see parts of Telesis and the different parts of it along with a few shots of Violet showing her emotional stages during the show. It felt refreshing and calming did the OP, which is a nice change from the usual stuff I have seen.\\n\r\nThe ED is pretty much the same, showing vibrant colours to depict Violet in the different seasons of Telesis as she goes about on her journey as a Auto memory doll, before ending with her in the real world resting beside a tree giving us a feeling of gladness as Violet has reached her journeys end.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was also spot on, \"Across the Violet sky\" depicted Violet's character incredibly showing that she has been introduced to a new world and can roam free amongst it, whilst \"Never Coming Back\" truly showed the struggle within her as she can't accept the death of Gilbert. The orchestral symphony really hits you in the right places for emotional scenes and this is definitely true for later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nI usually like my slice of life anime's, if it is shown in the right fashion and Violet Evergarden really nails it, as it only focuses on one characters struggle to accept and move on from something they have held very dearly to them for a long time, while also adapting to a new world they aren't used to.\\n\r\nThe communication between the characters also great, seeing Violet trying to solve the situations she encounters despite not having the complete understanding of certain emotions was a true testament to her character as she was willing to get through any problem even if it seemed impossible to get past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very enjoyable show, it does take time to get used to the pacing and the story, but the outcome was well worth the journey.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a nice anime showing the struggle of someone in a post war world trying to accept the loss of something precious to them and moving forward to make their life their own.",

Not only that the music is also appropriate and beautiful.

Despite a lack of resolution in the plot, the feels were enough for me. I guess Violet is still on her quest to become worthy of that name. It would be nice for an alternative story where the ending is happy. Character development although classic was beautifully demonstrated throughout these short thirteen episodes. For once, I felt an anime touch my heart and trigger streams of tears down my cheeks. Though this may not be the type of anime forother people, I enjoyed this throughout, watching Violet grow almost as if I was part of the anime. This was a unique immersive experience personally because I could relate with Violet as a character who was nurtured by precious memories thanks to the sacrifice of a certain someone. I dunno, maybe I'm just depressed af, but anyways,  I'm still waiting for the movie in 2020. feelssadman",

            "content": "Never have I cried this much over anything, I'm sure that I cried EVERY episode except from the first one as I was just getting introduced to everyone and was unsure on their past. The first few episodes I just shed a frew tears but towards the ending ones I cried a whole bath tub.\r\nThe story and the plot was very well made and it had a sence of realism which was probably one of the factors that made it so sad as something similar to this might have happened, well that's what I thought anyway. Words played quite a part in this anime asa girl who barely knows the true meanings of words becomes someone who's job is to write letters, ironic isn't it, but because of such a plot twist we get to expiriance it with her and see an un bloomed little purple flower become into a glorious flower named Violet. By going through all this story with her it made me smile but yet feel uneasy and full of emotions I can't explain on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the visuals really did tie everything together in a beautiful green bow. The scenery, the clothing, the backgrounds! I can't, it was just too wonderful I dreaded for the episode to end, I realy did. It didn't steal me completely though, which is good as I had part of me also involved in the plot while the other was stunned by how pleasing the visuals were. The sound also complemented the art as it was so light and flowey making you drawn even more to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Violet Evergarden herself was such a mysterious character, I absolutely enjoyed her develop and evolve in a world she was not used to and never knew. The other side characters also played a huge part as they basically guided her and gave her their own personal knowledge making her more skilled and expanding her knowledge of what words could truly mean and do to a person. In the end, every character was so unique that I am sure I will not forget their story's as they were so vividly and with such ditail shown to us viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you haven't yet seen this you are missing out on a roller coaster that will make you question life and the power of words. I am sure I will binge watch this one day when I am mentally ready again...",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden: A Flawed Masterpiece.\r\nAfter watching Violet Evergarden, I really struggled to rate it. An excellent anime no doubt, and I absolutely enjoyed it. This issue was, as much as I loved it, it definitely had some flaws (that didn't really impact my enjoyment much, but they were there nonetheless). I\u2019ve settled on a 9/10.\r\nViolet Evergarden is a beautiful, melancholic experience which revolves around Violet Evergarden a former child solder who is emotionally stunted. Violet is exceptionally well written and feels exceptionally true to life and to human emotion (as a war veteran on /r/anime noted), if a little overblown to some viewers. A thrillingexploration of human emotion and how it ties into the human experience that ultimately really hit me hard. The world is a copy of 1920s Europe with some changes, but the world felt...cozy to me, as if I knew it inside and out already, like a well-worn, comfy armchair next to a fire. The interactions Violet has with clients as an auto-memoir doll are exceptionally written and some of the best on shot stories I\u2019ve ever experienced. Its amazing how in 20minutes of screen time I was able to fully empathize with characters introduced at the start of the episode.\\n\r\nUltimately, when Violet Evergarden succeeded, it fucking succeeded, but it tended to be somewhat hit and miss, and I'm sure this would be exacerbated by someone who was not as taken by Violet's character story from the get go as I was. I think Violet\u2019s character carried me through the first 4 or 5 episodes without me realizing, until after the fact that they were somewhat flat. Having read the LN, I can see a lot issues stemmed from the changes the anime made. However, I don't fault Kyoto Animation for these changes-- they were absolutely necessary when the adaptation made Violet the main PoV character (as opposed to the LN which was from the perspective of Violet's clients, coworkers and Bougainvilleas). My issue was that their execution ranged from passable to merely good, as opposed to the exceptional content directly adapted content (the reworked ending worked well. I was happy that the Chapter 13 ending of the LN wasn't present here (okay yes, we have a Code Geass final scene, but I\u2019m choosing to interpret it was not Gilbert as there is no evidence other that Violet being surprised, that it is). It worked well in the context of the LN, but in the context of how Violet character progresses in the anime (a lot more), it would not work). \\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nViolet was an exceptional character, that I was taken by immediately. Her backstory was intriguing, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so enthralled by a character\u2019s personal arc before.  The characters adapted from the LN were great. The original anime characters were quite hit and miss. Erica and Iris were pretty mediocre and whilst I liked the attempt to flesh at least one out with the backstory episode, unfortunately we got a passable to mediocre episode on the less interesting of the pair (and probably the worst character of the anime). Luculia and Spencer were the best of the original characters and were fleshed out really well. Had active roles in the story that deserved to be there. On par with the other clients, and probably had the most important role in driving Violet\u2019s early character progression (and in this anime Violet\u2019s character progression can basically be seen to be the whole plot, another major point of difference from the LN).\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nMeagre at the beginning. The arc of Violet becoming an auto memories doll, is given one chapter in the LN (and not until Chapter 6 at that) which admittedly was probably not enough, and certainly not enough given the focus shift. But, the early story could use a lot of trimming. Erica and Iris could probably be dropped from the anime without any repercussions, improving the focus on Cattelya/Violet (which is a relationship which I was unhappy to see was not fleshed out more) and cutting about 2eps of content out to either adapt more client one shots or flesh out the ending more.  The LN direct adaptations of Violet\u2019s experiences working take up the middle and are as fantastic as the written version. The ending is probably controversial for many LN fans. I prefer the direction the anime takes with deepening Violet\u2019s character progression, and in the process deviating from the LN ending. The train episode was poorly executed in places but had all the right pieces to be the perfect penultimate episode for the, for the exceptional final episode which I consider to be the superior ending the LN.\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nDo I really need to spell this out? Outstanding and consistent art and animation on the level of a movie throughout. The quality and direction are marvelous.\\n\r\nSound:9 \\n\r\nA consistently great but not exceptional nor interesting OST. OP/ED songs are good but not exceptional once again. Music works well in the context of the anime consistently. Sounds like you would expect it to if you watched the anime without audio and then heard the OST afterwards. Honestly one of the most boring ways to say something was 9/10, but there you go.\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nViolet was an exceptional character, that I was taken by immediately. Her backstory was intriguing, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so enthralled by a character\u2019s personal arc before.  The characters adapted from the LN were great.

So obviously it was extremely watchable.\\n\\n",

Almost too extreme for some, but nevertheless, such understanding and dedication can really make the real world a peaceful one, even if it seems apparent. \\n\\n\r\nNot just that, the story also led me to so many surprises, it's actually enjoyable not being able to guess what's going to happen, even if I prone to just guess what might happen.\\n\\n\r\nEven characters too, was portrayed beautifully. I can say for one thing: There was no bad character, no antagonist, or even a bad concept in this series. Even war, death, was portrayed so beautifully. No, not the glory war or death, but because of the dedication from all characters I mentioned above, both of these concepts became something beautiful. War is what let people know how bad it is, that's why they want peace. Death causes pain, but it teaches people to cherish life, still there or have gone already.\\n\\n\r\nFor art and sound, you will be overwhelmed right away, in the first episode so I won't mention much about them. Let's just say, it all sums up in one word: \"Beautiful\". \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I recommend this series to anyone who can afford to watch it. \\n\r\nI noticed I use the word beautiful too much in this review. However, I haven't seen something of this extend in a long time. And I have also mentioned it can all be summed it that one word, so please bear with me in that aspect.",

            "content": "\"No letter deserves to go undelivered\" - Violet Evergarden\r\nIn an age where communication can take many different shapes and forms, some debatably more meaningful than others, I appreciate Violet Evergarden's heartfelt message on the importance and meaning of communication. If I could alter the opening quote for a modern setting I would say \"No conversation deserves to go unspoken\". \r\nViolet Evergarden is ultimately about the titular character evolving as a person. In the beginning Violet is quite dull and robotic, her arms not helping with that impression. This may put off many potential viewers, but I believe the reward of watching this show is beingable to see Violet grow as a person, becoming more of a 'human' and reaching her goal of realizing the meaning behind the words \"I love you\". I think knowing beforehand that Violet will change dramatically is a better way to embrace the slow start of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOnce Violet begins to go on jobs the series predominantly takes on an episodic format where we learn more about the world and the people within it. Much like Violet we as the audience are new to this world, so it is through her eyes that we experience it. As a letter writer, Violet not only meets people, she goes through their struggles as they try to convey their immense emotions on a small piece of paper. By living the life of an ordinary civilian and not a soldier Violet begins to sympathize with her clients, whereas previously she would have only accepted her 'orders' and left with no feelings towards her task. Despite their episodic nature these relationships Violet forms are not discarded and are called upon within her character defining moments as she struggles to move on with the loss of Major Gilbert.\\n\\n\r\nViolet's immense struggle is aided by one of the most sensational soundtracks of all time. Each track blends in perfectly with the time period and evoke a myriad of emotions. The music is expertly used to create suspense, a sense of wonder, feelings of sadness and grief, and a sense of moving forward, not letting the past define you. Also aiding this is the impeccable animation, which offers incredibly subtle and realistic human movement and expression and creates a visually stunning and detailed world, packed with life which could have easily been very dull.\\n\\n\r\nViolet's life as a soldier paints a moving war story that is lovingly handcrafted into a moving tale of growth, loss and the importance in being able to understand the feelings of others. I myself have had times where I am unable to say what I truly mean, and I've believed that my feelings could be expressed more truthfully in writing instead. For this, the series truly understands an important part of what it means to be human. Unlike other seasonal anime, Violet Evergarden has stuck with me and continues to do so. I take it's final message to heart and believe it encapsulates the wonder of the show.\\n\\n\r\n\"Live, live and live some more\".",

            "content": "This... this anime... wow... So I'll admit episode 1 and 2 weren't the most captivating but from episode 3 and up the story has been phenomenal, Violet Evergarden is a true gem among anime not only this year but all time, and here's why...\r\nThe art style is amazing and even surpasses the art style of most fully funded anime movies(Thank you Netflix) as well as a great animation style, but the most impressive would be it's use of lighting, I was blown away every time there was a sunset scene and the level of detail is also a very prominent strong point in the visualaspects...\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was exhilarating, every time that violin started playing I would mimic the violinist(I'm a weirdo like that) as my ears were treated to a symphony of beautifully played instruments and sounds as well during the backstory on episode 8 and 9 I was thoroughly impressed by the soundscape and the surround sound as well as the accuracy of the sound of a WWI war zone...\\n\r\nThe story and writing was simply put, Amazing, Kana Akatsuki did amazingly and Taichi Ishidate was a superb director and excellent screenplay by Reiko Yoshida, lets just say that my heart was beating at 120 during the first 5 minutes of episode 13 and I love how deeply each character is explored throughout the series and all their post-war stories as that's what this story was about, it was the different experiences of people who had endured the war in different ways and everyone loves a good war story. \\n\r\nOh I forgot to mention the landscapes... Holy s%!+... this really pushed boundaries I never thought you could make a fictional world so detailed and pretty, I got at least 20 wallpapers from the scenes in the anime based entirely on the landscape...\\n\r\nWow sorry just wrote a full essay so... \\n\r\nDo I recommend this anime? If you don't know my answer you haven't been reading properly.(its yes)\\n\r\nIs it anime of the year material? yes\\n\r\nAre you still reading? Doubtful\\n\r\nBut if you are and you haven't watched it GO AND WATCH IT!!!",

            "content": "\"It's about the journey, not the destination.\"\r\nThis phrase is used to describe a lot of shows, movies, etc. The basic idea is that how the story shakes out in the end isn't important: the experiences gained along the way are what matter.\r\nViolet Evergarden is a tricky show to parse at first, because it's the antithesis of that idea. It relies on a slow build of character, story, and tone that might not grab you and sweep you away right off the bat. It demands the patience to sit down and follow it through to the end, trusting that the time you invest in it willpay off when all the pieces come together. Violet Evergarden is ALL about the destination. And I understand how this might put some people off it, as you don't know whether the 6.5 precious hours you spend watching it will be worth it, or just a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nWell, fear not, curious one. Because having finally finished the show, I can confirm that it is absolutely worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSet in a fictional country that resembles Victorian England with a bit of a steampunk twist, Violet Evergarden centers around its titular hero, a 14-year old orphan girl who was taken in by the army and raised as a living weapon, a tool of death meant only to be used, pointed at the next target and told to kill. But the war is over now. There's no more fighting left to do. Major Gilbert, the one man who treated Violet as anything more than a tool, is missing, presumed dead. So where does she go from here?\\n\\n\r\nWell, she finds a job at the Auto Memories Doll service, a ghostwriting service that sends its \"dolls\" across the country to write letters for whomever asks for them. Why does she take this job? Because she's haunted by the last words the Major spoke to her: three words that, having been raised as an emotionless killing machine, she can't understand. By transcribing the thoughts and feelings of others onto paper, she hopes that one day, she will grow enough to understand Gilbert's last message to her.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a mostly episodic format, in which Violet is called out to write for a new client every week. As expected, they all have tragic backstories or deep-seated issues, and through her interactions with them and their emotions, Violet begins her slow crawl back to humanity. Her growth serves as the throughline tying these mostly unrelated stories together, with each inch of progress she makes during one episode visible in the next. This is what I mean by the destination mattering more than the journey; on their own, these disparate stories about wounded people trying to find peace might not be all that interesting. It's only when taken as a whole- not as separate vignettes, but as one character's deeply personal journey, exploring love in all its facets and flaws- that the show begins to truly pay off.\\n\\n\r\nAnd holy SHIT, does it pay off. The waterworks may be slow to come, but once they start flowing, they don't stop. Violet's increasing awareness of her own humanity, and the pain she both feels and has caused, is utterly wrenching, and in the moments where it fully bursts out, it makes me sob more consistently than anything since Clannad After Story. Credit must be given to the criminally underrated Yui Ishikawa, who between this and Mikasa Ackerman has nailed the seemingly-emotionless-but-with-hidden-depths shtick down to a science. Yes, it may be slightly melodramatic at times, but this is anime. If I'm not watching it for huge swells of feeling and emotion, then why am I watching it at all?\\n\\n\r\nWhat helps these moments land is the fact that anime though it may be, Violet Evergarden doesn't feel like anything else on the market right now. I mean, in a medium full of giant mechas, high school, fanservice, video game worlds, and other intensely nerdy pursuits, Violet Evergarden feels like it was ripped right out of the pages of a Jane Austen novel. It's soaked in a kind of 19th-century atmosphere and feeling, defiantly refusing to pursue any of the tropes we've come to expect from anime. That kind of attitude is admirable, and it helps the series' biggest moments land with the impact that they do.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, special attention must be paid to the animation as well. Kyoto Animation has always been the king of good-looking shows, but this one REALLY takes the cake. Beautiful backgrounds, characters that move and shift with subtle detail, well-integrated cg, cinematic-quality editing and lighting effects, and some truly jaw-dropping rotoscoping... you could print out every single frame of this show and hang it on your wall. It adds so much wonder and beauty to a show that's all about wonder and beauty, making for a truly enthralling watch.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Violet Evergarden is a true masterpiece, worthy of the hype that it's been gestating in for the past few months. If you abandoned it early on because you were worried it wasn't going anywhere, now would be the time to fix that. Because it does, indeed, go somewhere, and the destination is absolutely worth the journey.",

So plz dont curse me while reading this xd\r\n (Spoiler )Story :The story really got me , Im must admit that i even cried at some scenes...  It's about a Violet , who was militarytool,found somewhere in the battlefield without any emotions and human signs.  The major ,Gilbert takes care of her and want make her more human . He dies and his last words were \"live\" and \"I love you\" . So there comes the main plot about knowing what these words mean .\\n\r\nArt : 10/10 beautiful , I don't know what to say more ,applause to the animators\\n\r\nSoundtrack : music was composed by Evan Call, and it fits perfectly to all scenes.slow piano is on the sad scenes , fast violin on the action ones and more ..\\n\r\nCharacter: there is what was she like and how she is like . So we can see how she changes , and can show emotions more and more\\n\\n\r\nFinal : watch it .No matter what don't watch animes based on the reviews , because the top ones are more bs for me than 6.5 score. And how I can tell just looking on the other reviews  , this anime will be at the 8 score thanks to \"professional\"  reviewers",

            "content": "Hello all, I'm going to start right off the bat by saying that I'm not a critic, nor am I particularly smart. I'm just a normal guy trying to watch some anime. Now when I looked at VE on MAL I was really surprised at the amount offormat thing that everyone decides to do so.... uh, yeah, let me just get into that I guess.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, I gave the story a 9/10 because the story was incredibly beautiful. I've seen a couple other people say this but yeah, the story is pretty simplistic, it's about a little girl who has known nothing but war try to find what love means. Each episode is essentially its own little story in itself, giving little snapshots of life in different stages. Each episode also grows Violet's character somewhat, because she has to deal with all these emotional troubles, her emotionless character has to react in ways she never has. Yeah, that's about it, I think a lot of the bad reviews might have a little to do with the expectations of what it was going to be. I think a lot of people maybe thought it would be a bit more grandiose.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni, honestly, is there anything else to say?\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nOST was great and really set the stage for the anime, there were a few scenes where the background music overpowered the characters but it's not as if it was irredeemable. Still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\\n\r\nI think a big thing that a lot of people gave VE criticism for was the lack of character for Violet. I will admit it is a little unrealistic for Violet to have absolutely zero emotions but considering how she was treated by everyone in the military besides Gilbert I can imagine how she would end up like that. I mean, she was effectively a slave, you have to stay stoic in situations like that, there's no room for emotions.I do agree, though, in some way, I think the character development was a little slow, the first 4 or so episodes had little to do with actual development of her character. I believe the development was a little bit on the slow side, and the side character were also kind of bland, but to be honest, you don't see them too much anyways so it's not too much of an issue. Also, the new character introduced each episode actually surprised me. Although they were limited to the \"tell\" method, the characters actually had a lot of depth and emotion behind what they were doing. You could actually relate with most of the character in each of these individual episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nThough not perfect, it is a really enjoyable experience. I've noticed that a lot of the reviews have only watched 4 episodes or so and I'm going to tell you straight up; you need to watch more. This show has a very slow build up and honestly, at episode 11, I don't think its done. No one knows for sure how the end is going to be, but we can only hope it's amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nIt's good, beginning is slow though.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden -Despite what the metal arms of the protagonist may have you believe- is not an action-focused show. So if that's what you're looking for then you've already been warned. It's also likely a reason why previous reviews have commented on the slow nature of the first few episodes; expecting action. Rather- it's a story that uses the background of war and conflict to enrich it's main character's conflict and take the viewer on a journey of self-discovery and tears and is definitely worth watching past the first 5 episodes. When I started off watching this show I wasn't expecting to be overwhelmed bycreative subplots that brought me to tears nearly every episode. But I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, I rate this anime a 9/10. Reasons are below:(WARNING: MILD SPOILERS AHEAD)\\n\\n\r\nStory(broken up into 3 different aspects of it)- 8/10\\n\r\nSetting: It isn't too hard to believe- it's a post-war society in a place that resembles Eastern Europe. The setting remains consistent throughout the series which makes the world more believable and immersive. They also portray the many places the main Character (Violet Evergarden) beautifully in a way that doesn't distract the viewer from the actual story or characters. There are a couple of things that bother me though- including the fact that they somehow have a perfect control over making metal replacements for entire limbs like in FMA, but have just recently discovered typewriters. A more basic grievance I have is that they never really establish the names of the places they visit- which makes it seem as if the story is all taking place in one big country (Which it isn't) \\n\\n\r\nPacing: Like I said in the introductory paragraph, the story starts off almost excruciatingly slow- with small bits of action thrown in to keep the viewer entertained. While it does a good job establishing the main characters in the story that we'll be spending the rest of the show with, the lack of conflict and plot other than that dealing with Violet makes it slower than it has to be. After the first few episodes though, these issues are mostly resolved as the story moves to focus more on Violet's journey of self-discovery and forgiveness. This makes it easier for the plot to move on as the writers no longer need to arduously work to define characters that by themselves have little significance to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nStory Quality: As much as I enjoyed the overall story, I think the writers were a bit confused when they wrote this. The show starts off by defining the surrounding characters and follows a very linear journey of Violet as she learns to integrate herself into society from war, but immediately after she does so, it moves to a show about her journeying around and the adventures she goes on in those travels. The sudden shift makes it kind of confusing, but the transition isn't TOO abrupt and is a lot easier to follow than other terrible examples of writer indecision I've seen before. The story is nothing if not original and it IS original. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The art is absolutely phenomenal. As an aspiring artist myself, I couldn't tear my eyes from the beautiful animation and art that this anime features. Although it suffers from the typical problems like awkward facial expressions in large shots and chibi like expressions when it wants to seem comical, it more than makes up for it with moments that look like they were pulled straight out of an art museum in terms of color palette and beauty. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The music is sometimes very reminiscent of BBC's Sherlock soundtrack, which is definitely a good thing. Though not as memorable, it does its job of complimenting the story as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The show does a pretty good job of defining its characters early on, but it suffers from an issue that I've seen in far too many shows; after it's finished giving backstory to it's sided characters, they become almost insignificant the story and makes the viewer feel almost as if they wasted the first few episodes on learning about characters that they never see again. Other than that though, the progression and development of the story's protagonist- Violet Evergarden- is done beautifully and makes the story addicting to keep up with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I shed tears of both happiness and sadness throughout this anime, I get the feeling that you will too. The art, soundtrack, and story all add up to make a beautifully comprehensive story of self-discovery that will likely not be forgotten for a very long time. \\n",

I still think if this anime deserves either 9/10 or even 10/10.\r\nStory:\r\n8/10\r\nSome people say the story of anime is going slowly. I can't say it isn't true,- contrariwise, I agree. The plot is very important part of anime and there is bit different, extraordinary plot, but I think, it suits this anime well. I gave 8/10 because even though I am enjoying it, it's true that it's bit weaker part of anime, (but still also interesting).\r\nArt:\r\n10/10\r\nI didn't have any problem with art. It's beautiful, I very like it.\r\nSound:\r\n8/10\r\nI would give 10/10, because the sound it's great,but not enough to be so excited of it. But it's good, where should be sad music, there is sad, where dramatic, there is dramatic..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nBest part of anime, at least for me. Violet Evergarden is really interesting, cute girl, also weird, but finally main heroine, which is so likeable (and symphatetic) . She is maybe still finding herself, but it's amazing to watch her story. Other characters? Great! I like them all. I usually like especially main characters, but in this anime I fell in love with all character who stand on the side of Violet. I think you will love some character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nI dunno what to say here.. For me all episodes were so perfect. I was enjoying them all. Neither one episode wasn't boring. Maybe first episodes will be bit weird for you, but soon you will enjoy them too !\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nEdit: In the end, I gave 8/10. Still, it's very great anime.\\n",

If this is not a masterpiece than no anime is a masterpiece.  \r\nThe story is simple, but touches the heart. It is not about the abilities that Violet has, rather the oxymoron of a person without feeling facing situation of emotions (which are carried by the letters that were delivered).\r\nIt make me wrote a letter to my wife who sleep beside me everyday. The tear and smile show on her face when she received it just proof how a simple letter bring \"life\" to our simpleyet profound journey that we take together.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who does not appreciate the anime, I guess they have lost their sight to see the beauty created by the anime. I am now at episode 11 and without watching the ending, I am already decided that this is a masterpiece that is worth for me to create an account and write this review. \\n\\n",

It\u2019s trying to make us understand other people feelings (love principally) in different situations through this girl, Violet. Parents, brother and sisters, and couples love.Each one represented in its unique way. \\n\\n\r\nI might be overestimating this anime, but I really loved it. Each chapter made me cry and reflect about some situations of my life. Yes, there are things that are not possible in real life, but the feelings are the same. Pain of losing someone important to you, insecurity of meeting new people, fear of express a feeling that by yourself you can\u2019t, happiness of being with the one you love. This is what make \"Violet Evergarden\" so special for me: that the anime is able to make me feel what the characters are feeling. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, in the technical part, the animation and sound are by far, the best of this season. This fact made the anime more enjoyable and easier to concentrate only in the story. (Yes, sadly, I\u2019m the type of person that if the animation has many problems, I can\u2019t concentrate in the story).\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Srry, english is not my main laguage, it was quite hard to express my opinion.

The first few episodes introduce the character and the world around her in a way that certainly isn't amazing but, is still quite good, while the rest of the season I'd consider to be outstanding. The overlying theme of the show is with out a doubt love. Love of a significant other, love of a mother, father, daughter and love of ones self. As each episode ended, I found myself craving to watch another episode every time because, I knew I would feel an abundance of emotion. Happiness, sadness, anger, fearare just a few of the things I had felt throughout watching this show. Now is this show for everyone? Absolutely not, but for myself? I have found what I believe to be one of the greater  anime's I have ever seen and I simply can't wait to watch more.",

            "content": "Disclaimer:\r\nThis is my second review. The reason I decided to write this is that no review seemed to do justice to this masterpiece. All of the spoilers I write come from episode 1. If you want to skip those, skip to the second part of the story chapter. \r\nGenre:\r\nMelodrama (the kind where you know from the start thay you will cry a lot like in Anohana) \r\nStory (10/10):\r\nViolet Evergarden tells a story of a 14 year old girl who grew up in the army, and lost her commander in the final battle of the war. However, no one can bear to tell her the truthabout her commander, so she tries to find out the meaning of his last words \"I love you, Violet.\" To do this, she starts working as a letter writer trying to convey people's feelings. This is a very unique story that deserves an 8/10 in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers over\\n\\n\r\nWhere this show really shines though, are it's side stories that start at episode 3 if my memory serves me correctly. Almost every episode portrays the life of people in the aftermath of the war. A lot of them concern people who have lost someone they love, and the scars that has left in their hearts in a very humane way. They show the beauty of life, of love, and how letters made them see the light at the end of the tunnel. Each of these stories are so touching they deserve a 10/10.\\n\r\nThe main story progresses slowly but steadily, and every episode revolves around Violet's clients, making Violet Evergarden a very episodic series, so don't expect cliffhangers here. \\n\\n\r\nSetting:\\n\r\nThe show is set on a romanticised victorian era world where a large scale war has just ended. The world diverges only little from our world. Their alphabet and history are different, but that doesn't deter from the story. However our main character has more advanced arm protheses than what we have today similar to Fullmetal Alchemist. I didn't mind that though since I love the fantasy genre. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\nHaving grown up in the army, Violet is an emotionally lacking girl who lost her arms in the war. She is exact and strict with herself and slowly learns to understand emotions. Having grown up in the army, she excels at everything that requires precision or diligence. It is difficult to connect with her at first, but she is slowly developed and her backstory revealed. (9/10)\\n\r\nIn the company that Violet works at there are about four other letter writers that don't get much air time apart from one of them. They mainly serve as comparison to what successful letter writers are like in contrast to Violet. (6/10)\\n\r\nHere too the strong points of this show are the episodic side characters with so beautiful and sad backgrounds they have made me cry a couple of times. The people's grudges and regrets however get resolved in a way that has left me speechless time and time again through the letters that our heroine writes. Each episode after the first couple are built in a way that slowly reveals the side characters' history and the letters always tie the episode well together. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10):\\n\r\nI have never seen such outstanding art in an anime. Not even in Your name. The expressions are detailed, the backround sharp, and the animations fluid. The art does not try to express people listening on conversations with 5x bigger ears or the like but stays consistent as is expected of the genre. There was one episode in particular that left me in awe of the impressive animation (episode 6 or 7).\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great and the feelings come across, but I'm not very good at appraising it. At least I haven't heard any part with bad voice acting...  The ending is also, how do I put it... unique. There is also some background music, but I rarely pay attention to those so I am not appraising them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall (10/10):\\n\r\nAs most of the show has already been resolved, I can confidently say that Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece and the best anime of the season. It also topped my previous favourite Your name. The main story progresses slowly revolving around side stories each one more beautiful than the last, until it hits you with a few main story episodes that really touch your kokoro. The structure of the show is so different that it may be hard to get into at first, but the main attraction for the first ~7 episodes are the side stories. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes the drama genre like Anohana and Your name, or who is searching for very realistic and humane depictions of people like in Breaking Bad. Also, if you are searching for something Victorian after watching Gosick, this is the show. Don't watch if you hate the idea of a slow paced main story or are in search of action (this is drama.) \\n\\n\r\nHaving now seen how touching letters can be I really feel like receiving one. Please give me constructive critique about my review and if there are bad grammar mistakes, do tell since I'm not a native speaker. :)",

I will write a full review when it is finished most likely.\r\nNormally i am a person who is more into the action kind of anime(with a few exceptions). This is honestly my first time i watched this kind of Drama/Fantasy anime. \r\nAfter just finishing episode 10, and feeling the tears going dry on my cheeks, i decided to write this review since this show has really done something to me that no show has done to me. It showed me the importance of words, the emotions behind them. This animemanaged to exquisitely capture someone who was lost, alone and at that point without any knowledge of concepts like love grow into a women who understands someone else's emotions (Still, without understanding fully understanding her own) more than anyone else in that world.\\n\\n\r\nNormally i waited for the big climactic battle between 2 overpowering forces. Now i was just waiting for Violet to show her true emotions, and when she started to cry. So did i. \\n\\n\r\nHer journey was one of coming of age, maybe not in the literal sense. But in the sense that she learned how to love, cry, be angry. Be human. \\n\\n\r\nP.S: This is my first attempt at something that should resemble a review, i will welcome any tips so i can improve my writing etc. If you just want to say: Hey i liked your review, that's okay ofcourse as well. As mentioned at the beginning i will try and write a full review once the show is over.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

So far this anime scores a 10/10 for me. I will admit that the first time I watched the anime from episodes 1 to 4 I stopped and quickly put it on hold; because honestly, I'm not quite the person that is fond of slow-paced, dialogue-heavy shows. Only a few shows have got my attention and Violet Evergarden is one of those shows that captured my emotionalside. I would recommend this show a must watch and for those who dropped to give it another chance. Violet Evergarden is probably the 3rd show on my list that made me cry more or less than Anohana and Clannad with just one episode and the episodes before that.\\n\\n\r\nI want to address that while I was taking a break from the show I follow reviewers in youtube and they helped me clear up all the misconceptions I had with the show and also by reading others review on MAL helped me see what Violet Evergarden is really about. \\n\\n\r\nWith that all said I'm very excited and am looking forward to more Violet Evergarden.\\n\\n\r\n\"I rush anywhere to provide service for a client.

            "content": "Unfortunately there are too many flaws to give Violet Evergarden an honest 10. Mainly in the story department because they are hit or misses and some could be longer, I just feel the 14 episodes are a hindrances, if they had a full season maybe the few stories that felt rushed could have been elaborated on. The two I can name are when Violet was apart of the school for a short time to learn to be a doll, that all began and wrapped up in a single episode. It was still good, I just felt more could be done even though the ending didhit home.\\n\\n\r\nThe other was the night of the comet, a few episodes in, I think it was episode 5, they spent some time talking about loneliness and I felt they could of done so much more to define and heighten that though both Violet and the person she was working with.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the rest of the review, art is outstanding and I am surprised that Kyoto Animation hasn't tried more serious adaptations with their art style. I was just looking and all there stuff is cutesy moe stuff, which isn't bad but to see such a drastic change to something more serious. The animation is flawless.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: These are key to any series. Or at least one that you are trying to be serous with. The OST of Violet Evergarden is comparable to that of CLANNAD, which coincidentally Kyoto Animation did. Every note during the sad portions of the anime hit home. Again, flawless.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly we end with Characters. A bit lack luster but still great, and since Violet is the main focus, the others arne't necessarily important but provide enough support that they fill their roll, I mean Violet Evergarden is a story to story series, each episode being a story in of it self with a few sprawling more and of course the over arcing story. Still the characters are all good, just don't expect to see much of anyone besides Violet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, like I said, it's not enough to warrant a 10 and being this far in, after watching 10 episodes, I doubt 4 more will change my opinion on upping my rating to a 10.",

However, leading up to episode 9, the character development, individual stories, and backstory all connected in episode 9. It gets emotional after you realize what the protagonist went through leading up to ep 9. \r\nIt captures the essence of purpose and how purpose can influence a person in life. Understanding this, it brought a whole new meaning to the plotand the development of the main character. I think this is what hit most people that watched up to episode 9.

She is on a quest as an \"Auto Memory Doll\" to find the meaning of \"I Love You\", last words her major said to her...\\n\r\nFist 2-3 ep might seem boring but after that it gets pretty good...\\n\\n\r\nArt~10\\n\r\nWhat? Do u need to say it it's simply fantastic. Production done by *Kyoto Animation* it's an eye candy to watch. Backgrounds are detailed and character movements are fluid. Honestly imo best animated TV series...\\n\\n\r\nSound~9 \\n\r\nSound of this series is pretty good too the ost amazing, not only the fit the scenes brilliantly but most of tracks on their own are good enough to be on anyone's playlist and opening and ending sequences are also very good and fits in the show perfectly.\\n\r\nSub is amazing the voice actors have done a great job but the English dub for this is also pretty good and by pretty good I mean as good as sub if you are interested.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~8\\n\r\nIt's a character driven show so characters are to be the best and it's correct in a way but not exactly. Violet is main character so she gets most exposition and in starting she is quite generic emotionless but as the time gets she gets a lot of development and that's pretty interesting but since the show is not over yet it's not exactly true we don't know what happens next.\\n\r\nThe side characters are good but still rough on the edges the time we got is less and that is why it's difficult to say anything at this point but seeing the way it's going I think we will get more of them...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~9\\n\r\nIt's pretty amazing it's delightful to eyes fantastic to hear and Simply amazing to experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall~9\\n\r\nAmazing just amazing the story and characters are written brilliantly (untill now). There is lack in development of side cast and story is bit cheesy and predictable at times too but nothing that can ruin the experience it's a near perfect masterpiece...\\n\r\nAnd I think by the end it will become worthy \"10\" score \\n\r\nThink noore just watch it ignore anything else people said just watch it to experience it is truly beautiful.\\n\r\n================",

The confusion people seem to be having with this show is that they think it's about a cute girl who's also a kick-ass soldier and does some wicked fighting. This, it most certainly is not. What this show is, however, is the tale of a young girl searching for meaning in a post-war world where she doesn't belong, while simultaneously trying to cope with her past actions. Violet Evergarden is a masterpiece of character development, storytelling, and the emotional payoff (on top ofKyoto Animations' brilliants executed world) that will have you tearing up after episode 3.",

            "content": "So I've seen a lot of reviews, and I decided to write my own after seeing EP.7.\r\nAt the beginning, I was enjoying the backstory that was teased piece by piece, really loving the art (best graphics I've ever seen in anime by far) and I was looking forward to see how the characters (especially Violet obviously) were going to be developed. \r\nIn the first 4 episodes, they really took their time, and even if that didn't disturb me, it wasn't the case for everyone, which is totally understandable. \r\nIn EP.5, the story was getting a little faster-paced, and that wasn't unpleasant at all, with agreat teasing in addition at the very end. \\n\r\nThen dropped EP.6, which felt like a half-filler, because we were starting to see more development in Violet's character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this week arrived EP.7, and oh boy the little things I could criticize disappeared in a second. Without spoilers, Violet's character just went form half-blank to deeper than most shonen characters, and the story made a true leap forward: they finally concealed good graphics with a beautiful and well written story which almost made me drop a tear or two, even if we're just halfway there until the end of season 1. \\n\\n\r\nA bunch of people who watched it during airing were saying it was really cool, but had flaws that they hoped to see corrected in the next episodes. The big thing was to see if they would do it greatly or not, and they actually did it very well.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating, considering the 7th episode events, would be:\\n\r\nStory: 9, I don't give a 10 because it started a bit slowly and we need more backstory exposure.\\n\r\nArt : 10, just beautiful, would put 11 if I could.\\n\r\nSound : 9, the OP and ED are cool, the OST fits nicely the scenes, I don't give a 10 because there aren't any outstanding tracks that I would listen to out of the show.\\n\r\nCharacter : 10, with secondary characters as good a Luculia and such development in Violet's one, I can't give less than 10.\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10 Obviously, with these graphics and the story progressing in such a good way.\\n\r\nOverall : 10!\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can't say much more without putting severe spoilers, so I'm just gonna say this:\\n\r\nGive this show a try, it deserves it. Definitely. Sit back, get your eyes ready, and enjoy :)\\n\\n\r\nEdit up to EP10: Story 10, we got the backstory we wanted in ep8 and Violet really grows mentally in eps 9 & 10.",

When you try to get up you then know that its useless cause in front of y- No, in every corner you can see a burning arrow fill with sadness falling right at you from a very far distant. Hopelessly struggle as you try to avoid those arrow. Some of them hit you and gave you the pain that you mightn't beable to run at all.

Sometimes made you cry with joy.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, I will say that all the art are perfectly fit how the stories need to be. It gave you the right image that you felt while listen or read the subtitle along the way. Help to support the stories even more. That's just how good it was. With the Opening and Ending art style that also goes so well with the stories as well. I recommend you check the OP/ED. 10/10 for sure.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I will say that every character is very loveable and enjoyable characters as well.

            "content": "Initial Impressions:\r\nFull disclosure, I didn't totally choose to watch this anime. Long story short, I offered to do a panel on it for the anime club I'm apart of... except at the time I hadn't seen the show. I'm honestly glad I showed up late because I feel I was able to look at this show critically rather than being filled to the brim with hype. Even though it may sound cheesy to give this show a perfect 10, I feel it really earned that perfect 10 from me. I enjoyed the beautiful set pieces, the emotional grounded struggles of Violet, and how each episodetold a story the contributed to the greater plot. I feel like 13 episodes were enough to me. It was satisfying in a way that I don't feel like I'm hanging from the mouth waiting for a sequel. So, let's get into the meat of it, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story keeps itself grounded. A very vague synopsis is a child soldier (Violet) comes home from war only to feel conflicted by her commanding officer's last words: \"I love you.\" Starting a story off with a simple premise honestly means it can only go up from there. It also keeps the stakes small and personal, so it feels all the more satisfying to watch our hero go through her journey. It also makes the journey feel more personal to the viewer. Everybody has their own definition of I love you. It's a personal statement that's hard to describe because it means that much. Watching somebody who is almost completely emotionless try to find meaning in the most emotional statement somebody can say is really heartwarming. Something I mentioned earlier was the formatting of the episodes. The fact the show tells a separate story in each episode that all connect and contribute to the end goal was honestly a good decision. I feel that if the show tried to go with a complete series format, it would've felt like the story was just being dragged around until the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is literally one of the most beautiful shows I've seen. The set pieces are honestly really great and splendid to look at. There was a lot of care that went into creating them. The animation is also very fluid and conveys the mood and tone of what is happening on screen perfectly. There's not all that much to complain about except one or two instances of CGI which is integrated so well it's kind of hard to see unless you're looking for it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nSound design is great. Apart from a few pieces that sound out of place or just a few bad reads, it's not too shabby. The music does a good job of conveying the tone of the scene. Couple that with the art, and you'll be in tears. A lot of the music is fairly mellow which I really liked since the show tends to be more toned down and grounded. The VA's brought their A-Game and just put so much emotion into their voices. It made the characters feel human and not like they were just reading their lines for a paycheck. I feel it would've been easy for them to overact rather than underact, but they skillfully were able to keep a hold on how much emotion they put into their performances and knew when to reel it back.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were done well. Everyone gets a moment o shine and is developed properly so that they aren't just walking tropes. Aside from a small issue of some of the main characters showing up and never really reappearing until later down the line, it handles most of them fairly well. They all contribute to the greater story arc by having their own personal arcs and issues they need to work out as well. I feel they could have been easily rushed, but the episodes they are featured in and take their time in setting up how they feel and why they're having such a hard time at this point in their life. It's rare to see characters nowadays actually sit down and say how they feel or what's going on in their head. By actually sitting down and just letting them talk and work things out, it makes them a lot more human than never bringing up their issues at all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved it. I don't think I can describe how much I loved it. This series made me cry multiple times because I cared about Violet and her struggles or what the other characters were feeling at that moment in time. This show made me feel something other than being angry that I didn't feel anything. It told the story it wanted to tell, and it didn't let itself drag. That's good storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI don't give away 10's. I give 10's to shows that have earned them. Violet Evergarden bleeds that kind of passion. It has a great story, amazing characters, and beautiful art and voice acting. It's a show worthy of your time. It doesn't bait you into needing to watch a sequel. It's a satisfying story of finding the meaning of \"I love you.\" I would highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys grounded storytelling or just anybody at all.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden (the series) is unlike any anime I've watched so far in that it aspires to be something other than entertainment. Rather than being pulp entertainment aimed at teenagers, it aspires to be Art. It aspires to be high literature. And as such it has to be judged by a different standard than you would apply to a Gintama or a Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. \r\nThe series is nothing less than an artistic examination of what it means to be human. Sometimes it succeeds. Sometimes the series is a bit ham-handed in its attempts. It is an attempt worth watching. It is one ofabout four series that I go out of my way to catch every episode.\\n\\n\r\nIt conducts its examination through the eyes of the title character. Part of the confusion comes from the nature of Violet (the character) who is somewhere on the cyborg to full robot scale. She may be mostly human with a set of sophisticated prosthetic arms or she may be a robot. That she is relatively emotionless indicates she is further toward the fully robotic end of the scale. The technology that the character embodies is well wildly ahead with the mid 1800's - early 1900's Europe in which the story happens so it is possible that the character isn't even from the story's place and time. But that is irrelevant. What does matter is that Violet (the character) doesn't understand what it means to be human at all.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fictional character that most reminds me of Violet, is Data from Star Trek the Next Generation. Data and Violet both want to be human. Neither fully understands what that means. And the audience gets to explore what it means through the experiences of these two innocents.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that it isn't entertaining. The humor stems from the ineptness of the character and the slightly warped view of society. There is enough eye-candy for anyone interested in that.\\n\\n\r\nWhere will it all go? Will Violet fall in love as she comes to better understand what it means? Will we see more of what she actually is and where she comes from? I look forward to finding out.",

            "content": "After being discharged at the end of a war, our titular Violet takes a job as an Automatic Memory Doll (basically a ghostwriter) and starts writing letters for other people. So far so good but what's the show actually about?\r\nIt's an anime where the focus is on the characters, specifically on Violet who, after leaving behind the harsh military life, needs to learn how to live and interact as a civilian. \r\nIt doesn't rush anything, it takes it sweet, sweet time showing Violet's growth as a person and her interactions with the people around her. It can be best described as a \"slow burner\".\r\nViolet asa character seems to be a base breaker for the viewers. Her emotionless, robotic responses have been off-putting for a large number of people. If her character were to stay the same through the series, I'd agree with this view but since the show is all about her growth and evolution, I don't mind. I actually find her and the way she misconstrues what other people are saying quite endearing.\\n\r\nIt's also a great exercise in world building. The world of Violet Evergarden feels like a real, breathing world full of cities, trains and landscapes.\\n\r\nAnd it's also about the small things in life. About personal dramas and emotional dilemmas. \\n\r\nThe art is so high quality, it might have required the budget of a small country to animate. Regardless of one's opinion of the anime, there seems to be an unanimous consensus that it looks great.\\n\r\nThe sound is doing it's job and goes well with the general atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nIs this anime for you? \\n\r\nIf you've come here after reading the light novels and expect to see a faithful adaption, then no. I don't really mind this, I think that, most of the time, the source material is irrelevant when it comes to an adaption. The anime should be able to stand on its own and that it does.\\n\r\nIf you have very high expectations for this show then you might be severely disappointed. I came with zero expectations and so far it's my favorite anime of the season.\\n\r\nIf you have a short attention span, don't really like character driven shows and prefer a fast paced plot, then it's probably not for you.\\n\r\nBut if you do enjoys slow paced emotional roller coasters sprinkled with slice-of-life elements here and there, then give it a try.",

            "content": "As far as I can tell from the first 4 episodes, 'Violet Evergarden' is definitely not for viewers looking for a fast-paced show surrounding action. It seems to be a slower-paced drama surrounding the build-up of characters. To me this show is very enjoyable so far, especially due to the amazing art and soundtrack. \r\nI was only made aware of this show a couple of months ago (I also haven't read the source material), however apparently this show has been hyped for a very long time. Obviously as of now many people seem to either claim this show is a masterpiece or think it's overratedgarbage. The issues a lot of people seem to be having with the show is the slow plot and Violet Evergarden's character. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the main character is seemingly very bland and socially inept means that her character is going to grow over the course of the show. It almost seems unfair to me how her character can be criticised so heavily so early on in a series that is clearly using her character development as its main story. Likewise, saying that her character is amazing so far is equally unjustified but to me I have hope in her character improving as the show goes on. \\n\\n\r\nI completely understand if people are saying this show is overrated. However, saying this show is overrated as your main/only point of criticism to justify that the show is awful then I find that ridiculous. How popular a show is shouldn't take away from your own experience while watching it. I do understand if people are disappointed due to the anticipation of the series as the style and pacing of the episodes so far are probably not what some people expected. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals and music are simply amazing and manage to hold your attention despite the lack of action. I really enjoy the slower-paced narrative style as well as the character build-up. However if this type of anime isn't for you then I doubt you will enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\n(My first review it's probably bad but ok)",

Violet as a character was brilliant, it was ultimately about her developing as a person, and for such a short anime I felt extremely connected to the character. The visuals were absolutely stunning, expecting nothing less from kyoto animation and they deliver wonderfully, I think the two best things about the show were the visuals and the music, one note is that the music was always ongoing for some reason, in scenes where the show could be silent for extra effect, it plays music, however maybe I\u2019m just picky. The episodes more or less felt like \u201cshort stories\u201d in which there would be a character, who Violet writes letters for, there\u2019s drama and then it usually gets fixed, this is kinda off putting because the characters in every episode do not get much screen time, the episode with the mother and kid made me really emotional though. Overall I\u2019d rate Violet Evergarden 8/10, and a movie is coming out so I\u2019ll be checking it out most likely, wonderful show.",

And it was great.\r\nLet's start with the story. I gave it a nine, because it sometimes felt a little bit weird, but overall it was great. You have a fantasy world, which isn't an Isekai. You have a Steampunky world, with a lot of character. The world itself would be worth at least a 100 episodes.\r\nArt: As almost anyone will tell you. The art is amazing. The details, the lighting, the overall world. It's amazing how detailed everything isand after this anime I need a break, because my eyes need to get on a \"normal\" level again. The details, it's breath taking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The overall sound is also amazing. I got annoyed by the ending till episode 9, but sometimes I felt it. There is no particular song that stood out to me, but the overall theme got my feelings. The music fitted perfectly and therefore as to be a 10 again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: While at first some characters seemed generic and Violet might seem boring to some, I got hooked by Violet. I felt sorry for this little girl, who fought so hard and lost so much. While the side characters are mostly \"usual Anime\". Violet is mature, yet so small, a killer, a yet so naive and therefore I wasn't annoyed by here. Instead I wanted to make sure, she feels good, that she finds salvation etc. I wanted to protect this killer and therefore I felt her sadness, and it just stood out to me, her design is extraordinary too.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment. My enjoyment was great. I laughed, I almost cried, my feelings came up and down, but it was alwys an enjoyment. I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is an amazing show, go watch it right now. It has a lot of rewatch-potential, because there were no annoying arcs etc. One episode had a somewhat annoying character, but she grew on me in the end too. Amazing show with a lot of rewatch-potential",

I wasn\u2019t blown away by what was going on though, my first impression of Violet in these early episodes were a combination of the girl in Koe no Katachi and Saber fused together. But I got annoyed with Violet acting like Saber becauseViolet acted and felt to me like she was a robot Saber wannabe and not a human. I got an impression that this was an average anime about wars,guns,generals,yawnnn max I would give it is a 6 or 7 out of 10 and I even thought of dropping it while watching Episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nFast forward 3 episodes or so and I am jizzin my pants at the artwork , music,emotions,and character devolpment combined.

To me, I was hooked from the beginning, but I prefer animes that build up than those that reach their peak at the beginning or middle of the season.\r\nThis anime is all about one question: What does it mean to love someone or be loved by someone? Thankfully, I followed Violet on her journey as she navigates her way to aim at finding the meaning of what Gilbert toldher in his seemingly last moments. This anime is a character-driven one...meaning it is the characters who drive the story, not the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nWe meet some genuinely nuanced and realistic characters on the way as Violet goes around writing messages people just cannot say out loud or don't know how to express in words. This anime is not just about love, though, as it tackles loss, giving me some of the saddest moments I have experienced since Dear Nina Tucker was merged with her dog into a chimera. Each character she meets is fleshed out in the short amount of time she meets them, which is no easy task, and each of them deals with grief and love in their own realistic and unique way.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and art style are some of the best you will see in any anime, with the soundtrack fitting right in with the unique setting for an anime. It is clear Netflix spent a whole lot on the animation, environmental architecture, facial nuances and overall rendering and style of the show. It is, I daresay, the best-looking anime I have seen along with Attack on Titan (AOT is this high because of the battles).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I was left floored and enthralled by the first season of Violet Evergarden and cannot wait for the next one.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a unique Slice of Life anime that avoids all the tropes associated with the genre. It is a shining light on the texture of love, and how loss infects one's grief, while also remaining unique, inventive and honest.",

            "content": "This series blew me away. This is how episodic episodes are done right. By the end of the anime, our robotic soldier of an MC could finally become a normal human being.\r\nEven though there weren't many episodes, they both individually and together pact a lot of depth and weren't wasted filler and even though it was an episodic series the transition between them was flawless, I would forget that I'm not watching a series with giant arcs because those half-hour episodes flowed so smoothly together that each individual episode felt like its own mini-arc in the series.    \r\nWhat makes the story moreinteresting is that the focus of the episode isn't Violet but whatever letter or task she has to accomplish for someone else whose life ends up impacting Violets and she ends up gaining new knowledge and understanding about herself and her relationship with the Major. \\n\\n\r\nEach character plays an important role in her life and helps to progress the story itself and Violet's character development. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a very character driven show and those tend to be my favorite but it certainly doesn't lack action, on the contrary, our MC is a former child soldier and the story takes place both within the memories of the past war and the continued ability to maintain peace with the two former enemy nations. Doesn't help that some rebels want to maintain the conflict and our little MC gets dragged in the middle of it so we get to see her kick some major butt.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also a love story if you can believe it, just a lot more painful, and lacking in the cliches of most romance series that gets overplayed.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is emotionally driven so if you want one with senseless action, I don't think this is the story for you. \\n\\n\r\nNow in terms of the art and animation, it's probably one of my favorite ones. The colours alone in this series are fantastic. They are filled with such life and personality, that it's blindingly beautiful. The art is largely what interested me in the story and I'm happy that I stuck around to the end. It was worth it.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden has its imperfections, but proves yet again beyond the shadow of a doubt that when Kyoto Animation brings the pain, it brings the P-A-I-N.  \r\nMinor spoilers follow, though nothing particularly explicit.\r\nViolet Evergarden's major drawbacks are twofold, but both avenues of criticism lead to the same conclusion: the show does not have firm enough belief in the ability of its titular character to carry the narrative.  First, the show dwells on combat too heavily for its own good.  I don't begrudge wholesale the inclusion of flashbacks to the war; establishing Violet's traumatic background cannot be so convincingly completed without glimpses intothe violent world she first entered, and some of the show's most moving - and visceral - moments come from Violet's final minutes with Major Gilbert.  Every image of Violet's mechanical arms carries so much more weight with the knowledge of how she earned them, and the small looks of surprise on other characters' faces on first noticing her prosthetic limbs offer in each instance yet one more twinge of painful recollection.  The true strength of the show, however, lies in the aftermath, in Violet's postwar resurrection.  The most relevant plot elements and the strongest emotional resonance emerge in the story of Violet's career as an Auto Memory Doll, in the letters she writes, in the people she helps.  Taking time away from that powerful and compelling journey only hurts the show in the long run, and throwing so much weight behind story arcs centered directly on the war - especially in the show's final episodes - robs Violet of the chance to construct the show's true apex herself.  Violet's personal trials and agonizing growth become subordinate to dime-a-dozen shoot-'em-up sequences on battlefields that hold little significance to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nCombined with a handful of puzzling logistical questions and the fact that episodes 9 and 10 provided a perfect ending for the show that the subsequent episodes never approached, let alone surpassed, the insistence on dragging along the dead weight of martial subplots frustrates the show's otherwise fragile demeanor.  Watching Violet handily dispatch enemy troops like the killing machine that she is has its novelty, but why should victory come from the barrel of a gun rather than the heroine's own heart?\\n\\n\r\nA small part of me further interjects that war was not meant to be this gorgeous, and that might have presented some disconcerting dissonance had the show involved wider depictions of battle.  Thankfully, what combat there is remains at a relatively small scale, and, however odd it may be, the animation is as breathtaking as ever.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, certain peripheral characters continuously threaten to take away from Violet the screen time and opportunities to demonstrate growth that she has earned.  Her fellow Dolls and her various customers factor heavily into her maturation, and without such emotionally charged interactions, it is doubtful that Violet could ever realize her true potential.  Anime-original characters like Iris and Erica prove that even expanding the cast can work exceptionally to the show\u2019s benefit, if only implemented tastefully \u2013 but by the end of the show, Hodgins, Dietfried, and even Major Gilbert himself feel overbearing.  In taking over for Gilbert, Hodgins has assumed the role of authority figure and parental guide in Violet's life, and, stunted as she is, Violet experiences difficulty weaning herself off this manner of ever-present director, which necessitates Hodgins's presence early on.  Violet does grow over the course of the show, however; she proves herself capable of making her own decisions, learning her own lessons, and living a life free from orders.  As she develops, Hodgins should become less indispensable and less present, or at least more of a side character than the authority figure he was introduced as.  Yet, by the series' end, Violet still looks to Hodgins for affirmation and justification.  He becomes almost an unwelcome presence because of his tendency to control any scene in which he and Violet are together.  Dietfried, meanwhile, provides a handful of opportunities for the show to examine Violet's new life in a different light.  As the man responsible for finding Violet in the antecedent action, a malicious reflection of Violet's protector, and a lone voice resentful of Violet's struggles to move on, Dietfried complicates Violet's journey in important ways.  On the other hand, he is an unaccountably grotesque character and his insistence that Violet has no humanity seems bullheaded and baseless from the beginning, even more so at the end; in a most ungracious and unflattering turn, the show's final arc attempts to foist Dietfried's emotional baggage onto Violet's catharsis.  \\n\\n\r\nGilbert, for his part, is the crux of Violet's search for answers and plays such an enormous role in her development that his semi-constant presence might be unavoidable.  The show could not conclude without Violet addressing her feelings for Gilbert in earnest and I find it hard to imagine this series without Gilbert playing such a major part.  Unfortunately, the tragic and moving relationship between these two figures cannot seem to sustain the same poignancy throughout the full course of the series.  By the end of the series, Violet has become a very strong character.  As she grows, she becomes more unrecognizable as the helpless child who relied on Gilbert for everything in life, and while this growth is a great achievement of the series and very much the whole point, it has the unintended consequence of suggesting that Violet is now better off without Gilbert - or, put in a gentler light, Violet is no longer an abject shell without him, having outgrown the need for his constant protection.  If Gilbert were to return to the world as it is in episode 13, how different would his relationship with Violet be?  Some flashbacks do a great deal to contextualize anew Violet's evolving worldview; others circumscribe a sorry suggestion that there is little to Gilbert's personality beyond the fact that he is nice to Violet and highlight an unflattering contrast as Violet's happiness becomes less contingent on Gilbert's approval and increasingly the result of her own developing strength.\\n\\n\r\nThe show could avoid turning one of its key figures into a shadow hanging over the heroine by shifting the focus of its later episodes.  The flashbacks should have been more limited in scope; Dietfried's role should have been downplayed; once again, the character of Violet-as-soldier should have been removed from the field.  The more Gilbert reappears to deliver exposition of Violet's former self and remind us of how basically nonfunctional she used to be, the less time the present Violet has to demonstrate her growth.  By the end of the show, flashbacks to Gilbert do not feel like chances for Violet to overcome her trauma and learn more about herself so much as pure flashbacks to a state of being that is no longer compatible with the present direction of the show and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could identify a third serious flaw in this show, it would be the writing.  Exhibit A: \"Just exploit this orphaned girl as much as you can and dump her in the battlefield when she's no longer of use.\"  I hope never to encounter such a piece of dialogue outside a comedy ever again.  The writing in this show is usually tepid, dull, and witless - at least boring when it manages not to be obtuse.  Metaphors extend well beyond their expiration dates.  Philosophical orations ring hollow.  Observations that need not be vocalized are, and plainly.  The all-important letters typically fare much better than day-to-day conversation between characters, though even the letters suggest that perhaps an Auto Memory Doll ought to have been hired to script (or perhaps translate) this series.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the myriad cracks in the cinematic latticework of Violet Evergarden, I cannot bring myself to feel any of these words I say against it.  Truthfully, the dialogue bears little weight on the flow of the narrative for me; the story entire is told through Violet's face.  This is a tale based on feelings, not on words, and, just as Violet conveys her clients' feelings while struggling to mold her language to her needs, this show's true feelings reached me even without the aid of luminary screenwriting.  The details of Violet's origin might as well remain shrouded in mystery, as far as I am concerned; with so much of the show riding on her evolution after the war, how she entered the war in the first place is only a curiosity and not particularly consequential to the overall narrative.  I do not need to know her childhood any more than I need to know about Revy or Major Kusanagi or the Gunslinger Girl troupe, beyond the few scraps of back story scattered across the years.  However much Gilbert may intrude on the present narrative, however much excessive flashbacks may block Violet's spotlight, the confused and intense feelings that Violet has for him override any meta considerations of complex symbolic interaction.  Every shot of Violet's brooch lights up my heart the way the gemstone lights up the screen; every time she grasps for it, I picture the hazy, softly lit marketplace where Violet first discovered how to verbalize her feelings and where much of the show's store of pathos had its origin.  I could pick and criticize and probably warp Gilbert into a negative influence by the end of an essay, and Hodgins for that matter, but all I want is for Violet to find peace and closure and to be able to reciprocate his love, even though I know this cannot be.  All I care about is Hodgins's happiness with Cattelya and the success of his business.  All I care about is Iris making a name for herself, Erica gaining confidence in her ability to communicate, and Benedict learning how to wear real shoes.  Thematic analysis be damned.\\n\\n\r\nCertainly, the elements of war may feel ham-fisted and too pervasive for the show's own good, but these few detours account for so little of the show's true spirit and can never overpower the simple, sweet narratives of Violet helping her clients find themselves.  Every customer has a story to tell through Violet, and each touches on some new element of the human soul that teaches Violet about what it means to live at the same time as it reminds the audience of these things.  The sheer weight of every letter Violet constructs almost defies logic, and yet each is more poignant than the last; every new episode leaves an indelible mark on the show (and left one on me as well).  Hearts bared, tensions rising, souls overflowing with incalculable emotion: Violet's journey is one to the center of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe finer points of film-making and the technical terminology that accompanies them are somewhat mysterious to me, but Violet Evergarden has the clarity, detail, and boundless quality of art reserved for (well-budgeted) feature films rather than television series.  Violet Evergarden takes \"every frame a screensaver\" to heart, from the jaw-dropping backdrops to Violet's delicate and stirring facial expressions.  Many character designs reflect the premature age and distress of war veterans; even those for \"regular\" or unremarkable characters pop so vividly with the peculiar spark that Kyoto Animation adds to every project.  Scenes with dozens upon dozens of characters teem with just as many unique designs; no two Dolls, no two market patrons, no two soldiers are alike.  Violet herself has a positively elegant design, one that encapsulates at first her lethality, coldness, and hollowness, later her naivete, confusion, and turmoil, and eventually her maturity, compassion, and depth.  Her striking features, noble Prussian blue jacket, and shimmering mechanical arms make a powerful impression just through a still frame, before taking but a single step into a story arc.  Even for Kyoto Animation, a studio built on attractive character designs, lovingly crafted settings, and fluid, high-quality animation, Violet Evergarden is an extraordinary triumph.  I cannot remember the last show I watched that was so absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nBehind such exquisite designs is a cadre of voice talents more than capable of bringing these characters to life.  Aya Endou, Haruka Tomatsu, and the lamentably little-used Minori Chihara stand out in particular, but the true star - as it should be - is Violet herself, Yui Ishikawa.  Ishikawa's performance evolves with Violet herself, exercising restraint and holding forth as necessary to achieve the greatest dramatic effect.  Violet is similar in temperament to Ishikawa's most famous role, Mikasa Ackerman in Attack on Titan, but Violet is such a layered and complex character that Ishikawa has room to move, test herself, and deliver truly heartfelt lines.  Having heard Ishikawa as Violet, I could picture no one else matching this character so perfectly.  The music complements the tone and appearance of the show with equal aplomb, at times fluttering and sunny, at others reticent and humble, at others curious and complex.  Strings and piano melt across these breathtaking tableaux as if conducted by the scenery itself.  The true centerpiece, the star on the tree, the kiss at the end of the rainbow, is the ending theme, \"Michishirube,\" sung by Minori Chihara.  The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya taught me that there is little in this world more transcendent than Minori Chihara singing a beautiful melody unaccompanied.  Adding piano does not dampen the effect, but adds one more facet to this supremely sweet voice and melody.  I could have this song played at my funeral.\\n\\n\r\nIn the midst of everything that Violet Evergarden did for me, what can I say to its detriment that does not sound disingenuous?  The moment never came when I was able to take my eyes off it, so transfixed was I by its every little intricate detail.  A letter never emerged from Violet's travels that did not move me at the deepest foundations.  I believe that every time Violet shed tears I did, too.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing full well that Violet Evergarden is a less perfect show than I would like it to be, I probably cannot justify rating it a 9/10, and once sufficient time has passed, I may decide to lower my rating, but what I felt while watching this show transcends what I thought about it afterwards.",

All i can say about Violet Evergarden was, amazing and stunning.\r\nStory :\r\nI can say 9/10 because of how i already predicted on what's going to happen in every single episode after watching the episode before it. Even if you didn't predicted on how will the next episode will be like , then i think you would like it more than i do. The story have a really deep meaning each episode so get ready because each episode will really hit your feels really bad ifyou really immerse into the story like i do. Although i predicted some of the scenes correctly , i still enjoyed the story in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nThis is so far the best looking anime in 2018 , idk if there is some will beat this kind of art level in short time but it still can be beatable by more beautiful anime than this ( for example , makoto shinkai works , ghibli anime movies , etc ). To be honest , i wanted to see this anime art style for a long time but no one is kinda achieved that before this anime announced or released. Overall its a 10/10 for the Art.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nWell , this anime have some REAL soundtracks going on and what i mean by REAL soundtracks , you have to actually watch the anime really deep and immerse your self into it and feel how REAL the soundtracks is. I've bought the soundtrack album and it is amazing. I keep playing it over and over when i woke up , do some house chores , go to college , etc.  For the opening ( TRUE - Sincerely ) and for the ending ( Minori Chihara - Michishirube ) i like it a lot , it really connects into the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nI was really surprised on how the character development in this anime because i didn't expected the character to be this impactful. Really liked how the character developed as the story goes but yea, not the best but it was great to see how each character developed as the story goes on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nAll i got to say is it was enjoyable for some people and also some people didn't enjoy watching this so it depends on how deep or how can you immerse yourself into the character it self. Like i said in the story review , if you really immerse yourself into this anime then you'll feel the deep meaning in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nI would say 9.5/10 but i rather choose 10/10 , this anime have a really stunning and beautiful art , good animation , surprisingly good story , REALLY GOOD SOUNTRACKS , and yea i'll say this anime is a worth the hype and worth to watch. Exited for what's coming in the future.",

Justknow that every episode puts something to the story. The development of Violet is simply the most beautiful thing you will see this year. In the start she is just that girl which was dropped out from military and then is confronted with the whole civilworld and tries to figure out what it means to be human and what all these weird feelings she has mean. Now I don't want to say anything to much about how she is in the end... But she really grows up...\\n\\n\r\nArt: The Art of the Anime is a whole new level of amazing. I don't think there is any other show that looks this good. Seriously!\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Sound was always fitting and every single piece of it is amazingly well done and enjoyable. Whilst writing this I just remember the last episode and already here the music playing again and it already puts me to a sad mood. God damnit ;_;\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I loved everyone. Even the guy I really didn't really like at the start because he was one evil boi...\\n\r\nWell how do I put it... Every character has his own background, own motives and own goals. You learn quite alot about every single one and that is one reason I got so hooked to it. At some points I didn't really want to see Violet but instead I wanted to know more about the sidecharacters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well I watched it in one session because I just couldn't get my eyes of it. I really enjoyed this anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 11/10. This is a masterpiece!",

Yes, the story is a bit slow in the beginning, but if you stay with it (even just to enjoy the beautiful art of Kyoto Animation) you will probably see what I see.\r\nI'm not one to easily tear up or even cry but at the end of nearly every episode pushed me to the brink of bursting out in tears and the giant hole Violet Evergarden leftafter it finished is probably not one that will be filled anytime soon.\\n\r\nBut with a second season on the way and the easy accessibility with it being on Netflix anyone who likes anime or a good show in general should watch this show.",

It was my first anime since 2014 that I watched week after week, after every new release, without getting bored. However, the ending pretty sucks. It was pretty anticlimactic and it didn't felt as a proper ending. I think it's mostly about structure, since the ninth episode would be a better series finale. They should have switched the order, making Violet's discovery about Gilbert's fate after the end of the war. Her breakdown and overcoming would be a proper endingfor the main character than that stupid finale. I dare say that episodes 10, 11, 12 and 13 are just filler. \\n\\n\r\nBesides that, the art and music are gorgeous. Most of characters are pretty likable, even if they don't have more than one episode of development for each one. However, since this anime is called \"Violet Evergarden\" and not \"Violet Evergarden and Friends\", it doesn't matter at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice series. Pretty overrated, judging by what people are saying about it, but still nice.",

            "content": "\"In general, Age is not a barrier to love\" - Violet the lolicon\r\nOk so, when I was writing the review for violet evergarden while browsing through the review section for references, I soon to realize what people were missing out on, especially preliminary reviewers which seemingly get my nerves on for getting more upvotes on something that unfinished.\r\nSo here's my take on Violet Evergarden, a quiet bloomer.\r\nNow I know, Violet is a very boring character that we've seen mostly before. A monotonous, emotionless husk of a borderline robot. Pair it up with essentially an anime about poetry and emotions and yeah, you'll probably sleep throughthe first episode. I know, I did too. I kind of get the complains of why people didn't enjoy the first 3 episodes but frankly after watching the series, I kind of get where Kyoani was trying to achieve here.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow and really boring start gave room for Kyoani to slot in minute details and really a lot of guesswork that requires just constant attention. It's an anime that demands you to stay glued throughout. Staying glued allows you to really enjoy the subtle details such as Gilbert saying \"I love you\" in a manner that every girl would start nose bleeding, or her inability to adapt to an ever so laid back environment which draws in confusion and loss, basically it further enforces on something that was once just glanced off.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of detail, have I told you about how lovely the art looks? Even if you don't dig into the minute story details, the art would have at least perfectly portrayed the scene of a WW1 era. Colors are simply lush and vibrant and character detailing is just off the charts. It's a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nComing back, Violet is all (wo)man up, ready to write letters to everyone. This was the part I felt escalated too quickly. It was only an episode ago where she managed to just barely learn to write and next thing you know, she's writing for the princess to restore peace for both nations. But noting that aside, with your eyes still glued, you can really start to see Violet's feelings open up a bit, offering to now help out the princess out of obligation. You really start to notice that this anime isn't really just about writing but about offering help and comfort. This really laid the foundation down to what the anime really is about. \\n\\n\r\nOh right, the music and vocals in this are simply fantastic. Vocals have a slight smoothness which gives for a more relaxing experience and the slight restraint of Violet's anger and denial was fantastic. You also get the sense of the environment from light chatter to birds chirping or whizzing wind. Transitions to music are excellent, just seamlessly moving to classical music which blends in lovely. \\n\\n\r\nComing near the end, you soon really see a big change to her. She seems to no longer fight out of orders but for herself now. You can feel such incredible amounts of restraint from her, trying to avoid killing anyone. She seems to now showcase great amount of emotions and the willingness to defend everyone, as if she's standing up for herself rather than for orders.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back, this anime seemed like a story of poetry and literature. But clearly, that wasn't its main purpose. There were tiny changes to an ever so boring character that slowly transform an individual to one from the military to a marshmallow. Every episode seem to show very little change but looking at episode 13 and going back to episode 1, Violet is a changed woman. The ever so slow development without trying to cramp in as many sad scenes is what really made this anime so good. It's the process of change through writing that just makes you cry with joy rather than the amount of sad scenes involved. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now, we take a minute on the minutia. \\n\\n\r\n- Colors have a pleasing vintage tone to it, slightly warm, but has a homey feel to it.\\n\\n\r\n- Wind sounds may be a bit too quiet for a plane flying quickly with no roof.\\n\\n\r\n- Violet's backstory is a bit too tragic, borderline cliche, but I won't blame them.\\n\\n\r\n- Cinematography is good, great angles, panning is smooth on everything but complex scenes.\\n\\n\r\n- The salute in episode 1 is quite controversial for many military eccentrics but for someone like me, it informs me of Violet's background. \\n\\n\r\n- Luculia was a great character that could be developed on more but lacking in characterization\\n\\n\r\n- Some elements of the comedy side may be a bit overdone to showcase Violet's military side\\n\\n\r\n- Episode 5's storyboard was done by the same guy who did Koe no katachi, so a lot of intimacy.\\n\\n\r\n- \"Age is not a barrier to love\" really showcases the era's neglect for age differences.\\n\\n\r\n- The anime really does well on portraying children; annoying, childish but courageous\\n\\n\r\n- Fighting scenes are fine, smooth and sharp animations, but movement seems too free for fighting on a train. \\n\\n\r\n- Violet should stop hacking, seriously\\n\\n\r\n- Side characters are very active in the first few episodes but slowly dwindles away until violet does batshit crazy stuff\\n\\n\r\n- Gilbert is cool, very cool.\\n\\n\r\n- Violet seems to only wear one dress for that 13 episode\\n\\n\r\n- Side characters are shit at comforting Violet. Like seriously, a letter. No hug, no words?\\n\\n\r\n- Diethard is a living reminder of Violet's past. Really hateful but important for the story.\\n\\n\r\n- They made recruiting child soldiers seem normal by neglecting Violet's age but somehow Violet is the only child soldier, strange.\\n\\n\r\nAnd well thus I conclude the review of Violet Evergarden, hope you enjoyed it. Leave a like if you enjoyed it.\\n",

I'm your typical action head and I never give non-action Anime the time of day but this one tricked me into watching it. My intention was to just look at episode one to see what the hype was about and next thing I'm sitting here writing a positive review after my tear ducts have taken a good and thorough thrashing.\r\nThe first thing that hits you about this show is the lush colours, beautiful animation, and hypnotising sound. The show'svisuals are the best I've seen and I'd say Violet Evergarden has raised the bar on what a high quality anime should look like.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is episodic, each episode has it's own little story, and each story grows the character that little bit more. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime hits you in the feels, it does it in a way that I've never experienced. It's clearly a sad anime and you feel for the characters, but it doesn't leave you feeling bad or emotionally exhausted like e.g. Grave of the Fireflies, it leaves you feeling refreshed - the kind of feeling you get from looking at an old photo and reminiscing about past memories.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say whether you'll like this or not, best thing to do is do like I did and watch an episode and go from there. \\n\\n\r\nBring tissues.\\n",

            "content": "This anime centers around the concepts of self-discovery and the accumulation of experiences and human emotions. If you are looking for a good show that offers a refined melodramatic plot with beautiful visuals, this is the gem that I highly recommend. (This is as complete and as spoiler-free as I can go)\r\n+ this show has a unique and clever way of delivering drama and emotions to the viewers. It does it through letters. The feeling of manually crafting and receiving letters is magical. This is somehow diluted today because everyone wants it done and sent quickly. \r\n+ each individual sub-story is a gem and eachcontributes to the character development of the main protagonist. Violet\u2019s interactions with each client helped her slowly mature by her learning to express the emotions that she has never expressed before through her clients\u2019 first hand stories. \\n\r\n+ the show knows where it should focus on. Even though Violet was not always there for 100% of the time, it all builds up to her development. \\n\r\n+ the general plot has a nice build-up and it climaxed and ended beautifully. At the end of the day, we are all rooting for Violet and her future endeavors. \\n\r\n+ the dialogue is rich in content and poetically written. The words used were carefully chosen especially during the narratives when the letters are read. Each word on the letters conveys a magnitude of emotions. \\n\r\n+ the output of the voice acting is also fitting. The dialogue is given life through the voices and the emotions that were attached with each word. I personally love the rather quiet and clear voice of Violet. Her voice actor did a good job portraying her.\\n\r\n+ the visuals are very well drawn and the backgrounds and landscapes are pleasant and calming to look at. Details such as the creases on Violet\u2019s ribbon tie, the lights and shadows on Violet\u2019s emerald brooch, and the different flowers that are seen on numerous frames are very well-detailed and adds to the overall elegance of the scene. The color palette of the frames perfectly complements the emotions/aura of the scenes.\\n\r\n+ beautiful character design that is refined to the last detail.\\n\r\n+ the animation is crisp and flawless. This is probably the most well-animated drama anime I\u2019ve ever watched. \\n\r\n+ I also like the play and meaning behind Violet\u2019s name\\n\r\n+ the music is emotionally stirring which complements the scenes. \\n\r\n+ The OP and ED did not fail to meet the high expectations. These songs are subtle but they personally give me an attachment to the show. \\n\r\n+ overall, this anime offers a lot of emotions and they translated it beautifully to the viewer.\\n\r\n- it started quite slow and perhaps roughly because it started with the viewer not connecting with Violet\u2019s sentimentality with Gilbert. \\n\r\n- I still find it strange when an episode ended with someone recognizing Violet as the soldier of death and saying she should not be an auto memories doll. \\n\r\n- I think it may jump a lot of times from present to past.\\n\r\n- I still do not understand the importance of her 'Evergarden' last name. She is basically more like a Violet Bougainvillea than an Evergarden... (tho Violet Evergarden sounds catchier)\\n\\n\\n\r\nWrapping this up, what I personally got from Violet Evergarden and what resonates with me are that:\\n\r\n1. Letting go of people we love is never easy;\\n\r\n2. Learning what love means and healing after letting go is part of the process in finding our own selves; and \\n\r\n3. Remembering to live life to the fullest and keeping on moving forward, as well as cherishing the moments we have with the people we love are what will give us a positive and healthy outlook in life.",

The closeness between feelings and the heart. We are not dolls because most of us have this linkage that places importance in the world we live in. Violet Evergarden is the unlocking of the emotions in our heart, and it left several powerful yet simple messages behind that we all can take in.\r\nOne might consider this mature story to be too empty and lackluster as an entertaining anime. After all, it followed Violet. A bland girl who was broughtup by war, lived around war, and still with a mind in the state of war. She truly doesn't know what emotions are, left wondering what the words of love from her dying major meant after surviving the war. So when she decided to become a Doll, a job that took her to a world of emotions and feelings expressed in the form of writing letters for many clients, that was when her slow-paced progression came to light. The thing about the story was that you don't have to relate with Violet. Her backstory with her major explained the situation on why she was what she was, a human comparable to that of a doll. Many of us lived in a time of peace knowing the potential of emotions, something contrary with how she grew up. Her quest in discovering the things that are familiar and close to others was the reason why I'm interested in how she grew with meeting people who have circumstances. Again, it may seem normal to us, predictable per se in how the episodes will unfold, but it's not normal to her and that was why I was intrigued with her interactions with people, gradually molding out her character. She delved into their feelings, a paramount significance towards transforming the unchanging Violet into a woman who will understand the underlying personalities that every ordinary human possesses. There may be little focus for other characters, but the title of this anime placed utmost importance to Violet Evergarden, and this was why I felt the story made sense as it was her story. The rest served pretty well in creating situations to open Violet's mind into the world, and a couple of them did developed given their screentime. The only thing that put me off at times were the melodrama in the earlier episodes along with comedies that felt a bit off.\\n\\n\r\nUsing an obscure setting that depicted United Kingdom about two centuries ago, you will see typewriters, early automobiles, and fashions from the era back then. The different set of architectures were all refreshingly pleasing to see. Together with the character designs and expressions, they were shaded with realistic use of indirect lighting that just amazed me with how each scenes were beautifully portrayed. Definitely stunning and wondrous. There were two main tones used to depict the visuals. Vibrancy, especially in the eyes, contrasted with the monotic stance of Violet but at the same time, it also brightened up the setting. On the other spectrum would be the dullness that elicited emptiness, but it too served to maintain the Victorian setting as there were no bright technologies back then. This, along with subtle visual symbolisms such as the flight of a white dove to represent new beginnings and peace, were important in delivering more depth to a story that might had felt too dry without the attractive art to wash over it. Animation of everything were down-to-earth, reinforcing the realism that this anime had set up. There was no overexaggeration but the careful animation to create the details were enough to fixate my eyes on the screen. I can't find any fault in the aesthetics, it was just that immersive to see. As for the sound, there were moments where the European-style soundtracks stood out. Overall though, their unique quiteness was just there in the background to complement with the scene. It's not too heavy and not too light. Same goes for the voice-acting which was pretty average. The only thing I had in mind about them was that they had a refined dialect feel that reminded me of the mannerism of speakers from the early days.\\n\\n\r\nWrite something and it may just change a person. Violet Evergarden is the story of a girl on her way to discovering what it's like to feel and have emotions. It may be too dull at first, but the simple story of writing for people and gaining new feelings from people is definitely an experience worth giving a try, especially with the great visuals that glossed over some of the issues.",

            "content": "\"There are two sides to words\" - Cattleya\r\nShowing emotion and feelings in words let alone how LA tries to portray it in a review is no easy feat which may also lead to misunderstandings or lost in translation such is the case for Violet Evergarden...the character, not the anime.\r\nViolet Evergarden is a placid show, but an anime with depths in it's language of words and Violet Evergarden perfectly understands the misgivings, discourse and love of the written language and what it tries to convey to us.\r\nKyoto Animation ALWAYS had a way of showing emotion instead of telling us, Hibike Euphonium did it, Hyouka didit and Violet Evergarden is no different and this bleeds into the gorgeously done and sleek character designs, backgrounding and they're immense attention to detail to every aspect of every frame.\\n\\n\r\nViolet herself is made out to be a very bland blank slate, however she herself is the focus of the anime (her name is kinda a giveaway) but she at first is an emotionless, anti-social blank slate with no human emotions, but ohhh boy when we know her backstory with Gilbert and his last words of \"I love you\" bringing out Violet's goal and into becoming an automaton doll is soo heavy on both the audience as well as a part of Violet identity. She does by all intents grow from a husk of blank slate into someone who writes letters in order to bring people happiness where before she was nothing but a blood hungry emotionless \"weapon\" during the war. Yes, Violet's backstory does have some methods of \"emotional manipulation\" in making Violet's backstory as tragic as possible especially during wartimes in which the anime was set in, but for what it's worth, Violet's backstory though has shades of emotional manipulation and tragedy to push us into liking Violet, the backstory still has levity in the plot and Violet herself and opening herself to the cast as well as the audience more by the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow how Violet Evergarden is structured for the most part, the bulk of the anime is episodic look at who Violet is writing letters to, and by all means the plot structure does more in developing the minor characters in the focus of the episode than Violet herself, however LA begs to differ in some cases as some of the clients Violet goes through has shades of what Violet went through and we learn a bit more about Violet...through the minor character's development in the process of things. It might be said that the minor characters push away and brings less screentime to Violet herself, but LA sees that Violet both grows from these experiences and writing letters and once her backstory comes, it goes somewhat full circle by giving her her humanity and that she's not just an emotionless weapon.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the only cases of minor characters not being in the limelight as much and are \"just support\" are Erica Brown voiced by Minori Chihara (a co-worker of Violet and an automated doll) and Benedict Blue voiced by Kouki Uchiyama a postman. but LA understands, that it's VIOLET's story not their thus the support makes sense, loosely.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well this is Kyoto Ani, thus we have pristine and beautiful detail to animation, from character designs to backgrounding and even some of the more brutal wartimes fights shown is shown in bloody detail. Kyoto Ani's facial animation is brought up in showing emotions again, like LA said above and it's just amazing how the detail to animation makes some of the more emotionally tense scenes play out and how characters don't even need to say anything and we can see what they are feeling. Kyoto Animation did it again!\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, is tricky to say the least, as Yui Ishikawa who voiced Mikasa Ackerman of Attack on Titan fame, well she voices Violet and she keeps a kuudere emotionless cadence for the majority in voicing Violet, makes sense but keeping that cadence while doing more of the dramatic moments is something else really. Yui Ishikawa is kinda the MVP in this voice cast all due to her voicing the main protagonist, but LA will say the entire voice cast, from Aya Endo as Cattleya, to Daisuke Namikawa as Gilbert, Hidenobu Kiuchi as Dietfried and Takehito Koyasu as Claudia Hodgins as well as the rest of the minor cast was excellent in their portrays.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as LA praised Violet Evergarden, it's not without it's flaws, as such Violet Evergarden is a slow endeavor of an anime, Violet herself in the beginning is hard to like because of her emotionless state and anti-social behavior and finally the episodic nature of Violet might deter people from the anime, however LA will defend some of these flaws, such as the slow endeavor of the anime is mostly one because of the episodic nature and us getting used to Violet Evergarden through the minor characters she meet and us getting to know Violet through the phases she goes through from emotionless husk to a human with a goal of spreading happiness and getting over her trauma as proof.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Violet Evergarden the anime itself is definitely one of those anime you NEED to wait and see before passing judgment on it is the case with this anime and the overhyped nature of how this anime came to be didn't help with it's detractors. YES, Violet Evergaden was overhyped even before the the Winter 2018 season even started but even for LA, LA didn't really get into the hype train, LA did find flaws in the anime to annoy LA, but that \"eureka moment\" of Violet's backstory easily rejuvenated and wholesomely developed Violet into a great main protagonist as mundane of job of her as is to writing letters is.\\n\\n\r\nLA won't say that Violet Evergarden was the \"best anime of Winter 2018\" as both Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card-hen and Nanatsu no Taizai's 2nd Season are up for debate for LA as LA's best of Winter 2018. But as overhyped Violet Evergarden was, LA did find Violet Evergarden...\"competent in what it was portraying, wearing it's emotions on it's sleeves throughout the anime\" rather than \"the best anime OMG KYOTO ANI\" for a response and this coming from someone who wasn't on the Violet Evergarden hype train.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a tragic yet beautiful story of one husk of a person wanting to spread happiness through letters and finding her place in the world in the process where once she was nothing but an emotionless weapon. Violet Evergarden gave people voices and herself one too and for what Kyoto Ani did to hype Violet Evergarden to all hell, Violet Evergarden herself as a character and the things she went through and getting to know her was nonetheless one HELL of an emotional rollercoaster.",

            "content": "I have never written a review on here before. However, this show has easily become my favorite anime within weeks of watching, so I thought I owed it a review.\r\nHowever, this is not an action-based anime. Sure, there are a few fight scenes, but if you're here to watch something that's very fast-paced and exciting, this is not your anime. If you're here for an amazing and tearjerking story, grab some popcorn and enjoy.\r\nSTORY - 10\r\nWhile it takes some time for the story to develop, it is one of the best stories in anime I've ever seen. Most episodes do not focus on the mainstoryline (Violet's background) but are nonetheless very important for the story. Violet starts to work for a company that writes letters because she wants to know what 'love' means. While she is writing letters all over the country, we see all different kinds of love. Almost every episode has had me crying towards the end. Sobbing, actually.\\n\r\nThe main storyline also comes along eventually, and so far it has not disappointed me. However, the main storyline sometimes seems less important than the other episodes, because they are teaching Violet what love is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very clean and pleasant to look at. The shots are very artistic and inspiring, some of the transitions of scenes are almost like cinematic masterpieces to me. This anime actually uses the art to give the story more meaning than it already had.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are all great. While the opening soundtrack is very beautiful, the other OST is not really my style. However, both songs are very emotional and can make me cry when played at the right time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile Violet's character seems to be a bit dull and to lack dimension, I can tell you there is some really great character development, though it is slow. The other characters in the show also show character development, even the ones who are only there for one episode. All characters in the show have a story, not one of them is who they might seem to be at first glance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nI can't wait until Thursday each week so that I can see what happens next in this show. I have cried tears of sadness and joy, I have never been this emotionally involved in an anime before (not even Your Lie In April). \\n\r\nThis anime is also very accessible for anyone who wants to watch anime but is overwhelmed by the intense Japanese culture. This is a pretty 'western' anime. While the names of places are made up, it clearly takes place in Europe after World War I. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say that this is my favorite anime, the story and cinematics are actually thought through and professional. I can recommend this show to anyone who wants to watch a calm yet tearjerking anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

Violet's only reason to live at first is to see her beloved major again (he is believed to be dead btw) and to ask him about the words he said to her. Those were \"I love you\". Pretty generic if you ask me. The show then turns into an episodic anime which centers an entire episode about characters who never return again. The story doesnt progress at all until episode 11which is just bad.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nThe visuals are outstanding and some of the best in all anime ever (not including movies) and episode 10 is one of the saddest episodes of all anime I've seen so far.\\n\\n\r\nBut the reason I wanted to make this review is:\\n\r\nTHE ANIME HAD GODDAMN 14 EPISODES AND NOW THE 14TH IS AN OVA OR SPECIAL OR SOME SHIT??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME NETFLIX,  KYOANI AND EVERY OTHER SOB WHO WORKED ON THIS??? WE WERE PROMISED 14 DAMN EPISODES AND YOU BASTARDS DECIDE TO MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY OUT OF THIS.

With episode 11 fresh in the mind, it is amazing to consider how much the girl has grown from the beginning.\r\nViolet Evergarden is a story about war, but it is also a story about emotions.Violet is a girl of little words and yet she manages to reach the hearts of many, including viewers. The show has brought me to tears on countless occasions, only a few episodes not doing so by this point. The way Violet manages to touch my heart while not being relatable to my own self in any sense of the word is absolutely breathtaking. The way how a girl, like Violet, who doesn't even know what the words \"I love you\" mean at the beginning of the show, desires to help those so she can begin to understand just what these words mean is truly touching.\\n\\n\r\nI implore you to watch this show and give it a chance past the first few episodes. As you learn of Violet and her story, you learn of the stories of other supporting characters. You learn of love and loss. This show brings about emotions that I had not expected from the start and, truly, it will be a show that I miss the most as these last few weeks of it wrap up.",

By seeing the people around her dealing with their struggles, we see Violet grow from an emotionlesssoldier-girl to a fully fleshed-out little woman, capable of understanding the people around her, while having her own self-discovery journey.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is just the most delightful thing I've seen in a while.

However, just a few days ago I went back and watched the entire series in bulk, and I'm disappointed I didn't watch it any sooner.\r\nThis is possibly the best anime of the year that no one will most likely put on their top list. It's breathtaking. With amazing art, a story that'll make even grown men cry, characters that are hard not to love, it has so much for a dramatic story.\r\nIn a world where thisgrand war was ending, it shows the darkness the aftermath will show. Pain, loneliness, death. The show revolves around these concepts that we all consider negative. But gives off a meaning that even if you're at your lowest low, you should keep going, no matter who you lose or how hard it becomes. \\n\\n\r\nI will say the story can get very negative most of the way, but that is only parts of a breathtaking story with an amazing development in characters. The most I've done was tear up, but that was around 6-7 times in the entire 13 episodes. I will say that if you have problems in depression or have been in war that resulted in ptsd or any hard negatives of war, you should not watch this anime, but if you love amazing art, an interesting story, and tearing up to crying a good bit, you will love Violet Evergarden.\\n",

Violet Evergarden is one of those animes that you cant judge just sole based on the first 3 or 4 episodes like many animes. It doesn't reveal its plot, or main aspects until much later on in the show. It starts off slow, introducing you into the life of Violet and where she is post-war. It slowly introduces you into her struggle of learning emotions through her service as an auto memory doll and writing letters.\r\nshe learns emotions through the stories and lives of other people:specifically her clients.\\n\r\nthat's why i noticed it was hard to judge this anime based off its first 4 episodes only. \\n\r\nImagine you couldn't understand human emotions, but slowly you begin to understand and feel for people through writing for them, that's how this anime makes you feel. its astonishing really. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the first 5 episodes i felt little to no attachment to the characters, and saw myself not being able to comprehend the depth of this story, but later i found myself so deeply moved by other peoples stories within this anime I began to feel, as if i was in violets position.\\n\\n\r\nI felt for the story of the others, not violet in particular but that was special in its own way because i felt as if i was in the position of violet herself and was following her on her journey.\\n\\n\r\nit truly is a unique perspective and i highly recommend the watch if you are the type of person who is willing to take it slow with an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't place all its cards on the table at first, and for many because of its lack of action it can seem boring - but if you're in for a really deep emotional anime i highly recommend this one.",

I can't put ten out of ten because some episodes have a very decent story, you may get bored.\r\n Art - 10/10\r\n Violet Evergarden has one of the best animations. It's outstanding views, the beautiful character design and their eyes, the details. Nothing to complain about the art. \r\n Sound - 6/10\r\n The sound is the weakest point of the series. Because of the horrible ending song and the average opening song. But, it still has good voice actingand a wonderful ost.\\n\\n\r\n Characters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\n One of the best things about this anime is the characters and character development. First of all, the protagonist is a very well made character with an amazing backstory (one of the best anime backstories in my opinion). Also at the start she is an emotionless human but as the anime goes, her feelings appear and she unfolds her true insides. Secondly, this anime reveals new characters at every episode and everyone has development, you can connect with them very easily. Lastly, the characters are good and well developed but still not outstanding.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\n At the start i was bored, because of it's decent story but from the sixth episode and on, i couldn't wait for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\n Overall: - 8/10\\n\\n\r\n Violet evergarden is a very good anime that lacks in some things but with an amazing story, an outstanding animation, a beautiful ost and great character development you can't help it but to put an evaluate score.\\n",

Questioning about love and how to live normal without orders.  first time i know the anime before the anime released in myanimelist. I looked the ratings pretty good (it was rated above 8 before the release), \r\nstory was really really  good, every episode full of drama and progressive, violet gets more and more emotional and full of expression. I love the way she becomes  better  writing a letter in everyepisode until it's common in her daily job as professional letter's writer. The slice of life is the important part in here that made me think it has 10 out of 10 in story.\\n\\n\r\nArt was good, i can't really describe it but the for me the it is fine, i mean above fine, the effect, the character drawing so yeah.\\n\\n\r\nSound very good, the backsound really brings the atmosphere and the op and ed song are good to hear until finish.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter was great, the character looks promising from the cover at first, violet looks so gorgeous, elegant, and full of journey finding the meaning of life.  \"cooked well done\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall was great, i enjoy the anime and for me the story is the main \"spice\" in this anime.",

The animation left me in awe and yet the end result is different from what we expected.\r\nStory:\r\nThe actual story potential is limitless, a young girl that was viewed as a war machine that was transformed by someone. She needs to adapt to the post-war scenario (i.e. get a job, work for the community, socialize etc..) \r\nI was interested in what it would turn out to be and it didn't disappoint me. Don't go there expecting a hilarious comedy anime though...\r\nArt:\r\nAmazing. FULL STOP every single detail is portrayed well and intensified with vivid colors. Same goes for the animation, simply outstanding. \r\nSound:\r\nI'llmostly talk about the opening and ending. They piqued my interest quite a bit. They both portray the sentiments and atmosphere that surrounds the anime. Sad and yet refreshing, it kind of made me wonder a lot about certain aspects of myself (although this might not apply to everyone). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf you asked what flaw this anime has, I would say that it is the character development. Not the main characters, but certain important side-characters. I found myself several times wondering why some characters were developed so much and yet others were only slightly mentioned [or was it only me :') ]\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI love it. Will you though... I think that this anime appeals to most people that enjoy sadness mixed with a heartwarming development.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI kind of don't know how to conclude this but I still want to say one thing. People tend to judge books by their covers way too often. The anime is a bit slow at times and a sort of hit or miss type of anime. I still recommend that people take a bit of their time to watch the whole anime and then give their opinions.",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden, aka the most hyped anime of Winter 2018. It has already earned a lot of praise since the release of the 30 sec CM by KyoAni. People are praising how this anime is going to be the next big thing or anime of the year. Lots are hyping it up. Normally I won't like shows that are too hyped, but being a KyoAni fan, I just had to check out the anime to comment my thoughts. And after 8 episodes, what's my opinion on this anime?\r\nI have read quite a few reviews saying that the show is slow and the pacing is verybad. Well, I can't disagree with that. After all, Violet Evergarden is definitely slow paced, or to be exact it's episodic. If you want fast paced actions in this, sorry but I recommend you checking out other series instead.  Also because it's slow paced, I didn't write my review right after episode 4 just aired. 3 episodes ain't enough for a slow paced anime to get to its climax man, they'll need at least 6 episodes. For Violet Evergarden's case where they have 14 episodes, they'll need to get to episode 7 for their climax and well, it did happen. The plot did start progressing in episode 7. So, that concludes my view that people are too fast to place a judgement on an anime. It's like saying Hunter X Hunter is bad because the first few episodes is generic and empty. Writing a good story takes time man. Also let's not forget that this anime is sponsored/simulcasted on Netflix, where it'll have a high chance of getting a 2nd season. So, what's the rush?\\n\\n\r\nWell, now for the characters, I heard tons of people complaining that Violet is very empty and soulless. Well, in fact...she is. It's also stated by the characters in the anime itself that Violet is like a robot, very soulless and can only carry out order given by others. Now, the problem comes, did Violet develop as a character? The answer is yes, in episode 8 you can see that Violet is actually becoming more humane with emotions. So, that also add in to my point that people are too fast to place judgement on an anime. The other characters are decently written. They are definitely not bad characters but they just aren't important to the show itself. Most of the time is focused on Violet's work as a Auto Memories Doll, where she help others and find the meaning of love. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is okay. It definitely did add in to some dramatic scenes, especially the ED theme. It really didn't stand out but it's definitely not bad. The voice acting for this anime is excellent. They added in a lot more to the characters. So, props to the VAs for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the part where people are constantly praising about in this anime, the artstyle. Yes, it's beautifully drawn. You can see that the artists did actually pun in a lot of effort in their works. It's by far the prettiest art I have ever seen in a TV anime. The animation isn't bad, it's quite average, but mixed in with such a beautifully drawn art, it's hard to notice the flaws in the animation.\\n\\n\r\nNow to conclude my thoughts on this anime, it's a good anime. Definitely not the best, but not as bad as others claim it to be. They definitely haven't seen shows much worse than Violet Evergarden if they can say that this anime is shit. It's well written, well drawn and well animated. You should definitely watch this if you like slow paced romance drama anime.",

            "content": "The comet Halley transpires in the night sky once every 75 years. That means, one who enters the world on that promised day shall see it with his very own eyes alongside his grandchildren, and those grandchildren shall see it again with their own grandchildren. On those lengthy minutes, the faint trails emanating from the comet's tail draws closer to his eyes. A mountain-sized figure, appearing as a mere spec, that embarked on a journey so mindnumbingly great, has finally tainted the dotted heavens through a path billions and billions of miles long. Its tail leaves behind the sprinkle-like glitter that gradually fades into thecosmic dark. Then it strides away, slowly, but surely, its beauty unnoticed by a myriad of lifeforms sheltering under their homes, with their gazes lowered. Does one comprehend the message Halley leaves as it visits the minuscule blue ball we call home? The unheard words vary for each individual, or the words may not be passed on at all, or the words were there, but not understood. \\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden is a sweet tale of that individual who yearns to understand the words she had not understood, and this yearning has led her to an opened gate that reveals a world tainted with innumerable colors she never saw, colors which were once locked within closed hearts, but now spread open like a parasol carried by a wind-spirit through the mere power of words.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEach of us have taste in the sorts of stories we enjoy. I myself adore these types of stories, and I truly think it was told is such a honey-sweet and wonderful way I leave behind a burst of emotions. It centers around a character who desires certain understanding, and the way this character develops this understanding over time is great! \\n\r\nThe story, from the description lines alone, may seem somewhat convoluted and intricate, but in reality it conveys a relatively simple plot. Violet yearns to comprehend the meaning of Love, and as the story progresses she learns the various ways love can be understood. \\n\r\nSome may find this anime boring, and some find it interesting. Despite the divisiveness, the anime has appealed to me very well and I certainly enjoyed the episodes. To me, when 24 minutes flows faster than it should be, it is a good sign, and the fact that buffering becomes the cause of insanity, it is a divine revelation that states that you are into a particular series.\\n\r\nThe series is episodic, so not all the episodes coalesce directly, as some episodes tend to take place in varying setting and time. However, as many folks think, I honestly have no issue towards the pacing. It is true that so far the anime catches up sluggishly to the source material, but verily, I find that each episode is a crucial part of Violet's development, as I can't begin to imagine how the pacing should be according to other people.\\n\r\nThis rating may change, as the anime is not complete yet, but I am looking forward to it!\\n\\n\\n\r\nART : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin? Is this supposed to be  questioned? \\n\r\nKyoAni has outdone themselves for the past few years in delivering glorious animation. The art style they embed into their series is distinguishable indeed. The way they draw faces in anime is unique! You can definitely make an observation of plenty animes they animated.\\n\r\nAs for this specific show, I absolutely take this anime as one of their best works. \\n\r\nRight from the very details, shading, coloring to the backgrounds and settings, this anime is just a wonder to the eyes. \\n\r\nSo far there is no inconsistency in the quality of the animation. Each episode is drawn beautifully and I can just take a moment and stare at the green iris fields from Episode 4. They even implemented chromatic aberration into some of the shots! It just induces the 'bright sunny' feeling.\\n\r\nAnd yes- the characters are just gorgeous. Each of them are unique! They're like the square-root of -100; A solid 10, but also imaginary.\\n\r\nViolet looks legitimately alluring and magnificent. Heck, she's probably my type in terms of appearance. Not only that, but even the other female characters are exquisite. I desire the day I will be married to a woman as elegant as that, and from there on, my mornings will be tainted with the mesmerizing smile of her's. I'm just grateful I'm a minor, as it would be rather indecent of me for my lust to be fed to some of the characters which are like, 14? Anyways, I'm a teenage male, so you can understand the overwhelming aura of sex appeal emitted from attractive females!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is like the paramount amalgam between moments, episodic theme, and emotion. \\n\r\nAt times, the background soundtrack sounds rather mystical and induces an ethereal feeling, like as if you are a figure entranced by the radiant imagery of the plastered night sky, sitting on the edge of a high round, embracing the grace of the soundlessness.\\n\r\nAt times, the music strengthens emotion, putting thee in place of a fellow witnessing a shortwhile moment that brings forth the remembrance of a single memory from the past. I've been brought to tears twice so far in the anime.\\n\r\nAt times, the music was rather subtle, and was orchestrated in such a joyful tone, but it puts the viewers in speechlessness so that they can admire the charm of the scenery as the voices of the characters narrate.\\n\r\nBut really tho- it would be one hell of a ride to binge-watch this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of appearance, the main character is undoubtedly unquestionable. Her attire, even when it covers her body, brings my throbbling genitalia to a powerful stand, and feeds on my lust at such an unimaginable level, I crave to make love to her in the most passionate manner that the one who would pull me away would be crowned King Arthur. \\n\r\nIn terms of character, I find Violet rather interesting. She has a strong will to make the effort to understand what Love means, and overtime this has led to the her development over the course of the series. She starts out emotionless, inconsiderate, but as the meaning of love was amplified to her by various other people she came across, she began to cherish the significance of Love, realizing that the words I Love You requires courage to articulate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : 10\\n\\n\r\nWith all those fused into the amalgamation we know of as Violet Evergarden, there is no doubt that I enjoyed the series so far. I will watch this series to the very end and will come back here to revealuate my words in utter fairness and truth.\\n\r\nThe manifestation of stunning visuals, captivating story, and enticing sounds and music is like a burger forged with the blazing passion of a thousand burning suns. All ingredients consolidate in preeminent decency to produce a fine product!\\n",

It's difficult to share the impact of this show without spoiling, but know that Violet grows a lot as a character and learns how to cope with the life she's been given. Through impacting others she is impacted herself. \r\nSome find issue with the episodic format, but I find it helps show the bits and pieces that add to Violet's development. While there is an overarching conflict that ends up tying it all together, I would say thatthis anime is more of a slice of life. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime if you're into heart-breaking emotional mush, but if that isn't your speed then you definitely will not find much in this show and will likely see Violet as annoying.",

            "content": "7 episodes are out and that welcomes a first impressions review! Now, my opinion and critique in the end may alter due to how this anime raps up. However, as of right now these are my thoughts and critique on the show as of 7/14 episodes. \r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nI hear plenty of people say the story is \"bland,\" and I can't say I disagree nor agree. I don't find the show to be painfully dull or boring, I'm actually genuinely engaged at most times. I think that's partly due to voice acting and placement of angles in each scene. I'm always curious onto what ishappening next. It's simple, yes, but I don't particularly see it as a terrible thing. Not every anime has to have exaggerated plot points and very bizarre premises to be watchable. Some of my favorites have simple stories but utilize other factors in order to be watchable. It's pretty ridiculous at the amount of hate this anime is receiving. I blame the hype of it, and fortunately I didn't fall into this hole, so I went in with little to no information and expectations. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is that Violet, an exmilitary assassin is adopting a new way of life. Instead of taking lives, she's helping to contribute growth and happiness to others. This is all because the war is over and she wants to know what love is and what it means. With that being said, I actually quite enjoy the narrative of the show as a whole. I love the idea of having an introductory episode and then having a string of episodes exploring all the different kinds of love and their effects on the human condition. It helps progress our main protagonist and her perception on all sorts of human emotions. It might not be extremely endearing or riveting but I find it to be an exploration into what it means to be human and trying to find yourself while helping those around you. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOh but of course! This is one of the main attractions to this anime. I will say the use of music in this anime is quite enjoyable and it does help get a message across. The different uses of animation direction really gives me goosebumps at some points. The voice acting is well executed and I feel like people don't talk about that much! The lines are always delivered wholeheartedly and never feel faked. It goes hand in hand with the animation and soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs of right now, the development seems to be extremely slow paced and VERY slowly progressing. Violet's real development will probably skyrocket after this week because something happened at the end of episode 7 that will completely shake her character. But since this is half way through the series review, I can't account to any of that for right now. \\n\\n\r\nI do admire Violet and her character. I also enjoy her encounters with the ones around her and the impressions she leaves on all of them. The side characters however, feel very unimportant at times and sometimes even useless. They do attempt to develop them which is quite nice but I don't feel like they're nearly as interesting (when I say side characters I mean the other Dolls who work with her). I enjoy the simple interactions between Violet and her clients far more. \\n\\n\r\nWith that, moving forward I'm really excited to see where Violet's character goes!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, I do quite enjoy this series. It's a feels good anime with a tab of sadness. And if you don't like those kind of vibes, then of course you might not enjoy this series. If you're going to come into this series thinking it's going to be magically mind-blowing, then you're looking at the wrong anime. This isn't a sci-fi anime that's going to go above and beyond to blow your existence into smithereens. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands for right now, an 8/10 does suffice for me :)\\n",

After 7 episodes the only interesting part are the pieces of violets past and the whole rest is just boring. It is so boring that most of the episodes gave some kind of a filler feeling. \r\nThe whole concept of Violet becoming a \"doll\" doesn't make any sense why must she write letters to understand the conceptof love but this is just a small point why Violet Evergarden is mediocre. All the side characters in each new episode that should give you some kind of interest or feeling are just plain and boring. \\n\\n\r\nI still hope Violet Evergarden will be more interesting but till that the only good thing about this anime is the animation and this is just sad after so much hype I did expect much more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is anime is until now just mediocre and doesn't deserve a rating over 8.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate May 3 2018\\n\r\nAfter reading the novel this adaptation doesn't deserve to be a 5 it is just bad.

It evokes that empty and lost feeling after one finishes a book in which they were particularly invested, something that, I believe, almost tangibly changes you, if only in the smallest of ways.  I believe anime of this nature convey something that we can't quite put our finger on, be it human nature, or something more obscure.\r\nVioletEvergarden is not a rushed anime.  The story is paced, but not painstaking.  The character development is slow and unbalanced because the character herself is emotionally slow and unbalanced.  There's no one that stands out as particularly amazing, and there is no hero in this story.  Everyone struggles, and I think this anime does an incredible job in expressing this poignantly, desperately, and tinged with the elegance only raw emotion conveys, both though the protagonist and through the surrounding characters.\\n\\n\r\nPrepare yourself.  This is not an anime that will bring you joy, but one that will break away a piece of your heart and take up its home within you.",

            "content": "I have been withholding judgement on this for a while, and now, after watching six episodes, I think I have watched enough to write a review. So, here are my thoughts\r\nStory: 7\r\nUpto now, this series' story is rather....confusing. Not in that it's complicated, but rather it's depth. When I watched episode one, I was hoping we would see more of the war and what what Violet went through during it as she finds herself in the letters that she writes. Further episodes revealed that it was aiming to be a plot progression of character development, with little to nothing mentioned of her past. We areshown her progression not gradually, but in bits or pieces every episode. We see her understand a different part of herself in every episode. It is a series that speaks without speaking, and is a rather odd concept in an age where anime is drowned with shows which try too hard to appeal to the impatient nature of it's viewers. The weekly release format works extremely well for this, because this is not a show that you can binge watch. The plot up to this point consists of showing moments where Violet gains a new understanding of herself with each episode, and at a first glance, will come off as bland given that the protagonist doesn't really talk all that much or show much expression.\\n\r\nDues to the semi-episodic nature of this series, I give the story a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nWell. Art. \\n\r\nI cannot express in words how beautifully animated this series is. It is by far the best animation and art I have ever seen. While there are more intriguing art styles (like that of the Monogatari series), in terms of attention to detail and the absolute vividness, there is nothing that comes even close. It's not an exaggeration to say that this is probably the best two-dimensional animation ever seen in terms of just how detailed each frame is. You can watch the series just to appreciate how beautiful it is without really enjoying the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nThe opening theme of this anime is quite beautiful, but to me, it doesn't really stand out much. The closing theme really caught my eye because of the classical Japanese meter, and both the opening and closing are beautifully done. The OSTs are once again, very beautiful, but nothing to truly write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe main problem with the characters of this anime is that much of what happens happens in their minds, and is difficult for us to see onscreen. I haven't read the Light Novels this series is based on, but I can see that this is the type where much is left unsaid. KyoAni have done a beautiful job of it, and have not tried to provide windows into their thoughts unnecessarily, but I feel that this is the type of series whose characters cannot truly be casted completely on screen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIf not for the story, this series can most definitely be enjoyed for the art. I mean, look at it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIn my opinion, while beautiful,this is not an anime everyone can watch and appreciate. It is somewhat like Koe no Katachi, but somehow even more abstract, given that almost everything has to be inferred by that which is not said. Something that is made even more difficult by the lack of facial expression by the protagonist. To most, this will come of as a bland series with an even more bland protagonist.",

I haven't watched many anime like this before, and I think it is quite interesting.\r\nStory-8/10\r\nThe story is about a young girl named Violet Evergarden who decides to become an auto memoir doll to learn the meaning of \"I Love you\". She lacks emotion so she struggles in the beginning, but she starts to get better at understanding other people. She travels around places, meeting new clients, and slowly start to understand the meaning of love. I know the story might sound boring but it is actually quite interesting, andvery emotional. \\n\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nThere are certain scenes in the anime where people look at sceneries. The views are usually amazing and you can really feel that the creators spent a lot of time designing the scenery. The graphics are amazing and you can visualize the nature in each scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8/10\\n\r\nThe OST is quite good and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8/10\\n\r\nThere are multiple characters found in this anime, but not much are known about everyone yet. As for Violet, you can only see a few flashbacks about her past and nothing more. The rest of the auto memoir dolls or clients never really reveal much, but all are quite interesting characters. The directors did a good job in making the watcher curious about Violet's past and what she used to do.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9/10\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching this, I was quite surprised. I never expected an anime as calm as this to be this fun. The first 3 episodes were pretty good, and I never hesitated to watch the next episode. Once I hit episode 4 and 5, I was hooked even more into the anime and enjoyed it even more. The anime in general is actually quite calm and there isn't really much of a plot.

Those who don't can just settle for one episode to decide weather they want to continue.\\n\r\nThose reading these my unstructured ramblings might think that I really dislike the story, but the truth is, it's well written, well executed, and so far I enjoyed watching the show, despite absolutely hating dramas.

            "content": "So far, this anime has really been something special. It doesn't quite merit a full 10 rating (as of yet), but what I've seen so far is excellent and in some ways I suppose I'm being a little conservative in giving it a 9.\r\nThe most obvious thing to praise is the breathtaking animation; it has an undeniably cinematic quality, and could very easily pass for the highest quality of Ghibli release. From episode 1 to 4 there is a staggering selection of varied landscapes, from cities to fields devastated by trench-esque warfare and serene, untouched countryside. Each one manages to elicit the same \"oooh\" ofalmost childish wonder as it bursts onto your screen. \\n\\n\r\nSecond is the emotional heft it carries. Violet is an incredibly touching character to watch, not just because of her own thought-provoking emotional and moral conflicts (the most prevalent of which is her relationship with the still enigmatic Major) but also because of the clarity she sheds on those that she comes to know better in the Auto Memory Doll Staff. However, one thing I might mention is that it often panders towards excessively sentimental. Don't get me wrong, Violet Evergarden is chock full of some really touching and heavy thematic substance, but you often get the sense that the creators are fully aware of this. At times, a little more subtlety could've gone a long way, especially in Eps 3 and 4.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't take away from the overall effect of the show, and at times it can be surprisingly whimsical and light-hearted. Much of the humour derives from Violet's low-key savage blunt honesty, which is consistently funny (though it could get tired if KyoAni continually insist on it). Overall, this is definitely worth a watch. I can't wait for the rest of the series!\\n\\n",

Also, there is no clear direction or goal the story is going to. Another smaller problem is that although the episodes have good pacing overall, there is a bit too much narration/repetition. Overall, the story is OKAY. Keep your expectations low.\r\nArt: 10\r\nAbsolutely amazing. Visuals with fluidity that can rival movies further refined by gorgeous color grading and work in post. If you're feeling iffyabout the story/characters, at least check this anime out for the eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art almost saves the characters by brute force and damn good visual character design. Unfortunately, similar to the story, characters have a complicated background (so they have a lot of potential), but behave in repetitive, predictable ways. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nAbove average. The OP was good but I especially thought the abundant use of strings were nice to listen to and is mostly used appropriately.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if it weren't for the visuals, I'd probably rate my enjoyment an 7. Nonetheless, I'm a huge sucker for cinematic experiences.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nA beautiful anime but underwhelming in the plot and character design. I imagine veterans here will have a much more negative review compared to mine.\\n\\n",

To people who are shallow, this show is indeed shallow, because in order to find meaning the author demands the reader to find their meaning. Many different episodes talk about small shallow things which many people take for granted, such as having a child, or having a loved one. Violet Evergarden does not know about such things, she never had any parents. You are viewing life, through the eyes of someone who saw nothing but poverty, war, and destruction. Yet through these eyes, through these hands, throughthis absolutely beautiful masterpiece of an anime comes hope, love, and peace. This anime convinced me to keep living, to find light in the deepest darkest places of life. For me this anime is almost like it was something written by God. 10/10 in all aspects, if you rate it low, honestly, and simply you probably didn't finish the show.",

I don't often decide to watch anime known to be sad but I was bored and decided why not. I MADE THE BEST DECISION! \r\nThe artwork is absolutely stunning. I love the animation quality and feel that the artwork style really fit with the story. You are about to embark on an emotional rollercoaster (the good kind)\r\nIt will hit you right in the feels. As the anime progresses you get more and more invested in thecharacters and by the 10th / 11th episode ... oh man have some tissues handy. You really need to watch the entire series to fully enjoy the depth and character development of this story.\\n\\n\r\nThey do a really good job with flashbacks (I can get confused with messy flashback sequencing). They are very clear and add so much depth to the story and each character. The light novel that it was based upon was not in chronological order and I think that the anime adaptation did a fantastic job creating a story that made sense and maintained the essence of the original work. Very well executed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are like me, you have heard of this anime before but never really got around to watching it. The Netflix anime selection is not always that good so I had my doubts. Honestly though, it was incredible and I am thrilled that there may be a second season / movie. I hope you take the time to enjoy this wonderful animation. It was truly beautiful. There is a little bit action, drama, romance, and adventure for everyone.",

            "content": "I will admit that there have been times where I\u2019m unable to express how I truly feel. I\u2019m sure everyone has those moments, though; they know that they feel a certain way, yet they can\u2019t put those feelings into words. However, I will try today; I will try as hard as I can to put my feelings for this particular anime into words. After all, I\u2019ve waited so long to watch this anime, from the moment it was announced to the day (after) it was released on Netflix (because I wanted to watch it legally). Even so.... despite the facts being that this anime wasanimated by Kyoto Animation and the light novel it was based off of was the first to win the grand prize in any of their contests, was the wait worth it? Was this anime able to meet the expectations of me and everyone else who eagerly awaited it?\\n\\n\r\nFrom the looks of it, yes. At the very least, I can speak for myself when I say that Violet Evergarden was worth the wait.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden follows a girl named.... well, Violet Evergarden, who was raised to be a \u201cweapon\u201d for the military in a war. Gilbert Bougainvillea, a major in the military, did not treat her as a weapon, however; he treated her with kindness and treasured her....right up until he told her he loved her right before the war ended. Having lost her arms in the war, Violet is left with only those words that her beloved major told her and no understanding of what they mean. In order to understand, she ends up getting a job as an Auto Memories Doll, who write letters for people who are unable to do so or have trouble expressing their feelings. From there, Violet\u2019s encounters with her clients not only change their lives for the better, but they also help her grow and understand emotions better.\\n\\n\r\nSee, that last sentence alone capitalizes the second best thing about this anime (and I\u2019ll get to the first best thing later), and that is the character development. All of the characters get a great amount of development, from the main characters to the supporting characters and even those who only appear in one episode. Even the characters I initially found annoying for one reason or the other, I ended up sympathizing with them; if an anime can do something like that, it\u2019s doing a good job. In the center, however, is the titular character, Violet Evergarden, who gets the best character development of all. As fascinating as it is to see how she affects the lives of those around her, it\u2019s simply quite amazing to see how it all affects her, as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development helps the overall story, as well. There were moments where I was admittedly not too invested in what was going on, but those moments were few and far between; for a large majority, there was quite an amount of emotional investment. Take episode 10, for example; given the situation that was going on in that episode, I will just say that by the end, I was in tears. (It\u2019s kind of funny, actually; Violet is starting to understand emotions throughout the course of this anime, and I was starting to get emotional as I watched!) With all of that said, some people may say that each of the stories told in this anime aren\u2019t really connected to each other, but I can confidently say that whoever would say that doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. All of them are connected in that we see how Violet grows through all of these experiences; thus, even if these stories aren\u2019t connected, they are.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSincerely\u201d by TRUE and \u201cMichishirube\u201d by Minori Chihara, which respectively serve as the opening and ending themes, are truly music to my ears; both are beautifully composed and wonderfully sung, and I could listen to them many times! (In fact, I already have, in the opening theme\u2019s case.) On another music-related note, \u201cViolet Snow\u201d by Aira Yuuki is very beautiful, too; I can remember it being played when one of the first PVs of this anime came out, and it was pleasing to hear it again in the last episode. While I can\u2019t really say much about the Japanese voice acting because I watched the English dub, I can say that the English voice acting was superb, with every voice actor, especially Erika Harlacher as Violet, doing much more than just fitting the roles they were given. The best part about this anime, however, is the animation, and I really mean it when I say this; it is breathtakingly gorgeous, even by Kyoto Animation\u2019s usual standards. The backgrounds, the character designs, the colors, the animation.... It was clear to see that on an artistic scale, this was KyoAni at their finest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Violet Evergarden was truly a great anime. Looking for an emotional rollercoaster with gorgeous animation? Watch this one! It\u2019ll probably leave you experiencing pretty powerful emotions.",

That's what \"Violet Evergarden\" is. \r\n\"Violet Evergarden\" is one of those shows that have been hyped up for the longest time ever, but it is also one of the shows that I tend to avoid. \"The art is nice, but where is the story?\"\r\nYes, don't expect to find an emphasis on a story in \"Violet Evergarden.\" Instead, expect to see multiple stories throughout the series. You can even skip around episodes or watch the episodes out of order, and you can still understand what is going on. Why? Because \"Violet Evergarden\" is an anime that is portrayed through a\"realistic\" lens. Life isn't all about crazy exaggerations and stories. Life is more than just one main character. This anime was more than just \"Violet Evergarden.\" This anime is also about the people in her life. As you watch the anime, you'll almost always be hearing someone ELSE'S story. But through those stories, Violet learns more about herself, which brings us to the main reason that \"Violet Evergarden\" is a good show.\\n\\n\r\n\"Violet Evergarden\" is an anime with the strongest character developments ever. A life doesn't need a MAJOR event to change. It can be one small event, such as looking for a job as an \"Auto Memory Doll,\" a female scribe who writes letters for people. That's precisely what Violet did. At first, she wanted to be a doll because she wanted to know what \"I love you\" meant, but eventually, she wanted to be a doll so that she can slowly change other people's lives, to let people's feelings be expressed, and to bring people together. Every single episode is another heartbreaking story that Violet has to know through her job of working with people to write their letters. Every single episode, you will see Violet slowly change. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode in the \"Violet Evergarden\" series is named as \"I Love You and Auto Memory Doll,\" but the last episode is named \"Auto Memory Doll and I Love You.\" Yes, they're the same exact words but rearranged in a different way. To me, this is important because it represents how much Violet has changed over the episodes. The love of her life died. She's just living to find out what his last \"order\" meant. She's only working as a doll to find out what \"I love you\" meant. But eventually, \"Auto Memory Doll\" came in front of \"I Love You.\" Yes, she still cares about the major. She still can't forget her past. But she has changed. She is more than a tool that takes orders now. She is a HUMAN now. She is her own individual, and I think it is very beautiful how she found herself after all these episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes. Don't watch \"Violet Evergarden\" if you expect a big story. DO watch \"Violet Evergarden\" if you want to see the most beautiful character transformation ever. Here is a warning though: the art is striking, and you will cry. But you'll love it.",

If there should be any reason to watch this anime it should be for the looks and stellar animation alone. I can't even tell you how much my jaw dropped on to the floor because of how amazing this anime looks. More than half of the time this art looks on the quality of visual art cg's , but higher quality and animated. Lets be honest there are mostly 3 reasons (possibly four) for watching this show. \r\n1. The outstanding artwork and thefact that almost the entire time this movie looks like it could high tier movie quality. \\n\\n\r\n2. the fact that this was made by the reputable kyoto animetion. \\n\\n\r\n3. The amazing score. \\n\\n\r\n(4). the source material.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the worst thing about this show is the characters. thats not to say that their annoying its just that anyone besides Violet (the main character) is severely under developed. to the point that even when i binged the show i forgot some of the supporting cast. Violet is an amazing main character, though she does seem a little boring at first, i soon found her to be a more emotional character as she progressed thought the story. Unlike most anime characters nowadays violet actually has character development too so thats a huge plus. \\n\\n\r\nthe sound does its job, its nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nthe story is also pretty good I love abandoned soldier stories. its also episodic kind of like mushishi, kino's jounrey, or cowboy bebop.

            "content": "Now I have to say, I don't typically watch anime dramas, but I had to give it a chance after hearing so many people raving over this anime, and boy was it worth it! Violet Evergarden follows the story of a former soldier who lost her arms following the climax of a war she seems to have repressed. Seemingly left without a purpose after losing her commander, our titular character, Violet Evergarden, takes on the job of a Auto Memory Doll, a sort of writer-for-hire, in an attempt to better understand human emotions and, more importantly, what it means to love after being confessed toby the aforementioned commander.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone also not fond of episodic anime, I have to say that this series really knows how to give the audience a unique story every episode that almost always manages to make us, or at least me, wonder what's going to happen next. While the anime typically follows the episodic theme, there is an underlying plot that really comes to a head in the anime. This is definitely one of those series that'll have you binge-watching the series if you aren't too careful.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for this anime are all unique and almost always manages to make me connect with the characters. I can only think of maybe two instances where I couldn't really connect or sympathize with the minor characters of an episode. Other than those few instances, the characters were very well-written and some even left me wishing to see more of them. As for our main character, Violet is quite the interesting case. She starts off as a character incapable of exhibiting empathy and really understanding the emotions of others. However, as she assumes the role of an Auto Memory Doll and really connect with the customers she is assigned to, she begins to better understand the emotions of others as required for her job. Eventually, when Violet is forced to confront her past and recall previous events leading to her amputation, we witness out protagonist hit her lowest point and really express her vulnerability. Violet is just really one of the most realistic characters I've seen in recent anime and I really appreciate the detail taken in portraying a character like her.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is absolutely gorgeous. While the art style isn't really unique, the backgrounds are really breathtaking and the characters aren't too similar in appearance. What I like the most is the detail given to the metal prosthetics Violet reveals every episode. I know some people aren't fond of the constant attention given to Violet's arms, but I really like the CGI-animation given to her arms as it looks just amazing. The soundtrack is also pretty good. It's not generic, and it always fits the mood of the story at each given moment. It's not too memorable but I remember really liking some of the background themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe series ended with a card mentioning future project, but I'm really hoping there won't be another season to this anime as I feel like the series ended perfectly, and I fear it might be ruined with an additional season. Overall, I give this series a (9/10); the reason why I can't give this season a perfect score is because of maybe two episodes I wasn't too interested in. Those episodes were also the ones containing the characters I couldn't really connect with. I won't reveal those episodes because I don't want to sway the opinions of others. However, I will say that this anime is definitely something worth giving a try.",

            "content": "I just finished this piece of telivision and wanted to get some of my feelings down in words. This show isn't perfect, and I actually dropped it four episodes in on my first try, but it was able to get an immense amount of emotion out of me when I decided to give it another go.\r\nThe bulk of the enjoyment out of this show comes from how it made me feel. The art is amazing, the sound is good, and direction is great. When put together, they set up perfectly when the show wants to get emotional in a few episodes. I particularly enjoyed episodes7 and 10 for these reasons, and the other episodes from 5-11 are stellar. Everybody involved deserves a round of applause. After each of these episodes, I found myself feeling a lot of emotion, and ended up crying after several of them. I would recommend this to anybody that is even slightly inclined to this sort of thing, - you'd be missing out if you pass it up.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it is worth watching, the show does have it's flaws. First, it feels a bit too episodic. It's not too much of a bad thing, but there's not really a strong overarching story - only Violet's character development. While this enables the series to have some extreme emotional moments, it hindered my engagement (hence why I dropped it my first time through). It also has some very bland and uninteresting characters. Most of the cast besides Violet herself and one episode only characters feel flat. Luckily, the one episode characters are generally amazing and help enable the high levels of emotion that happens. Lastly, the last two episodes are fine, but they definitely aren't as strong as the series middle.\\n\\n\r\nAs for subs vs. dubs, I'd personally recommend the dub if you are on the fence, but just go with whatever you prefer. Watching the dub allows you to devote more attention to the amazing art, which is a huge boon of the series, but the sub VA's are also good as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is definitely worth watching on the merit of how magnificently it ties it's strengths together to make the viewer feel a variety of emotions throughout. I'm glad I gave this series another try.\\n",

            "content": "Story: This is the story of a girl who is on a journey to find love. She was a killing machine in the war and is not very good at understanding the emotions of people, or even certain words. This is due to the fact she was orphaned as a child. Now that the war is over she is on a journey as Auto-Memory Doll, Violet Evergarden, learning about emotions as she helps people write theirs into letters. When I first started watching it was pretty interestng but I thought it was an weird theme and was going to be another cliched girl learns emotionsanime. It exceeded my expectations, though. It was a heartwarming tale of Violet Evergarden, the young girl from the war. Throughout her journey as an Auto-Memory Doll, she went to many different places to write letters for people, in which we learned about their stories of love as well. This show had me crying the entire time and thinking about what love is to me\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this anime was absolutely beautiful. Each scene has so much well-drawn detail that I felt I was in the story. The characters were all beautiful and well-drawn. They were able to show emotion well in the eyes. This show has many scenes showing lovely views of nature and it's clear they intended to do those well. Even people who didn't like the show would have to admit that this is some pretty art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main character in this series was Violet Evergarden. Her emotional growth in this series was immense, her turning from an orphan, only trying to survive, to an (almost) emotionless killing machine, who only cared for her commander, to a girl who cries and knows what love is. The other countless characters we meet have deep feelings and unique personalities. It's hard to dislike any character or at least understand their feelings. Assuming there really is a season 2 (which, with that ending there better be), I am hoping to learn more about the other supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I didn't realize while watching this how fantastic of a show it would be. I sped through it in two days, so deeply moved by all the emotions of the characters. I highly recommend it, and truly hope a season 2 is on the way.",

That said, as a person who really appreciates good characterization anda well-paced slow-burn story, Violet Evergarden is hiding a deep, touching story of love, maturity, and pain under those stunning visuals and, coming in at only 13 episodes, you'd be remiss to not at least give the show a chance.",

            "content": "\u201cI want to know what I love you means.\u201d\r\nThis anime is surprisingly beautiful, and not in the traditional sense, even thought the animation itself is also noteworthy. Moreso, it\u2019s the act of seeing a character grow to become something completely different grow which it started from that makes it amazing. Violet Evergarden will touch your heart in so many ways.\r\nThe first thing we should talk about is Violet as a character, who you find very difficult to emphasize with, seeing as how she doesn\u2019t really show much emotion to begin with. But, as she starts interacting and making friends you slowly start to see thiscrack, and eventually, even though she is still very rigid and robot-like, she becomes functional.\\n\\n\r\nThe second best thing that the show does is how it presents its story telling. It tells it\u2019s story linearly, but uses Violet interacting with different characters to tell their individual (and often slightly painful or sad) stories, while also tying the main plot together. Eventually, it paints a clear picture of Violet\u2019s progress, and also makes you feel strongly about the episode specific characters, which is suprisingly affective.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to talk about is it\u2019s emotional impact, and oh boy is it rough. This show will clothesline you if you have ever felt abandoned or misunderstood, and it portrays these feeling throughout the show, whether through Violet or most of the characters. I\u2019ll be honest here and say right now, I couldn\u2019t sit through the show in one sitting, and I was in tears for the majority of certain episodes. About halfway through, the show goes into emotional overdrive and I\u2019d recommend taking a break, as the second half is very emotional and should be treated carefully.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo without further ado, we have some negatives, even though they are few and mostly inconsequential. The biggest problem is the suprisingly average soundtrack, which while not really needed here, could use a little work. The other thing is the sometimes lack of clarity for what\u2019s going on, as the show tends to jump around sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell that\u2019s about it for this review so I guess: TL;DR: Violet Evergarden is an amazing anime that I would recommend to everyone, which great characters and animation, and a thought provoking and emotional story.",

            "content": "Much like the protagonist of this anime, from whom it gets its name, Violet Evergarden is like a doll: a beautiful exterior with an empty fluff filled center. What Violet Evergarden does so greatly in the animation department is almost completely overshadowed by the dull empty story that sadly amounts to little to no value. Like a doll, you can go on a couple imaginative adventures with it, but once realize it's simply a hollow piece of fabric you move on to more interesting things with your life, as should everyone who reads this review thinking of watching this anime.\r\nHere we are with yet anotheranime to get pumped out by Kyoto Animation with absolutely amazing visual quality and no substance. At this point, I\u2019m not sure if I should expect this continuing forward or should still hope for anime like they made in the past. For a while back there Kyoto Animation only made incredible anime, but currently, at least for me, I've felt an incredible emptiness from all the anime released there from. It's all so very hit-and-miss at this point. That aside, I'm sure you could tell by my opening and that number \"5\" sitting at the top of my review; I don't really like this anime that much. I went in pretty excited, as I usually am for anime from this studio, because they've got a pretty good track record, at least in the past, of excellence, but Violet Evergarden is anything but excellent.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a street girl who's taken in by a military commander who teaches her to speak and kill people during a civil war era in a fictional Victorian country. She basically becomes some super assassin who only follows orders, but then the war ends and the commander dies and tells her to live on in a regular life, much to her confusion. The main bulk of the anime is this girl, Violet, going around the country with her newly acquired job as what the anime refers to as a \"doll\", or a glorified ghost writer. Each episode she helps write a letter for some person and it inevitably tries to be sad and emotional in some way. Over many letters Violet learns about the emotions she didn't know she had as well as what \"I love you\" really means, or so the story claims. \\n\\n\r\nI felt a massive disconnect with this story. The main protagonist is extremely boring, and robotic. Ironically, it would have been more interesting if the protagonist was a robot trying to understand what love is, because I would have an easier time suspending disbelief and understanding the character's perspective. Then, with that perspective the story could potentially explore love in ways that you wouldn't have normally thought of it and brought new understanding to the character and the viewer at the same time. Instead every episode you just get hit around with a generic sad plot that's trying really hard to be emotional and sometimes Violet will exposit aloud about how she\u2019s sad now too. When I can observe the writing effort to make something sad rather than just getting injected with emotion by my viewing, it really takes me out of the experience and makes the emotion feel forced, as does most of this anime.  Each episode presents a new sad story of someone I have no reason to care about with a sterile doll of a person interacting with them as they tend to end up crying. You would be reasonable to believe I think sad and sappy stories are bad, but feel free to check my anime list here to see that that's wrong. I don't think sad and sappy stories are bad, I think this story is bad. It\u2019s forced, gives no reason to care about characters in each new setting and just doesn\u2019t get to me at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason why this anime falls short is the characters. No one in this anime is interesting, most especially Violet. Very few characters get multiple episodes of screen time except the small amount that work at the main work place of Violet, most of which are very basic and uninteresting and in the end serve no purpose. Violet is the pinnacle of this being almost quite literally a living doll. Even a little girl later in the anime thinks she's an actual doll, she's just that boring. This could be fine, because this essentially removes her character from scenarios putting the entire brunt of the quality on the story of the people she's writing for in each episode, making her the same as you, just a viewer. This is ineffective because of two things though. One, the stories of the other characters are mostly uninteresting and uninspiring forced emotional experiences about characters that are difficult to care about. Two, the story keeps trying to go back to Violet's story and past as if it's interesting or important. Pick one, she's either a bystander and the story of everyone else is important and we learn about love through interesting stories, or Violet's growth is important and we learn about Violet. This anime unfortunately splits the baby here. The baby is dead now, but at least it's wearing a pretty dress right?\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals, in my opinion, are also really mediocre. As always with Kyoto Animation, the quality is through the roof, but that's really the only good thing I can say about the animation. Quality alone does move mountains for my opinion of art, but it's not getting anything past a 7/10. The visual's purpose is to serve and strengthen the story. The visuals are almost completely irrelevant to the story, the beautifulness of it all really doesn't mean anything, it just is high quality and that's it. The cinematography is basic, simple, which is fine, but I couldn't possibly say that it's anything great with just basic and simple. No interesting visual moments, no use of interesting lighting or perspective, just basic. Once again, this puts the brunt of the show's value into the story and in fact focuses on it, which I once again say is weak. The visuals only further illuminate to me the flaws of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was unobtrusive. I don't remember any of the themes musically, but I don't recall them being bad, which is fine. The voice acting is also fine; no one gave a notably good or bad performance. The opening and the ending theme are both skip worthy; I never listened to them past episode 1. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally, with all this grief I gave this anime my enjoyment level was very low. How could it be any different? I always hate when I catch myself already analyzing a show while I'm watching it because it's so uninteresting. I want to be enveloped by the story and not really think about whether it's good or bad until after I'm done watching, but I'm torn out of this anime's world so easily due to its boring characters and story. I can\u2019t just sit 13 episodes straight ogling at visual spectacle alone, eventually that novelty wears off and your left with a boring old doll. Do yourself a favor if you haven't seen this anime and just go watch something else, we've long since moved past playing with dolls, or maybe that's just me.\\n",

This anime really hits the heart strings. I was on a two-three year break from anime and when I decided to start watching again, this was the first series I stumbled upon. The story is beautiful and heartwarming. It follows the life development of the main character, Violet Evergarden. As you learn more about the main character, you can\u2019t help but sympathize with her and the circumstances she is in. I won\u2019t spoil the deeper contents ofthe anime, but I\u2019ll just warn you to be prepared to cry or at least feel emotional (like I said, the anime touches the heart strings). \\n\\n\r\nNot only is the story beautiful, so is the art. The art is gorgeous. It helps to convey the story well and every scene is like sweet honey being poured into your eyes (idk if that was the best description, but oh well). The music is wonderful as well. It isn\u2019t as overpowering as other anime music, but it has a warm and memorable tone that drives the story development to the \u201cT\u201d. To add, the sound effects are also breathtaking, and they remind me of unintended ASMR, lol. \\n\\n\r\nTo end, I would like to say that this anime is worth watching (as my review up top should hint at). The story development is well paced, and it\u2019s a good change from the fast action anime that are coming out in great numbers.

With the help of Claudia Hodgins, a formal army commander, she starts to work as an \"Auto Memory Doll\", amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into words on paper. Hence, she starts a new journey, a journey filled with words and feelings, a journey that willreform her clients' lives, and her own life.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing nothing but taking orders, Violet struggles a lot in her new life. Transferring feeling into words written on a paper is no easy task, especially when you don't know anything about living a normal life. Violet learns this through her encounter with different clients who each have a story to tell. The characters development was done perfectly. With each passing episode, you will realize how much development was put in this show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, Kyoto Animation has done a good job. Animation, sounds, environment, and music were nicely done. However, they could have done them better.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was good. However, I think that the first couple of episodes missed something. I think I felt this way because the first couple of episodes were meant to be an introduction. So, I think that they made it long.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Violet Evergarden is a show that takes you to various adventures with a good amount of feels in it with great characters development. Each episode has a great quotation at the end that can be used to summarize the meaning behind each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rate: 8/10",

I then continue on and it get more and more intense with the feel every episodes, there is no break to it.\r\nA bit of spoiler below.\r\nThe story is all about words, emotions and how everyone need someone to rely on yet need to move on with life, be free and live. It hit me in the feel of how such normal and almost instinctive our actions and thought are but it somehow really struggling for Violetto comprehend anything. That is, think of how unrealistic of it, it still managed to convince viewers to believe that such person could exist if the childhood condition allowed. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI believe this is masterpiece because of how it get viewers to think more that words and understanding can really change the world, both from inside of one and to the outside world. It is the best bittersweet story I have ever experienced. \\n\\n",

Story is simple, girl after war stars work in post office by writting letters. She must accept reality and her own emotions. Animation is beautiful, it's like an orgy for our eyes. Kyoto Animiation did great job - like always. Great soundtrack is composed to squeeze tears out of our eyes. In every episode we meet new people who have a story to tell - new stories - sad, romantic or happy stories written by life. If you let yourselfto empathize with these stories you will cry a lot, because they are not completely made up, these are things that can happen to any of us.\\n\r\nIf you have romantic soul, if you want to see people emotions Violet Evergarden is definitely for you.",

            "content": "'Please, give me orders' // 'What does he mean by 'I love you'//  'do I deserve it, to life?'\r\nViolet, a girl that is seen as a tool, by others. Better said, as an killigtool. Grew up in the military, and raised with strict rules, so.. emotions were like out of the place. The motto of her life was just, to complete their orders. But as soon as possible there was a Major, who did not see her as an tool, just as a girl, a human made of flesh and blood. That's how a beautiful, tragic relationship were build. \r\nWhile the anime, the main-lead,Violet need to fight with feelings she does not understand, thinking sometimes of giving up her live, she finds the way back  again and grows to an independent strong woman. Emotional moments that captivate the viewer  and causes him to tears, mixed with less action makes it to an unique, very enjoyable, slice of life anime. \\n\\n\r\nTo continue with the art, I just say, that it is so relaxing to look at it. To formulate it simple, its like a 'visual treat'. Character designs are pretty well made, but I personally think that they could give other characters (beside Violet) more attention. What I want to say whit that is, that I just see the main char. Violet as an unique character, seen to less from the other ones. \\n\\n\r\nSomething what I noticed positively is the chosen of Violet's voice, the 'emotionless girl' has been brought across well. Kinda like the background music too, some osts are just nice to hear, the others give you goose bumps, during the sad and emotional moments.\\n\\n\r\nThere is always someone, whit a different taste, who can not really agree with me etc.. but I personally, enjoyed Violet Evergarden a lot, a emotional, warm-hearted slice of life anime, were the painful moments for the maincharacter, are more painful for the viewer.

            "content": "Enjoyment of this anime really comes down to one thing - can you invest and buy into the dramatic content.   The first episode is easier to like than any other (imo) because it has just enough action and conflict to bring in average anime fans.\r\nBut after that?  Each episode follows the path of some ass kicking dramatic situation that the main character must resolve the best she can.  The main character, Violet, is lacking in any social skills and understanding of basic emotions.  It is though this journey that she evolves, and this is the emphasis of the complete storyarc.\\n\\n\r\nI fully admit I am an absolute sucker for dramatic content, as long as I like the characters.  This anime absolutely would crush my emotions time and time again.  I could feel it coming at the beginning of each episode, build, and release near the end.  This leads me to believe there is a lot of well placed foreshadowing at the beginning.  And the structure of each episode is built on unleashing powerful emotion before each story concludes.\\n\\n\r\nI love the emphasis on the power of the written word (letters), which is something in real life that most people are getting further and further from.  I used to write meaningful letters.  I used to write meaningful emails - now it's all texts and instant messaging - and the power of a well thought out, written letter is being lost.  It's an absolute shame, and I think a lot of people who have not shared my observations or experiences?  Just don't care.  It's not a problem, because it was never part of life in the first place.  So I get it.  To a lot of viewers, this anime may seem contrived, and pointless - especially if you can't slip into the story, characters and their experiences.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you can?  Violet Evergarden isn't just good - it's an instant classic.  My only complaints are nit picks about the world building and technology.  It's all cool, but there is a lack of balance or explanation as to the 1950's style machinery, and the highly complex augmentation which is literally part of the main character.  But does this really matter in the larger picture?  No.  In fact, symbolically all the world building may be in exactly the right place.\\n\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden has absolute top notch production.  10/10 for art and animation as far as I'm concerned.  Everything else is way above average.  My final rating a 9/10.",

            "content": "NOTE: this review is for my own personal use only. i've noticed after a while, i forget why i rated a show highly or poorly, so i'm going to write reviews after completing each series so i can reference them in the future.\r\nrating this show is proving extremely difficult; it has a number of flaws that can't be overlooked and in most circumstances, those flaws would kill the show for me. but violet evergarden excels in all its other aspects that i can't rightly justify what rating i should give it. so i guess i'll list all of the shows faults, then its strengths andsee if i can come to a conclusion\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\nperhaps the show's worst fault is its pacing. i personally enjoy slow pacing as it gives time for the audience to get attached to the characters and sympathize with them. when given violet's robotic character, it's especially important to have slow pacing, because too much change too quickly will just feel like the show isn't taking itself seriously. having such a blank slate kind of character, any change at all will seem like a lot, so you really have to pace yourself and avoid having them do a 180. small changes are all you need. and 90% of this show has the kind of pacing i want to see, but they do this weird sort of time-skip-esque sequence. she goes from full robot to full feelings in the span of an episode. in every other episode, violet gains a better understanding of her own feelings bit by bit through her ghostwriting. her character changes microscopically through each ghostwriting, but will have a noticeable effect in the end, after going through so many. but then the show just goes, \"yo. she normal now. she can cry.\" it's way too sudden and almost feels like the show is saying that the ghostwritings are unimportant. \\n\\n\r\nviolet evergarden also fails at a lot of suspension of disbelief moments. i can take the whole \"violet is a god of a soldier\" thing and that she can outfight anyone you put in front of her, but there are moments when i'm taken out of the experience because i can't believe she can possibly do what she's doing. in the playwriter episode, she jumps across a large lake while \"walking\" on the water which is completely bullshit. there's no way she could've jumped that far. and the last episode is full of suspension of disbelief moments. parts where the enemy could have easily shot violet, but then just decide to charge in like idiots, especially after seeing her take down 4 guys alone. then there's that one guy who kicks off the bomb. looking at the way those bombs were bolted to the bridge, i'm pretty sure a kick isn't going to dislodge it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\\n\r\nthis show has perhaps, the best episodes i've ever seen. the episode with the mother writing letters to her daughter was absolutely perfect. taken alone (and you could probably watch this episode alone without any context), the episode excels at everything. the characters, the story telling, the way the episode deliberately hides things from you - all perfect. the episode with the playwright and dying soldier were also wonderful episodes which bring tears to my eyes, which i feel is worth mentioning. if a show can make you cry, then it must be doing something right.\\n\\n\r\ni also love the characters. i really enjoy the clean slate character archetype that violet falls under, but the show also does justice to all of its background characters. with the exception of the big-tittied doll, you get (at the very least) a small glimpse into their characters and what drives them. in this regard, the show makes it feel like a living, breathing world. and every person that violet ghostwrites also feel completely fleshed out. characters who are only there for one episode get so much love. it especially pleases me to see that violet grows with her clients.\\n\\n\r\ni also really appreciate how this show handles post-war lives and how it affects people. it doesn't really say much about PTSD (which would've been nice to see), but it does hit hard on regret for what you did on the battlefield with luculia's brother and especially nails the loss of purpose with violet. although the show kind of cheats with how violet literally loses her purpose (with regards to the major), it does secondarily, or perhaps tertiarily, show the loss of purpose a soldier experience after spending his/her life in a war.\\n\\n\r\na couple of other minor things, the show's art style was absolutely GORGEOUS. it's perhaps the most visually beautiful anime i've ever seen. the soundtrack was also beautiful and used so brilliantly. because violet doesn't speak much, the music often conveys the feelings she's having, even if she doesn't quite understand them. it's almost as if violet is speaking through the soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nin the end, i have to acknowledge that violet evergarden is far from perfect, but it excels in so many regards that it's hard to rate lowly. the show is unbelievably beautiful in its visuals, soundtrack and characters, but lacks in its ability to pace its story and violet's character development. i'm giving the show a 9/10, which is higher than i think it deserves, but i know in the future, i'll look back at this show for all the things it did right instead of the things it did wrong.",

Anyway I give a 9 because of the nexts:\r\n-It really has a good art animation + very good music.\r\n-The story has his highs and lows.\r\n-It really gives what a love sentimental anime must give.\r\nWhile I was seeing it I was pretty sure I will give it a 6-7, but thats because the start is really a little waste of time like in her first jobs etc... Of course I know it's important but for me it was really slow, till chapter 10 when it really start to \"happening\" main story things.Also the strange atmosphere of the world makes me go crazy... It's like they have a relly good technology like in Fallout but they live like they are in 1950... So this twisted my mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway once I saw it all I can get to this anime being very good since it gives what it is (Love, feelings...) but to slow for me, thats all.",

            "content": "*Violet takes off her gloves to reveal a mechanical hand* *everybody gasps*--Multiple times in Bioretto Ebaagarden\r\nViolet Evergarden is a triumph in Kyoani's line-up in terms of animation. There is a high chance that you might be interested in this show just because of its animation and trust me most off the people who watched the show were also the same. The truth is that VEG is downright GORGEOUS, from characters to backgrounds everything is eye-catching and detailed. This show is visually a gem no doubt that.\r\n....but unfortunately, there are other things like story and characters that matter as much as the art if not more.VEG is quite mixed bag in those departments.\\n\r\nViolet is a young lady with a dark past, she was an OP loli (not to be confused with a child soldier) in a war. She basically thought herself as a tool. She worked under the man named Gilbert. She and Gilbert had a very strong connection, not that of master and slave but that of....yeah I'm not sure if it is purely romantic but it's still heartfelt. Gilbert dies in the war(not a spoiler) and violet is left alone.\\n\r\nViolet was basically living on the orders from Gilbert and now she struggles to find a meaning in her life that does not involve killing, so she becomes an Auto Memory Doll (it's basically like I will write a letter for you with fancy vocab).\\n\r\nViolet meets different clients that tell her about themselves and through them she learns about life, feelings, emotions and herself.\\n\\n\r\nSo this is basically VEG, every episode Violet meets new people. Every ep has a new story interwoven with Violet's development. These stories vary from Uninteresting to feels-trip. And that really does affect this show. One episode is really good and next one is meh and one after that is different.\\n\r\nThis pattern breaks in last few episodes but those episodes are its weakest anyways so....\\n\\n\r\nThe verdict for characters is same as the for the story. A good episode means the episode with good characters and vice versa.\\n\r\nViolet is a very interesting character despite the fact we don't know about her origins, about her life before becoming a child soldi...dammit! OP loli.\\n\r\nEveryone in the Auto memory doll department is not really interesting.\\n\\n\r\n----TL;DR----\\n\r\n+Amazing animation\\n\r\n+Some episodes are heartwrenching.\\n\r\n+Violet is a genuinely interesting character\\n\r\n-Some messy episodes\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory=ranges of 5 to 10( the only ep that deserves a 10/10 is ep 10 hmmmm) overall a 6\\n\\n\r\nCharacters= 7\\n\\n\r\nSound= 6\\n\\n\r\nArt= 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment= 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall=7\\n",

From the detailed, almost ethereal art style to the characters, story line, soundtrack and beyond. I won\u2019t go into full detail, but let me tell you about the main things I enjoyed and didn\u2019t enjoy as much.\r\nOne thing that made Violet Evergarden a great anime to me, is the development of Violet as an individual, discovering her own feelings, those of the people around her and trying to understand the meaning behind them. She grows from an \u201cemotionless war tool\u201d toa fine young lady who doesn\u2019t need orders anymore and decides things for herself.\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, the art style and sound track are great too and add a lot to the anime, aiding the emotions to show their true colours.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are very good elements present, I feel like something is lacking. In my opinion Violet Evergarden didn\u2019t portray its full potential and could\u2019ve been a bit more \u2018daring\u2019. But you won\u2019t regret watching this if you enjoy this genre of anime. I don\u2019t cry often during series or movies, but this one did it for me. I\u2019m definitely looking forward to the special episode!\\n",

The community now waited eagerly for the chance to see the anime as a whole. I'm generally not that easy to impress, but to be honest, the episodes have magically captured me, so this review was almost written by itself. Allow me to share with you some of my impressionsto give you an understanding of the praise and the very good rating for this series. On the other hand, please excuse this relatively long review, which could be simplified and reduced to the following: \"This anime, it`s the bee`s knees, it really is\".\\n\\n\r\nStory: classical structure, episodically arranged around a central theme (9,5/10)\\n\r\nThe first episodes are essentially an introduction that tells us about Violet, the people close to her and, how it came about that she works as an auto-memory doll. We get acquainted with Violet, who was seriously injured in action and on top of that also discharged, since the war is over. The narrative is quite emotional tuned, but well done without exaggeration or even becoming pathetic. Finally, we get to know her main motivation, which runs like a thread through the story.\\n\r\nThe adaptation of the story has already been criticized as the chronology differs from the light novel (LN) by Akatsuki, Kana (illustrations by Takase, Akiko) from the year 2014. Although this criticism is not entirely wrong, it does not take into account that one anime and one LN are two very different media. The narrative structure of the LN is a collection of short stories that revolve around how Violet as Auto Memory Doll writes letters for her clients. Each chapter begins with a story that doesn't seem to have anything to do with Violet, but focuses on telling the customer's story. Thus, Violet and her story remain a little mysterious and one is enlightened only by brief flashbacks of her past. This classic narrative style is well chosen for a novel or LN, the reader is drawn deeper and deeper into the story with each page. \\n\r\nFor an anime adaptation of a classic Slice of Life containing drama and fantasy elements, this narrative style was rightly considered less promising. The creative team began with a compact \"Coming of Age\" style introduction that well illustrated Violet's past.\\n\r\nThe content of both narrative modes is the same, only the chronology differs.\\n\r\nIf you're wondering whether to start with the light novel or the anime, the following hint may be helpful.\\n\r\nThe LN tells many beautiful stories from the beginning and slowly reveals the actual main character and her story. It is exciting and beautiful to read.\\n\r\nThe anime, on the other hand, marks the main character's initial status as an emotional infant and then focuses on developing her character through her encounters. In this character-driven plot some very emotional moments are offered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: successful, sophisticated and demands to take a closer look (9,5/10)\\n\r\nThe characterization is successful, but that remains hidden if the series is fleetingly observed or aborted. The individual characters are grounded and very understandable. A small number of only 13 episodes and an extensive cast make a comprehensive description of each character almost impossible. Regardless of the fact that the LN doesn't do this either, both the anime and the LN will convince in terms of characterization. One could argue that the main characters are not sufficiently described. Is that so?\\n\\n\r\n*The description of the characters includes spoilers, so you should first read the LN or watch the anime. *\\n\\n\r\nHodgins Claudia:\\n\r\nHe is a good friend of Gilbert's since the military academy and takes Violet into his care, according to Gilbert's request. Claudia quickly realizes that Violet is not yet socially acceptable and simply needs his help. Since he cannot resist a certain feeling of guilt towards Violet, he decides as founder and owner of the CH postal company to give Violet a job and help her with her first steps in her new life in post-war society.\\n\r\nClaudia is a kind-hearted man, with experience, yet at first unable to tell Violet the truth. \\n\r\nHis background story, as with all characters, isn't explained extensively, but the outline of his being and character is nevertheless well described. In the first episode, his character and behaviour are beautifully portrayed through  the dialogue with Violet on the way back to CH Post's office. Clearly, he tries to make Violet aware of what it will be like if she tries to understand further. But Violet cannot understand it yet, any other explanation would not help and so she must decide for herself what she wants to do.\\n\r\nBaudelaire, Cattleya:\\n\r\nAs already with Hodgins, we don't learn much about the background story of Cattleya. The small number of episodes just doesn't leave enough screen time.  Nevertheless, her characteristics are easy to grasp. An educated woman whose beauty is in no way inferior to her temperament. Her abilities as an auto-memory doll are impressive. She has great empathy and can successfully realize the writing wishes of her clients. She is the opposite of Violet, and for this reason she takes over a large part of the care and training of Violet.\\n\r\nBlue, Benedict:\\n\r\nHis role was reduced in comparison to the LN. It is clear that a reduction is necessary and that his role is not the most important. I noticed it anyway, because I found the passages in the LN in which he played very amusing. Since his character wasn't completely deleted and the shortening, as I think was done in the right place, I don't consider this to be negative. His character is a little quick-tempered, which stands for a certain insecurity, but he is a good guy under the obviously rough shell.\\n\r\nCannary, Iris:\\n\r\nHer role is well implemented, and the way she is described resembles the description of Violet's clients are described, later. Basically, she is Violet's first client.  She is actually a good-natured country girl who worked hard to get a foothold in the city. She is not necessarily the most talented and tends sometimes to exaggerate a little, but she knows what she wants and works hard for it.\\n\r\nBougainvillea, Gilbert:\\n\r\nHe is the most important supporting role, but we only get to know him from the retrospective. He treated Violet like a human being and not like a military tool. This becomes clear in the very simple but no less beautiful scene when Gilbert asks for her name and since she does not answer, he gives her a name. Gilbert's desire for Violet to become a person who underlines the simple beauty of the name is only an undertone of the scene, but a very delightful one. His character will further emphasize the background story of Violet in the second half of the series, as will his brother Dietfried, who is the exact opposite of Gilbert and plays this role very well and credibly.\\n\r\nViolet Evergarden:\\n\r\nHer character, as mentioned above, is described as emotionless as well as incapable of understanding or correctly interpreting the emotions of others. Since everyone else shows very emotional behaviour, the impression is of course strengthened. Maybe that's a reason why some people don't want to see the anime completely, which is a pity because Violet Evergarden is a very beautiful anime. The anime begins with the development of Violet from scratch. With every client she writes a letter for, her emotional awareness and understanding grows. As already in the LN, the character of the clients as well as their motives are described very well and Violet's reaction to them indirectly shows her personal development plausibly and beautifully. \\n\\n\r\n*spoiler alert end *\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: stunning in Art and Animation (10/10)\\n\r\nThe series impresses in both art and animation. It comes close to the already rare quality of an anime Movie. The individual character sketches are beautifully drawn and their outward appearances are very different and fit the respective character. The very detailed backgrounds as well as the architecture with strong Victorian style elements have been realized very effectively and with many beautiful details, so that it is a pleasure to watch. The play of light and shadow is impressive and the beautiful colours mix like in an impressionistic painting. The series also features a steampunk element, as evidenced by the simple vehicles to match the era and Violet's technically advanced mechanical arms. The animation is convincing, the movements of the figures appear natural, fluent in the individual movements and result in a beautiful overall picture. I was particularly impressed by the good combination of CGI and hand-drawn material. Besides the two prosthetic arms of Violet, the typewriter from the beginning of the 20th century is also an excellent example for me. Let yourself be enchanted by a European-inspired and breathtaking fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: breathtaking musical arrangements, beautiful OP and good VA & directing (9,5/10)\\n\r\nThe background music by California composer Evan Call is great. The individual themes musically describe the characteristics of people and connect the listener with current events. A fine example is the Violet Evergarden theme, which consists of a beautiful women's choir that emphasizes the feminine, the string instruments and the piano convey strength and the desire to discover new things. Have you noticed that a nice typewriter sound and an electric guitar have been included in the arrangement? Splendid music to characterize Violet.\\n\r\nThe theme \"A simple mission\" is a great example of how well the music fits in with current events. The emotionally \"awkward\" Violet meets the much too hot-headed Benedict, it is obvious that it will be amusing. The instruments of the arrangement interlock as if in an exchange of blows, thus mediating the back and forth between Violet and Benedict. The theme was used to introduce Violet at CH Post Services and is repeated in slight variations whenever there is work to be done.\\n\r\nAll in all, I liked the fact that there are hardly any militant pieces of music, though the main theme of the anime is war. So the anime musically focuses on the expression of emotions and thus on the dramaturgy.\\n\r\nThe opening of Karasawa Miho (artist name: True) is called \"Sincerely\" and is one of my absolute favourite pieces of music. Her voice is powerful, clear and yet feminine. The song goes very well with her voice and her intonation is great. Maybe the voice sounds familiar to you, she has also sung the opening \"Dream Solister\" for the great Anime Hibike! Euphonium. As I said, a wonderful voice and a joy to hear.\\n\r\nThe Ending \u201cMichishirube\u201d is a beautiful composition. The lyrics match the anime and although I know that Chihara Minori's voice is very good, unfortunately I don't get along so well with the intonation.\\n\r\nThe ending \"Believe in ...\" was only used for the 9 episode and is a fitting soulful musical ending to the episode. I like the voice of Yuuki Aira better and the musical composition is great.\\n\r\nRegarding the voice actors, I particularly liked Ishikawa Yui as the voice of Violet and Endou Aya in the role of Cattleya. The reason for this is that they both did an impressive job in bringing the character traits of their roles to life and making them audible. In the case of Cattleya a very temperamental and yet feminine charisma. On the other hand, Endou-san as Violet, a very reserved grace in her voice, which only changes into a strong emotional tone in special moments and in a skillful way. \\n\r\nAmong the male voice actors I was very impressed by Kiuchi Hidenobu as Dietfried Bougainvillea. His portrayal of arrogance and malice in Dietfred's voice was very compelling. Even if you do not like the character, you have to admit that it was an impressive achievement.\\n\r\nThe dialogue directing is also excellent, the conversations were plausible, but not exaggerated or even boring and predictable. In addition, it was even possible to put one or the other weakness in a better light. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed reading the Light Novel as well as watching the anime and I gladly recommend both.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and have fun watching.\\n",

            "content": "Violet Evergarden is a great example of how an anime can use a repetitive formula for almost every episode, but somehow make it enjoyable and emotional for everyone. It might bore you sometimes because the series can play a little bit too safe sometimes, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great anime that makes you shed a few tears, sometimes.\r\nKyoAni's newest anime adaption of the light novel of the same name, Violet Evergarden is about an auto-memory doll who tries to understand the meaning of \"feelings\", and know the meaning of words that were said to her in the battlefield of a war shewas part of. It is mostly about how Violet, the anime's main character, tries to become a new person after spending most of her life in the middle of The Great War. Through each episode, she finds out something new about \"feelings\" by going through situations that involve other people needing help. In the end, Violet Evergarden ends up being an emotional journey, that unfortunately uses a repetitive formula for each episode, even though this doesn't ruin the experience of watching the anime, too much.\\n\\n\r\nFrom all the aspects of the anime, here's all the scores I give each one of them:\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, Violet Evergarden uses a repetitive formula, for almost every episode. Most of the episodes are about the protagonist Violet having to help someone who is struggling with something important. Since she doesn't know the meaning of feelings, she faces a few problems until she manages to help this person somehow, and then, learns something new about feelings. The general story doesn't have a focused \"antagonist\" or something similar to this, so sometime you'll be disappointed that most of the episodes don't lead up to anything. However, even if most of those episodes have the same formula, they still deliver and surprise you in lots of ways. Each situation of each episode is different and that makes every episode unique in their own way. Sometimes, Violet Evergarden catches you off-guard, and ends an episode while you shed a few tears. The ending of the anime is really emotional and interesting as well, so you'll probably won't be disappointed when you finish the series. While the story is truthful to the original light novel, it does takes different routes sometimes, but they ended up being necessary changes.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals and animation of Violet Evergarden are simply outstanding. Everything is colorful, smooth and well designed. I found myself distracted from the episode and just looking at the entire scenario, sometimes. You'll definitely won't be disappointed with the art in Violet Evergarden.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe entire OST of this anime series is something out of this world. The music is beautifully composed and gets stuck in your head lots of times. Just listen to its Opening Song and its Ending Song, if you think I'm lying. The only problem that I have with this aspect of the anime is that, sometimes, a certain music plays in a certain scene, and ends up not fitting, providing a weird sensation to the viewer. This happened at least three times in the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their development in Violet Evergarden might start \"bland\", but they'll get better with time. The protagonist Violet, for example, starts as a character in which you can have almost no sympathy so much, but with time, she gets so likeable that it will look like she was never someone so \"bland\". Unfortunately, a few characters in early episodes are quite boring and never get the good character development they deserve. Fortunately, this stops happening later on. Still, the characters and their development in Violet Evergarden is not bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nEven with flaws that could be fixed in various ways, Violet Evergarden still provides a great, unique and emotional experience that isn't ruined by its negative points. Personally, I enjoyed the series a lot and shed tears multiple times, and the flaws were almost nothing to me. I'm pretty sure you'll probably feel the same way while watching this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Violet Evergarden becomes another great anime made by KyoAni, and stays truthful to its source material, even if it has to take different routes sometimes. While it does have a few flaws such as the use of a repetitive formula and a character development that starts weak, it still becomes an emotional, beautifully made series, that you should NOT miss out.",

            "content": "Kyoto animation is back at it again with their consistent ability to write a compelling yet tragic story. The phrase \"eye candy\" would surely be a disservice to this anime's stunning visuals. Couple this with a striking soundtrack and you only scratch the surface to why this anime is a must watch. KyoAni has stuck to their roots here by providing a setting where you will tread in the main character's footsteps. Throughout their emotional journey you can't help discovering pieces of yourself along the way. As a sucker for these types of dramatic anime I will recommend you prepare your tissues in advanced becausejust like so many other tear jerking masterpieces KyoAni has produced in the past, such as Clannad After Story, this will be no exception.\\n\\n\r\nOur journey of course centers around the young women by the name of Violet Evergarden. This military veteran was renown for being a cold-hearted killer. Her collection of blood and scars forced her to not only lose both of her arms but cripple her into an apathetic state. Much like chapters in a book, every episode you will receive a glimpse into Violet's past. The story mainly revolves around her quest of personal development. While heedless of the burns accumulated along the way, her shattered soul seeks the meaning of love. Violet attempts to collect the broken pieces of her past while working as a ghostwriter. Who would have thought the woman with robotic limbs and numb heart could convey the emotions of others so well. While writing these letters she is able to grasp her own emotions and eventually find a sense of closure. The attention to detail and delicate approach to the characters thoughts, emotions, and motives is what caused me to fall in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLeaving all personal KyoAni bias aside my only complaint would be the story. The overall pacing of the anime gives you a feeling that you are missing something important that I can't put my finger on. Yes it invokes an emotional response, but I can't help but feel there so much lost potential. Much like other Light Novel adaptations perhaps 13 episodes was a significant limiting factor. Surely nothing that can't be resolved by simply reading the source material.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, if you are a fan of KyoAni's cinematic art style and are in the mood for a tale that will surely strum your heart-strings, please don't hesitate to explore this emotional roller coaster named Violet Evergarden.",

            "content": "I'll keep this quick-ish and spoiler free for those who may be considering giving this show a watch. Skip to the end if you just want a quick conclusion.\r\nStory (8)\r\nThe story of Violet Evergarden is very good, but not spectacular. It covers a time period nearing the end of war and the struggles that come from it. Violet, originally being a emotionless tool of war, is learning to acclimate to the real world and come to terms with her emotions that she has yet been able to express. While there is one overarching story, each episode seems to be a little story of its ownthat ultimately contributes to Violets character development. The show overall has a slice of life feel to it, and incites a wide range of emotions into its viewers with ease. It seems to start out a bit slow as it sets up the characters and plot, but don't abandon it quite yet as it picks up heavily around episode 7. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this anime hands down is the art. This isn't much of a surprise, and is typically what initially peaks everyone's interest in the show. Nothing much to say here other than it's absolutely awe inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. Voice acting is fine, opening and closing songs are bangers, and the symphonic background music is beautiful and really contributes to the mood of the show. Great stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\\n\r\nInitially this category wasn't that great. Violet seemed to be an uninteresting and  typical-for-anime stoic character who simply doesn't understand emotions. But as the show went on, I was completely surprised to see excellent character development, which seems to be lacking in many anime's. I was very happy that there was reasons for why she was the way she was, and that the events throughout the show impacted her. The other characters in the show were very good as well but I won't waste any time expanding on them since the focus is around the MC. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime, but I wasn't head over heels for it. I think almost anyone who gets through this whole show would also enjoy it, but it may not be their absolute favorite. Basically, there's no reason not to give it a shot and I doubt anyone would regret watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an excellent anime. What seemed only OK at first really had me gripped by episode 7. I doubt anyone would dislike this show, but if for some reason someone does, they can at least enjoy one of the most visually pleasing anime's of all time. I would recommend it to anyone, and while it may not be the favorite of many, it certainly won't let you down.",
