            "content": "The Academy Awards, also known as The Oscars, is an annual American award that honors the best in cinema and their achievements in the film industry. Since its introduction in 1929, winning this award has become the gold standard to which movie titles are measured against, as well as the end goal that many bigwigs within the film industry aim for. It encourages innovation and progress, which is always a good thing in any form of storytelling medium. \r\nAnd while the Oscars celebrates the \"best of the best,\" there's an equally recognizable award that does just the opposite, The Golden Raspberry Awards. Better known byits shortened name The Razzies, since 1980, it has served as the antithesis of the Oscars by honoring the \"worst of the worst\" to come out of the film industry. Needless to say, this isn't the award anyone wishes to be bestowed with. And if anime titles were to ever be given an equivalency to the Razzie award, I can safely say that Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace would be nominated with flying colors. \\n\\n\r\nOverworked, ostentatious, and utterly deplorable, Ranpo Kitan was a tethered together mess with inconceivable plot twists and dizzying tonal shifts that relentlessly forced a narrative along with no proper rhyme or reason. It's a title that fails so much that it transcends to an ethereal plane of stupidity, becoming something like a \"how-to\" guide to making a bad anime. An achievement so successful in fact, that as an end result, it manages to turn shitty writing into an art form. \\n\\n\r\nRanpo was classified under the mystery genre but was better suited to be seen as a comedy. Trying its best to tell an interweaving story of a conspiracy, we're introduced to our trap protagonist Yoshio Kobayashi, or who I like to refer to as Fujoshi-kun, as his mundane life is flipped upside down when he finds himself involved with a detective after a gruesome murder. The rest of the story chronicles Fujoshi-kun's misadventures with this detective and the rest of the wack jobs they encounter along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery genre tag for Ranpo Kitan is extremely misleading since most of the cases have no real \"mystery\" behind it. For the most part, the show is simply dedicated to showing fucked up psychopaths and the extreme methods they're willing to take in order to murder people. There's no guessing, there's no clues, there's no investigation, just a bunch of crazy dimensionless lunatics killing people in very over the top ways. It's like Spike's TV series \"1000 Ways to Die\" with an extra serving of vanilla homoerotica. And at the off chance, the show does try to tell a mystery story, it became irrelevant since Fujoshi-kun and the detective Kogorou Akechi are basically the Houdinis of solving crime. With little to no foretelling clues, they're able to piece together a case as if it was simply routine. There's no proper answer given and when they made any attempt to explain it, the reasoning was convoluted logic that only made sense when the writers retcon past events.\\n\\n\r\nAnother poor element the show attempts to use is a highly volatile sub-form of math known as chaos theory. Like time travel, chaos theory is in its fledgling stages of understanding and falls more into the realm of make-believe than factual content. Most of what is known of it come from a lot of guess and check work that ultimately pans out to a dead end. To put it in layman's terms, it's impossible to prove accurate. And since math is all about accurate assessments, trying to incorporate such an unstable arithmetic equation in a real world setting only comes off as stupid. And that's precisely what Ranpo attempts to do; it takes an asspull theory and uses it to haphazardly explain away events as \"it's all according to plan\" logic. If you use an inkling of common sense while watching this it'll frustrate you to no end. It's the equivalent of a \"mystery\" show making up bullshit as the story goes along and pretending it was predestined. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the aspect of this show that became the most grating wasn't the ludicrous story but rather the ill-conceived cast of characters that populated it. This is a show that's asking you to take things seriously while presenting a loli teacher who looks like she's 10 but is actually 32, a fujoshi bait lead who is far removed from reality and think everything is \"fun,\" a man who wears a paper bag over his head and watches little girls, a masochist that wets herself, a detective who's a living breathing Gary Stu, a 4th wall breaking medical examiner who happens to be a loli, and the list just goes on and on. \\n\\n\r\nThese caricatures that make up Ranpo Kitan are tonally conflicting with the dreary atmosphere the story is trying to present and as the story continues along, they somehow manage to get worse. It's a motley crew of one terrible personality after a next, each one adding a headache inducing layer to the show. This conflicting tone between the characters and story results in some of the worst tonal whiplashes imaginable. Dark scenes can be immediately followed up by yaoi fanservice or poorly placed comedy. Nothing is treated seriously despite the show's desperate attempt to be serious and as a result, nothing feels significant in the least. Just poorly handled \"dark\" moments being forced to share screen time with subpar humor.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing Ranpo deserves recognition for was its audiovisual presentation. It used very interesting techniques to convey certain scenes and even had a few motifs, that while too deserving for such a badly written show, still helped to enhance it from being a complete failure. Some notable examples were the 'butterfly effect' visuals that tied back to chaos theory (obviously being represented by the butterflies) and silhouettes being used to show a character's relevancy to Fujoshi-kun within the story, by either masking the person in it or having them step out of it. It was a well thought out idea that deserved credit for its inclusion. No, it wasn't on the same pedigree as something Masaaki Yuasa or Kunihiko Ikuhara would use but it was certainly a step above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme were also nice ear-worms and even had accompanying visuals that were well paced. \"Speed to Masatsu\" by amazarashi, which served as the opening theme, was a catchy progressive rock fusion song that really got the blood pumping. Certainly a standout track from the summer season. The same could also be said about the ending tune \"Mikazuki\" by Sayuri, a bittersweet ballad that hit the right high notes while building into a nice pop rock anthem finish. They were both sonically soothing and were great as stand-alone listens.\\n\\n\r\n2015 saw with it a sleuth of detective/mystery anime titles, Ranpo Kitan was yet another statistic. However, out of the bunch, Ranpo was quite possibly the worst to make its debut that year. And for that, it earned its Razzie and spot in the annals of shitty anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I enjoyed was the opening and ending themes... the show itself can jump off a cliff into oblivion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to mince words here, this anime is really bad. It sets out to create a mystery and the end result was a faux pas into B-grade territory. Unintelligible and pointless, there is nothing here worth digesting outside of a superficial level. With that being said, I highly suggest you save yourself the trouble and ignore this honking pile of turd.",

            "content": "Here\u2019s the thing about detective fiction. When you go into a series with mystery as part of its genre, the least you should expect are cases, then suspense, culprit(s), clues, and the resolution. Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace takes the typical ideas of a mystery and attempts to transform the show into a blockbuster thriller. The key word here I refer to use is \u201cattempt\u201d. Otherwise, this series is what came out as a disorganized mess with a colorful script that started out with life but ended up as wreckage.\r\nFirst, we should understand a bit of the background info about the original series. The 11-episodeadaptation is based on an author known as Edogawa Rampo. As a celebrated author in Japan, the main focus of the series concentrates on some of his published works from over 50 years ago. Back then, he was known for breathing life into the mystery genre in Japan with inspiration based on famous detective known to many as Sherlock Holmes. But don\u2019t think this show as near as smart as it should be. Sherlock Holmes didn\u2019t invent criminal justice. He perfected it.\\n\\n\r\nNow enough about Sherlock Holmes. This show does concentrate on mystery and suspense alongside peculiar cases at works. The first few episodes establishes a rather bizarre case involved a schoolteacher being murdered in a crude fashion. The main male protagonist Yoshino Kobayashi becomes a suspect because of his close proximity of the murder and because he is a key witness. He also becomes an assistant of Akechi as they work on the case. This is where the mystery aspect of the show comes in. The first two episodes establishes Kobayashi as a capable investigator. Although not on the same level as Akechi, he is able to deduce with clever thinking that a culprit framed him for murder. Through careful analysis, he is able to clear his name. And by doing so, the audience gets a clear view of his potential as the assistant. On the other hand, Akechi is on another level of skill. He claims to work on strange cases out of \u201cfun\u201d but the government has actually issued a license for him to investigate in abnormal activities. \\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the thing about the show though. It\u2019s both a simple and complicated series. On the simple side, Game of Laplace appeals to the cases as some of them have fairly obvious red herring and resolutions. And if you can call a few of those resolutions, it sometimes comes out as fairly rushed and lacks concrete interest despite a thrilling buildup. A few of the cases does have recurring themes and symbolism that is memorable on terms of content. The complicated part is more of the characters. By complicated, there\u2019s a few ways to look at it. First, it\u2019s more of whether we should know them better. At first glance, there\u2019s a good amount of interest that should be invested into the main characters in particular Akechi. His intellectual mind is legitimate and someone that we don\u2019t see too often. His intention to take down a primary source of antagonists known as the Twenty Faces in the show is a keen interest that is explored often. On the other hand, there\u2019s Kobayashi, an androgynous boy who is hard to take seriously. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t focus much at all on characterization for either of the two main leads.  It does however, compare the two on a background basis because of their ideals and perception of the world around them. There\u2019s more necessary focus on the cases and because of content, we also get a bit of that on the supporting characters. To say the least, most of the other characters are far less interesting. Examples include Kobayashi\u2019s best friend Hashiba with mostly a minor role throughout the show and an implied crush on him. Or there\u2019s Hanabishi who dresses like she is going to a cosplay party, the Black Lizard with an obsession on Akechi, or the Shadow-Man whom is dubbed as the \u2018master of disguise\u2019. Is it just me or do all these characters have something in common? All of them are downright strange. And because the show is so insistent on focusing mystery, it neglects most of them with a lack of characterization. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I guess the show could appeal to certain type of audiences. Anyone interested in suspense that\u2019s laced with imagery, symbolism, and metaphors can find this show to be quite appealing. I\u2019ll also have to admit that despite some of the comedic values added in the show, it retains its seriousness throughout almost each episode. Body horror is also a prominent aspect from the very first episode that runs all the way through the show. It\u2019s not just symbolic but also literally frightening if taken on a realistic approach. Some of the plot twists of the cases are also gruesome with disastrous consequences that results from human sins. Additionally, the show offers some insight on various studies such as chaos theory and algorithms. To say the least, Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace is well crafted when it gets serious and not off track. But often or not, it doesn\u2019t fulfill its full potential. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork invests itself with a unique fashion although nothing outlandishly mind blowing. They essentially capture the mystery elements and thankfully accomplishes that. The most noticeable part is the obstruction of the character faces with the use of shadow silhouettes. By doing so, it creates a suspenseful atmosphere that appeals to the themes of identity. On the other hand, character designs are more or less worth praising. Kobayashi is designed to look like a trap and the show itself seems to be aware of this as it pokes fun of his looks. There\u2019s also a bit of fan service when it comes with characters like Black Lizard along with her sadism. Still, the show does maintain a distinctive way of delivering its art style. The amount of symbolism the show possesses in the form of butterflies and other background makes it enough to attract interest.\\n\\n\r\nA stronger point in the show is the soundtrack. The OP and ED theme song are not just visually appealing but also very well decorated with clever cinematics. The OST has the style of what makes a mystery show especially when episodes reaches its climax point. This is further accompanied by the eerie feel and coordination when demonstrated by its suspenseful angles. Finally, we have the character voice mannerisms. Criticism can be easily approached again with characters like Kobayashi, who doesn\u2019t really sound like a detective prodigy. On the other hand, I will say that Akechi has a voice that sounds like the mind of strategist. Furthermore, some episodes is able portray the emotional appeal with more sensible themes. \\n\\n\r\nSo what does this series in the end equate to? It\u2019s more of an average mystery show that has some promise but mostly doesn\u2019t live up to itself. What seemed clever and well-structured in the beginning quickly becomes stale. The storytelling is unbalanced despite all the interesting themes each episode that ultimately becomes half of entertaining as it is. And to top it off, only a few of the characters are memorable and probably only by their names. I will say that the unique style of some of the artwork and symbolism strikes as intriguing. And when connected with the soundtrack, the show can be a blockbuster thriller. Each episode\u2019s title tries to lure the audience in but in the end, Game of Laplace plays out as a not so much fun.",

            "content": "In the first 3 episode, I started to think that this series was interesting. But in the  last 3 episodes, it all goes wrong..., in almost every aspects.\r\nI will first discuss the story, the anime was identified as the mystery genre with no other genres. I should say that at first, the story promising many things. As we know, in mystery series, there's only one item that been offered to us. And the answer is 'the mystery' itself, but if we identified all of the available cases in Game of Laplace, there's not much mystery in it. It just a blank question that readyto be answered at any time and any place. The bad thing is the anime unable to present  intense mystery settings to the screen. Which a fatal error to the story plus the enjoyment. Imagine this,\\n\r\n\"Have you had any idea if we watch a detective or a mystery movie without any mysteries within it?\". The mysteries revealed with unclear reasons and many plot holes. Good thing this is just 11 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnother annoying thing is the character. I didn't even know why there's always psychopath that do the killings. The main cast could be told as one of the most typical, uninteresting, and ridiculous cast I've ever seen. You must know that the director is having a brain wreck. Instead offering a great mystery, they offering a yaoi fan service. Really? YAOI?! In mystery genre?! They exacerbated the situation with many other annoying and bizarre cast which I didn't want to describe one by one because it's just too.......ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound settings it's fair enough to make me watch this until the last second. Thanks to that two aspects, my headaches starts again.\\n\\n\r\nComic Relief, Ridiculous Cast, Unfulfilled Individual Element, and many other bad things make this anime got worse and worse.  All of that wrapped up in just 11 episodes.Trust me, if you have any idea about watching this, I suggest you too forgot this for an instant.",

            "content": "A damn shame, i didn't had a lot of hype about it but i was hoping that it would end up good. \r\nIt failed.\r\nRanpo Kitan is an anime to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the death of Edogawa Ranpo. He's pretty much of the godfather of mystery series. If he was alive, i'm not sure if he would be happy about this adaptation of his works with the modern twist of these days. \r\nFor the story, i'll not talk about it you can just read the synopsis. However, what i can say is that the mysteries around the cases aren't really good. They are casesthat could have been interesting but it goes so fast and they don't even show you a clue, they just throw the answer like that. \\n\\n\r\n''Hey, we never showed you that girl or these clue but it doesnt matter, that's what happened deal with it.''\\n\\n\r\nWhere's the fun in this ? Dammit Makoto Uezu and Seiji Kishi stop touching mysteries and stuff. Stay with comedies. Please.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. It's not ugly but it's not ''holy sh- it's beautiful'' too ! However, we can see that they try to be original with the presentation and some of them are really appreciated like the people who only were silhouettes representing people that Kobayashi doesn't care at all and only the people that he finds interesting is seen normally. Just background characters for him. Sometimes, they try too hard with the symbolisms that it just gets boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is ok. The OP and ED were some of the best in this season. ( I listen to them a lot in my car, no joke.) The OST is also nice, but there one song in particular that plays almost every episodes. Is the song bad ? No. But it gets annoying, a little bit like the song ''Don't loose your way'' in kill la kill.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are ... most of the time forgetable. With the exception of one : Kobayashi. A boy who got us all confused, thinking that it was a girl. Kobayashi is bizarre and wants some action in his life... thats pretty much it. The protagonist pretty much gets in trouble, help sometimes Akechi and gets our ding confused. The other characters aren't worth mentioning with Hashiba who might be gay for Kobayashi (we will never know), the detective super-duper intelligent and anti-social Akechi and Minami the medical examiner aka one of the worst character this season. Popping out randomly, trying to be funny. The Shadow-man was good tho. Weird and sometimes creepy but he was definitly the most interesting one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i was hoping that it gets better. The first episode people were sceptical and i was thinking: ''Oh c'mon people it's just the first episode. Give it some times.'' The more it was going, the more i was thinking that ... yeah, that's not good at all.\\n\\n\r\n4/10, don't waste your time with it.\\n\r\nWell, there's only 11 episodes so you can try if you want but don't get your hopes up.",

I really liked this show. \r\nI imagine that the problem most people thought that this show was pretentious, silly, all style, no substance, no profundity. And truthfully, I agree with all those except for the last two.\r\nIt is very true that this show is one of the most stylistic animes I have ever seen. I have never seen a show like this. It reminds me of Chicago, but this is that stylein the form of a mystery theatre instead of a stage play. And it is brilliant. It's bright, it's colorful, it's dark, it's powerful. This is something that truly sets this show apart. It helped with the drama and it helped with the comedy.\\n\r\nThen there is the fact that this show has the single best soundtrack of any show I have ever seen. I'm not just talking about the opening and closing themes. Anybody who has seen this show knows about that one song. I call it \"Another Sky\", and it is one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful songs ever. I will but the OST when it comes out just for that one song.\\n\r\nSo, what about the story and characters? I personally think that the story was brilliant. Twenty Faces is one of the best symbolic villains ever. \\n\r\nThis show can be boring, generic, and silly at times. But this show has been home to some of the best moments I've seen in an anime. \\n\r\nRanpo Kitan is a lot of things. It's silly, it's dark, it's strange, it's generic. But before it is any of those things it is a great art piece. Is it perfect? No. But this show made me really feel and really think. I think it was a wonderful experience.",

It is pretty sad to say that Kishi Seiji has declined in quality ever since Persona 4 the Golden Animation which I didn't watch.\r\nSTORY (3):\r\nThis anime marks the 50th anniversary of Edogawa Ranpo's passing. Edogawa Ranpo was known as the Sir Author Conan Doyle of Japan who produced mystery fiction books. Now, Kishi Seiji the director undergoes this project. \r\nYou know a mystery fiction has to build tension and suspense when it comes to mystery solving and riddles to be solved. However, this anime failed on that ground. Everything was extremely clich\u00e9 and countlessmystery fiction have done before in the past years. Everything was unresolved at the end.\\n\\n\r\nSome mysteries try to include all those sexual fantasies of the creators which Japan has been infamously known for. I told you I am very tired of all these sexual fantasies of the creators, they have been done to death in the past decade of anime. Like for example Kuro Tokage being tortured and she shows joy, especially Yaoi in this anime. Yes, I'm not joking.\\n\\n\r\nART (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is below average just like Tokyo ESP. The animation never give the other characters some colors, imagine just like Watamote. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was the best thing that will ever stay in my head in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (3):\\n\\n\r\nI really hate to say this but Kogoro Akechi has great character development other than the rest of the casts. Seriously, Kogoro Akechi was like a wish-fulfilment character. \\n\\n\r\nSouji Hashiba is just like another Azuma Kyoutaro with no personality that can stand out among the generic crowd. And do you guys remember Azuma Kyoutaro in Tokyo ESP, neither do I. But I do remember that Azuma Kyoutaro was useless and relied on Rinka Urushiba for help. Just like Souji Hashiba, he barely did anything but just be there for Kobayashi AKA Mr Transvestite.\\n\\n\r\nI will just define Kobayashi's personality with this quote.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just a sweet transvestite from Transylvania. I can't do anything and I jerk around with Akechi & Hashiba. \\n\\n\r\nKuro Tokage was the most creepiest person in this anime. She tries to be like a sex desire but she became creepy instead. The voice actress Hikasa Yoko this Summer 2015 anime has now voiced actresses that moaned a lot and including one character from Bikini Warriors. She is just a sex model.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain was as clich\u00e9 as the main villain as in Tokyo ESP.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3):\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that this anime is basically Tokyo ESP v2.0 with mystery that is not compelling and characters that are as bland as they can get.\\n\\n\r\nI've got nothing more to say. Lerche has now declined in quality this year.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets a 3 out of 10.",

Maybe i cant perfectly write my thoughts in here.\r\nStory 10/10:\r\nhmm i myself cant explain what in my thoughts but im gonna try...\r\nFor me maybe this is the most real mystery anime for me at least the most close situation with real life... I think for many people a \"Mystery\" genre should be typical solving criminal case with why,who,when,where,what,how. Well im sorry but this isnt anime that you looking for... but actually this anime have all of those aspects its just they make it a bit more interesting... Thisis our \"reality\" the case is not given by them but its in our surrounding, its how we interpret every cases, every action, and sometimes people&object and even the case itself used as an symbolic. \\n\\n\r\n(spoiler alert):\\n\r\nWell its pathetic that a 14 yrs old and 17 yrs old student solving the mysteries insted the older ones. This is unlogical and maybe not make sense for most people, but its just how our society are, its just how corrupt our society are,and its just how unlogical,nonsensical our society are. For some people who lived a good live grow in a good society,good school,good parents,good friends,good economics, i think it will be hard to get something from this anime even a glimpse. Chaos teory,masked man,butterfly effect,twenty faces? wow so messed up right? and dont forget the absurd criminal cases and maybe some yaoi? well its i think they already know if they make this anime with more serious manly characters it will be more and more confusing than it`s now and of course more bad ratings. And thats all just an example, the real case is in our everyday life...\\n\\n\r\ne.g masked man and sachiko shows us how kindness we give will return to us as another kindness masked man are maybe a grandpa who you dont know showed up when you`re alone and sick, and maybe he`s a person who helps you when you`re on accidents you or a doctor who cures you? or just some stranger who loves kids and guard your sisters/brothers when you`re not there... who knows? \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: If you`re gonna watch this anime, try to think as unlogical as you can, try to understand what the creator want to say... its all about our surroundings, and always pay attention at all the symbols.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan - Game Of Laplace is one of the three shows that aired in Summer 2015 from relatively new studio, Studio Lerche. This was the studios first time ever producing more than 2 anime in a year, and I must say, besides one major fault, this, as one of the 4 series from them this year, is my favourite.\r\nLet's get the bad thing out of the way. The execution of the writing. The first 2 episodes and the last 5 episodes I absolutely loved, however, all that was in-between I would have counted as filler if they didn't come into use (even though small)in easily one of the best finale's of the year. Their were three writers to the series, and all had their own distinct style which creating a bit of a problem for many watchers. The weakest out of which is the writer not mentioned in the staff part of this series' page. When she was on script, the series felt rushed and packed with completely forgettable introductory episodes. The writing itself I had no problem with, it was excellent and daring, but it was the execution of some episodes that really dragged it down. However, even if those episodes left a sour taste in the mouth, the finale quickly redeems those faults.\\n\\n\r\nProduction -\\n\r\nThe production is on the complete opposite of the spectrum. Even if just for the production, watch this series. This really proved that Lerche is full of both veterens and creative young animators alike. Just like in all other of their series, their wasn't a single frame that wasn't near perfect art. The animation was well above the average standard also. However, it was the creative aesthetics that made this show so excellent. Everything has meaning. Its full of symbolism and unique visuals which change depending on what point of view the episode focuses on. The cgi was really well done and blended in nicely, and the colour palette was extremely vibrant and atmospheric in itself. The voice acting was also incredible, with the most notable actors being Jun Fukuyama with his short yet absolutely phenominal role as a key character. The music was excellent, as would be expected from the man behind \"Your Lie In April\"'s soundtrack.\\n\r\nHowever, the man who deserves the most praise is Seiji Kishi. His cinemetography, choreography and just overall his direction is still to this day second to none in the T.V. anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nHighlights of the series -\\n\r\nMusic - Phenominal\\n\r\nVoice Acting - one of the best acting of the season\\n\r\nArt - very minimal flaws only noticeable if going individual frames at a time.\\n\r\nAnimation - varying from fluid to movie quality\\n\r\nDirection - some of the best directing of the year.\\n\r\naesthetics - almost studio Shaft in nature.\\n\r\nThe Finale - couldn't have been more excellent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this proved many things to us about studio Lerche. \\n\r\n1 - they are daring and will not hold anything back. They are also masters at censorship, sometimes the censorship is used to even compliment the overall visual.\\n\r\n2 - they have excellent production quality\\n\r\n3 - they are a studio that can actually think\\n\r\n4 - they are incredibly creative and unique\\n\r\n5 - they have massive potential going forward\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan was a great series only bogged down by poor scripting.",

            "content": "Okay okay, before I get backlashed for my \"high\" rating, please read this (almost lengthy) review. \r\nFor a disclaimer, I haven't read any of the source material. I've heard bad things about this adaption, but I can't agree or disagree. But you have my condolences on it not being to your standards, really, I understand. And yes I'll probably read the source material in the future.\r\nStory - 7/10   \r\nThe story, for my tastes, was interesting for the most part. There of course are lots of things I wish they had done differently, but you can't win 'em all I guess. For example the\"comedy\" relief in Ranpo Kitan isn't that great. I didn't find most of it actually \"funny.\" Then again, humour is subjective. The characters are also a disappointment, but I'll get more into that later. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual plot of this story, to me, is interesting (even with execution not being as good as it could have been). It makes us ponder the everyday vision of society. Who are we and what do we mean? Who is bad? Who is good? Is there really a difference? I love anime that makes me blur the line between \"good\" and \"evil.\" Whether it's cliche or not, it's interesting to think about. \\n\\n\r\n*spoiler warning ahead--just skip to the \"art\" part*\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into the actual spoiler part, let's do some backtracking. This anime is filled with a plethora of symbols and metaphors. Ranpo Kitan's whole plot and visual aspect is built on this. So of course if you don't look into the small detail or even care about it, you'll miss out on something. This isn't an anime you can turn your brain off and watch. You have to pay attention. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said let's get into the ending spoiler. A lot of people are complaining about the ending and how \"nothing changes,\" and how \"this was a waste.\" While I agree there was TONS of wasted potential, the ending was perfect. All the efforts made by the characters proves futile. That's right, useless.  But life is a paradox; this ending was suppose to represent the society we live in. While things do and will change, there's just some things that won't. We CAN'T make the bad people go away. Evil will always exist. So Namikoshi's death (or maybe he tricked the formula into thinking he died) went in vain. Nothing came of his disappearance. This means deaths everyday in this would are \"wasted\" on this idea that it will mean something. While some do, most don't from the other people looking in. Their death, unfortunately, becomes a part of a statistic. \\n\\n\r\nEvil isn't born, it's created. it's created by people who were also created by evil. It's a never ending cycle that can't and will not be broken. Bullies, rapists, molesters, kidnappers, murders, etc etc will always exist and other people will always be a victim to these monsters. And that's what this ending represents; a never ending cycle of bad people being created in this world. Take it or leave it, but just know that our justice system is just as messed up as these people. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime is very fluid (for the most part). I enjoy the dark scenery and character designs in contrast to the characters' eye color. It could represent the light we see in people but how the darkness is an unavoidable concept.  The art and animation is also visually beautiful. Mostly the symbolic story telling in a lot of the scenes. It's all so so stunning. I love the color pallet they chose for Ranpo Kitan overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also beautifully done. The OP is just great. I'm now a big fan of amazarashi's music. They are known for they storytelling music and I love that. \"Speed and Friction\" is one of my favorite OPs of the season.  Now the ending song. Wow the first time I listened to it I was captivated. It's beautifully dark. \"Mikazuki\" is one of my favorite EDs this season as well. The whole soundtrack is on point and I love everything about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where my review does a 180. The characters are so bland it makes me wanna bang me head on a wall. While I didn't HATE Kobayashi, I completely understand why people do. He's so annoying. He's part of that \"comedic\" relief I mentioned earlier. It all seems out of place and he makes me feel a lil uncomfortable. Especially because he's so fascinated by death and such. Now I personally find death interesting, but I'm more interested in where we go after we die, not dead body parts. I understand how his character is suppose to be a polar opposite of the entire plot, but it wasn't done well. I like the supporting characters more, but his best friend was pretty annoying too. I will admit his gay lil crush is kind of funny and cute, but that's about it. It's the only thing I like about either of them lol. \\n\\n\r\nNow with Akechi, the paper bag guy, and Namikoshi. I like the \"I don't give a fuck\" archetypes such as Akechi. Nothing really stood out with him for me. I do admire the care and love he had for his best friend Namikoshi though. With no one in the world to understand each other, they only had one another. I get that on a personal level. This brings me into another thing people didn't like which was the cliche backstory on Namikoshi. Saying it was a typical antagonist backstory, which is all true. It's as cliche as they come, but it fits the overall anime well. It's the simplicity that really reflects society. There are tons of people in this world that are/were in the exact same situation he was in. This anime revolves a lot around death the social injustice of this world. So it all makes perfect sense. \\n\\n\r\nThe paper bag guy was just one small fraction of the humour I enjoyed in Ranpo Kitan. He was interesting. I still wonder who he really is, but some mysteries are meant to be unknown. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI know the flaws. I know the small plot holes. I know a lot of things went unanswered. I know this story had it's issues. With all that being said, I still really enjoyed myself. This anime is honestly a hit or a miss with people, and for me it was a win. This is coming from someone who loves looking beyond the given visuals. It's easy for me to read in between the lines. It gets an eight for mostly the ending otherwise it would be like a seven. \\n\\n\r\nIt's impossible for me to recommend or not recommend this anime. It's just up for the viewers interpretation. You might be disappointed and hate or like it and feel fulfilled. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really don't want to 'pile on' the Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace troll train. This show has been shat on and abandoned by so many bloggers and critics that it needs no more of that. Rather, though I'm giving this show an overall score of 4, I'd like to mount a short defense of the show. I do not regret watching it, and would encourage others to do the same.\r\nWarning: some spoilers, though nothing too significant, follow.\r\nHere are what I believe to be the greatest problems with the show, and the ones most criticism live on:\r\nThe mysteries are not great, and billing this asa detective, or mystery, show is somewhat untrue. Leaps of logic, insane and often inane conclusions based off the most meager of evidence, frequent the show. The cases are often punctuated by brief bouts of melodrama, where the culprit's trauma is explained as tragedy; some of these are more ridiculous than others. A few, however, are moving. Murders occur in the beginning, and culprits are caught in the end; but this is not the only thing required for a good mystery, and perhaps the most relevant criticism we can make of Ranpo Kitan is that it fails to engage the intellect of its viewers in this crucial respect. Though it parades the structures and tropes of a mystery show, this has little to do with mystery.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this show on a weekly basis leaves the viewer with no sense of cohesion or order. All is chaotic. A grand design behind the show's haphazard design is not perceptible. As has been pointed out before, this anime is, in two words, fucking weird; intense and stylized scenes merge the grotesque and ordinary, perhaps most pointedly in the medical examiner's lighthearted dissections of the murder victims. Even if a grand design is apparent to those who've finished it, the show fails to compel viewers to come back week after week. Those who kept watching do so less out of eager interest, and more out of a benign curiosity, with the intent of observing the final moments of a beautiful trainwreck. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on. \\n\\n\r\nComing into this show with the expectation of mystery - primarily because it commemorates Edogawa Ranpo - leads you to one conclusion: this show blows. \\n\\n\r\nWe might instead think of this show in the tradition of Gatchaman Crowds, and think of the cases that pepper the show as angles that slowly reveal a particular social condition to us. It is precisely this element that captivated - well, captivated is too strong a word, but compelled kindasorta - some viewers even as so many dropped the show. In adapting Crowds to its modern incarnation, the show changed and \"updated\" much of the show; here is a similar attempt, though it tends to flail and drown where Crowds soars and succeeds. If Crowds is a social commentary that happens to involve superheroes, Game of Laplace is a social commentary that happens to involve detectives and mysteries, and while the former is no doubt a more successful show, the comparison still holds water. \\n\\n\r\nIn adapting Edogawa Ranpo, the creators of the show wanted to modernize and accentuate elements of Edogawa, and they dramatized it as they saw fit. In a similar fashion to Crowds, they focus on the cross between the net, anonymity, and justice. \\n\\n\r\nThe aching sorrow with which each culprit is portrayed may seem too much, but the tableaus all flow from a general disgust with the legal system - a system that fails, we are told, to hold even the most cruel criminals accountable for their actions. And the leitmotifs the show employs - the butterflies, the shadows, and the tender (if silly) way each culprit's grief is put on tableau for the viewer; they're all more digestible when viewed from this perspective. These recurring tropes make little to no sense, and are indeed distracting, if you consider the show a mystery. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Kobayashi, is only 'explained' by way of the completion of the plot - indeed, another flaw of the show. Even then, you might not buy it, and viewers of the show will only have a 'cold' connection in the characters - not an empathetic or meaningful one. Many simply kept watching, I imagine, to see if Kobayashi would lapse into crime. Yet the show points to Kobayashi's psychopathy as a metaphor, and proceeds to do little to nothing with it, aside from gift us all a few beautiful stills that glimpse into his perspective. Though I suggest here a level of grandeur behind the show, I do not want the reader to believe I think the show does so with success. And so this review is not a typical, pretentious \"you-just-didn't-see-the-point\" of it review. The show still fails in many respects. Most, in fact. The art and sound design is good and sometimes great, but in every other respect it's lacking.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's still worth a watch. Beware the obsessively negative reviews; this show is at times beautiful. It is nothing near a masterpiece, but I would recommend it to any whose taste veer toward the strange and unique, or those interested in watching a dazzling trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\n\"Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace\" attempts to gesture towards something complex, and fails - with magnificence - to say anything meaningful. This will never be considered a great show. Rather, it is an imbalanced show, leaping off a cliff without a solid plan of escape. But crazy shows that burn as they fail are still worth watching; the unique colors they give off as they descend into nonsense can be both rare and beautiful.",

            "content": "SPOILERS: This show is garbage. It started as a simple, but decent murder mystery show. But then it goes into WTF territory of pretentiousness, head scratchers and forehead smacking that would have Evangelion telling it to relax. \r\nThis show sucks.\r\nWhat\u2019s good?\r\nThe main character Kogorou Akechi is the cool headed boy detective that I actually grew fond of as the show progresses. Always one step ahead, brilliant and having a sympathetic motivation, Akechi is what keeps the audience drawn to the show. \r\nSouji Hashiba is possibly one of the most underutilized characters in the show, which is a shame. He doesn\u2019t do much in the show,but the scenes with him (sans that trap) are some of the best moments in the show. I liked that he is straight man of the main trio while Akechi and that other one are eccentric and out-of-the-box. Hashiba should have been Akechi\u2019s right hand man. Though rare, the best moments in the show are the interactions between Akechi and Hashiba, especially in the last few episodes where the two are working together.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of 20 faces is really interesting. I wished the show put more focus on that than waiting for it to have any significance in the latter half.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is nicely composed, with some scores reminding me of Kingdom Hearts, oddly. \\n\\n\r\nWhy this show is garbage?\\n\r\nOne, Kobayashi. This show is ruined simply by this person\u2019s existence. First of all, why is she a trap? There\u2019s no reason for her to be one. It\u2019s become a trend in anime in the last few years that needs to die. It doesn\u2019t help that she is possibly that worse case of traps in anime. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, the god awful pretentious behavior of this character and the outright neglect of consequences. It pertains to the last episode where he, (SPOILERS, but no one will want to watch this show), helps the villain only because he finds the villain to be more interesting than Akechi. She attempts to commit suicide along with the villain and the other 20 faces simply because he finds it interesting. Piss off!! Oh, and no gratitude towards Hashiba, the only one who genuinely cares for him, for saving his life. Poor Hashiba. His hormones must be a mess. Oh, that cringe worthy moment when Kobayashi saw Hashiba as a faceless mannequin.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is there a seductress that soils herself whenever she sees Akechi, let alone a teenager?\\n\\n\r\nWhy is there a gothic lolita teacher who clearly has some issue that I thought would play into the story, but never did?\\n\\n\r\nHow did Minami and her corpse doll interact with the real world? Weren\u2019t they a figment of everyone\u2019s imagination? What\u2019s with those Family Guy cut-aways? That form of comedy got old 10 years ago. \\n\\n\r\nWhy there was an episode dedicated to a cat right after the good episodes Kagami??!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nSuch a shame that this simple, yet enjoyable murder mystery show turned into a complete mess. Akechi, Hashiba and their interactions are great, but are not enough to cover all the badness this show has. Off pacing, nonsensical directing and the wasted potential of 20 Faces really made this show into a downer. \\n\\n\r\nAnd screw you Kobayashi with your pretentious behavior and cross dressing. Where are Subaru and Charles to give this dude the 3D through the table?  Kobayashi  would make a fine chair.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: I haven't read any of Sir Edogawa's work when I wrote the review for this anime.\r\nRanpo Kitan is an anime coming from the mystery genre which produced Un-Go, Hyouka and Case Closed. The show's setup was good enough. The characters are quirky enough. The premise of the mysteries was creepy enough to pick the interest of the audience. To be honest, I really thought it can be a successor of Un-Go but what went wrong with this show? Oh well, let's proceed with the review.\r\nRanpo Kitan's direction is more mysterious than the story itself because the way on how the outcome of stories weresolved was bereft of any thrill and life. It was also randomly handled at times that it managed to squeeze all the characters in a single episode for God knows why. It can also be inferred that one may not enjoy fully this series if he is not familiar with Sir Edogawa's works. That alone sends a distress signal in this anime given that it cannot stand in itself.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the audience was not given enough time and clues to solve the cases it had.  A typical Ranpo Kitan case goes as follows: Akechi and his gang do their daily hijinks, a case comes up and bam! it was solved immediately. It was as if you are listening to a narration which suddenly jumps to the resolution and bores you to death.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main story picks up at episode 8 (after some empty fillers), which is really late for an eleven episode anime and the payoff is not anything grand either. The sense of belief and tension in the finale were not there. It was as if I was just waiting to see what happens in the end.  It starts to become passable then but it was too late to redeem the audience who dropped this early on.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of focusing to create a solid plot, Ranpo Kitan focused in the quirks of the characters which was never good enough to compensate the lack of story. Twenty Faces, Shadow Man and the Medical Examiner are interesting enough since they are portrayed in a theatrical manner but without a good story to anchor them, they are just talking cardboards.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan's characters were also not given proper development and were only shown for the sake of the writing staff to move the plot. The only standouts given these characters are Kobayashi who seems to be a sociopath and Akechi who received fair amount of development from an overpowered protagonist to someone who is likable enough in the end.\\n\\n\r\nYet to say that Ranpo Kitan is a total waste of time is not fair. The visual techniques are really pretty that it compensates its inability to deliver a good story and I can certainly say that the background sound is one of the best I have heard this season. The opening song sets the mood for the show and the ending song is a pure earworm pop rock. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it seems like the noitamina slot is not fail proof when it comes in producing quality shows. Ranpo Kitan is one of their casualties this season which is a shame given that this is supposed to be the tribute to Sir Edogawa's 50th death anniversary.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nCrime has been around for as long as humans have roamed the Earth. While it would be awesome if everyone held hands and made peace and sang carols, an idyllic world of that kind simply does not exist. There are \u201cbad apples\u201d everywhere. People who, for whatever reason, resort to crime.\r\nRanpo Kitan: Game of Laplace centers on crime like pedophilia, torture, and murder. Grotesque crime, but crime all the same. It shows the lengths people on both sides of the law will go to and what that means for everyone in society.\r\nI have never committeda crime and I have (thankfully; knock on wood) never been the victim of a crime. Someone did steal a USB drive of mine once, but I was not so annoyed that I wanted to call for an investigation. Thinking about it now, I wish I still had that USB from way back when. And thinking about it more, if I had a copy of Ranpo Kitan on that USB, not only would I not care about it getting stolen, I would thank the thief for stealing it.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan is filled to the brim with problems, and nowhere is that more evident than in the tale it tries to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime touts itself as a \u201cMystery\u201d anime, and to be fair that is partially true. Each crime committed is usually quite strange: people contorted into furniture, little girls kidnapped and molded into concrete slabs, and so on. No matter the crime, the characters logically determine who the culprit is, what the culprit did, and why the culprit did it. Though the point is not this detective work because the crimes are usually solved within the episode, which realistically means within about ten minutes. Worse still is that the mysteries mean very little to the rest of the show. Individual mysteries do not affect the other mysteries, nor do they affect the characters themselves. Thus, the mysteries serve little else besides providing the setting. A misstep, especially considering the \u201cMystery\u201d tag.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of the anime is the idea that crime goes unpunished. That these murderers and pedophiles escape conviction either for making bail or for having a mental illness, allowing them to \u201ccheat the system.\u201d This is where Ranpo Kitan encounters another major problem. The show is so one-sided that it becomes difficult to take the narrative seriously. The police are aggravatingly inept. Akechi and Kobayashi often need Kuro Tokage, the masochistic criminal who is madly in love with Akechi, to tell them where to go, even though she is behind bars and is a criminal herself. Kagami, one of the detectives, is put behind bars forever despite doing the exact same thing as the other criminals.\\n\\n\r\nThis last detail is meant to show the stupidity of the system in place. But it is so silly because of how contradictory it is. The precedent had already been set: criminals walk free even after committing egregious crimes. So when one case out of the (presumably) hundreds of others goes against this norm, it comes off as a cheap way to show how \u201cunfair\u201d society is.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan also has a glaring problem with just the tale it is telling. It starts off with these singular, mystery cases that allude to a so-called \u201cTwenty Faces.\u201d What was supposed to happen was a build-up towards the eventual boiling-over of the Twenty Faces dilemma. Instead, what occurs is a lot of stagnation. The crimes are, at best, semi-related to Twenty Faces, so when the Twenty Faces conflict reaches its climax, it comes out of nowhere. Build-up is further squandered when the anime interrupts the conflict. Episode six is too comical and too unrelated to the overarching plot. And episode ten, while expounding on Namikoshi and hence the origins of Twenty Faces, disrupts the tension that was finally being created.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the so-called \u201cDark Star\u201d law which cheapens the narrative further. This law coming out of nowhere is a problem, but the biggest problem with this law is its scope. As an omniscient law, it is never wrong, meaning the narrative gets to do whatever it wants without consequence. When the law is wrong, it is either unfairly avoided (Namikoshi conveniently \u201cupdates\u201d the law after Akechi \u201csolves\u201d it) or the explanation is nonsensical (Namikoshi and Kobayashi have to commit suicide in order for the law to be \u201ccomplete\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending also has issues. Rather than gracefully concluding the season, Ranpo Kitan tries way too hard to wrap everything up. The attempt made is a bunch of words without fully showing the aftermath, acting as a sort of catch-all to cover its bases. But the ending does not stop there. As the characters discuss, Namikoshi is (possibly) still alive, which is ridiculous. Not just because he has now pretended to die for the second time, but also because the entire purpose of the ending \u2013 the reason why Namikoshi went through this overly complicated crime \u2013 was to, in the end, kill himself. So when the anime nonchalantly states that the main antagonist is still alive, then everything throughout the season was for naught.\\n\\n\r\nEven the tone of the anime is problematic. The crimes depicted are dark, yet the anime regularly dips into comedy. For instance, Minami, the doctor, is regularly used for comedic effect with her joking about the violent deaths. The idea is that the contrast is supposed to be funny, but because the anime is too serious when it comes to its subject matters, the contrast is less hilarious and more jarring.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan\u2019s narrative simply has too many problems to consider it well-executed; contextually, the narrative is as barebones as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best aspect of Ranpo Kitan is its artistic direction. Multicolored lighting and nice shadows are used, but its best move is embracing its weirdness, creating scenes that bend reality at will. Impossible proportions, impromptu objects, and involved symbolism are just a sampling of the ways in which the anime depicts its scenes. \u201cScenes\u201d in the literal sense. Curtains, spotlights, and fourth-wall breaking are used to make elaborate, stage-like creations to explain the crimes and events. The show even goes so far as to have the characters viewing the explanations as if they were watching a play. Since the crimes are a spectacle, presenting the anime in this fashion is not only interesting but also quite fitting.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Ranpo Kitan is not focusing on the imaginary, the anime can look pretty dull. Besides Akechi\u2019s abode and various parts of the city, the backgrounds and locations do not have the same pizzazz as the previous scenes. Although that is sort of the point. Similar to the story\u2019s tonal contrast, a contrast between the crazy scenes and the mundane ones is designed to make the crazy scenes that much crazier. Dissimilar to the story\u2019s tonal contrast, the artistic contrast actually works.\\n\\n\r\nAnother cool detail is how the anime presents uninteresting people. When Akechi\u2019s perspective takes the limelight, uninteresting people are drawn as wooden puppets, symbolizing how they are controlled by the world around them. The most interesting case, however, is when the anime draws them as outlines with faded colors. Light grays, pinks, and greens cover the people that are currently uninteresting, including the main characters. How the anime determines who is uninteresting is based on Kobayashi\u2019s feelings. He is disinterested in the world, so much so that the people he does not care about \u2013 the people he finds uninteresting \u2013 receive this faded treatment.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the character designs are a step down, mainly due to their plainness. Akechi wears dress clothes with a red tie, but he looks a bit too old for his apparent age. Hashiba is similarly plain; besides his glasses, he has no outstanding qualities. There might be a case for Kobayashi who is designed to be feminine in appearance, but he, too, has a design that lacks any \u201coomph.\u201d Shadow-Man might have a case as well given his signature paper bag he wears over his head. The paper bag symbolizes his ability to disguise himself as anyone he wishes, disguises that he regularly uses. Hanabishi, the teacher, has a strange design with cat ears, pink colors, and a short stature, although why her design is like this is never explained. Altogether, even giving Shadow-Man the benefit of the doubt, the designs lack the necessary appeal to call them impressive.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, there is a moderate amount. The elaborate scenes are most likely the culprit for this, since they are more for show than they are for movement, although they can have moving parts and shiny sparkles. Hair, eyes, and limbs hardly move, and besides Akechi fighting some bad guys, there is not a whole lot of action. But again, to be fair, the anime\u2019s focus on standalone shots of fancy setups makes this an expected outcome.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Ranpo Kitan are as abysmal as the story they find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi, the main protagonist, starts off well-enough but quickly tapers off. In the beginning of the season, he (indirectly) talks about his \u201cboredom.\u201d His \u201cempty\u201d feeling, as he puts it, causes him to be disinterested in the world around him. As if life had nothing to offer. That is a sad thing for a junior high school student to say since the world has so much in store.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not until he is framed for a murder that he finally finds the calling he had been searching for. He then starts working with Akechi, this work considerably lifting his spirits. At this point, Kobayashi\u2019s character stagnates. He is always present, but he does not stray far away from his characterizations of solving the crimes and acting carefree. So when the finale comes around, and he is ready to commit suicide, it is perplexing. Not only was he finally enjoying himself, he had Hashiba, he had Akechi, and he had his ability to help solve those heinous crimes. There was never any indication that he was contemplating suicide let alone regressing back to his earlier thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nNamikoshi is likewise a weak character. Namikoshi does not enter the series until midway through episode eight (out of eleven) and very briefly at the end of episode nine. All of episode ten is spent on characterizing and developing him. This episode shows everything: the bullies he had hounding him, the abusive parents he had at home, and his cherished friendship he had with Akechi. Doing this characterization and development so late is a major issue because the audience has no time to understand him as a character. He shows up, he gets developed, and then he disappears, all within the span of essentially a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Namikoshi is ultimately meant to be is a parallel to Kobayashi. Both Namikoshi and Kobayashi felt left alone by the world around them. Both Namikoshi and Kobayashi were intelligent in ways that few others knew. And most importantly, both Namikoshi and Kobayashi had a best friend that, no matter their troubles, would fight to stay by their side. This parallel is supposed to exist between them, however, it is poorly handled. Namikoshi appears at the end (their relationship has no foundation) and Kobayashi no longer feels the same way as Namikoshi (his actions and demeanor throughout the season prove this). So not only are Kobayashi and Namikoshi weak characters individually, but they are also weak on a relational level.\\n\\n\r\nOther relationships have problems as well. Akechi and Kuro Tokage \u2013 the masochistic, psycho woman in prison \u2013 presumably have some kind of past. But how they met or what kind of relationship they had is never explicitly shown. Akechi and Namikoshi\u2019s also lacks strength; their relationship, while constructed, is not around long enough to say that what they shared was worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender, however, is Hashiba and Kobayashi\u2019s relationship. Unlike Akechi and Namikoshi, whose relationship demonstrates that they care for one another, Hashiba and Kobayashi\u2019s relationship lacks that same sense of friendship. This is mostly due to Kobayashi\u2019s attitude. Hashiba pesters Kobayashi and saves him from certain death, so he clearly cares for Kobayashi. In contrast, Kobayashi regularly ignores Hashiba\u2019s pleas, making it clear that Kobayashi does not care about Hashiba as much as Hashiba cares about him. There are a few scenes in which Hashiba and Kobayashi interact in a meaningful manner, but they amount to nothing more than small apologies or asides. The result is the awkward relationship they share.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Hashiba\u2019s individual character, he blushes a lot whenever Kobayashi is nearby \u2013 while maybe not romance, it is assumed that he is attracted to Kobayashi. Besides this fact and that he comes from a rich, gambling family, nothing else is known about the best friend.\\n\\n\r\nHence, the best character is Shadow-Man, though even he is not without problems. His hobby is protecting little girls from would-be criminals, though people misread him as a pedophile. He is undoubtedly the most unique character the cast has to offer, yet as is common with Ranpo Kitan, the anime fails to use him. This is not even about developing or changing his character, he simply has next to no presence within the show. After his initial introduction, he appears in episode six (the comedic one) and then not until the finale. So while his character is strange, that is all he is, because that is all that the anime used him for.\\n\\n\r\nThus, like the story, the characters are as barebones as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is not slow; there is a quickness to it that pulls the listener along. And contrary to the anime, the song is not spooky. The first section has a single beat that seems like it will build towards that, but it is followed by a softer section that feels like longing. The middle section is comprised of a smattering of noise, leaning heavily on repetition. But the more its heard the more spiritual it becomes, fitting the sort of spiritual mood that the anonymous Twenty Faces and death in general entails. Also, the lyrics are interesting: \u201cSing notes of bronchitis,\u201d \u201cAnd my blood is my escape route,\u201d and \u201cAll as speed and friction burn my insides\u201d are graphic and haunting, once again fitting the anime\u2019s mood. The song is not that impressive, but it at least hits the right atmosphere for Ranpo Kitan.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme starts off somber, an acoustic guitar and strained singing filling the piece. When the song picks up someplace in the middle, the piece becomes, like the OP, a cacophony. It is a bit overbearing, but it does have a purpose. As the visuals help to illuminate, this cacophony represents the craziness and figurative fall of society that the show regularly depicts. The piece goes back to its somber roots as it concludes, ending the piece on a sad note. This flow of emotion \u2013 from low to all-over-the-place to low once more \u2013 reflects the story\u2019s own progression, making the ED, if nothing else, symbolic.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack is subpar, to say the least. The anime expectedly uses spooky compositions, such as a slow, ambient track that was essentially lifted from a haunted mansion. These set the mood, but are not fun to listen to outside of the show. Ranpo Kitan also uses a lot of piano tracks for the dramatic moments, but these tracks lack emotion. One dramatic piece in particular is Namikoshi\u2019s favorite song, the song that Akechi plays from time to time on his jukebox to calm himself down. This song goes too far the other way; the song is too emotional and feels out-of-place. Then there are the comedic, jazzy tracks that only further the jarring tonal problems. Altogether, the OST is a largely forgettable offering.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting has no noteworthy performances. Rie Takahashi as Kobayashi gives the feminine male a girly voice but that is because Ms. Takahashi is a woman. Takahiro Sakurai as Akechi uses a voice that is a bit too old for his age. And Yoko Hikasa as Kuro Tokage, while energetic, does not come off as the conniving \u201cBlack Lizard\u201d she claims to be because she always sounds so hyper.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI cannot say that I liked this one.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the comedy and the drama did nothing for me. I was not laughing when Kuro Tokage peed herself from pleasure (which happened a lot), and I was not emotional when Kagami was recounting the tale of his sister. My disliking of the comedy and the drama stems from my dislike of the characters. Kobayashi was too annoying, Akechi was too full of himself, and Namikoshi was too nonsensical for me to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nShadow-Man was interesting, if only because he wore a paper bag over his head. His episode, where he tries to save Sachiko for the second time, is also the best of the season because there was an actual relationship and person worth caring about. Sadly, the anime forgets about Shadow-Man for much of the rest of the show, so I cannot say I will remember him too much. Fitting, considering his name and disguises.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries were lame, too. Akechi and Kobayashi always instantly got the answer, so it never felt like I got to solve the mysteries or at least try to figure them out in some capacity. If they had some kind of trouble with the mysteries, it would have felt more genuine for the show and the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThen there were all of the ludicrous instances. The mother of the little-girl kidnapper literally not turning her demented son into the police. Everyone in the city joining Twenty Faces\u2019 cause so suddenly. An island that basically amounts to a slavery ring that nobody ever investigated. And (albeit petty) Akechi slurping his black coffee all of the time.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite aspect of the entire anime was something that was insignificant: the cat. The cat was a happy cat, which made me a happy person. She was a fun cat, but she had nothing to do with anything. She was there be a cute cat and nothing more. If she was the only part I found entertaining, that speaks volumes for how I felt about the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan: Game of Laplace is awful. The story is broken, the characters are weak beyond belief, and the show is generally a bore to sit through. The art and parts of the music save this one from total atrocity, but only barely. It is practically a crime that this anime even got made in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, the mysteries are pointless, the main theme on crime going unpunished is silly, proper tension is never built, the \u201cDark Star\u201d law is cheap, and the ending is handled horribly\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, the elaborate scenes are interesting, the lighting, contrast, and other details add purpose, about average actual animation, but subpar character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, Kobayashi, Akechi, and Namikoshi are weak individually and in conjunction with each other and the rest of the cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, okay OP, okay ED, bad OST, below average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, only the cat was fun to watch\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "As of the time I'm writing this the last episode of Ranpo Kitan has finished airing. This series is genuinely decent. Just decent. If you're just looking to find a 'masterpiece' this show is not for you. \r\nAlso I'll just go ahead and tell you that as you go into this series, expect all sort of disturbing, disgusting things. The series is very gory and it's themes and undertones aren't exactly child friendly. So just a heads up, the show is messed up from day 1.\r\nIt's biggest flaws include it's story and character development. There are continuous plot holes that by rules I cannot discussnow, but they take away from the overall quality of the show especially from the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is also somewhat confusing for some viewers as some episodes leave you with questions and leave you wondering what's even going on. The way the plot progresses in the first half is rather mediocre and I'd even go as far to say odd. It didn't feel like much effort was put into this part and even by the end of the series the first 5 or so episodes feel irrelevant to the overall scope of things. By episode 6, the show overall picks up in quality and some very interesting events happen. From episode 6 forward the main focus of the anime shifts into a new, darker arc that finally introduces decent character development (but said development is only revealed in the final episodes) and events that were very....different from most other anime. Side characters also become important to the overall plot and events of the story and help the plot pick up. I don't feel like this series was rushed at all unlike some other series here. It had a somewhat 'open' finale but at the same time was somehow 'conclusive'. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm at that, some of the antagonist's motivations are confusing and if you think logically while watching a series you'll probably pick up on. Just a heads up. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : The visuals are amazing for this show, I have to say. The scenery looks beautiful and conveys exactly what the writer was thinking. The character design is also very appealing but \"generic\" for most of the male lead. Definitely is different in terms of the way the art presents itself. During dialogue and flashbacks even the artwork is constantly changing. Almost sort of like the entire series is a play for the viewers even.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in a \"gory, action, thriller\" anime that'll make you say WTF, Ranpo Kitan is what you're looking for.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace Review\r\nStory (5/10) Mediocre\r\nI'm not going to be doing a synopsis in this section I will be talking about how I felt about the overall story in general. The first episode made it seem like the all of the episodes would be able who framed the MC but that mystery gets solved within the first two episodes. After that it turns into an episodic anime filled with some controversial, sometimes interesting and sometime not interesting episodes. The the last like 4 episodes try to all connect together an introduce an antagonist for the sake of having some sort of series finalefeeling which was an ok little arc but not enough to suffice and withhold anything better than a 'fine' for the overall story for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the anime is really colorful and the cover picture for the anime is what caught my eye at the beginning of the summer anime season enough for me to give it a short. The art style did indeed drop rarely but most of the time it kept a colorful look to the entire anime and also a gritty look when the horrific and blood scenes occur also.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job, the bgm was on point and the opening song is probably one of the best this anime season and the ending caught on to me by the time i finished the anime also nothing really to complain in this section.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10) \\n\r\nMore Specifically (4.5/10)  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters I felt to rather weird. Like I said in art section the character designs and art style of everything in the cover picture is what caught my eye in the first place. And when looking at it from someone who doesn't know you would assume that Kobayashi is the girl that the main character Hashiba is trying to get and Akechi is some sort of anti-hero or rival of the main character Hashiba. But we (or at least I was entirely wrong). Kobayashi is actually a trap which for some reason the anime decides to awkwardly fanservice the crap out of the little boy to the viewers and he's technically the MC I have no clue what kind of sick message they want to get across nor do i care at the end of the day. Hashiba is technically his best friend but it seemed that Hashiba was kind of irrelevant majority of the anime always showing suspect blush moments towards his so called best friend and Akechi basically the senpai they look up to. All the other character in the show were unique but not worth mention in this review honestly the only character I ended up somewhat liking in the anime is Akechi and he's quite possible the most generic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10) Bad\\n\r\nMore Specifically (4.5/10) \\n\\n\r\nThere was only about 2-3 episodes I fairly enjoyed in this entire anime all the reason I either didn't care for, weren't interesting or remember-able or they was just straight up bad. I ended up putting the anime on a semi-hold until all the episodes were out because it just wasn't worth rushing to watch every week with episodes like what I explained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10) Fair\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.20/10) \\n\\n\r\nSo like I said earlier I had to put this anime on semi-hold because it just wasn't worth watching weekly I was able to binge watch it when all of the episodes were out at least but my overall thought on the anime didn't really change on it. It's a fine anime at best the best things about it were the art style and sound which these days isn't saying much because you can kind of get that anywhere.",

            "content": "So the summer anime season is coming to a close and as we prepare for the Fall to simultaneously disappoint us and blow our minds, let\u2019s start looking back at how awful these last three months have been. And what better way to start than to beat up a shitty noitamina anime? I\u2019m actually kind of surprised Ranpo Kitan was amongst the first of this season\u2019s crop to have an ending. Okay, it started on the first week of releases rather than wait until everything is out like noitamina anime usually do, but I assumed it was just 12 episodes like the other two offeringsfor the timeslot this year and that it anticipated that weekly delay that practically every show went through this season. But no, it\u2019s the standard 11 episodes, which is a blessing in disguise because A) it ends quicker B) I get something to review and nothing says catharsis more than beating up a show no one in their right mind would defend.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I\u2019m sorry to say that unless A-1 somehow churns out a worse mystery anime next season - and I know it\u2019s A-1, but this series is just sad - Ranpo is easily the least interesting of noitamina\u2019s offerings in 2015. Punch Line had a decent story that was let down by execution issues and some people seem to like Saekano in all its poorly animated, stakes-less ugliness for some reason, but at least they promoted discussion. You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find anyone other than masochistic mystery buffs who made it past the first two episodes of Ranpo Kitan, mainly because it was directed by a hack who makes Akiyuki Shinbo look like David Fincher.\\n\\n\r\nWhere exactly are these fans who still support Seiji Kishi enough to have him continue with this thing we humans call a career? Yes I know he\u2019s always adapting really popular stuff due to whatever connections he\u2019s got, but after a while, you\u2019d think people would catch on and realize that Devil Survivor 2 will be more the rule rather than the exception. And more to the point, who was it that approved of him to adapt the works of Edogawa Ranpo in the first place? Who even owns the rights to the property these days? Because after watching this tripe, I think we\u2019re going to need a change of hands to someone who can actually say no as well as some psychological counseling towards the original guy after he experiences the thing for himself.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I usually describe the plot of this show, but I honestly don\u2019t know what to say because it\u2019s just too fragmented and lifeless to put in coherent words whilst being way too dependent on the characters. I mean you\u2019ve got this downbeat detective out for justice. You\u2019ve got this kid who looks and talks like a girl, but is really a boy, and speaks like a robot. You\u2019ve got his male glasses-wearing friend who may or may not be gay for him. Then there\u2019s this bag-man and woman dressed in bondage gear - and I never actually read a Ranpo story, but I\u2019m pretty sure the wacky nurse who looks like the bastard lovechild of Paranoia Agent and Danganronpa wasn\u2019t in the original source, let alone took a substantial role in the show\u2019s climax.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters are given the Kishi hyper-stylization treatment and have about as much believable human emotions as Itchy and Scratchy when they\u2019re phoning it in. And you remember how in Durarara where the unimportant people are drawn in gray and only when they actually have significance to what\u2019s going on is when someone bothers to color them in? Ranpo Kitan has something like that too, except the characters fade into silhouette-like backgrounds at really arbitrary moments and it looks incredibly unfinished rather than stylistic.  It leads to this weird disconnect of coldness most normal people who try to watch Ghost in the Shell experience in that even if you saw something worth watching in here, it\u2019s presentation makes actually accessing it all but impossible. Only in Ranpo Kitan\u2019s case, not only are the smart things just the same old bullshit regarding \u201cwhat is justice\u201d and every other moral you could get in any cop show either, but there\u2019s no excitement to be had even if you penetrate the presentation and dig that sort of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nNow the show\u2019s utter lifelessness makes remembering events difficult, but I do remember that most of the individual cases are more stuff the anime does to fill out time rather than pieces to a much bigger picture. The closest thing we get to an overarching plot thread is through some lunatic named Twenty Faces, who basically kills criminals for justice, and catching him would be a lot easier if there weren\u2019t multiple people doing things in his name. But this conflict only takes up half the screen time and the rest of it is just piddling about. Please explain to me the significance of that one episode where The Amazing Bag-Man stops by the detective\u2019s house and we spend the entire run time basically coming up with theories like a bad stand-up comedy before ending on a conclusion that - as the domesticated father said regarding the broken toilet bowl that had just been used by his kid after digesting food from Taco Bell- was full of shit. There\u2019s taking a break from an on-going plot and then there\u2019s just throwing shit out of that bowl just because you can.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m probably going to have to address the elephant in the room regarding the actual mysteries in this show and whether or not they\u2019re good at some point. Short answer: no. Long answer: Fuck no! The logic is incredibly hard to follow - not helped by the giant heapings of dialogue that desperately needed an editor during investigations - and the actual criminal is always some arbitrary person that the show just pulled out of thin air with either no foreshadowing or so little of it that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference either way. Backstories for the criminals are so token and predictable that you\u2019d only need thirty seconds to explain it. Detective Conan-style. And yet for some reason, the show decides to devote entire half-hours trying to make me sympathize with these morons.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the Twenty Faces arc concludes is pretty much a combination of all the problems I listed above with another one added, and that problem is the feminine main character. Up until that point, he\u2019s always been an audience cipher that no audience member can relate to, but he was in the background so I let it slide. But the final few episodes put him at center stage for the crucial part of Twenty Faces\u2019 grand plan and his emotionless accepting reactions become impossible to ignore to the point that he might as well have been wearing a yellow T-shirt that said \u201cI am an obvious plot device\u201d in big black letters. It wasn\u2019t until the final few minutes that ended on him that I realized he was basically a walking metaphor for the show: a small lifeless pile of gimmicks who hangs around with the big boys just because he can. And if he died, no one but sad geeky losers would give a shit.\\n\\n\r\nSo on the whole, I can\u2019t really say I recommend Ranpo, even if you\u2019re a die-hard noitamina fan. It\u2019s badly written and it\u2019s hard to even pay attention to the writing at times because there\u2019s a high chance the visuals will put you to sleep beforehand. Some people may say Kishi\u2019s style is still fresh and interesting even if it\u2019s not being good, but I say that gimmicks are gimmicks.  It was gimmicky back when Shaft first used it over a decade ago, and it\u2019s godawful now.",

            "content": "This is an odd noitaminA series celebrating the temporary entry of Edogawa Rampo's work into the public domain. (@$%# TPP rubbish)  The series isn't a whodunnit, but resides firmly on the crime story or borderline horror end of the mystery genre. Rampo, like his namesake, frequently wrote about horrific things so this isn't an inappropriate focus. His work has been turned into a horror anthology film (Rampo Noir), and the only readily available English translation of his work for a while was the inclusion of \"The Human Chair\" in the My Favorite Horror Story anthology. The series probably shouldn't have been billed as amystery for western audiences, but that has little to do with the work's quality itself. \\n\\n\r\nStory: I've seen a lot of complaints about tone shifts, but have watched enough live action Japanese movies not to be put off by it. Fits in well with stuff like Tokyo Gore Police, Stacy and Tokyo Zombie. So it might appeal to fans of those. Like me. \\n\\n\r\nSpends a few episodes working up to the main plot, which is well used to develop the characters. The structure is odd, but that's to be expected when you're adapting favored short works and novels from a large canon as a single season anime. Imagine what a Sherlock Holmes anime doing the same would be like and you might get an idea of the overalll story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style can take some getting used to. Highly stylized overall. Frequent use of marionette imagery, words, etc in the artwork for thematic purposes. Pretty high quality throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  OP and ED are two of the better ones for the season. Sound is used effectively thoughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Kobayashi has never found anything fun or interesting, until he becomes a murder suspect in episode 1. Which he outright admits is the most fun he's ever had.  He's a bit ghoulish, but well intentioned. I think he's one of the more interesting protagonists I've seen lately. \\n\\n\r\nAkechi was originally a Sherlock Holmes expy, and that's still in force here. He usually knows the answer within minutes, and lets things play out for his own inscrutable reasons. If you dislike that type of character, he won't be changing your mind. \\n\\n\r\n Hashiba, Kobayashi's best friend and possible love interest,  spends most of the series as the only sane man.  He also tries to save Kobayashi from Kobayashi a lot of the time. The three have a pretty neat dynamic together, and I enjoyed the focus on them.\\n\\n\r\nRecurring and secondary characters are a strength of the show. It's a pretty odd collection as you might imagine. Hard to go into without spoilers, but there are a lot of fully realized characters who could carry a story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:  Ranpo Kitan deals with some pretty heady themes: the morality of vigilantism vs law, Japanese laws on mentally ill criminals, and even determinism vs free will. It manages to do it without coming across as pretentious which is hard. Overall it was a pretty fun mix of action and characterization.   The series is sort of the mutant freak baby of Yoshihiro Nishimura and Edogawa Rampo.  Which is cool in its own way. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the odd collection of characters and will miss seeing more of them.",

            "content": "Another anime ruined be its ending. I am very picky, even small things can ruin my mood. This ending definitely ruined the enjoyment for me. Was expecting an ending more like the one in fight club and not a wimpy nonsensical melodramatic wannabe happy one.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in a way is the embodiment of a shapeshifter transposed into the plot of a series. Interesting in itself, but as a result it's creepy and unenjoyable.\r\nSo it first starts of as a nice mystery anime, with murder solving elements, although a bit awkwardly exaggerated it was still great and from the first episode on i only expected itto be a mix of horror and detective crime solving anime. Would have been truly awesome.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the 2nd or 3rd episode, not sure which, starts a bit comical with a guy wearing a bag over his head. I thought it sure adds a bit more excitement to the anime, even if it's not what i had expected it's deviating from a monotonous linear genre driven story. Unfortunately that line deviating from horror/crime solving towards comedy runs all over the place. It makes you wonder if the author threw a dice to see what genre it should intersect next.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there on it swings even more chaotically. Unfortunately the ending crash lands the plot into a dumpster with the most putrid, rancid and nausea inducing pile of decaying matter you could imagine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSure the mc being a cross dresser was funny, especially since he was so excited about it. His friend showing strange feeling towards him was odd but intended to be comical.\\n\\n\r\nAekichi seemed to be rather odd. At first he is supposedly the genius detective, always invoking cold thinking and a cold heart too. He can solve about any crime effortlessly and emotionally detached, not really caring about who dies or lives, but just about solving crimes for fun. By the end of the show however he pulls a 180 and becomes an hyper emotional slut that wants to save the world and his best childhood buddy.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the characters and their actions don't make sense. Those that do make sense are a bit shallow.\\n\\n\r\nWish they would explain Aekichi's girlfriend who sits behind bars. Why is she tied up with strings and why are her ogres escaping later on, or how are the even escaping. Nasty plot hole, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI liked the art a lot. If it weren't for the blanked out characters it would have been perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\neh? not sure what to say about it, the OP/ED theme was crap\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did find the anime interesting enough to watch it in one go, but seeing it intentionally sabotaged and destroyed like a plane flown into a skyscraper, it only left me irritated at the end. Yes, it was exactly that depressing. The only thing missing to completely ruin the enjoyment is to have the creator jump from a building and live streaming the event ...\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a clear picture of this anime, then imagine drawing a line from point A to point B. Before getting to point B you will move your pen in all directions as chaotically as possible and then only reach point B. That is exactly how this anime is in it's entirety.",

            "content": "A lot of people are hating on this show, but I thought it was good- not super amazing, but not as bad as the other reviews make it sound.\r\nStory 7/10- Although this show is \"mystery\", I do understand how people would get annoyed at how the cases just get solved, and they don't explain how. At first, the story has a bunch of different cases, but near the end, it kind of takes a break from that and focuses on a main conflict. I didn't really mind, since I've watched Detective Conan and don't need another episodic mystery anime (especially since Ranpo Kitan wouldn't beable to match up, sorry). I thought the anime got better near the end, but also kind of more confusing. Oh well, I've seen worse for sure, and the story was fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10- Art was pretty nice to look at, you could tell there wasn't a lot of motion involved, but it was disguised well. There was some cool lighting and shadow going on in certain scenes. Character designs were appealing, and I don't have any complaints here. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10- Average. None of the songs were very memorable, but I did like the ED a lot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10- I'm just gonna talk about the three main characters, and leave out some others to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n Kobayashi is supposed to be a \"quirky\" character because he literally isn't shocked or afraid of anything and his default emotion is to be happy at all times. It kind of works, because instead of typical \"wow that's so horrible\" reactions, he gets over things quickly. It also adds an element of creepiness because it's unnatural for a kid to act the way he does. He's also kind of a trap since he looks like a girl.\\n\\n\r\nAkechi is an ok character. He doesn't really do that much and spends his time acting cool. The writers gave him a weird quirk- he constantly has a headache and is seen crushing aspirin and drinking coffee the majority of his screen time. \\n\\n\r\nHashiba (Kobayashi's friend) is the straight man of this show. He reacts when Kobayashi doesn't, and has a lot of clich\u00e9 shouty lines. He also likes (loves?) Kobayashi a lot. I guess he's ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fine, but most of the reason why I gave this section a 7 is because Kobayashi is a pretty unique character and that makes this show not a copy paste of common stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show wasn't a waste of time, and in my opinion isn't as bad as everyone says. So, this is kind of a different opinion arguing more of the good stuff this show does.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "As I normally do, I will have spoilers as you can't really explain how good/bad the story flows without actually explaining/telling parts of the story. So don't read if you don't want to get spoiled.\r\nStory: 1\r\nFor an 11 ep series, it sure took its time to get to the main story: the Twenty Faces identity. The first few eps are largely character introductions, showing how inadequate the police force is, how great Akechi is and how unjust the justice system is. It dragged on needlessly as it could have easily been condensed within two episodes; maybe even one. And even when Twenty Faces was introducedit dragged on quite a bit with continuous side missions/mysteries. \\n\\n\r\nThe highlight was when the origin of Twenty Faces was revealed and that was when it became interesting. Unfortunately the writers probably have little to no experience regarding the philosophical/mathematical concepts they throw out, like 'Laplace Demon', 'Chaos Theory' as they mentioned how they were both similar; except a quick wiki search will show you that Chaos Theory is a counter to Laplace's demon.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing... the ability for Twenty Face to affect people is largely excused with \"people are angry\" combined with the pseudo-intellectual application of \"Butterfly Effect\". \\n\r\nNow, you might be thinking that I'm harsh and that I should have a suspension of disbelief. Sure, let's try that for a moment and believe that everything works.\\n\r\nSo as the climax, the antagonist then kills himself/disappears to complete his formula to make Twenty Face realised/complete. And the aftermath is that Twenty Faces appear more, then... they're forgotten... ??? All this is explained within the last few mins of the episode. It's as though the concept of Twenty Faces went back to square one and that the formula suddenly stopped working.\\n\\n\r\nSo the entire series was basically four episodes long that contradicts itself and ends up having essentially no effect as the concept of Twenty Faces pre-dates the story's timeline. \\n\\n\r\nPS: There was even, what I consider, a filler episode (ep 6), in that nothing happens that advances the actual story. It is literally a side mission/mystery that's presented and solved in one episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI liked the ending song and the piano insert song (look up Ranpo Laplace Dream on youtube and have a listen). Voice acting was pretty standard, I didn't feel like I felt attached to any particular character's voice selection. Overall, very average/standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art isn't particularly bad, though the colours are a bit all over the place which reminds me of the *monogatari series. Though I feel that they share some kind of artistic overlap, in this series' case, it's not done as well as the *monogatari series and really just feels random.\\n\r\nCharacter designs are your more typical modern anime types in that their eyes don't take up half their face and hairstyles are more refined.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nAkechi - Of all the three main characters, it feels like Akechi is the only one whose impact is actually felt outside of plot devices from the other two. He solves everything, fights everything and is basically the get-out-of-jail card that's used every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi - He is basically the plot device to bring the camera to the villain (of the episode) so we can get some expository dialogue about the situation, then have Akechi come in and solve it. \\n\\n\r\nHashiba - His character feels completely out of place with the overall mood and story. His yaoi tendency serves no purpose towards the story nor does it even have any humourous impact.  He's basically the incarnation of the concept of 'devil's advocate', except in a really annoying manner and without effect.\\n\\n\r\nSupports - When we find out that some of the recurring characters turned out to be part of Twenty Faces, their impact towards the story just feels like the writer was trying to pull a 'bet you didn't expect that' card. But since their purpose basically fades away instantly, you end up not really caring too much about it in the end. \\n\r\n- Black Lizard had literally no purpose other than perhaps providing some fan service which also applies Hanabishi who is a 'moe', loli looking school teacher introduced for the sake of more fanservice (probably).\\n\\n\r\nNakimoshi - The only one who's remotely interesting but is quickly off'd as the series had to come to a conclusion. Basically a bullied guy who has a 'notice me senpai' complex who looks for affection from Akechi and took his disapproval as rejection which led him to Twenty Faces\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI really dislike episodic series if they're trying to have an overall story. Stuff that's a slice of life like Non non Biyori works fine because of its nature, but when something has an overall story but takes almost 6/11 to get to it, then there's a problem with the writing. A large portion of character interaction is bland and has no development and the mysteries aren't even that enjoyable as they're resolved too fast with little complexity. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\r\nI would not recommend this series",

            "content": "The Academy Awards, also known as The Oscars, is an annual American award that honors the best in cinema and their achievements in the film industry. Since its introduction in 1929, winning this award has become the gold standard to which movie titles are measured against, as well as the end goal that many bigwigs within the film industry aim for. It encourages innovation and progress, which is always a good thing in any form of storytelling medium. \r\nAnd while the Oscars celebrates the \"best of the best,\" there's an equally recognizable award that does just the opposite, The Golden Raspberry Awards. Better known byits shortened name The Razzies, since 1980, it has served as the antithesis of the Oscars by honoring the \"worst of the worst\" to come out of the film industry. Needless to say, this isn't the award anyone wishes to be bestowed with. And if anime titles were to ever be given an equivalency to the Razzie award, I can safely say that Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace would be nominated with flying colors. \\n\\n\r\nOverworked, ostentatious, and utterly deplorable, Ranpo Kitan was a tethered together mess with inconceivable plot twists and dizzying tonal shifts that relentlessly forced a narrative along with no proper rhyme or reason. It's a title that fails so much that it transcends to an ethereal plane of stupidity, becoming something like a \"how-to\" guide to making a bad anime. An achievement so successful in fact, that as an end result, it manages to turn shitty writing into an art form. \\n\\n\r\nRanpo was classified under the mystery genre but was better suited to be seen as a comedy. Trying its best to tell an interweaving story of a conspiracy, we're introduced to our trap protagonist Yoshio Kobayashi, or who I like to refer to as Fujoshi-kun, as his mundane life is flipped upside down when he finds himself involved with a detective after a gruesome murder. The rest of the story chronicles Fujoshi-kun's misadventures with this detective and the rest of the wack jobs they encounter along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery genre tag for Ranpo Kitan is extremely misleading since most of the cases have no real \"mystery\" behind it. For the most part, the show is simply dedicated to showing fucked up psychopaths and the extreme methods they're willing to take in order to murder people. There's no guessing, there's no clues, there's no investigation, just a bunch of crazy dimensionless lunatics killing people in very over the top ways. It's like Spike's TV series \"1000 Ways to Die\" with an extra serving of vanilla homoerotica. And at the off chance, the show does try to tell a mystery story, it became irrelevant since Fujoshi-kun and the detective Kogorou Akechi are basically the Houdinis of solving crime. With little to no foretelling clues, they're able to piece together a case as if it was simply routine. There's no proper answer given and when they made any attempt to explain it, the reasoning was convoluted logic that only made sense when the writers retcon past events.\\n\\n\r\nAnother poor element the show attempts to use is a highly volatile sub-form of math known as chaos theory. Like time travel, chaos theory is in its fledgling stages of understanding and falls more into the realm of make-believe than factual content. Most of what is known of it come from a lot of guess and check work that ultimately pans out to a dead end. To put it in layman's terms, it's impossible to prove accurate. And since math is all about accurate assessments, trying to incorporate such an unstable arithmetic equation in a real world setting only comes off as stupid. And that's precisely what Ranpo attempts to do; it takes an asspull theory and uses it to haphazardly explain away events as \"it's all according to plan\" logic. If you use an inkling of common sense while watching this it'll frustrate you to no end. It's the equivalent of a \"mystery\" show making up bullshit as the story goes along and pretending it was predestined. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the aspect of this show that became the most grating wasn't the ludicrous story but rather the ill-conceived cast of characters that populated it. This is a show that's asking you to take things seriously while presenting a loli teacher who looks like she's 10 but is actually 32, a fujoshi bait lead who is far removed from reality and think everything is \"fun,\" a man who wears a paper bag over his head and watches little girls, a masochist that wets herself, a detective who's a living breathing Gary Stu, a 4th wall breaking medical examiner who happens to be a loli, and the list just goes on and on. \\n\\n\r\nThese caricatures that make up Ranpo Kitan are tonally conflicting with the dreary atmosphere the story is trying to present and as the story continues along, they somehow manage to get worse. It's a motley crew of one terrible personality after a next, each one adding a headache inducing layer to the show. This conflicting tone between the characters and story results in some of the worst tonal whiplashes imaginable. Dark scenes can be immediately followed up by yaoi fanservice or poorly placed comedy. Nothing is treated seriously despite the show's desperate attempt to be serious and as a result, nothing feels significant in the least. Just poorly handled \"dark\" moments being forced to share screen time with subpar humor.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing Ranpo deserves recognition for was its audiovisual presentation. It used very interesting techniques to convey certain scenes and even had a few motifs, that while too deserving for such a badly written show, still helped to enhance it from being a complete failure. Some notable examples were the 'butterfly effect' visuals that tied back to chaos theory (obviously being represented by the butterflies) and silhouettes being used to show a character's relevancy to Fujoshi-kun within the story, by either masking the person in it or having them step out of it. It was a well thought out idea that deserved credit for its inclusion. No, it wasn't on the same pedigree as something Masaaki Yuasa or Kunihiko Ikuhara would use but it was certainly a step above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme were also nice ear-worms and even had accompanying visuals that were well paced. \"Speed to Masatsu\" by amazarashi, which served as the opening theme, was a catchy progressive rock fusion song that really got the blood pumping. Certainly a standout track from the summer season. The same could also be said about the ending tune \"Mikazuki\" by Sayuri, a bittersweet ballad that hit the right high notes while building into a nice pop rock anthem finish. They were both sonically soothing and were great as stand-alone listens.\\n\\n\r\n2015 saw with it a sleuth of detective/mystery anime titles, Ranpo Kitan was yet another statistic. However, out of the bunch, Ranpo was quite possibly the worst to make its debut that year. And for that, it earned its Razzie and spot in the annals of shitty anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I enjoyed was the opening and ending themes... the show itself can jump off a cliff into oblivion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to mince words here, this anime is really bad. It sets out to create a mystery and the end result was a faux pas into B-grade territory. Unintelligible and pointless, there is nothing here worth digesting outside of a superficial level. With that being said, I highly suggest you save yourself the trouble and ignore this honking pile of turd.",

            "content": "Here\u2019s the thing about detective fiction. When you go into a series with mystery as part of its genre, the least you should expect are cases, then suspense, culprit(s), clues, and the resolution. Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace takes the typical ideas of a mystery and attempts to transform the show into a blockbuster thriller. The key word here I refer to use is \u201cattempt\u201d. Otherwise, this series is what came out as a disorganized mess with a colorful script that started out with life but ended up as wreckage.\r\nFirst, we should understand a bit of the background info about the original series. The 11-episodeadaptation is based on an author known as Edogawa Rampo. As a celebrated author in Japan, the main focus of the series concentrates on some of his published works from over 50 years ago. Back then, he was known for breathing life into the mystery genre in Japan with inspiration based on famous detective known to many as Sherlock Holmes. But don\u2019t think this show as near as smart as it should be. Sherlock Holmes didn\u2019t invent criminal justice. He perfected it.\\n\\n\r\nNow enough about Sherlock Holmes. This show does concentrate on mystery and suspense alongside peculiar cases at works. The first few episodes establishes a rather bizarre case involved a schoolteacher being murdered in a crude fashion. The main male protagonist Yoshino Kobayashi becomes a suspect because of his close proximity of the murder and because he is a key witness. He also becomes an assistant of Akechi as they work on the case. This is where the mystery aspect of the show comes in. The first two episodes establishes Kobayashi as a capable investigator. Although not on the same level as Akechi, he is able to deduce with clever thinking that a culprit framed him for murder. Through careful analysis, he is able to clear his name. And by doing so, the audience gets a clear view of his potential as the assistant. On the other hand, Akechi is on another level of skill. He claims to work on strange cases out of \u201cfun\u201d but the government has actually issued a license for him to investigate in abnormal activities. \\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the thing about the show though. It\u2019s both a simple and complicated series. On the simple side, Game of Laplace appeals to the cases as some of them have fairly obvious red herring and resolutions. And if you can call a few of those resolutions, it sometimes comes out as fairly rushed and lacks concrete interest despite a thrilling buildup. A few of the cases does have recurring themes and symbolism that is memorable on terms of content. The complicated part is more of the characters. By complicated, there\u2019s a few ways to look at it. First, it\u2019s more of whether we should know them better. At first glance, there\u2019s a good amount of interest that should be invested into the main characters in particular Akechi. His intellectual mind is legitimate and someone that we don\u2019t see too often. His intention to take down a primary source of antagonists known as the Twenty Faces in the show is a keen interest that is explored often. On the other hand, there\u2019s Kobayashi, an androgynous boy who is hard to take seriously. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t focus much at all on characterization for either of the two main leads.  It does however, compare the two on a background basis because of their ideals and perception of the world around them. There\u2019s more necessary focus on the cases and because of content, we also get a bit of that on the supporting characters. To say the least, most of the other characters are far less interesting. Examples include Kobayashi\u2019s best friend Hashiba with mostly a minor role throughout the show and an implied crush on him. Or there\u2019s Hanabishi who dresses like she is going to a cosplay party, the Black Lizard with an obsession on Akechi, or the Shadow-Man whom is dubbed as the \u2018master of disguise\u2019. Is it just me or do all these characters have something in common? All of them are downright strange. And because the show is so insistent on focusing mystery, it neglects most of them with a lack of characterization. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I guess the show could appeal to certain type of audiences. Anyone interested in suspense that\u2019s laced with imagery, symbolism, and metaphors can find this show to be quite appealing. I\u2019ll also have to admit that despite some of the comedic values added in the show, it retains its seriousness throughout almost each episode. Body horror is also a prominent aspect from the very first episode that runs all the way through the show. It\u2019s not just symbolic but also literally frightening if taken on a realistic approach. Some of the plot twists of the cases are also gruesome with disastrous consequences that results from human sins. Additionally, the show offers some insight on various studies such as chaos theory and algorithms. To say the least, Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace is well crafted when it gets serious and not off track. But often or not, it doesn\u2019t fulfill its full potential. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork invests itself with a unique fashion although nothing outlandishly mind blowing. They essentially capture the mystery elements and thankfully accomplishes that. The most noticeable part is the obstruction of the character faces with the use of shadow silhouettes. By doing so, it creates a suspenseful atmosphere that appeals to the themes of identity. On the other hand, character designs are more or less worth praising. Kobayashi is designed to look like a trap and the show itself seems to be aware of this as it pokes fun of his looks. There\u2019s also a bit of fan service when it comes with characters like Black Lizard along with her sadism. Still, the show does maintain a distinctive way of delivering its art style. The amount of symbolism the show possesses in the form of butterflies and other background makes it enough to attract interest.\\n\\n\r\nA stronger point in the show is the soundtrack. The OP and ED theme song are not just visually appealing but also very well decorated with clever cinematics. The OST has the style of what makes a mystery show especially when episodes reaches its climax point. This is further accompanied by the eerie feel and coordination when demonstrated by its suspenseful angles. Finally, we have the character voice mannerisms. Criticism can be easily approached again with characters like Kobayashi, who doesn\u2019t really sound like a detective prodigy. On the other hand, I will say that Akechi has a voice that sounds like the mind of strategist. Furthermore, some episodes is able portray the emotional appeal with more sensible themes. \\n\\n\r\nSo what does this series in the end equate to? It\u2019s more of an average mystery show that has some promise but mostly doesn\u2019t live up to itself. What seemed clever and well-structured in the beginning quickly becomes stale. The storytelling is unbalanced despite all the interesting themes each episode that ultimately becomes half of entertaining as it is. And to top it off, only a few of the characters are memorable and probably only by their names. I will say that the unique style of some of the artwork and symbolism strikes as intriguing. And when connected with the soundtrack, the show can be a blockbuster thriller. Each episode\u2019s title tries to lure the audience in but in the end, Game of Laplace plays out as a not so much fun.",

But in the  last 3 episodes, it all goes wrong..., in almost every aspects.\r\nI will first discuss the story, the anime was identified as the mystery genre with no other genres. I should say that at first, the story promising many things. As we know, in mystery series, there's only one item that been offered to us. And the answer is 'the mystery' itself, but if we identified all of the available cases in Game of Laplace, there's not much mystery in it. It just a blank question that readyto be answered at any time and any place. The bad thing is the anime unable to present  intense mystery settings to the screen. Which a fatal error to the story plus the enjoyment. Imagine this,\\n\r\n\"Have you had any idea if we watch a detective or a mystery movie without any mysteries within it?\". The mysteries revealed with unclear reasons and many plot holes. Good thing this is just 11 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnother annoying thing is the character. I didn't even know why there's always psychopath that do the killings. The main cast could be told as one of the most typical, uninteresting, and ridiculous cast I've ever seen. You must know that the director is having a brain wreck. Instead offering a great mystery, they offering a yaoi fan service. Really? YAOI?! In mystery genre?! They exacerbated the situation with many other annoying and bizarre cast which I didn't want to describe one by one because it's just too.......ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound settings it's fair enough to make me watch this until the last second. Thanks to that two aspects, my headaches starts again.\\n\\n\r\nComic Relief, Ridiculous Cast, Unfulfilled Individual Element, and many other bad things make this anime got worse and worse.  All of that wrapped up in just 11 episodes.Trust me, if you have any idea about watching this, I suggest you too forgot this for an instant.",

Dammit Makoto Uezu and Seiji Kishi stop touching mysteries and stuff. Stay with comedies. Please.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. It's not ugly but it's not ''holy sh- it's beautiful'' too ! However, we can see that they try to be original with the presentation and some of them are really appreciated like the people who only were silhouettes representing people that Kobayashi doesn't care at all and only the people that he finds interesting is seen normally. Just background characters for him. Sometimes, they try too hard with the symbolisms that it just gets boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is ok. The OP and ED were some of the best in this season. ( I listen to them a lot in my car, no joke.) The OST is also nice, but there one song in particular that plays almost every episodes. Is the song bad ? No. But it gets annoying, a little bit like the song ''Don't loose your way'' in kill la kill.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are ... most of the time forgetable. With the exception of one : Kobayashi. A boy who got us all confused, thinking that it was a girl. Kobayashi is bizarre and wants some action in his life... thats pretty much it. The protagonist pretty much gets in trouble, help sometimes Akechi and gets our ding confused. The other characters aren't worth mentioning with Hashiba who might be gay for Kobayashi (we will never know), the detective super-duper intelligent and anti-social Akechi and Minami the medical examiner aka one of the worst character this season. Popping out randomly, trying to be funny. The Shadow-man was good tho. Weird and sometimes creepy but he was definitly the most interesting one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i was hoping that it gets better. The first episode people were sceptical and i was thinking: ''Oh c'mon people it's just the first episode. Give it some times.'' The more it was going, the more i was thinking that ... yeah, that's not good at all.\\n\\n\r\n4/10, don't waste your time with it.\\n\r\nWell, there's only 11 episodes so you can try if you want but don't get your hopes up.",

            "content": "Now is the time, once again, for me to have an opinion in the minority here. I see plenty of scathing reviews for Ranpo Kitan. But I'm giving this show a positive review. I really liked this show. \r\nI imagine that the problem most people thought that this show was pretentious, silly, all style, no substance, no profundity. And truthfully, I agree with all those except for the last two.\r\nIt is very true that this show is one of the most stylistic animes I have ever seen. I have never seen a show like this. It reminds me of Chicago, but this is that stylein the form of a mystery theatre instead of a stage play. And it is brilliant. It's bright, it's colorful, it's dark, it's powerful. This is something that truly sets this show apart. It helped with the drama and it helped with the comedy.\\n\r\nThen there is the fact that this show has the single best soundtrack of any show I have ever seen. I'm not just talking about the opening and closing themes. Anybody who has seen this show knows about that one song. I call it \"Another Sky\", and it is one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful songs ever. I will but the OST when it comes out just for that one song.\\n\r\nSo, what about the story and characters? I personally think that the story was brilliant. Twenty Faces is one of the best symbolic villains ever. \\n\r\nThis show can be boring, generic, and silly at times. But this show has been home to some of the best moments I've seen in an anime. \\n\r\nRanpo Kitan is a lot of things. It's silly, it's dark, it's strange, it's generic. But before it is any of those things it is a great art piece. Is it perfect? No. But this show made me really feel and really think. I think it was a wonderful experience.",

            "content": "This anime to me resembles a lot like Tokyo ESP v2.0. It is pretty sad to say that Kishi Seiji has declined in quality ever since Persona 4 the Golden Animation which I didn't watch.\r\nSTORY (3):\r\nThis anime marks the 50th anniversary of Edogawa Ranpo's passing. Edogawa Ranpo was known as the Sir Author Conan Doyle of Japan who produced mystery fiction books. Now, Kishi Seiji the director undergoes this project. \r\nYou know a mystery fiction has to build tension and suspense when it comes to mystery solving and riddles to be solved. However, this anime failed on that ground. Everything was extremely clich\u00e9 and countlessmystery fiction have done before in the past years. Everything was unresolved at the end.\\n\\n\r\nSome mysteries try to include all those sexual fantasies of the creators which Japan has been infamously known for. I told you I am very tired of all these sexual fantasies of the creators, they have been done to death in the past decade of anime. Like for example Kuro Tokage being tortured and she shows joy, especially Yaoi in this anime. Yes, I'm not joking.\\n\\n\r\nART (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is below average just like Tokyo ESP. The animation never give the other characters some colors, imagine just like Watamote. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (4):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was the best thing that will ever stay in my head in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (3):\\n\\n\r\nI really hate to say this but Kogoro Akechi has great character development other than the rest of the casts. Seriously, Kogoro Akechi was like a wish-fulfilment character. \\n\\n\r\nSouji Hashiba is just like another Azuma Kyoutaro with no personality that can stand out among the generic crowd. And do you guys remember Azuma Kyoutaro in Tokyo ESP, neither do I. But I do remember that Azuma Kyoutaro was useless and relied on Rinka Urushiba for help. Just like Souji Hashiba, he barely did anything but just be there for Kobayashi AKA Mr Transvestite.\\n\\n\r\nI will just define Kobayashi's personality with this quote.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just a sweet transvestite from Transylvania. I can't do anything and I jerk around with Akechi & Hashiba. \\n\\n\r\nKuro Tokage was the most creepiest person in this anime. She tries to be like a sex desire but she became creepy instead. The voice actress Hikasa Yoko this Summer 2015 anime has now voiced actresses that moaned a lot and including one character from Bikini Warriors. She is just a sex model.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain was as clich\u00e9 as the main villain as in Tokyo ESP.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (3):\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that this anime is basically Tokyo ESP v2.0 with mystery that is not compelling and characters that are as bland as they can get.\\n\\n\r\nI've got nothing more to say. Lerche has now declined in quality this year.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets a 3 out of 10.",

Maybe i cant perfectly write my thoughts in here.\r\nStory 10/10:\r\nhmm i myself cant explain what in my thoughts but im gonna try...\r\nFor me maybe this is the most real mystery anime for me at least the most close situation with real life... I think for many people a \"Mystery\" genre should be typical solving criminal case with why,who,when,where,what,how. Well im sorry but this isnt anime that you looking for... but actually this anime have all of those aspects its just they make it a bit more interesting... Thisis our \"reality\" the case is not given by them but its in our surrounding, its how we interpret every cases, every action, and sometimes people&object and even the case itself used as an symbolic. \\n\\n\r\n(spoiler alert):\\n\r\nWell its pathetic that a 14 yrs old and 17 yrs old student solving the mysteries insted the older ones. This is unlogical and maybe not make sense for most people, but its just how our society are, its just how corrupt our society are,and its just how unlogical,nonsensical our society are. For some people who lived a good live grow in a good society,good school,good parents,good friends,good economics, i think it will be hard to get something from this anime even a glimpse. Chaos teory,masked man,butterfly effect,twenty faces? wow so messed up right? and dont forget the absurd criminal cases and maybe some yaoi? well its i think they already know if they make this anime with more serious manly characters it will be more and more confusing than it`s now and of course more bad ratings. And thats all just an example, the real case is in our everyday life...\\n\\n\r\ne.g masked man and sachiko shows us how kindness we give will return to us as another kindness masked man are maybe a grandpa who you dont know showed up when you`re alone and sick, and maybe he`s a person who helps you when you`re on accidents you or a doctor who cures you? or just some stranger who loves kids and guard your sisters/brothers when you`re not there... who knows? \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: If you`re gonna watch this anime, try to think as unlogical as you can, try to understand what the creator want to say... its all about our surroundings, and always pay attention at all the symbols.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan - Game Of Laplace is one of the three shows that aired in Summer 2015 from relatively new studio, Studio Lerche. This was the studios first time ever producing more than 2 anime in a year, and I must say, besides one major fault, this, as one of the 4 series from them this year, is my favourite.\r\nLet's get the bad thing out of the way. The execution of the writing. The first 2 episodes and the last 5 episodes I absolutely loved, however, all that was in-between I would have counted as filler if they didn't come into use (even though small)in easily one of the best finale's of the year. Their were three writers to the series, and all had their own distinct style which creating a bit of a problem for many watchers. The weakest out of which is the writer not mentioned in the staff part of this series' page. When she was on script, the series felt rushed and packed with completely forgettable introductory episodes. The writing itself I had no problem with, it was excellent and daring, but it was the execution of some episodes that really dragged it down. However, even if those episodes left a sour taste in the mouth, the finale quickly redeems those faults.\\n\\n\r\nProduction -\\n\r\nThe production is on the complete opposite of the spectrum. Even if just for the production, watch this series. This really proved that Lerche is full of both veterens and creative young animators alike. Just like in all other of their series, their wasn't a single frame that wasn't near perfect art. The animation was well above the average standard also. However, it was the creative aesthetics that made this show so excellent. Everything has meaning. Its full of symbolism and unique visuals which change depending on what point of view the episode focuses on. The cgi was really well done and blended in nicely, and the colour palette was extremely vibrant and atmospheric in itself. The voice acting was also incredible, with the most notable actors being Jun Fukuyama with his short yet absolutely phenominal role as a key character. The music was excellent, as would be expected from the man behind \"Your Lie In April\"'s soundtrack.\\n\r\nHowever, the man who deserves the most praise is Seiji Kishi. His cinemetography, choreography and just overall his direction is still to this day second to none in the T.V. anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nHighlights of the series -\\n\r\nMusic - Phenominal\\n\r\nVoice Acting - one of the best acting of the season\\n\r\nArt - very minimal flaws only noticeable if going individual frames at a time.\\n\r\nAnimation - varying from fluid to movie quality\\n\r\nDirection - some of the best directing of the year.\\n\r\naesthetics - almost studio Shaft in nature.\\n\r\nThe Finale - couldn't have been more excellent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this proved many things to us about studio Lerche. \\n\r\n1 - they are daring and will not hold anything back. They are also masters at censorship, sometimes the censorship is used to even compliment the overall visual.\\n\r\n2 - they have excellent production quality\\n\r\n3 - they are a studio that can actually think\\n\r\n4 - they are incredibly creative and unique\\n\r\n5 - they have massive potential going forward\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan was a great series only bogged down by poor scripting.",

            "content": "Okay okay, before I get backlashed for my \"high\" rating, please read this (almost lengthy) review. \r\nFor a disclaimer, I haven't read any of the source material. I've heard bad things about this adaption, but I can't agree or disagree. But you have my condolences on it not being to your standards, really, I understand. And yes I'll probably read the source material in the future.\r\nStory - 7/10   \r\nThe story, for my tastes, was interesting for the most part. There of course are lots of things I wish they had done differently, but you can't win 'em all I guess. For example the\"comedy\" relief in Ranpo Kitan isn't that great. I didn't find most of it actually \"funny.\" Then again, humour is subjective. The characters are also a disappointment, but I'll get more into that later. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual plot of this story, to me, is interesting (even with execution not being as good as it could have been). It makes us ponder the everyday vision of society. Who are we and what do we mean? Who is bad? Who is good? Is there really a difference? I love anime that makes me blur the line between \"good\" and \"evil.\" Whether it's cliche or not, it's interesting to think about. \\n\\n\r\n*spoiler warning ahead--just skip to the \"art\" part*\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into the actual spoiler part, let's do some backtracking. This anime is filled with a plethora of symbols and metaphors. Ranpo Kitan's whole plot and visual aspect is built on this. So of course if you don't look into the small detail or even care about it, you'll miss out on something. This isn't an anime you can turn your brain off and watch. You have to pay attention. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said let's get into the ending spoiler. A lot of people are complaining about the ending and how \"nothing changes,\" and how \"this was a waste.\" While I agree there was TONS of wasted potential, the ending was perfect. All the efforts made by the characters proves futile. That's right, useless.  But life is a paradox; this ending was suppose to represent the society we live in. While things do and will change, there's just some things that won't. We CAN'T make the bad people go away. Evil will always exist. So Namikoshi's death (or maybe he tricked the formula into thinking he died) went in vain. Nothing came of his disappearance. This means deaths everyday in this would are \"wasted\" on this idea that it will mean something. While some do, most don't from the other people looking in. Their death, unfortunately, becomes a part of a statistic. \\n\\n\r\nEvil isn't born, it's created. it's created by people who were also created by evil. It's a never ending cycle that can't and will not be broken. Bullies, rapists, molesters, kidnappers, murders, etc etc will always exist and other people will always be a victim to these monsters. And that's what this ending represents; a never ending cycle of bad people being created in this world. Take it or leave it, but just know that our justice system is just as messed up as these people. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime is very fluid (for the most part). I enjoy the dark scenery and character designs in contrast to the characters' eye color. It could represent the light we see in people but how the darkness is an unavoidable concept.  The art and animation is also visually beautiful. Mostly the symbolic story telling in a lot of the scenes. It's all so so stunning. I love the color pallet they chose for Ranpo Kitan overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also beautifully done. The OP is just great. I'm now a big fan of amazarashi's music. They are known for they storytelling music and I love that. \"Speed and Friction\" is one of my favorite OPs of the season.  Now the ending song. Wow the first time I listened to it I was captivated. It's beautifully dark. \"Mikazuki\" is one of my favorite EDs this season as well. The whole soundtrack is on point and I love everything about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where my review does a 180. The characters are so bland it makes me wanna bang me head on a wall. While I didn't HATE Kobayashi, I completely understand why people do. He's so annoying. He's part of that \"comedic\" relief I mentioned earlier. It all seems out of place and he makes me feel a lil uncomfortable. Especially because he's so fascinated by death and such. Now I personally find death interesting, but I'm more interested in where we go after we die, not dead body parts. I understand how his character is suppose to be a polar opposite of the entire plot, but it wasn't done well. I like the supporting characters more, but his best friend was pretty annoying too. I will admit his gay lil crush is kind of funny and cute, but that's about it. It's the only thing I like about either of them lol. \\n\\n\r\nNow with Akechi, the paper bag guy, and Namikoshi. I like the \"I don't give a fuck\" archetypes such as Akechi. Nothing really stood out with him for me. I do admire the care and love he had for his best friend Namikoshi though. With no one in the world to understand each other, they only had one another. I get that on a personal level. This brings me into another thing people didn't like which was the cliche backstory on Namikoshi. Saying it was a typical antagonist backstory, which is all true. It's as cliche as they come, but it fits the overall anime well. It's the simplicity that really reflects society. There are tons of people in this world that are/were in the exact same situation he was in. This anime revolves a lot around death the social injustice of this world. So it all makes perfect sense. \\n\\n\r\nThe paper bag guy was just one small fraction of the humour I enjoyed in Ranpo Kitan. He was interesting. I still wonder who he really is, but some mysteries are meant to be unknown. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI know the flaws. I know the small plot holes. I know a lot of things went unanswered. I know this story had it's issues. With all that being said, I still really enjoyed myself. This anime is honestly a hit or a miss with people, and for me it was a win. This is coming from someone who loves looking beyond the given visuals. It's easy for me to read in between the lines. It gets an eight for mostly the ending otherwise it would be like a seven. \\n\\n\r\nIt's impossible for me to recommend or not recommend this anime. It's just up for the viewers interpretation. You might be disappointed and hate or like it and feel fulfilled. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This show has been shat on and abandoned by so many bloggers and critics that it needs no more of that. Rather, though I'm giving this show an overall score of 4, I'd like to mount a short defense of the show. I do not regret watching it, and would encourage others to do the same.\r\nWarning: some spoilers, though nothing too significant, follow.\r\nHere are what I believe to be the greatest problems with the show, and the ones most criticism live on:\r\nThe mysteries are not great, and billing this asa detective, or mystery, show is somewhat untrue. Leaps of logic, insane and often inane conclusions based off the most meager of evidence, frequent the show. The cases are often punctuated by brief bouts of melodrama, where the culprit's trauma is explained as tragedy; some of these are more ridiculous than others. A few, however, are moving. Murders occur in the beginning, and culprits are caught in the end; but this is not the only thing required for a good mystery, and perhaps the most relevant criticism we can make of Ranpo Kitan is that it fails to engage the intellect of its viewers in this crucial respect. Though it parades the structures and tropes of a mystery show, this has little to do with mystery.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this show on a weekly basis leaves the viewer with no sense of cohesion or order. All is chaotic. A grand design behind the show's haphazard design is not perceptible. As has been pointed out before, this anime is, in two words, fucking weird; intense and stylized scenes merge the grotesque and ordinary, perhaps most pointedly in the medical examiner's lighthearted dissections of the murder victims. Even if a grand design is apparent to those who've finished it, the show fails to compel viewers to come back week after week. Those who kept watching do so less out of eager interest, and more out of a benign curiosity, with the intent of observing the final moments of a beautiful trainwreck. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on. \\n\\n\r\nComing into this show with the expectation of mystery - primarily because it commemorates Edogawa Ranpo - leads you to one conclusion: this show blows. \\n\\n\r\nWe might instead think of this show in the tradition of Gatchaman Crowds, and think of the cases that pepper the show as angles that slowly reveal a particular social condition to us. It is precisely this element that captivated - well, captivated is too strong a word, but compelled kindasorta - some viewers even as so many dropped the show. In adapting Crowds to its modern incarnation, the show changed and \"updated\" much of the show; here is a similar attempt, though it tends to flail and drown where Crowds soars and succeeds. If Crowds is a social commentary that happens to involve superheroes, Game of Laplace is a social commentary that happens to involve detectives and mysteries, and while the former is no doubt a more successful show, the comparison still holds water. \\n\\n\r\nIn adapting Edogawa Ranpo, the creators of the show wanted to modernize and accentuate elements of Edogawa, and they dramatized it as they saw fit. In a similar fashion to Crowds, they focus on the cross between the net, anonymity, and justice. \\n\\n\r\nThe aching sorrow with which each culprit is portrayed may seem too much, but the tableaus all flow from a general disgust with the legal system - a system that fails, we are told, to hold even the most cruel criminals accountable for their actions. And the leitmotifs the show employs - the butterflies, the shadows, and the tender (if silly) way each culprit's grief is put on tableau for the viewer; they're all more digestible when viewed from this perspective. These recurring tropes make little to no sense, and are indeed distracting, if you consider the show a mystery. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Kobayashi, is only 'explained' by way of the completion of the plot - indeed, another flaw of the show. Even then, you might not buy it, and viewers of the show will only have a 'cold' connection in the characters - not an empathetic or meaningful one. Many simply kept watching, I imagine, to see if Kobayashi would lapse into crime. Yet the show points to Kobayashi's psychopathy as a metaphor, and proceeds to do little to nothing with it, aside from gift us all a few beautiful stills that glimpse into his perspective. Though I suggest here a level of grandeur behind the show, I do not want the reader to believe I think the show does so with success. And so this review is not a typical, pretentious \"you-just-didn't-see-the-point\" of it review. The show still fails in many respects. Most, in fact. The art and sound design is good and sometimes great, but in every other respect it's lacking.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's still worth a watch. Beware the obsessively negative reviews; this show is at times beautiful. It is nothing near a masterpiece, but I would recommend it to any whose taste veer toward the strange and unique, or those interested in watching a dazzling trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\n\"Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace\" attempts to gesture towards something complex, and fails - with magnificence - to say anything meaningful. This will never be considered a great show. Rather, it is an imbalanced show, leaping off a cliff without a solid plan of escape. But crazy shows that burn as they fail are still worth watching; the unique colors they give off as they descend into nonsense can be both rare and beautiful.",

            "content": "SPOILERS: This show is garbage. It started as a simple, but decent murder mystery show. But then it goes into WTF territory of pretentiousness, head scratchers and forehead smacking that would have Evangelion telling it to relax. \r\nThis show sucks.\r\nWhat\u2019s good?\r\nThe main character Kogorou Akechi is the cool headed boy detective that I actually grew fond of as the show progresses. Always one step ahead, brilliant and having a sympathetic motivation, Akechi is what keeps the audience drawn to the show. \r\nSouji Hashiba is possibly one of the most underutilized characters in the show, which is a shame. He doesn\u2019t do much in the show,but the scenes with him (sans that trap) are some of the best moments in the show. I liked that he is straight man of the main trio while Akechi and that other one are eccentric and out-of-the-box. Hashiba should have been Akechi\u2019s right hand man. Though rare, the best moments in the show are the interactions between Akechi and Hashiba, especially in the last few episodes where the two are working together.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of 20 faces is really interesting. I wished the show put more focus on that than waiting for it to have any significance in the latter half.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is nicely composed, with some scores reminding me of Kingdom Hearts, oddly. \\n\\n\r\nWhy this show is garbage?\\n\r\nOne, Kobayashi. This show is ruined simply by this person\u2019s existence. First of all, why is she a trap? There\u2019s no reason for her to be one. It\u2019s become a trend in anime in the last few years that needs to die. It doesn\u2019t help that she is possibly that worse case of traps in anime. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, the god awful pretentious behavior of this character and the outright neglect of consequences. It pertains to the last episode where he, (SPOILERS, but no one will want to watch this show), helps the villain only because he finds the villain to be more interesting than Akechi. She attempts to commit suicide along with the villain and the other 20 faces simply because he finds it interesting. Piss off!! Oh, and no gratitude towards Hashiba, the only one who genuinely cares for him, for saving his life. Poor Hashiba. His hormones must be a mess. Oh, that cringe worthy moment when Kobayashi saw Hashiba as a faceless mannequin.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is there a seductress that soils herself whenever she sees Akechi, let alone a teenager?\\n\\n\r\nWhy is there a gothic lolita teacher who clearly has some issue that I thought would play into the story, but never did?\\n\\n\r\nHow did Minami and her corpse doll interact with the real world? Weren\u2019t they a figment of everyone\u2019s imagination? What\u2019s with those Family Guy cut-aways? That form of comedy got old 10 years ago. \\n\\n\r\nWhy there was an episode dedicated to a cat right after the good episodes Kagami??!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nSuch a shame that this simple, yet enjoyable murder mystery show turned into a complete mess. Akechi, Hashiba and their interactions are great, but are not enough to cover all the badness this show has. Off pacing, nonsensical directing and the wasted potential of 20 Faces really made this show into a downer. \\n\\n\r\nAnd screw you Kobayashi with your pretentious behavior and cross dressing. Where are Subaru and Charles to give this dude the 3D through the table?  Kobayashi  would make a fine chair.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: I haven't read any of Sir Edogawa's work when I wrote the review for this anime.\r\nRanpo Kitan is an anime coming from the mystery genre which produced Un-Go, Hyouka and Case Closed. The show's setup was good enough. The characters are quirky enough. The premise of the mysteries was creepy enough to pick the interest of the audience. To be honest, I really thought it can be a successor of Un-Go but what went wrong with this show? Oh well, let's proceed with the review.\r\nRanpo Kitan's direction is more mysterious than the story itself because the way on how the outcome of stories weresolved was bereft of any thrill and life. It was also randomly handled at times that it managed to squeeze all the characters in a single episode for God knows why. It can also be inferred that one may not enjoy fully this series if he is not familiar with Sir Edogawa's works. That alone sends a distress signal in this anime given that it cannot stand in itself.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the audience was not given enough time and clues to solve the cases it had.  A typical Ranpo Kitan case goes as follows: Akechi and his gang do their daily hijinks, a case comes up and bam! it was solved immediately. It was as if you are listening to a narration which suddenly jumps to the resolution and bores you to death.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main story picks up at episode 8 (after some empty fillers), which is really late for an eleven episode anime and the payoff is not anything grand either. The sense of belief and tension in the finale were not there. It was as if I was just waiting to see what happens in the end.  It starts to become passable then but it was too late to redeem the audience who dropped this early on.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of focusing to create a solid plot, Ranpo Kitan focused in the quirks of the characters which was never good enough to compensate the lack of story. Twenty Faces, Shadow Man and the Medical Examiner are interesting enough since they are portrayed in a theatrical manner but without a good story to anchor them, they are just talking cardboards.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan's characters were also not given proper development and were only shown for the sake of the writing staff to move the plot. The only standouts given these characters are Kobayashi who seems to be a sociopath and Akechi who received fair amount of development from an overpowered protagonist to someone who is likable enough in the end.\\n\\n\r\nYet to say that Ranpo Kitan is a total waste of time is not fair. The visual techniques are really pretty that it compensates its inability to deliver a good story and I can certainly say that the background sound is one of the best I have heard this season. The opening song sets the mood for the show and the ending song is a pure earworm pop rock. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it seems like the noitamina slot is not fail proof when it comes in producing quality shows. Ranpo Kitan is one of their casualties this season which is a shame given that this is supposed to be the tribute to Sir Edogawa's 50th death anniversary.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nCrime has been around for as long as humans have roamed the Earth. While it would be awesome if everyone held hands and made peace and sang carols, an idyllic world of that kind simply does not exist. There are \u201cbad apples\u201d everywhere. People who, for whatever reason, resort to crime.\r\nRanpo Kitan: Game of Laplace centers on crime like pedophilia, torture, and murder. Grotesque crime, but crime all the same. It shows the lengths people on both sides of the law will go to and what that means for everyone in society.\r\nI have never committeda crime and I have (thankfully; knock on wood) never been the victim of a crime. Someone did steal a USB drive of mine once, but I was not so annoyed that I wanted to call for an investigation. Thinking about it now, I wish I still had that USB from way back when. And thinking about it more, if I had a copy of Ranpo Kitan on that USB, not only would I not care about it getting stolen, I would thank the thief for stealing it.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan is filled to the brim with problems, and nowhere is that more evident than in the tale it tries to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime touts itself as a \u201cMystery\u201d anime, and to be fair that is partially true. Each crime committed is usually quite strange: people contorted into furniture, little girls kidnapped and molded into concrete slabs, and so on. No matter the crime, the characters logically determine who the culprit is, what the culprit did, and why the culprit did it. Though the point is not this detective work because the crimes are usually solved within the episode, which realistically means within about ten minutes. Worse still is that the mysteries mean very little to the rest of the show. Individual mysteries do not affect the other mysteries, nor do they affect the characters themselves. Thus, the mysteries serve little else besides providing the setting. A misstep, especially considering the \u201cMystery\u201d tag.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of the anime is the idea that crime goes unpunished. That these murderers and pedophiles escape conviction either for making bail or for having a mental illness, allowing them to \u201ccheat the system.\u201d This is where Ranpo Kitan encounters another major problem. The show is so one-sided that it becomes difficult to take the narrative seriously. The police are aggravatingly inept. Akechi and Kobayashi often need Kuro Tokage, the masochistic criminal who is madly in love with Akechi, to tell them where to go, even though she is behind bars and is a criminal herself. Kagami, one of the detectives, is put behind bars forever despite doing the exact same thing as the other criminals.\\n\\n\r\nThis last detail is meant to show the stupidity of the system in place. But it is so silly because of how contradictory it is. The precedent had already been set: criminals walk free even after committing egregious crimes. So when one case out of the (presumably) hundreds of others goes against this norm, it comes off as a cheap way to show how \u201cunfair\u201d society is.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan also has a glaring problem with just the tale it is telling. It starts off with these singular, mystery cases that allude to a so-called \u201cTwenty Faces.\u201d What was supposed to happen was a build-up towards the eventual boiling-over of the Twenty Faces dilemma. Instead, what occurs is a lot of stagnation. The crimes are, at best, semi-related to Twenty Faces, so when the Twenty Faces conflict reaches its climax, it comes out of nowhere. Build-up is further squandered when the anime interrupts the conflict. Episode six is too comical and too unrelated to the overarching plot. And episode ten, while expounding on Namikoshi and hence the origins of Twenty Faces, disrupts the tension that was finally being created.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the so-called \u201cDark Star\u201d law which cheapens the narrative further. This law coming out of nowhere is a problem, but the biggest problem with this law is its scope. As an omniscient law, it is never wrong, meaning the narrative gets to do whatever it wants without consequence. When the law is wrong, it is either unfairly avoided (Namikoshi conveniently \u201cupdates\u201d the law after Akechi \u201csolves\u201d it) or the explanation is nonsensical (Namikoshi and Kobayashi have to commit suicide in order for the law to be \u201ccomplete\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending also has issues. Rather than gracefully concluding the season, Ranpo Kitan tries way too hard to wrap everything up. The attempt made is a bunch of words without fully showing the aftermath, acting as a sort of catch-all to cover its bases. But the ending does not stop there. As the characters discuss, Namikoshi is (possibly) still alive, which is ridiculous. Not just because he has now pretended to die for the second time, but also because the entire purpose of the ending \u2013 the reason why Namikoshi went through this overly complicated crime \u2013 was to, in the end, kill himself. So when the anime nonchalantly states that the main antagonist is still alive, then everything throughout the season was for naught.\\n\\n\r\nEven the tone of the anime is problematic. The crimes depicted are dark, yet the anime regularly dips into comedy. For instance, Minami, the doctor, is regularly used for comedic effect with her joking about the violent deaths. The idea is that the contrast is supposed to be funny, but because the anime is too serious when it comes to its subject matters, the contrast is less hilarious and more jarring.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan\u2019s narrative simply has too many problems to consider it well-executed; contextually, the narrative is as barebones as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best aspect of Ranpo Kitan is its artistic direction. Multicolored lighting and nice shadows are used, but its best move is embracing its weirdness, creating scenes that bend reality at will. Impossible proportions, impromptu objects, and involved symbolism are just a sampling of the ways in which the anime depicts its scenes. \u201cScenes\u201d in the literal sense. Curtains, spotlights, and fourth-wall breaking are used to make elaborate, stage-like creations to explain the crimes and events. The show even goes so far as to have the characters viewing the explanations as if they were watching a play. Since the crimes are a spectacle, presenting the anime in this fashion is not only interesting but also quite fitting.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Ranpo Kitan is not focusing on the imaginary, the anime can look pretty dull. Besides Akechi\u2019s abode and various parts of the city, the backgrounds and locations do not have the same pizzazz as the previous scenes. Although that is sort of the point. Similar to the story\u2019s tonal contrast, a contrast between the crazy scenes and the mundane ones is designed to make the crazy scenes that much crazier. Dissimilar to the story\u2019s tonal contrast, the artistic contrast actually works.\\n\\n\r\nAnother cool detail is how the anime presents uninteresting people. When Akechi\u2019s perspective takes the limelight, uninteresting people are drawn as wooden puppets, symbolizing how they are controlled by the world around them. The most interesting case, however, is when the anime draws them as outlines with faded colors. Light grays, pinks, and greens cover the people that are currently uninteresting, including the main characters. How the anime determines who is uninteresting is based on Kobayashi\u2019s feelings. He is disinterested in the world, so much so that the people he does not care about \u2013 the people he finds uninteresting \u2013 receive this faded treatment.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the character designs are a step down, mainly due to their plainness. Akechi wears dress clothes with a red tie, but he looks a bit too old for his apparent age. Hashiba is similarly plain; besides his glasses, he has no outstanding qualities. There might be a case for Kobayashi who is designed to be feminine in appearance, but he, too, has a design that lacks any \u201coomph.\u201d Shadow-Man might have a case as well given his signature paper bag he wears over his head. The paper bag symbolizes his ability to disguise himself as anyone he wishes, disguises that he regularly uses. Hanabishi, the teacher, has a strange design with cat ears, pink colors, and a short stature, although why her design is like this is never explained. Altogether, even giving Shadow-Man the benefit of the doubt, the designs lack the necessary appeal to call them impressive.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, there is a moderate amount. The elaborate scenes are most likely the culprit for this, since they are more for show than they are for movement, although they can have moving parts and shiny sparkles. Hair, eyes, and limbs hardly move, and besides Akechi fighting some bad guys, there is not a whole lot of action. But again, to be fair, the anime\u2019s focus on standalone shots of fancy setups makes this an expected outcome.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Ranpo Kitan are as abysmal as the story they find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi, the main protagonist, starts off well-enough but quickly tapers off. In the beginning of the season, he (indirectly) talks about his \u201cboredom.\u201d His \u201cempty\u201d feeling, as he puts it, causes him to be disinterested in the world around him. As if life had nothing to offer. That is a sad thing for a junior high school student to say since the world has so much in store.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not until he is framed for a murder that he finally finds the calling he had been searching for. He then starts working with Akechi, this work considerably lifting his spirits. At this point, Kobayashi\u2019s character stagnates. He is always present, but he does not stray far away from his characterizations of solving the crimes and acting carefree. So when the finale comes around, and he is ready to commit suicide, it is perplexing. Not only was he finally enjoying himself, he had Hashiba, he had Akechi, and he had his ability to help solve those heinous crimes. There was never any indication that he was contemplating suicide let alone regressing back to his earlier thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nNamikoshi is likewise a weak character. Namikoshi does not enter the series until midway through episode eight (out of eleven) and very briefly at the end of episode nine. All of episode ten is spent on characterizing and developing him. This episode shows everything: the bullies he had hounding him, the abusive parents he had at home, and his cherished friendship he had with Akechi. Doing this characterization and development so late is a major issue because the audience has no time to understand him as a character. He shows up, he gets developed, and then he disappears, all within the span of essentially a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Namikoshi is ultimately meant to be is a parallel to Kobayashi. Both Namikoshi and Kobayashi felt left alone by the world around them. Both Namikoshi and Kobayashi were intelligent in ways that few others knew. And most importantly, both Namikoshi and Kobayashi had a best friend that, no matter their troubles, would fight to stay by their side. This parallel is supposed to exist between them, however, it is poorly handled. Namikoshi appears at the end (their relationship has no foundation) and Kobayashi no longer feels the same way as Namikoshi (his actions and demeanor throughout the season prove this). So not only are Kobayashi and Namikoshi weak characters individually, but they are also weak on a relational level.\\n\\n\r\nOther relationships have problems as well. Akechi and Kuro Tokage \u2013 the masochistic, psycho woman in prison \u2013 presumably have some kind of past. But how they met or what kind of relationship they had is never explicitly shown. Akechi and Namikoshi\u2019s also lacks strength; their relationship, while constructed, is not around long enough to say that what they shared was worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender, however, is Hashiba and Kobayashi\u2019s relationship. Unlike Akechi and Namikoshi, whose relationship demonstrates that they care for one another, Hashiba and Kobayashi\u2019s relationship lacks that same sense of friendship. This is mostly due to Kobayashi\u2019s attitude. Hashiba pesters Kobayashi and saves him from certain death, so he clearly cares for Kobayashi. In contrast, Kobayashi regularly ignores Hashiba\u2019s pleas, making it clear that Kobayashi does not care about Hashiba as much as Hashiba cares about him. There are a few scenes in which Hashiba and Kobayashi interact in a meaningful manner, but they amount to nothing more than small apologies or asides. The result is the awkward relationship they share.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Hashiba\u2019s individual character, he blushes a lot whenever Kobayashi is nearby \u2013 while maybe not romance, it is assumed that he is attracted to Kobayashi. Besides this fact and that he comes from a rich, gambling family, nothing else is known about the best friend.\\n\\n\r\nHence, the best character is Shadow-Man, though even he is not without problems. His hobby is protecting little girls from would-be criminals, though people misread him as a pedophile. He is undoubtedly the most unique character the cast has to offer, yet as is common with Ranpo Kitan, the anime fails to use him. This is not even about developing or changing his character, he simply has next to no presence within the show. After his initial introduction, he appears in episode six (the comedic one) and then not until the finale. So while his character is strange, that is all he is, because that is all that the anime used him for.\\n\\n\r\nThus, like the story, the characters are as barebones as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is not slow; there is a quickness to it that pulls the listener along. And contrary to the anime, the song is not spooky. The first section has a single beat that seems like it will build towards that, but it is followed by a softer section that feels like longing. The middle section is comprised of a smattering of noise, leaning heavily on repetition. But the more its heard the more spiritual it becomes, fitting the sort of spiritual mood that the anonymous Twenty Faces and death in general entails. Also, the lyrics are interesting: \u201cSing notes of bronchitis,\u201d \u201cAnd my blood is my escape route,\u201d and \u201cAll as speed and friction burn my insides\u201d are graphic and haunting, once again fitting the anime\u2019s mood. The song is not that impressive, but it at least hits the right atmosphere for Ranpo Kitan.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme starts off somber, an acoustic guitar and strained singing filling the piece. When the song picks up someplace in the middle, the piece becomes, like the OP, a cacophony. It is a bit overbearing, but it does have a purpose. As the visuals help to illuminate, this cacophony represents the craziness and figurative fall of society that the show regularly depicts. The piece goes back to its somber roots as it concludes, ending the piece on a sad note. This flow of emotion \u2013 from low to all-over-the-place to low once more \u2013 reflects the story\u2019s own progression, making the ED, if nothing else, symbolic.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack is subpar, to say the least. The anime expectedly uses spooky compositions, such as a slow, ambient track that was essentially lifted from a haunted mansion. These set the mood, but are not fun to listen to outside of the show. Ranpo Kitan also uses a lot of piano tracks for the dramatic moments, but these tracks lack emotion. One dramatic piece in particular is Namikoshi\u2019s favorite song, the song that Akechi plays from time to time on his jukebox to calm himself down. This song goes too far the other way; the song is too emotional and feels out-of-place. Then there are the comedic, jazzy tracks that only further the jarring tonal problems. Altogether, the OST is a largely forgettable offering.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting has no noteworthy performances. Rie Takahashi as Kobayashi gives the feminine male a girly voice but that is because Ms. Takahashi is a woman. Takahiro Sakurai as Akechi uses a voice that is a bit too old for his age. And Yoko Hikasa as Kuro Tokage, while energetic, does not come off as the conniving \u201cBlack Lizard\u201d she claims to be because she always sounds so hyper.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI cannot say that I liked this one.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the comedy and the drama did nothing for me. I was not laughing when Kuro Tokage peed herself from pleasure (which happened a lot), and I was not emotional when Kagami was recounting the tale of his sister. My disliking of the comedy and the drama stems from my dislike of the characters. Kobayashi was too annoying, Akechi was too full of himself, and Namikoshi was too nonsensical for me to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nShadow-Man was interesting, if only because he wore a paper bag over his head. His episode, where he tries to save Sachiko for the second time, is also the best of the season because there was an actual relationship and person worth caring about. Sadly, the anime forgets about Shadow-Man for much of the rest of the show, so I cannot say I will remember him too much. Fitting, considering his name and disguises.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries were lame, too. Akechi and Kobayashi always instantly got the answer, so it never felt like I got to solve the mysteries or at least try to figure them out in some capacity. If they had some kind of trouble with the mysteries, it would have felt more genuine for the show and the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThen there were all of the ludicrous instances. The mother of the little-girl kidnapper literally not turning her demented son into the police. Everyone in the city joining Twenty Faces\u2019 cause so suddenly. An island that basically amounts to a slavery ring that nobody ever investigated. And (albeit petty) Akechi slurping his black coffee all of the time.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite aspect of the entire anime was something that was insignificant: the cat. The cat was a happy cat, which made me a happy person. She was a fun cat, but she had nothing to do with anything. She was there be a cute cat and nothing more. If she was the only part I found entertaining, that speaks volumes for how I felt about the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan: Game of Laplace is awful. The story is broken, the characters are weak beyond belief, and the show is generally a bore to sit through. The art and parts of the music save this one from total atrocity, but only barely. It is practically a crime that this anime even got made in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, the mysteries are pointless, the main theme on crime going unpunished is silly, proper tension is never built, the \u201cDark Star\u201d law is cheap, and the ending is handled horribly\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, the elaborate scenes are interesting, the lighting, contrast, and other details add purpose, about average actual animation, but subpar character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, Kobayashi, Akechi, and Namikoshi are weak individually and in conjunction with each other and the rest of the cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, okay OP, okay ED, bad OST, below average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, only the cat was fun to watch\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "As of the time I'm writing this the last episode of Ranpo Kitan has finished airing. This series is genuinely decent. Just decent. If you're just looking to find a 'masterpiece' this show is not for you. \r\nAlso I'll just go ahead and tell you that as you go into this series, expect all sort of disturbing, disgusting things. The series is very gory and it's themes and undertones aren't exactly child friendly. So just a heads up, the show is messed up from day 1.\r\nIt's biggest flaws include it's story and character development. There are continuous plot holes that by rules I cannot discussnow, but they take away from the overall quality of the show especially from the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is also somewhat confusing for some viewers as some episodes leave you with questions and leave you wondering what's even going on. The way the plot progresses in the first half is rather mediocre and I'd even go as far to say odd. It didn't feel like much effort was put into this part and even by the end of the series the first 5 or so episodes feel irrelevant to the overall scope of things. By episode 6, the show overall picks up in quality and some very interesting events happen. From episode 6 forward the main focus of the anime shifts into a new, darker arc that finally introduces decent character development (but said development is only revealed in the final episodes) and events that were very....different from most other anime. Side characters also become important to the overall plot and events of the story and help the plot pick up. I don't feel like this series was rushed at all unlike some other series here. It had a somewhat 'open' finale but at the same time was somehow 'conclusive'. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm at that, some of the antagonist's motivations are confusing and if you think logically while watching a series you'll probably pick up on. Just a heads up. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : The visuals are amazing for this show, I have to say. The scenery looks beautiful and conveys exactly what the writer was thinking. The character design is also very appealing but \"generic\" for most of the male lead. Definitely is different in terms of the way the art presents itself. During dialogue and flashbacks even the artwork is constantly changing. Almost sort of like the entire series is a play for the viewers even.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested in a \"gory, action, thriller\" anime that'll make you say WTF, Ranpo Kitan is what you're looking for.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace Review\r\nStory (5/10) Mediocre\r\nI'm not going to be doing a synopsis in this section I will be talking about how I felt about the overall story in general. The first episode made it seem like the all of the episodes would be able who framed the MC but that mystery gets solved within the first two episodes. After that it turns into an episodic anime filled with some controversial, sometimes interesting and sometime not interesting episodes. The the last like 4 episodes try to all connect together an introduce an antagonist for the sake of having some sort of series finalefeeling which was an ok little arc but not enough to suffice and withhold anything better than a 'fine' for the overall story for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the anime is really colorful and the cover picture for the anime is what caught my eye at the beginning of the summer anime season enough for me to give it a short. The art style did indeed drop rarely but most of the time it kept a colorful look to the entire anime and also a gritty look when the horrific and blood scenes occur also.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job, the bgm was on point and the opening song is probably one of the best this anime season and the ending caught on to me by the time i finished the anime also nothing really to complain in this section.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10) \\n\r\nMore Specifically (4.5/10)  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters I felt to rather weird. Like I said in art section the character designs and art style of everything in the cover picture is what caught my eye in the first place. And when looking at it from someone who doesn't know you would assume that Kobayashi is the girl that the main character Hashiba is trying to get and Akechi is some sort of anti-hero or rival of the main character Hashiba. But we (or at least I was entirely wrong). Kobayashi is actually a trap which for some reason the anime decides to awkwardly fanservice the crap out of the little boy to the viewers and he's technically the MC I have no clue what kind of sick message they want to get across nor do i care at the end of the day. Hashiba is technically his best friend but it seemed that Hashiba was kind of irrelevant majority of the anime always showing suspect blush moments towards his so called best friend and Akechi basically the senpai they look up to. All the other character in the show were unique but not worth mention in this review honestly the only character I ended up somewhat liking in the anime is Akechi and he's quite possible the most generic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10) Bad\\n\r\nMore Specifically (4.5/10) \\n\\n\r\nThere was only about 2-3 episodes I fairly enjoyed in this entire anime all the reason I either didn't care for, weren't interesting or remember-able or they was just straight up bad. I ended up putting the anime on a semi-hold until all the episodes were out because it just wasn't worth rushing to watch every week with episodes like what I explained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10) Fair\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.20/10) \\n\\n\r\nSo like I said earlier I had to put this anime on semi-hold because it just wasn't worth watching weekly I was able to binge watch it when all of the episodes were out at least but my overall thought on the anime didn't really change on it. It's a fine anime at best the best things about it were the art style and sound which these days isn't saying much because you can kind of get that anywhere.",

            "content": "So the summer anime season is coming to a close and as we prepare for the Fall to simultaneously disappoint us and blow our minds, let\u2019s start looking back at how awful these last three months have been. And what better way to start than to beat up a shitty noitamina anime? I\u2019m actually kind of surprised Ranpo Kitan was amongst the first of this season\u2019s crop to have an ending. Okay, it started on the first week of releases rather than wait until everything is out like noitamina anime usually do, but I assumed it was just 12 episodes like the other two offeringsfor the timeslot this year and that it anticipated that weekly delay that practically every show went through this season. But no, it\u2019s the standard 11 episodes, which is a blessing in disguise because A) it ends quicker B) I get something to review and nothing says catharsis more than beating up a show no one in their right mind would defend.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I\u2019m sorry to say that unless A-1 somehow churns out a worse mystery anime next season - and I know it\u2019s A-1, but this series is just sad - Ranpo is easily the least interesting of noitamina\u2019s offerings in 2015. Punch Line had a decent story that was let down by execution issues and some people seem to like Saekano in all its poorly animated, stakes-less ugliness for some reason, but at least they promoted discussion. You\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find anyone other than masochistic mystery buffs who made it past the first two episodes of Ranpo Kitan, mainly because it was directed by a hack who makes Akiyuki Shinbo look like David Fincher.\\n\\n\r\nWhere exactly are these fans who still support Seiji Kishi enough to have him continue with this thing we humans call a career? Yes I know he\u2019s always adapting really popular stuff due to whatever connections he\u2019s got, but after a while, you\u2019d think people would catch on and realize that Devil Survivor 2 will be more the rule rather than the exception. And more to the point, who was it that approved of him to adapt the works of Edogawa Ranpo in the first place? Who even owns the rights to the property these days? Because after watching this tripe, I think we\u2019re going to need a change of hands to someone who can actually say no as well as some psychological counseling towards the original guy after he experiences the thing for himself.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I usually describe the plot of this show, but I honestly don\u2019t know what to say because it\u2019s just too fragmented and lifeless to put in coherent words whilst being way too dependent on the characters. I mean you\u2019ve got this downbeat detective out for justice. You\u2019ve got this kid who looks and talks like a girl, but is really a boy, and speaks like a robot. You\u2019ve got his male glasses-wearing friend who may or may not be gay for him. Then there\u2019s this bag-man and woman dressed in bondage gear - and I never actually read a Ranpo story, but I\u2019m pretty sure the wacky nurse who looks like the bastard lovechild of Paranoia Agent and Danganronpa wasn\u2019t in the original source, let alone took a substantial role in the show\u2019s climax.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters are given the Kishi hyper-stylization treatment and have about as much believable human emotions as Itchy and Scratchy when they\u2019re phoning it in. And you remember how in Durarara where the unimportant people are drawn in gray and only when they actually have significance to what\u2019s going on is when someone bothers to color them in? Ranpo Kitan has something like that too, except the characters fade into silhouette-like backgrounds at really arbitrary moments and it looks incredibly unfinished rather than stylistic.  It leads to this weird disconnect of coldness most normal people who try to watch Ghost in the Shell experience in that even if you saw something worth watching in here, it\u2019s presentation makes actually accessing it all but impossible. Only in Ranpo Kitan\u2019s case, not only are the smart things just the same old bullshit regarding \u201cwhat is justice\u201d and every other moral you could get in any cop show either, but there\u2019s no excitement to be had even if you penetrate the presentation and dig that sort of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nNow the show\u2019s utter lifelessness makes remembering events difficult, but I do remember that most of the individual cases are more stuff the anime does to fill out time rather than pieces to a much bigger picture. The closest thing we get to an overarching plot thread is through some lunatic named Twenty Faces, who basically kills criminals for justice, and catching him would be a lot easier if there weren\u2019t multiple people doing things in his name. But this conflict only takes up half the screen time and the rest of it is just piddling about. Please explain to me the significance of that one episode where The Amazing Bag-Man stops by the detective\u2019s house and we spend the entire run time basically coming up with theories like a bad stand-up comedy before ending on a conclusion that - as the domesticated father said regarding the broken toilet bowl that had just been used by his kid after digesting food from Taco Bell- was full of shit. There\u2019s taking a break from an on-going plot and then there\u2019s just throwing shit out of that bowl just because you can.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m probably going to have to address the elephant in the room regarding the actual mysteries in this show and whether or not they\u2019re good at some point. Short answer: no. Long answer: Fuck no! The logic is incredibly hard to follow - not helped by the giant heapings of dialogue that desperately needed an editor during investigations - and the actual criminal is always some arbitrary person that the show just pulled out of thin air with either no foreshadowing or so little of it that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference either way. Backstories for the criminals are so token and predictable that you\u2019d only need thirty seconds to explain it. Detective Conan-style. And yet for some reason, the show decides to devote entire half-hours trying to make me sympathize with these morons.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the Twenty Faces arc concludes is pretty much a combination of all the problems I listed above with another one added, and that problem is the feminine main character. Up until that point, he\u2019s always been an audience cipher that no audience member can relate to, but he was in the background so I let it slide. But the final few episodes put him at center stage for the crucial part of Twenty Faces\u2019 grand plan and his emotionless accepting reactions become impossible to ignore to the point that he might as well have been wearing a yellow T-shirt that said \u201cI am an obvious plot device\u201d in big black letters. It wasn\u2019t until the final few minutes that ended on him that I realized he was basically a walking metaphor for the show: a small lifeless pile of gimmicks who hangs around with the big boys just because he can. And if he died, no one but sad geeky losers would give a shit.\\n\\n\r\nSo on the whole, I can\u2019t really say I recommend Ranpo, even if you\u2019re a die-hard noitamina fan. It\u2019s badly written and it\u2019s hard to even pay attention to the writing at times because there\u2019s a high chance the visuals will put you to sleep beforehand. Some people may say Kishi\u2019s style is still fresh and interesting even if it\u2019s not being good, but I say that gimmicks are gimmicks.  It was gimmicky back when Shaft first used it over a decade ago, and it\u2019s godawful now.",

            "content": "This is an odd noitaminA series celebrating the temporary entry of Edogawa Rampo's work into the public domain. (@$%# TPP rubbish)  The series isn't a whodunnit, but resides firmly on the crime story or borderline horror end of the mystery genre. Rampo, like his namesake, frequently wrote about horrific things so this isn't an inappropriate focus. His work has been turned into a horror anthology film (Rampo Noir), and the only readily available English translation of his work for a while was the inclusion of \"The Human Chair\" in the My Favorite Horror Story anthology. The series probably shouldn't have been billed as amystery for western audiences, but that has little to do with the work's quality itself. \\n\\n\r\nStory: I've seen a lot of complaints about tone shifts, but have watched enough live action Japanese movies not to be put off by it. Fits in well with stuff like Tokyo Gore Police, Stacy and Tokyo Zombie. So it might appeal to fans of those. Like me. \\n\\n\r\nSpends a few episodes working up to the main plot, which is well used to develop the characters. The structure is odd, but that's to be expected when you're adapting favored short works and novels from a large canon as a single season anime. Imagine what a Sherlock Holmes anime doing the same would be like and you might get an idea of the overalll story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style can take some getting used to. Highly stylized overall. Frequent use of marionette imagery, words, etc in the artwork for thematic purposes. Pretty high quality throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  OP and ED are two of the better ones for the season. Sound is used effectively thoughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Kobayashi has never found anything fun or interesting, until he becomes a murder suspect in episode 1. Which he outright admits is the most fun he's ever had.  He's a bit ghoulish, but well intentioned. I think he's one of the more interesting protagonists I've seen lately. \\n\\n\r\nAkechi was originally a Sherlock Holmes expy, and that's still in force here. He usually knows the answer within minutes, and lets things play out for his own inscrutable reasons. If you dislike that type of character, he won't be changing your mind. \\n\\n\r\n Hashiba, Kobayashi's best friend and possible love interest,  spends most of the series as the only sane man.  He also tries to save Kobayashi from Kobayashi a lot of the time. The three have a pretty neat dynamic together, and I enjoyed the focus on them.\\n\\n\r\nRecurring and secondary characters are a strength of the show. It's a pretty odd collection as you might imagine. Hard to go into without spoilers, but there are a lot of fully realized characters who could carry a story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:  Ranpo Kitan deals with some pretty heady themes: the morality of vigilantism vs law, Japanese laws on mentally ill criminals, and even determinism vs free will. It manages to do it without coming across as pretentious which is hard. Overall it was a pretty fun mix of action and characterization.   The series is sort of the mutant freak baby of Yoshihiro Nishimura and Edogawa Rampo.  Which is cool in its own way. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the odd collection of characters and will miss seeing more of them.",

            "content": "Another anime ruined be its ending. I am very picky, even small things can ruin my mood. This ending definitely ruined the enjoyment for me. Was expecting an ending more like the one in fight club and not a wimpy nonsensical melodramatic wannabe happy one.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in a way is the embodiment of a shapeshifter transposed into the plot of a series. Interesting in itself, but as a result it's creepy and unenjoyable.\r\nSo it first starts of as a nice mystery anime, with murder solving elements, although a bit awkwardly exaggerated it was still great and from the first episode on i only expected itto be a mix of horror and detective crime solving anime. Would have been truly awesome.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the 2nd or 3rd episode, not sure which, starts a bit comical with a guy wearing a bag over his head. I thought it sure adds a bit more excitement to the anime, even if it's not what i had expected it's deviating from a monotonous linear genre driven story. Unfortunately that line deviating from horror/crime solving towards comedy runs all over the place. It makes you wonder if the author threw a dice to see what genre it should intersect next.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there on it swings even more chaotically. Unfortunately the ending crash lands the plot into a dumpster with the most putrid, rancid and nausea inducing pile of decaying matter you could imagine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSure the mc being a cross dresser was funny, especially since he was so excited about it. His friend showing strange feeling towards him was odd but intended to be comical.\\n\\n\r\nAekichi seemed to be rather odd. At first he is supposedly the genius detective, always invoking cold thinking and a cold heart too. He can solve about any crime effortlessly and emotionally detached, not really caring about who dies or lives, but just about solving crimes for fun. By the end of the show however he pulls a 180 and becomes an hyper emotional slut that wants to save the world and his best childhood buddy.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the characters and their actions don't make sense. Those that do make sense are a bit shallow.\\n\\n\r\nWish they would explain Aekichi's girlfriend who sits behind bars. Why is she tied up with strings and why are her ogres escaping later on, or how are the even escaping. Nasty plot hole, seriously.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI liked the art a lot. If it weren't for the blanked out characters it would have been perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\neh? not sure what to say about it, the OP/ED theme was crap\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did find the anime interesting enough to watch it in one go, but seeing it intentionally sabotaged and destroyed like a plane flown into a skyscraper, it only left me irritated at the end. Yes, it was exactly that depressing. The only thing missing to completely ruin the enjoyment is to have the creator jump from a building and live streaming the event ...\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a clear picture of this anime, then imagine drawing a line from point A to point B. Before getting to point B you will move your pen in all directions as chaotically as possible and then only reach point B. That is exactly how this anime is in it's entirety.",

            "content": "A lot of people are hating on this show, but I thought it was good- not super amazing, but not as bad as the other reviews make it sound.\r\nStory 7/10- Although this show is \"mystery\", I do understand how people would get annoyed at how the cases just get solved, and they don't explain how. At first, the story has a bunch of different cases, but near the end, it kind of takes a break from that and focuses on a main conflict. I didn't really mind, since I've watched Detective Conan and don't need another episodic mystery anime (especially since Ranpo Kitan wouldn't beable to match up, sorry). I thought the anime got better near the end, but also kind of more confusing. Oh well, I've seen worse for sure, and the story was fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10- Art was pretty nice to look at, you could tell there wasn't a lot of motion involved, but it was disguised well. There was some cool lighting and shadow going on in certain scenes. Character designs were appealing, and I don't have any complaints here. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10- Average. None of the songs were very memorable, but I did like the ED a lot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10- I'm just gonna talk about the three main characters, and leave out some others to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n Kobayashi is supposed to be a \"quirky\" character because he literally isn't shocked or afraid of anything and his default emotion is to be happy at all times. It kind of works, because instead of typical \"wow that's so horrible\" reactions, he gets over things quickly. It also adds an element of creepiness because it's unnatural for a kid to act the way he does. He's also kind of a trap since he looks like a girl.\\n\\n\r\nAkechi is an ok character. He doesn't really do that much and spends his time acting cool. The writers gave him a weird quirk- he constantly has a headache and is seen crushing aspirin and drinking coffee the majority of his screen time. \\n\\n\r\nHashiba (Kobayashi's friend) is the straight man of this show. He reacts when Kobayashi doesn't, and has a lot of clich\u00e9 shouty lines. He also likes (loves?) Kobayashi a lot. I guess he's ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fine, but most of the reason why I gave this section a 7 is because Kobayashi is a pretty unique character and that makes this show not a copy paste of common stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show wasn't a waste of time, and in my opinion isn't as bad as everyone says. So, this is kind of a different opinion arguing more of the good stuff this show does.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "As I normally do, I will have spoilers as you can't really explain how good/bad the story flows without actually explaining/telling parts of the story. So don't read if you don't want to get spoiled.\r\nStory: 1\r\nFor an 11 ep series, it sure took its time to get to the main story: the Twenty Faces identity. The first few eps are largely character introductions, showing how inadequate the police force is, how great Akechi is and how unjust the justice system is. It dragged on needlessly as it could have easily been condensed within two episodes; maybe even one. And even when Twenty Faces was introducedit dragged on quite a bit with continuous side missions/mysteries. \\n\\n\r\nThe highlight was when the origin of Twenty Faces was revealed and that was when it became interesting. Unfortunately the writers probably have little to no experience regarding the philosophical/mathematical concepts they throw out, like 'Laplace Demon', 'Chaos Theory' as they mentioned how they were both similar; except a quick wiki search will show you that Chaos Theory is a counter to Laplace's demon.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing... the ability for Twenty Face to affect people is largely excused with \"people are angry\" combined with the pseudo-intellectual application of \"Butterfly Effect\". \\n\r\nNow, you might be thinking that I'm harsh and that I should have a suspension of disbelief. Sure, let's try that for a moment and believe that everything works.\\n\r\nSo as the climax, the antagonist then kills himself/disappears to complete his formula to make Twenty Face realised/complete. And the aftermath is that Twenty Faces appear more, then... they're forgotten... ??? All this is explained within the last few mins of the episode. It's as though the concept of Twenty Faces went back to square one and that the formula suddenly stopped working.\\n\\n\r\nSo the entire series was basically four episodes long that contradicts itself and ends up having essentially no effect as the concept of Twenty Faces pre-dates the story's timeline. \\n\\n\r\nPS: There was even, what I consider, a filler episode (ep 6), in that nothing happens that advances the actual story. It is literally a side mission/mystery that's presented and solved in one episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI liked the ending song and the piano insert song (look up Ranpo Laplace Dream on youtube and have a listen). Voice acting was pretty standard, I didn't feel like I felt attached to any particular character's voice selection. Overall, very average/standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art isn't particularly bad, though the colours are a bit all over the place which reminds me of the *monogatari series. Though I feel that they share some kind of artistic overlap, in this series' case, it's not done as well as the *monogatari series and really just feels random.\\n\r\nCharacter designs are your more typical modern anime types in that their eyes don't take up half their face and hairstyles are more refined.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nAkechi - Of all the three main characters, it feels like Akechi is the only one whose impact is actually felt outside of plot devices from the other two. He solves everything, fights everything and is basically the get-out-of-jail card that's used every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi - He is basically the plot device to bring the camera to the villain (of the episode) so we can get some expository dialogue about the situation, then have Akechi come in and solve it. \\n\\n\r\nHashiba - His character feels completely out of place with the overall mood and story. His yaoi tendency serves no purpose towards the story nor does it even have any humourous impact.  He's basically the incarnation of the concept of 'devil's advocate', except in a really annoying manner and without effect.\\n\\n\r\nSupports - When we find out that some of the recurring characters turned out to be part of Twenty Faces, their impact towards the story just feels like the writer was trying to pull a 'bet you didn't expect that' card. But since their purpose basically fades away instantly, you end up not really caring too much about it in the end. \\n\r\n- Black Lizard had literally no purpose other than perhaps providing some fan service which also applies Hanabishi who is a 'moe', loli looking school teacher introduced for the sake of more fanservice (probably).\\n\\n\r\nNakimoshi - The only one who's remotely interesting but is quickly off'd as the series had to come to a conclusion. Basically a bullied guy who has a 'notice me senpai' complex who looks for affection from Akechi and took his disapproval as rejection which led him to Twenty Faces\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nI really dislike episodic series if they're trying to have an overall story. Stuff that's a slice of life like Non non Biyori works fine because of its nature, but when something has an overall story but takes almost 6/11 to get to it, then there's a problem with the writing. A large portion of character interaction is bland and has no development and the mysteries aren't even that enjoyable as they're resolved too fast with little complexity. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\r\nI would not recommend this series",

Aside from that, there were a few episodes which were so cliche that they were utterly predictable. \r\nArt - 1/10\r\nAnimation seemed really lazy for this anime.

Nothing from the OST really stood out either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really one-dimensional in this series and they utterly failed when it comes to character development.

            "content": "I write this review with gladness and joy knowing that the Lerche A team was working on worthwhile projects like Assassination Classroom and MonMusu while the Lerche B team was indulging themselves on dollar store mystery novels and power fantasies when they decided to, for some reason, combine the two and animate it. I am willing to say that Seiji Kishi probably just glanced over at Ranpo Kitan's script and waved it off while looking at more worthwhile projects, while the writers took that as a go-ahead and told the animators to get to work. But nonetheless, here we are, with a mystery show thatholds an extraordinary ratio of \"piss you off\" in contrast to mystery. Ranpo Kitan is a disgrace to Ranpo Edogawa's work, and if you are thinking of watching this show because you are genuinely curious, I beg of you, the cat may have come back after satisfying its curiosity, but it remained mentally scarred of the horrors it witnessed as a result.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that Ranpo Kitan's story had in common with a regular story, is that I felt a sense of exhilaration when I finished it. This exhilaration is, of course, less because of excitement that I finished a story, but more because of gratitude that I finished this story. The plot is paper-thin, with the script writers probably just looking up \"really really cruel deaths\" on Google and thinking of a real life situation where that could happen. They then had to think of some extremely weird and convoluted way that those deaths would happen, while the main characters are somehow so enlightened in the art of investigation that they can come to a logical conclusion through threads of evidence that don't even tie together. Why this show even bothers trying to be all mysterious is the mystery element, as after the second episode, the ending is usually right in front of the viewer's face as the genius detectives do it again! By somehow tapping into the element of luck itself and hope that their theory, based off of nothing other than logical fallacies and insufficient evidence, works out in the end, which usually results in a confession from the murderer. It's like clockwork, if the clockwork squeaked really loudly and should probably get fixed since it gets more and more annoying at time goes on. The only reason this section is not a 2 or 3 is because of episode 4, but more on that in the Character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI really do wonder if the character designers are full of people who unironically say \"the dick makes it better\" when mentioning feminine-looking characters, because that is the main character. Yoshio Kobayashi looks like someone you pull out of a trap doujin and stick clothes on him. And if that's not enough, he apparently has a fetish for crossdressing, so there's an abundant amount of scenes where you have this \"boy\" dressed up in a frilly dress, with an abundant amount of ass shots for some odd reason. Other than this very glaring detail, the art style is nothing impressive, but nothing lackluster. The opening is the only part where I can see any kind of artistic freedom being taken, as the animated characters are interposed between real-life movies. The bondage play in the opening is also well-designed and well-drawn. It also says something about the show when the opening is the best animated out of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI will admit that the opening is the only reason why sound is rated so high, as amazarashi is a personal favorite and I wish they would do more openings and endings for different shows. Other than that, there's nothing really impressive about the soundtrack, and nothing stands out or misses its mark. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan is probably one of the only shows I've watched that I wanted the villain to win just to see the MCs die horribly painful deaths because the sheer amount of annoyance and anger that I feel because of them. We have Kogorou Akechi, the boy genius detective who can solve any crime by bullshitting a route of thought and twisting reality so that that route of thought is exactly how the villain thinks, and the villain gets caught. He is apparently so smart, that he doesn't even view other people as humans, but mere shadows on the horizon, uninteresting and bland (quite the parallel to this show). And by Kogorou Akechi I meant Yoshio Kobayashi, since they're literally the same character, except Yoshio is trap bait. In comes Souji Hashiba, the closet homosexual who knows that his best friend is a guy, but is still attracted to his overly-feminine body. But is liking traps really gay? That's a discussion for another time. And so goes the list of characters that I can't remember the names of because they were so generic that I shuffled them into the crowd of people that don't matter. At least one notable exception to these pathetic attempts at character creation is Tokiko Kagami, Keisuke Kagami's little sister. True to her archetype, she is innocent, kind, sweet, caring, and everything you would hope for in a bright and cheerful college-bound girl. When I saw her in episode 4, I immediately felt refreshed, as she, even being a generic archetypal character, is like the first flower blossoming after harsh and snowy winter. I also immediately knew where this episode was going, but that's besides the point. Overall, character is the least qualified category in Ranpo Kitan, although I do realize that that may not mean much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nThe lack of intelligent character design, the lack of intelligent investigation, the prevalence of the Marty Stu, and the lack of mystery in a mystery show makes Ranpo Kitan one of the worst ideas to come out of the otherwise decent studio of Lerche. Uninspired and sometimes downright disgusting character design kills any hope of redemption that the show may have from crawling out of its pit of overused archetypes and overpowered MCs. The only thing that saved this show from being a 4/10 is the existence of episode 4, where the show actually made me feel emotions besides mild annoyance and general distaste. If you are still interested to see what possible good can come of this show, just watch a portion of episode 3 and then episode 4. Trust me. It's as good as its gonna get here, so just sit back and eat your anime-watching snacks with a look of slight disgust on your face as you realize that perhaps the show is ruining the snacks this time, instead of the other way around.",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan: Game Of Laplace was created to commemorate the passing of the famous Japanese author, Edogawa Rampo. And just as his literature was, Game of Laplace is dark, twisted, and all over the place. The weird thing though, is that it's all done with a smile. All of these grotesque scenarios like: Child abduction, self-mutilation, murder...they're all presented lightheartedly as if they were no big deal whatsoever. And if that sounds weird to you now, you don't even know the half of it. Ranpo Kitan is one of the most creative shows I have seen in quite a long time. However, it has comeunder fire as of late by many viewers who see it as \"Too sporadic and odd to provide a positive watching experience\". That isn't a direct quote, but I feel like I paraphrased a good portion of the community pretty well. Regardless, this is definitely not something you have seen before.\\n\\n\r\nDirected by Seiji Kishi (Angel Beats/Persona 4: The Animation) and animated by the lesser-known studio Lerche, Ranpo Kitan comes off as abstract, while still bringing forth and even satirizing a good number of typical anime tropes. The story follows a 12 year old girl....err, boy...named Yoshio Kobayashi. Being the suspect of a gruesome murder case involving his teacher, Kobayashi had to figure out a way to prove his innocence. Which, in turn, he did. This ultimately lead to him discovering an interest in detective work which would soon-after morph into him clinging on to the lead detective of the former case -- that being Kogorou Akechi. Akechi (Who is also a full-time coffee and drug addict) is reluctant in letting Kobayashi help, but eventually submits seeing as it would be even more annoying having him beg at his doorstep like a stray cat for 24 hours a day.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, these two (As well as Kobayashi's friend, Hashiba) start going out and solving various cases too intense for regular police to handle. Whether it be a fat guy who steals little girls and buries them in his walls, a guy with a bag on his head that can somehow disguise himself as any other person, or that same guy that continues to steal little girls despite being told not to. The crimes are few in numbers and extremely weird, but there is a sense of unspoken realism to them not commonly touched in anime. Ranpo Kitan, if anything, isn't afraid to be ambitious and depict events that most studios wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. And it only gets more in-your-face as the story goes on. The downside, if you can even call it that, is that it winds up getting more confusing as a result. But at least a concrete story line is picked up once Twenty Faces emerges around halfway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the show becomes less focused on shock value and instead shifts its focus toward a deeper meaning -- the difference between right and wrong and the flaws of the typical justice system. In this anime, and even in a lot of real-life cases, criminals receive reduced sentences for pleading their mental instability. This eventually turns into them being able to roam the streets and repeat their offenses, hurting even more people. Twenty Faces is a vigilante who only kills those people. So now we have to ask ourselves if what Twenty Faces is doing is actually justice or not. Yes, it's illegal and even immoral, but should Akechi be going out of his way to catch him instead of the same people that Twenty Faces is targeting? I mean, he must be doing something right if half of the city has started to follow in his footsteps and even worship him on some levels. Twenty Faces becomes more of an ideal than a single person. If one is caught, two appear in his place. If those are caught, even more show up. The vigilante justice increases and increases until it eventually escalates way too far and the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, are at stake.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan is a lot different from how it appears on paper. It isn't your typical \"Detectives doing detective stuff and catching bad guys\" story. It's more of an audiovisual collage that blends lighthearted anime tropes with the darker side of the real world. It's the subtlety of the characters morbid tendencies that is more than just disturbing -- it's real. The school teacher has scars covering her wrists, but does her best to keep a smile on her face. Shadow-Man stalks children in order to \"Protect\" them. Akechi is an obsessed drug addict who has dedicated thousands of hours to proving that he is right. And everyone else is blacked out. Literally. The characters that don't matter are just shadows and wooden figures, implying that they are all the same, interchangeable creatures. The show is well-aware that it isn't a typical detective anime, and that's okay. In fact, it's even better.\\n\\n\r\nCreativity is the first thing I look for in any form of art, anime is no exception. Ranpo Kitan is absolutely beaming with it. No, its bleeding with it. This shows emanates the darkest sectors of reality and presents them as if they were normal. Because the truth is, they have become normal. The world isn't all smiles, Pocky, and brightly-colored haircuts. There are forces out there beyond our control -- subtle miseries, that we are afraid to acknowledge. This anime takes those fears and disintegrates them, leaving us with a product that can be confusing to some, but memorable and important to others. It might not be for everyone, but I honestly feel like Ranpo Kitan is one of the deepest, most under-looked shows out there.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan is not for everyone. If you are looking for a detective anime or a murder-mystery, look elsewhere. If approached with a clear state of mind and no specific expectations, Ranpo Kitan could wind up as something extremely thought-provoking and important. By no means is this show for anime-beginners. Instead, I would recommend it to seasoned viewers looking for a show that will break away from the norms that have grown to shape the anime industry. It may just be the single most creative thing I've watched this year. That alone can't possibly be a bad thing.",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan is often considered to be one of the worst anime of 2015, though being a completionist I nevertheless decided to give it a shot. Did it lead up to it's infamy? You bet. But why is that the case? Well, that's what this review is for. \r\nThe series is based off the novels of historical mystery writer Ranpo Edogawa, and this series was dedicated to him. Needless to say it wasn't EXACTLY the best dedication in the world, but enough jibber-jabber.\r\nThe show follows Kobayashi, a kid who pairs up with a classmate from his school and a famous detective named Akechi. Now, Ranpo'sstory line is messy to say the least. The show starts out episodic, but then dwells on the mystery of a figure named 20 Faces. The problem with the 20 Faces plot is that its pretty predictable. Once you see a certain theory that appears in the show, the culprit of the 20 Faces crimes is pretty easy to figure out. The other major problem with this show is that it relies too much on shock factor to get chills out of the viewers. We got a pedophile who turns disobeying children into wall paper art, a school teacher who turns people into chairs, a masochist who tortures people and pees herself constantly etc. These are too over the top to be taken seriously yet too disgusting to be taken comedically. It just fails to add up. One thing Ranpo IS good at though is info dumping. Some of the stronger episodes were those that dwelled on the backstories of certain characters. Too bad a lot of these are pretty damn clich\u00e9d and melodramatic. And a lot of the time the show isn't even good at being a mystery due to lack of any intrigue whatsoever and some episodes can barely be classed a mysterious in nature. The ending is pretty poor as well, leaving a sour note on a show that was already sour to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters. Well, the characters are mostly one-note and not even enjoyable to watch. There's Kobayashi, a bishounen who thinks everything is fun and is constantly confused for a girl. Doesn't help when they try and lure in the pedophile by making Kobayashi crossdress. My main beef with him is that his overly happy persona gets grating after a while and he solves pretty much all the cases even though he's basically the Watson of this story. Hashiba is pretty much pointless and is only there as either sub-par comic relief or to serve as yaoi bait, there's not much too him. Then there's Akechi. Now, I normally am fine with characters like him (cold-hearted and emotionless), but the problem is that he's so freaking lazy. He can never get a case solved on his own, and for someone who's a professional detective that's pretty pathetic. The rest of the characters aren't too notable. They either only serve as shock factor or have good ideas but very poor execution, though there were some I actually kind of liked (in particular, the nekomimi school teacher actually made me laugh intentionally).\\n\\n\r\nTo end things out on a lighter note, Ranpo actually looks pretty solid. Its dark and grim settings along with the way the flashback and info dumping scenes change in style is handled wonderfully. The soundtrack is good too. The OP and ED songs are great listens on their own, and while the songs in the show aren't too memorable, they fit the mood. There's this one English song that plays in nearly every episode that does get a bit grating after a while, but the song it self isn't that bad. However, good production values don't equal a good show, and Ranpo is a big example of that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ranpo Kitan is a show that fails both as a mystery and as a horror anime, due to its ludicrously over the top situations, uninteresting characters, and predictable mysteries in general. Something I do give Ranpo credit for is that its presented pretty well and that it at least never failed to amuse me. But that doesn't mean its a good show. Far from it. Several anime does its elements a lot better, and Ranpo doesn't really have much to set it apart other than human chairs and urinating masochists. I don't recommend it what so ever unless you purposefully want to watch a sloppily written show. That or you just like blood and guts with nothing much else to it. Either way works.",

            "content": "By the looks of it, it seemed Rampo Kitan was trying to be a sort of modern telling of story concepts taken from the mystery novels of famous Japanese writer Ranpo Edogawa. This very story gimmick can possibly prove to be a major barrier for many Western anime fans since not too many of Edogawa's works are accessible in English and this series is dependent on its viewers having knowledge of characters and story elements from the mystery writer's work to understand the symbolic elements of its storytelling. I'll admit even I was a bit lost with many of the Edogawa references as my onlyexposure to the man's work is the gentleman thief Twenty Faces.\\n\\n\r\nBut setting this issue aside, Rampo Kitan is focused on teen detective Akechi and two middle school boys who assist him in trying to solve a mysterious string of murders connected to a vigilante named Twenty Faces, this being an obvious nod to the rivalry between detective Akechi and Twenty Faces from Edogawa's works. It looked like the series was attempting to be symbolic with exploring society's ills and the oppressed lashing out against them by tying it in with whatever themes and story elements are within Edogawa's works. The execution of this is a bit hit-or-miss. It does have its moments of effective storytelling such as a rather tragic exploration of the murderer from one case tackled by Akechi in the middle of the series to show how far society's ills could break someone mentally trying to do the right thing for others. The style in which the cases are explored at a number of points is also quite creative as Ranpo Kitan goes for a theatrical-style presentation with showcasing elements of its cases, character back stories, and themes that helps enhance the story mood at key points and also serves as some effective symbolism at points to show the disconnection that Akechi and some other characters can have with perceiving others. Plus, the middle comedy episode in the series serving as a buffer between the show's first and second half was quite humorous for me with its absurdity and is worth a look if you enjoy comedy.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond these positives though, Rampo Kitan's very premise carries some major issues outside of the mentioned accessibility of the series. A number of the major characters in the series didn't feel like characters to a good degree as they felt more like shells to carry along the major elements of the series that it attempted to push, this being quite noticeable with the middle school boys that accompany Akechi on his cases. The motives of a number of the criminals and the supposed wrongs that society pushed a number of them into felt either absurd or a bit too nihilistic with pushing the anime's themes or attempting to twist character and story elements from Edogawa's novels. A few of the characters in particular, Black Lizard and Shadow Man, felt a bit out of place with Rampo Kitan's attempts to be a dark and serious look into mystery and elements of the human condition with how over-the-top their characters came across.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose my thoughts on Rampo Kitan are a bit mixed. While I applaud it for trying to be different with its creativity and incorporating elements of Ranpo Edogawa's stories for this mystery series, the execution of this is quite hit-or-miss and there is the obvious issue of many of its story elements flying over the heads of many Western viewers unfamiliar with Edogawa's literary work. I suppose whatever enjoyment you may get out of this series will depend greatly on how read up you are on Edogawa and his novels.",

            "content": "So first a disclaimer. I really wanted to like this show, hence my rating is probably a bit higher than it actually should be.  It takes/has a lot of elements from (in my opinion) two of the greatest crime shows to ever exist. Hannibal and Psycho-Pass. The first half of the show (and the style throughout) leaning more towards Hannibal, and the second half being very Psycho-Pass-esque with elements of the plot as well as the feel. So you may ask yourself, with emulation of such great works, how could they screw it up so bad?\r\nFirst lets get the good parts out of theway. Unfortunately... It won't take long. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 The sound is great. Nothing mind breaking, but definitely memorable. The music all fit enough to set emotional tones during scenes, it never felt too out of place. Will definitely listen to a few of them again. The opening and closing where both very artistically pleasing, and the music was great and fit the tone of the show. When I still had high hopes for the show, they were definitely something I looked forward to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 The art style reminds me of Danganronpa, the animation is pretty smooth. What stood out to me, was the stylistic choices, which really made me want to like this show. I'll have to bring up the comparison to Hannibal here. Many of the murders that take place throughout the show (and in Hannibal as well) are framed to look artistic, or the victim was actually made into something to resemble art, or their death was a retribution for a crime they committed. The first killer, for example, makes their victim into a human chair. Its grotesque, a bit over the top, but it fits the tone of the show. The art really shines here, genuinely making something you'd see in a rather twisted art show out of the carnage.  Additionally, there are artistic representations of the characters thought processes, which I always enjoy in an anime, as well as moments where we are shown different characters' perceptions of the world (i.e. characters that feel isolated, like they don't fit in, see others as things rather than people). I would love to have seen how the animators could have used this style with a show that had a better script. Alas... \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10 The characters... It's really a matter of opinion here I guess, a lot of cliche characters. Regardless, nothing outstanding or memorable. The main character is supposed to be this borderline naive, apathetic individual (a comparison could be made to Gon of HxH , but don't expect any character development, depth, or growth here). Who is also a guy... but looks incredibly like a girl. To the point multiple characters get embarrassed or infatuated with him when he acts like a girl (YES ITS A TRAP). Its out of place a bit in the show at first, till we meet the rest of the cast of rather zany characters, almost as if to say \"hey if you thought that was weird check this out\". His sidekick/voice of reason is normal anime protagonist #4. Hes just as bland, wants to protect his friends, blah blah. He just kind of exists to say how bad an idea everything is. You know the type. The detective, Akechi, who this show centers around is sort of more interesting, at face value anyway. Think of a young Kogami from Psycho-Pass. He can fight, hes distant, he is a super genius... But wait there's more! Oh wait, no there isn't. Like I said, expect 0 depth. There is also a master thief who can disguise himself as anyone. Wow... what a surprise. I ended up liking him the most out of all the characters besides the superintendent of the police. There is also some lady who can control the city from her prison cell. She's a sadist... except for when it comes to Akechi then shes a masochist who will do anything if he just talks down to her. No one stood out really, and only one or two characters got any real development. And at some points the characters could be downright annoying. \\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10 Now I'm usually very forgiving of attempts to be new and innovative with a story. As long as plot devices aren't extremely shallow, or used to beat me over the head (MCGUFFIN MCGUFFIN MCGUFFIN), I'm fairly forgiving. But this plot... Just no. The grand plot actually starts to move about halfway. Prior to this, I might have given the show a 7, as it was intriguing enough that I wanted to follow along to see what was in-store. Without spoiling too much, the author probably read a Wikipedia article on Laplace's demon, and doesn't really show any understanding of the concept beyond that. Basically in the show it comes down to \"with this I can influence all events, nothing more needs to be said, explained, or expanded upon\".  Without getting too deep into it, its sort of like someone is handed the key to the universe and infinite knowledge of the present and future. And what they do with it... its akin to then only using that key to unlock their front door after they forgot their keys. Its so uninspiring what they do with something so incredibly powerful, that no amount of domino or butterfly imagery can save it, though it sure doesn't stop them from trying (hmmm what do you thing that is a metaphor for? I wonder... WE GET IT BUTTERFLY EFFECT). All in all its a mess. Nothing pulled me in, it barely kept in a straight line. It tried to be deep by throwing out the concept of Laplace's demon, but then didn't explore it in any depth at all. Additionally there is a theme of punishing criminals that escape justice, but any message they were attempting to put forth was lost in the absurdity of which they presented it. The show basically showed almost every single criminal and serial killer being released back on the street for various reasons. Instead of criminals slipping through the cracks, it was more like you'd have to be a very unlucky criminal to face punishment at all. I assume the intent of this was to make you sympathize with certain views, but all it did was bring enough disbelief in that I couldn't suspend it. My last critique on the story (though I won't subtract any points for this) is that it seems to almost market itself as a mystery show, when in reality its more of a thriller. There isn't really any solving of the cases that the audience can go along with. Sad really, because I love the Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie style mysteries, that would have really won points for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10 Now after that rant, how can I give the show a 6/10 for enjoyment? Simple. It had a lot of cool stuff to look at, it sounded good, and if you shut your brain off completely it might even be a bit of fun. This is more of a personal rating. As I said, it resonated with me because it had a lot of shared elements with two shows I loved. So while objectively, this show is pretty bad, subjectively I sort of almost liked it. Sort of.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10 If you really like shows that are shallow and look pretty, you might really like this. I see people either hate this show or love it. I recommend you watch the first episode, then decide if its your cup of tea... albeit a partially steeped one at best. Also keep in mind that its all downhill from the first half.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free*\r\nSherlock once said \"I never guess. It is a shocking habit,\u2014destructive to the logical faculty\", a quote which any and every viewer of this particular anime should be able to relate... as Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace never will never provide you the time or opportunity to even begin guessing as to how a crime came to occur let alone guess who committed the deed. Unfortunately this mystery anime likely deserves to be tagged as a 'psychological' anime more than it does a mystery anime.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThis anime annoyed me immensely as I really, and I mean really wanted to like it far more thanI do after completing all 11 episodes. In all honesty each case had the potential to have so much depth and when combined with dark undertones in the art and sound I couldn't help but get a little excited.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, every ounce of suspense and my excitement would suddenly dissipate in each and every episode (note that this anime fits every case into singular episodes with exception to the last case). As quickly as I could find my self getting slightly excited I would find myself being spoon fed an extremely underwhelming 'answer' that had been put together by a slightly haphazard trio in mere seconds. And I use the term 'answer' over 'theory' because every word of their theories would hit the nail so hard on the head  that the culprit would just come out and admit everything on the spot without fail.\\n\\n\r\nIf it was that easy then why go as far to call it a mystery? Fortunately there is an under-lying plot regarding our prestigious but mundane detective Akechi and a person in his past, which links in well (credit where it's due) to almost every episode that may gain one's attention. But yet again there is hardly any sort of 'detective work' required and almost everything is spoon fed to the viewer. The only  beneficial compromise is that the viewer is then able to focus on questioning the morals of the scenario but even with that the entire scenario felt over inflated in terms of it's impact on the world and the people who inhabit it. I was told to expect a mystery anime not a psychology lesson.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & sound: 8/10\\n\r\nI place these two together as when combined they were probably the  saving graces of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED music for me are perhaps the best of this seasons anime's and for me the most original; the ED especially managed to send a small chill down my spin the first few times I heard it as both of these areas have dark undertones. Refreshingly, there are very few bright colourful parts to this anime as it is instead filled with deep, rich, dark colours and 'mischievous' music which help to create a nice tension and theme for a 'Game of Laplace'. This somehow well crafted theme is most likely what was able to keep me going through all 11 episodes without making a complaint.\\n\r\n(Note: As I would hope from modern standards, I did not notice any drops in quality of animation)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nThe focus is primarily on 3 young boys who if I'm really honest, regretfully do little more than bounce off of each-other and the support cast to help provide a little life to the anime. If one were to look hard enough they may find a shred of depth among them but you might need to enlist Sherlock's help for that. As a result I'm left with very little to describe them with.\\n\\n\r\n1st we have the young super genius, canned coffee drinking detective Akechi. I believe the 'anime' term that would best suit him is 'kuudere' (cold, blunt, cynical but might care slightly some-where with-in). However without providing spoilers and only having 11 over-filled episodes (1-case fitted into each 25min episode) there isn't much else to say unfortunately other than he does see a little bit of character development.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Kobayashi our bored gender trap (he's male) who finds murder cases and similar things fun. But unfortunately there is almost no attempt what-so-ever to help the viewer understand his unique character...\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally we have Hashiba who is perhaps the most rational character in this anime... except when it comes to Kobayashi as it would seem Hashiba is ensnared in the gender trap; this helps bring some humor to the anime but again, there isn't much else to say unfortunately.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: 5.5/10\\n\r\nI meant it when I wanted to like this anime, I really did. It brought a change of pace from the multi-coloured hair and everyone lives happily every after in a world full of big boobed girls anime that have come to swarm the anime industry in recent years. The art and music got me excited for a mystery or two with depth, and I might still download the OP and ED. BUT for me, with much remorse, Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace falls painfully short of the mark. All that was needed was to make it necessary for the characters to actually spend some time solving and struggle slightly with the cases..*sigh*-If only...\\n\\n",

            "content": "**Warning: I spoil the end of this abysmal show three paragraphs in**\r\nImagine that a movie gets to a chase scene, and at the exact moment the action hero turns on the ignition, there is an immediate cut to a theatre set. The action hero and villian, no longer in cars, are under spotlights, crouching, handling invisible steering wheels and chasing each other around the stage while a narrator fills in the gaps. This is, with minimal exaggeration, what watching Ranpo Kitan is like. It seems Studio Lerche, struggling with the workflow associated with three shows in a single season, decided to sacrifice the work andbudget put into at least one, and out of a gimmicky moe/horror hybrid (Gakkou Gurashi), pure filth (Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou), and a 50th anniversary tribute to a renowned mystery author, they decided to sacrifice the latter. Excrement, I mean excellent.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough turning the most difficult-to-animate scenes into theatre sets is certainly bad enough, Ranpo Kitan really outdoes itself to make the story and characters as shallow and unlike-able as possible. For a mystery show, there isn't much mystery, let alone suspense. If you haven't already figured out what's going on you will need to suspend your disbelief pretty hard. As soon as you get over a high school girl who literally wants to be mutilated by her teacher, you meet a man wearing a paper bag who can apparently disguise himself in a matter of seconds.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what of the main story? It's the most patently juvenile pile of bollocks. Apparently murderers and rapists and whatnot are being allowed to run free because of this horrible thing called the insanity defence. In real life this is meant to protect people with mental illnesses from pointless, inhumane punishment, but in the world of Ranpo Kitan apparently 50% of all the really bad criminals are being released in a matter of days and killing everyone. Sucks, right? Then, under the banner of a 'villian' called twenty faces, people decide to take matters into their own hands and kill the criminals, saving money and making up for the contrived incompetence of the injustice system. From this absurd scenario there is no reason to blame people from wanting to protect themselves, and it seems the scriptwriter realised this a bit too late. After 6 episodes of the heroes failing to morally challenge the situation [SPOILERS] Twenty Faces wins and the world becomes a better place. \\n\\n\r\nSo what about the characters? Well, we have Detective Akechi, who's only 17 years old and a detective and drinks black coffee and takes pills etc. Then there's the real main character (I think?) Kobayashi, who's personality is that he's a sociopath with no personality (he's not the only one) and looks like a girl (this is some revolutionary character development I tell you). Who else? We have Hashiba, Kobayashi's bff but really wishes Kobayashi were his bf. There is an imprisoned villian, Kuro Tokage, who pisses herself. Nearly every character in this show is expressly written to annoy the viewer, with the only pleasant characters existing to be savagely murdered or harmed.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, this is possibly the most pointless show I've ever watched. I've read the undercurrent of depraved fetishism and shock value in this show is actually a feature of Edogawa Ranpo's works, but in this case it sits very poorly with the lack of maturity in the script and artstyle. Well, next season Noitamina has another chance to do mystery right with Subete ga F ni Naru, so let's see if that will wash out the bad aftertaste of this abysmal series.",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan is the most confused anime I\u2019ve seen in recent memory, with so many ideas pulling it in different directions until it fails to satisfy anyone. Presented as a psychological horror detective-show, it has far too little of each of these three elements to merit the title.\r\nIn terms of production-value the show has proper animation-quality and music, the opening and ending themes being particularly superb. One upside to the directing is how the show dramatizes certain scenes. With many other adaptations based on books, you can sometimes see awkward pauses where there is obviously supposed to be internal monologues. Ranpo Kitan gets around thispet peeve of mine by creating theatre-stages that represent the characters\u2019 internal thoughts, a welcome bit of inspiration. The choice for the designs are however jarring, with mixes of cartoony and edgy scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAs a mystery-series it falls flat on its face due to showing too little detective-work, on the contrary it dumps exposition that instantly solves each case in the viewer's lap. On more than one occasion, the mystery will be solved in a rush and the murderer will turn out to be a complete stranger that was never part of the story until that point. This makes it all the harder to make a single guess on your own, hindering immersion.\\n\\n\r\nAs a horror-story it has a few redeeming qualities, though few and far in between. While the twisted and dark backdrop exists to give the show a pretty Halloween-wrapping, the presentation is far too cartoonish to provide any real tension or scares. The only area Ranpo Kitan excels in would be its attempts to disgust and shock the audience, turning itself into a freak-show of characters that are meant to entrance and fascinate in how strange they are. \\n\\n\r\nCredit where credit is due, a few side-characters do become fascinating to follow. The problem arises when the majority of the cast act like aliens that contradict every social norm and logical thought-process. The main character is detached and bored with regular life, to the point that seeing horrible things will make him feel happy and alive, which is another trait that makes it hard to take anything that happens seriously. While I personally am not against stark tonal-shifts, you need sympathetic characters that you want to follow through the madness in such cases. In Ranpo Kitan's case the characters just add to the confusion on what the show is actually trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nI could only recommend this to people interested in seeing a trainwreck, as it can be entertaining in that regard. Overall Ranpo Kitan ends up being an annoying and rushed kind of bad, showing potential in some moments but ultimately dropping the ball.",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan is a mystery show homaging the biggest influence on the Japanese mystery scene: Edogawa Ranpo. Ranpo Kitan doesn't just adapt his works, instead it blends the themes, narratives, and characters from many of his works. Unlike more orthodox mystery shows, Ranpo Kitan isn't about solving the mystery of a crime. The who, how, and why dunnits are unimportant and given little focus. Instead Ranpo Kitan asks 'what'. What is this crime scene presenting to us? Its gore and horrifying violence aren't just shocking images. They're artistic pieces created as a response to troubles of society. But are the troubles of society as seenby an early 20th century man still relevant a century later?\\n\\n\r\nOur primary protagonist of Ranpo Kitan is Kobayashi. Kobayashi is a young child who is dragged into solving a series of serial killings after he is framed for the murder of his teacher. Kobayashi is an interesting protagonist, in the ways he opposes the other, far more Sherlockian, detectives we follow.  We are shown Kobayashi's world view through the show's very controlled aesthetic. It depicts all unimportant characters as empty silhouettes,  or as mannequins.  By 'unimportant' I am not talking about unimportant to the plot, mystery, or narrative of the show. These characters are unimportant to Kobayashi (Or whoever's viewpoint we're following at that moment). Kobayashi only seems interested in the broken, rotten, and perverse aspects of the world. His classmates, teachers, and even police officers are all blank until they do something to interest him. Things like having scars hidden on their wrists. Talking about new parts of the serial murders. Or by having unique capabilities such as Akechi being above the law. Kobayashi's twisted outlook is something Ranpo Kitan makes explicit from the very start. It is this twisted nature that is the main focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis visual story telling is what Ranpo Kitan is best at. Rather than aiming for realism, Ranpo Kitan depicts dialogue and exposition through fantastical 'stages'.  These stages have a variety of different styles and designs, reflecting the character who's mindset they are depicting. Sometimes, they have bubbly and happy music and dialogue. Even though this happiness is often clashing with exposition of how the victim died, and the dark empty visuals. Sometimes they show us the crime scene. At which point the stage is full of grotesque, gaudy and rich colours. Off putting not in a gorey fashion, but in a more disconcerting fashion all together.  This enables Ranpo Kitan to address more intimate issues than it otherwise could through a more traditional depiction.\\n\\n\r\n The crimes in Ranpo Kitan are reactionary crimes. The culprits have all been intimately wronged by the victim, and society cannot or will not help them. These crimes thread together an overarching narrative of a war against the parts of society that allow these wrongs to exist. This corruption is unfortunately of an aged, privellaged, and surreal type. Such as the police being unable to punish people due to abuse of mental health laws. If someone pleads insanity, they 'get away' with murder so to speak. Women having sex, or homosexuals are sexual perversions. \\n\\n\r\nThese corruptions in a modern setting are all very reactionary ones that are fighting against the changes in society. However,  these reactionary responses are where our protagonists quirks stand out. Our protagonists are not straight, able people. They are queer in many aspects and a variety of ways, even if the show rarely treats women well at all. Many parallels are drawn between them and our culprits. Be it in how similar their ideals are, their queer gender and sexualities, or in just being neurodivergent. Our protagonists are often the very thing the crimes are lashing out against. Yet, not once are our protagonists treated as being wrong. The narrative is firmly on the side of Kobayashi and his friends, even when the various arcs would suggest otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThis confusion over what Ranpo Kitan is trying to say is not a small thing.  For one thing, it brushes over pedophillic grooming as a love story. Only demonising it later on when kidnapping is involved. When one arc is great another is often terrible. Even when the actual storytelling methods are just as phenomenal in both.  Sometimes the show is addressing and exploring real relevant horrors that are present in modern society. Sometimes its exploration is just another story scared of people who are always used as scapegoats for real issues. Its aesthetic carried it through its weaker moments for me, but that may not be the case for everyone. As no matter how stellar its style and tone is, it is rare the content of the arcs lives up to similar standards.",

And maybe it's contained spoiler(s), so be careful.\r\nStory : 8/10 \r\nRanpo Kitan : Game of Laplace is an anime about a certain girlish boy named Kobayashi who bored about his daily life, until someday he becomes a culprit for the murder of his teacher. Because of that, he feels amused and want to solve the case with Kogoro Akechi, a high-schooler Detective that handle his case. (\"Kogoro\" and \"High-schooler Detective\" huh? Feels like had heard it before)\r\nAfter the case solved, Kobayashi joined Akechias his Assisstant Detective, with his best friend Hashiba.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is a little bit complex, but it is good and stable enough. The way the scenes show up is always feels dark and mysterius. The background characters, too, only sometimes looks normally. But don't be confused. How the scenes shown is how the caharacters tought about it. Almost 65% (maybe more, maybe less) of this anime is inside their tought.\\n\\n\r\nThe way how the background characters is drawn is not because the staffs too lazy to draw it (LOL), it's depend on each character's perspective. For example, Kobayashi see them as plain colors, Akechi see them as wooden models, and 20-faces see them as bones and skulls. (Makes you remember them easier right?)\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound was great! Opening and Ending was so catchy (a litte bit gloomy and mysterious though). And there's a great, perfect backsound on some important scenes (it forces me to cry little. Only a little).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are full of unique peoples. As example, Kobayashi is a girlish boy who only interested in mysteries, always smiling, happy-go-lucky, and girlish (yes, i wrote it twice). Akechi is a High-schooler Detective who keeps consuming anti-headache pills by crushing it and drank it with canned coffee, always feels troubled by everything, and a Sadist (Sadist enough to makes a certain M wet herself only by his words). Hashiba is a son of a rich company (another one who could-do-anything-with-money), and always blushing when he is around kobayashi (yeah, he loves him).\\n\\n\r\nAnd there's Kage Otoko or Shadow Man (on my fansub). A man who covered his face with a paper bag and could disguise as every character in this show (If there's Shinichi, there's also Kaito Kid. Right?).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 6/10\\n\r\nWell, i don't very enjoy a dark, gloomy anime. It's not my type. But Ranpo Kitan is good enough to me give it 6 of 10. So maybe if there's someone out there who likes this type of show, maybe he/she will gave it eight or nine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7/10\\n\r\nI count this as : (8+7+9+9+6)/5 = 7,8. I put it at 7 not 8 because of nothing, just wanna do it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Notes (A lot of Spoilers ahead)\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan : Game of Laplace is a weird, good anime i say. Of course, i can't say it normal anime (but i can't find what is this \"normal\" refer to). This anime shows dark side of human's heart, made bodies into furniture, killing by drown it to cement and makes it to be a wall, and kobayashi is the most weird one that he always smiling brightly in every situation. Some cases at first is nothing than introducing new characters. The real trigger is started by Kagami's act as 20-faces's copycat, and then the show is on.\\n\\n\r\nThe real intention of this anime is how 20-faces want to change the world, the social, by spreading 'self-judgment' ideality. \"Kill the bad guy by yourself, police and government are useless\" Something like that. Using a weird formula named Dark Star (Chuunibyou, really) that he built together with Akechi, he could see what comes after and makes every one die by \"accident\" that he makes. By that too, he knew how to act so that the social will changed.\\n\\n\r\nFeels familiar? Yup, Ranpo Kitan maybe copying Death Note's concept and converse it into more a more scientific version. Using it and makes a new possibility so that we could enjoy it.",

            "content": "This series is extremely unique and appeals to a very specific set of philosophies/mentalities that I think may not be best portrayed through the anime medium.  Additionally, it can be very brutal with its depiction of certain elements of the story.  Anybody who is uncomfortable with extreme situations or mentalities will most not likely not enjoy this show at all.  \r\nThere seems to be a general consensus concerning this show that it was either misguided, not captivating, or generally lacking in any concrete merit.  The source of this dissatisfaction seems to come primarily from the mystery genre to which it hasbeen assigned.  This show most certainly does not fall within the ordinary realm of the mystery genre.  More so,  it is an examination of the philosophies and psychologies of the characters involved in such scenarios.  This is exemplified through extremes in order to more vividly portray the message, resulting in a more artistic outcome, as opposed to a more logical and puzzle-like approach one would expect from a mystery story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also very unique and incorporates a quasi-intellectual background to some extent as it directly references Laplace's demon.  This is necessary for fully understanding the computer formula constructed that is integral to the plot.   Anybody who is put off by intellectual or philosophical concepts will therefore find it difficult to become emotionally invested in such things or the characters related to them.\\n\\n\r\nIt also must be stated that this series is quite bloody and grotesque at times, revealing the hideous nature that lies within humanity as well as the acts which result from it.  One example of this is a man who kidnapping little girls, pretending they were his children and burying them in concrete if they didn't accurately play the role of daughters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are the  shining light of this series and the main source of my enjoyment.  The viewer is taken on a journey through various criminal acts and is exposed directly to the motivations and mindsets of the criminals in a very personal and emotional manner.  I must admit, however, that they can be quite enigmatic at times and they are not always portrayed seriously either.\\n\\n\r\nThis series tackles big themes such as the nihility of man and the search for purpose, the best example of this being kobayashi's innocence and blatant disregard for any significance associated with death.  I would describe it as being kafka-esque , once again, a quite niche genre within the anime community.  In order to reinforce this message, there are often glimpses of happiness and hope thrown in matter-of-fact, seemingly as if they were arbitrary.  This arbitrary nature, I would argue, is intentional, and serves to illustrate an existentialist perspective.  The character's hopes and happiness are short-lived and despair, failure, or loss are the ultimate result.  No character ever truly recognizes their goals or is completely satisfied with their current position in life.  To think such things to be possible would be purely fantastical or fictional!  This series quite accurately depicts reality from a philosophical perspective and borders on fantastical realism, yet another characteristic of Kafka.  However, in spite of loss, despair, and failure, as humans we are forced to live on and perservere.  In order to do this, we must make peace with ourselves, our situation, and our past.  I feel this is the ultimate message of Ranpo Kitan.  It provides a sense of ephemeral curiosity and serene acceptance in the face of death.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of this series was well done and significantly increased my opinion of the series as well as provided a feeling of profound satisfaction that I rarely receive from conclusions of anime series.  I do believe enjoyment of the series is highly dependent upon the viewer's mindset and their reluctance or acceptance towards existentialist concepts.  As such, if you don't enjoy this show, it may not be up your alley, so to speak.",

            "content": "Sensational and improbable events come up a lot in anime, and can be very appealing. When an anime starring Japan's first great detective does not include a single real mystery from ep2 onward, but prefers to spout the most lazy and facile justifications for sensational, improbable and vulgar atrocities, while sentimentalising motives of murderers at whole-episode length, what we have is pap. There is not only no mystery, but no tension or suspense, since these would require convincing situations, and no psychology, just vulgar, cynical shocks.\r\nIt is a pity; there must have been a good story to get out of the great detective, the phantomthief, and the cute young assistant. I believe the original stories made much of Kobayashi's jail-bait charms, and he is an interesting character here, if only his detachment could be analysed critically, and his growing engagement properly explored. The graphics and music for this series are actually not bad, and the minor characters are rather amusing; only the writing is so awful that I had to put out this review for an old series simply to relieve my feelings.",

            "content": "This anime is a miracle. It's an absolute phenomenon. Never before has there been such a tonally confused, unlikable, pretentious and yet completely superficial, amalgamation of inappropriate, clashing and frankly bizarre components in any media anywhere. This is a sprawling, choking, frankly apocalyptic, train wreck. I'm talking real Gog and Magog stuff here. Not one single thing works. Not one element is executed with a shred of care or dignity. Never have I felt so personally insignificant to a writing, animating or directing team than upon the completion of this anime.\r\nRight, so, story time. Once upon a time, My Anime List had a rating called\"unwatchable\" that coincided with a numerical value of '1'. I had vowed never to assign a '1' to any anime that I'd watched to completion, because, simply by virtue of watching it, I had proven that it was not unwatchable. But this anime is so pernicious in its execution, so unforgivable in its conception, that it has granted to me an epiphany: something can also be considered unwatchable if you wish you could go back in time and unwatch the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhere, where, where do I begin? The fact that literally eighty percent of the characters in this anime are not drawn ninety percent of the time? That backgrounds are routinely reused, and sometimes even entire clips deployed, sometimes when they don't even make sense? That there is absolutely no distinction, or care to make any kind of distinction obvious, between what is actually happening and what's just going on in some character's head? That this anime defies all classification? That one second it's Tokyo Ghoul, and the next it's Lucky Star, and other times it's Mekakucity, except in those moments when it's suddenly a fetish film, only those are actually decent expressions of their respective genres? It's as if there were fifteen writers in a room, and they had a dart throwing tournament every day to decide who would write which scene, and another dart throwing session to actually pick what would happen in each scene.\\n\\n\r\nI can only presume that once this rabbit from a hat writing sequence was completed that it was passed on to the art team, who proceeded to literally just write 'go fuck yourself' over and over and over again in paint shop pro before handing it off to the animators who desperately tried to at least draw two of the relevant characters in each episode before sheepishly handing it to the dubbing team, who were also, it happens, the editing, aftereffects, and quality control team. That's how I imagine this process went, except that actually, no, all of the teams are literally just one person using multiple voices to make themself feel like they weren't being paid $10/hr over a twelve hour period to do literally everything.\\n\\n\r\nNo, but, in all seriousness, I would liken this to that group project you got in high school where maybe one person really tried, but everyone else half-assed their portion, and one guy didn't show up at all, before you were forced to nervously present your project without the powerpoint because someone saved it as a word file. Oops.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are shallow. The motives make no sense. Plots are picked up and abandoned at a rate that can only be described as emotionally abusive. Nothing connects to anything. People know things they shouldn't, and are good at things just because the writers decided it would squeeze the story along. For instance, changing variables in an abstract mathematical equation allows you to, no joke, have god-like control over reality -- no, seriosuly, I'm not joking, and no, it's not a spoiler. For it to be a spoiler there would have to be some kind of coherent storyline to spoil -- there isn't. I watched this entire anime, maybe because I was so engrossed in the outrageousness of it all, maybe I was in shock, maybe I was hoping it would be comedic. But I watched it. And I have /zero/ clue what the first nine episodes were about. It seems like we /finally/ got to the story in episode 10, only to have it assassinated in the most unbelievably unceremonious way in episode 11.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's actually the most amazing thing about this anime. It does nothing, and I mean /nothing/ by the book. So please explain to me how this is somehow one of the most cliched, regurgitated, anovel conceptual traffic accident that has ever inserted itself into the confused pile of garbage that is B-rated, effortless anime? Oh, wait -- I know how. It's because this anime is actually an incredibly lazy hodge podge of anime tropes from other /successful/ anime series all smashed together in the hopes of making the most money for the least amount of effort (money.) For chrissakes, they literally leave over three-quarters of the characters depicted in the anime as silhouettes. Or mannequins! When it's trying to be art.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, it could not be more obvious how little of a shit these producers gave about the viewer. They sat there, folded their hands over their knee, looked you straight in the eye and said \"this is a pile of garbage, and you're going to eat it.\" Not one ounce of love or, my god, compassion -- mercy even -- was spared for this anime's creation. And here's something else that's bizarre -- because this anime is apparently part of a franchise, the characters all share their names with another series that is coming out right now called Trickster. But the characters have nothing to do with each other. They don't share personality traits, they don't share backstories, they don't share physical features -- nothing. Zilch. Nada. The main characters in the two stories (if I dare even try to parse out who might be a 'main character' in this mess) aren't even the same. There is literally no connection. No similar motifs. No suggestion that it even takes place in the same universe. Someone just decided that they would be connected. For no reason!\\n\\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't bizarre enough, you might recall me mentioning that at times this anime is a fetish film. Yeah. I didn't say that to be flippant. Literally we are treated to not one, not two, but three different scenes where a chained up woman is inexplicably turned on past her tipping point by another character unironically and unemphatically telling her that he doesn't give a shit about her. In what tasteful flavor was this handled? She pissed herself in what can only be described as a hasty, poor, who actually gives a shit, euphemism for a spontaneous orgasm. Am I even allowed to bring up that that actually happened? Because it did. And I'm not sitting here knocking anyone's kink, but it did. not. work. It was out of no where. It had no build up. It had no point. It was as if one of the writers decided that he's into that, and, fuck it, no one gives a shit about this project anyhow, I'm writing it in. Or maybe it was put in out of pure contempt. I can not reconcile the disastrous state of this anime with the idea that any effort was actually, at any point, put into it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, I know this is nitpicking. I know it is. But they gave one of the main characters lime green highlights in his eyes. It's such a small thing, but it so poignantly demonstrates my point: there is not a pixel in this anime that wasn't in the wrong place. The mood of the scenes was confusing. Colors never worked. Every frame was busy, cluttered and utterly without any sense of balance or framing. CGI was just overlayed over computer animated backgrounds. Backgrounds literally disappeared when we were supposed to be in the character's heads (except that sometimes the things in their head turned out to be what actually happened [?!?]). And, God forgive me for even mentioning the name of this anime in a review for a piece of shit like this, but sometimes it just had that Madoka Magica animation style out of no where. Like, it looks like they literally ripped it out of one of the witch scenes If you're not familiar with the series, and don't mind spoilers, just watch any scene in Madoka Magica where there is a witch and you'll understand exactly what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nLook. I'm not an art guy. I can tolerate some pretty egregious art mistakes. But the art and animation, like everything else screamed \"we could not care less about how this turns out. It's anime; people will watch it no matter what we do.\" And that's what all of this really boils down to. It's lazy. It's insulting. It has no idea what it wants to do, and it has no problem wasting hours of your time figuring it out, only to realize it used up its entire season getting there and the only solution is to immediately kill the plot before you can muster the energy to care.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like bad anime, this has to be one of the greats. If you are entertained by such things as watching asteroids wipe out humanity, stars imploding at the end of their life cycles, and the inevitable heat death of the universe, and you're having  yourself a bit of a chuckle just imagining any one of those things, you'll probably love this anime. I'd say it's analogous, in many senses, to the other belovedly horrific phantasms of our time, like The Room, Birdemic, Titanic: The Legend Goes On and all of its sequels, and Food Fight, except that at least those had enough cohesion to convey a comprehensible plot. This does not. There are quantum expressions fourteen pages long that I could probably explain better to you -- and at least those mean something.",

            "content": "I take this anime to be more of...an entertainingly unnerving experience. Its why I enjoy it so much.\r\nIt doesn't quite heavily distinguish its humor and seriousness because of its attempts to blur that line and recreate that \"unnerving\" atmosphere that was in Edogawa Ranpo's works. Its jokes are actually kind of sick, when you get right down to it past all of the anime fluff that they fill it with; we have a show within a show about an anime girl revealing an autopsy on a conscious \"dead\" body. We have a trap protagonist who sympathizes and communes with those who would otherwise betaken as \"abnormal\"; both criminals and recluses alike, yet appears almost psychotically \"innocent\" about his predicaments.\\n\\n\r\nYet that is all the more reason why I like this anime. Its a trip that makes you expect to having something inexplicably feel wrong in the back of your head. I wouldn't go as far as to say its disturbing, though that's probably because I think a lot of this audience is truthfully a little jaded to murder and that issue in anime; and because genuinely gore-focused anime exist out there. Its more subtle of a \"disturbance\" that fills you with a thrill knowing we're not too far off from the honest desires of the socially aberrant.\ufeff",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan, hmm... I've finished this series recently, at the moment I really don't know how to explain it. The series for me at first was very good, not going to lie, I actually loved the show from that, but then sometimes when you watch a show its hard to even explain the flaws at this point. Even I can see them but its hard to put them around. I'll try to explain a bit by my stances of categories. Note this is base out of my own personal opinion.\r\nStory: As I said previously, at first I got hooked to it as a person thatwants to at least want to see some mystery in the season. However here is the problem I have with Ranpo. For me it was mainly the amount of inconsistences of the episodes. For at least half of the episodes were good, and the other were just meh. For me there was this one episode that was completely not useful to my eyes. The second is the mysteries themselves being resolved too quickly, which causes me as a viewer slowly have some sort of loss of the interest. Although I will say though I like some of the parts of the show about the society and whatnot. The thing is it could have been done better to my eyes. I won't call this bad, because I personally see some good things around the series, however it feels lacking and rushed to the point for some people to stop caring for reasons. It could have been done better if they can stretch out to 24 episodes. 11 doesnt cut much. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters, I won't mention everyone but they're pretty much average characters in my personal thought. Sure, many didn't got development, but I guess regarding on their past made it a bit better for me in some cases. Kobayashi being the main male character (clearly not a girl) is pretty much for me a very... weird character at first but then I sort of like him. For the others its hard to explain. Few got character development, few just felt like thrown aside.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Now This is where the positives shine at least. The artstyle for the series can be described as unique and very high quality. At certain points it gives a lot of symbolism and greater detail, as well with the dramatization in some cases where they have to solve. Also I really love the cinematography for the show. It just looks very brilliant that it makes me wanna applaud Lerche for this. The way they present the mysteries and the drama itself makes it look unique in its own way. It was well crafted. Thats what I really love to be honest. Animation wise its a little limited but to me it still keeps its good movements to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Another part of the series strongest points. To describe it, its fittng, sometimes weird in a good way that makes your ears listen, the Opening and ED as well have a vibrant beat to the series that makes me hyped up every second. As for the VA I think all of them fit well for their roles. I felt like they put effort to my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even tho the show had a couple of flaws, I still find the show enjoyable to an extent when it kept me curious on the direction. Unfortunately for Seiji Kishi's directing and Makoto's writing it doesn't make it satisfying a bit. But Im fine the least I can say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ranpo to me is not a masterpiece. But even with its faults I still personally its worth a short for people. If you like mystery, but you want a better writing, I suggest not to check this. As I said, the story had few flaws to my eyes. If you want something with amazing artstyle and animation with music just for also entertainment, give it a go.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Just to keep something in mind, Happy late 50th Anniversary.\\n\r\nBut then again though, the books for me are fantastic. So if you like the anime, read the books.",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace follows the tale of Yoshio Kobayashi, the would be assistant of prodigy detective Akechi Kogorou and the various cases they have to solve. Ranpo Kitan has a classic detective style story but places it in the modern age. The original author, Ranpo Edogawa, is cited to be the father of Japanese mystery and he was highly influenced by Sir Arther Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.\r\nThere are a few interesting characters in the series but they all end up being characters that you can describe in a few or more words like No Personality McFuckFace (Kobayashi), ace detective (Akechi), disguise guy (ShadowMan), or girl in love with detective (Black Lizard.) I think you see what I'm getting at. They all had one defining characteristic but that was it. There's no depth to any of these characters. Hell even the main villain, Twenty Faces, who was supposed to be a foil to Akechi, had a very flimsy motive in that he didn't have any outside of \"people treated me bad.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like there was a lot of wasted potential here. Like it had the potential to be one of the best anime this season but the execution was just so poorly done with a slow story, flimsy characters, and near the end some of the most contrived bullshit I've seen in an anime. I really wanted to enjoy this, and I did for what it is, but the execution was just so awful and was nothing but detrimental to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was something. It looked really nice when we weren't getting still frames and outlines of characters that was hard to look at and wasn't pleasing to the eyes at all. It's almost like Lerche blew their entire budget on Assassination Classroom and threw what they had left into this.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can give this anime is the music. The man in charge of music, Yokoyama Masaru, also did the music for Plastic Memories, Rolling Girls, and Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches. The music in the series was used just to the right effect and some of the songs were truly beautiful. Even the opening and ending songs were, in my opinion, some of the best this season.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all would I recommend Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace?

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan: Game Of Laplace:\r\nTo start of this review I will give a quick description of the story which starts out with main character (Yoshio Kobayashi) being accused of a crime he doesn't commit, to which he then helps detective Kogorou Akechi solve the case to prove his innocence, to which after he then joins Akechi as an assistant solving various crimes with him as well as uncovering the mystery of mass murderer/ vigilantly Two Faces.\r\nNow from a viewer stand point this plot seems pretty good and you would think it would turn out pretty well, however it doesn't, in which one of the mainreasons being it's too short, as having 11 episodes doesn't allow for much development and by the end of the series it felt rushed as well as having a really poor ending to boot.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand however the story itself has all the correct ingredients, including a well though out and good filler, a though provoking next episode and then the whole Two face crime that interlinks into it as well as the rest of the story that is both though provoking and makes great material for a crime mystery show, so overall it could have been great but they went about it incorrectly and became nothing but a piece of wasted potential.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe next topic I would like to talk about is the soundtrack which fits the tone of show very well, having lovely crafted music for each scene that make each episode feel more unique than each other. Similarly with the Opening and Ending songs; which both fit the tone of the show well with the opening song being something that sets up the tone of the show, using the soft sound of guitar and drums that slowly build creating a thrilling vibe similar to the main show  ('Speed to Masatsu' by amazarashi). Next in regards to the ending song which while is not as good as the opening; fits the show well well but I feel that maybe a softer song would have worked better, that corresponds with the atmosphere ('Mikazuki' by Sayuri).\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the animation which can be summed up as decent and has a nice style to it, but shines most in the variety of ways the show presents it self to the viewers, standing out more than any of the more average animation in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAnd finally to conclude I'll talk about the characters and how there potential was wasted given the amazing amount of variety present in the show.\\n\\n\r\nTo start of I'll speak out the main characters, the first being Yoshio Kobayashi the boy who finds real life boring till the point he is a suspect for a murder case. Now I must tell you that one of the flaws of the show is this character as he is boring, has no development, doesn't fit well into the story and due to his design it becomes difficult to tell which gender he is, which leads to him becoming a poor lead and running the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe next two main characters should be the real leads of the show as they are far more interesting both in back story and personality; the first being Souji Hashiba who serves as  Kobayashi's only friend, as well as his only anchor to normal life, now what makes him a good character is how he is used within the story, playing the role as Kobayashi's reason as well as keeping him alive. But as a character Souji is rather plain with the only distinguishing features being that he an heir to a large company as well as possibly seeing  Kobayashi as more than a friend, however neither are never touched upon to a greater extend which is rather disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Kogorou Akechi who is the main detective that gets forced to have Kobayashi as an assistant; Akechi can be described as having an anti-social personality and being very serious at his job which fits well into the story and even more when some of his back story is presented, however just like the previous characters he doesn't get much development as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the supporting characters; which can range from quite boring, to interesting and creepy characters such as Minami the medical examiner who I wish had more screen time, as well as Kuro Tokage a criminal held in prison who is tied up as well as being infatuated Akechi and gives him advice on various cases, in which I really wish she would have got some development or at least we got to see backstory as she is mysterious and odd which makes her really interesting.\\n\r\nOverall there are lots of interesting supporting characters within the show that could have made it into a diamond but alas; they get barely any screen time or development.",

If you were expecting a serious murder-mystery with\\n\r\nmind-baffling cases and a coherent story, this will most likely severely disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I thought Ranpo Kitan gave out a similar vibe to Danganronpa from time to time, but that might just be me. I'll end with a warning, though, that it does have a good amount of gore and disturbing material so proceed at your own risk!",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan: Game of Lapace is an anime based on the mystery fiction by Edogawa Ranpo, a Japanese alternative to Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes or Hardy Boys.\r\nThe anime modernises the setting to thge contemporary Japan, but still keeping boys as main detective characters. In a nutshell, it's sort of like BBC adaptation of Sherlock. So, if you like the series, you should also enjoy this anime as well.\r\nStory: 7\r\nWell, as with many 'modern-set' adaptations, the story isn't original because it's based on other people work. But you have to understand that you may find the twists and plots quite cliche and orthodox since Edogawa's workis heavily inspired by Doyle's mystery style popular at the time. Edogawa's specialty is pretty \"ero, guro and nonsense,\" so if you don't like those themes very much, then you might not enjoy this show for its plot. It's not as gory as made-for-gore's-sake shows like Another or Blood-C, though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nAverage for a 2015 anime. Not too terrible, but just 'acceptable.' Having said that, the noir colour scheme and lighting are employed very expertly, capturing the atmosphere of mystery. I also appreciate the fact that the producer applies theatrical stage direction, such as light casting and shadowing people until they are introduced, implying theatricality of human nature and all. There is an imagery of butterfly too, but so far (episode 3) I couldn't see how that relates...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effect is pretty mediocre,but I love both the opening and ending. Though it's probably partial of me considering Amazarashi is my favourite band, I do think that Amazarashi's song \"Speed and Friction\" is well-choreographed with the OP animation, creating this overall sense of mystery.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nI think the cream of this show is the characters. Well, yeah, boy detectives are common enough, but these are not just normal boys.\\n\\n\r\nHere, we have Akechi, the genius boy detective with quirky and somewhat cheeky personality, basically an adolescent Japanese version of Sherlock. This might sound unoriginal, but the original Edogawa work also intended to create a Japanese Sherlock Holmes, so technically this is not 'unoriginal.'\\n\r\nThen, we have Kobayashi, who according to the original work, is an adolescent boy, who is very good at disguising as a female. Hence, his character in this show is designed as an ultra-androgynous boy, who makes your eye bulge upon learning that he's a 'boy' in the first episode. Many people find his character to be shallow due to his lack of 'human' reaction and empathy, but I'm convinced they just misunderstand his character. In fact, Kobayashi is an interesting character in this aspect. I'm sure you're probably familiar with the pop-culture term \"sociopath,\" or psychologically speaking unaffected psychopathy. Kobayashi is reacting to murders around him like a game not because he's shallow, but probably because of his mentality. Rather than striking me as an extreme doormat, he surprises me on several occasions.\\n\r\nFinally, we got a fanboy spectacled classmate, who is actually a son of a telecom CEO, who could be quite annoying but hilarious at the same time. There is also a hackneyed 'young and righteous cop,' though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell, it was good but failed to sustain my interest after that fluffy filler episode, so I put in on hold.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nA pretty average plot, but fun for any mystery fans with interesting casts of characters.",

            "content": "Hoo boy... this is going to hurt.\r\nSo when starting this show, I saw some promise at points. This anime is based on the works of Edogawa Ranpo, who himself is influenced by Edgar Allan Poe. And that does intrigue me, seeing as I enjoy Poe well enough, especially the Telltale Heart. And boy does it fall flat. \r\nSo let's start with this as a mystery. Mystery stories can work well in two ways. 1, giving the audience the clues to solve the mystery, or 2, having the story behind/of the mystery being incredibly engaging. The first just simply doesn't happen, so it tries for thesecond. But the big issue is that most of the criminal motivations episode per episode feel incredibly contrived and so far detached from human reason to be taken seriously. So one time characters are often horribly developed, and then the main characters are... better, I guess... but still not great. Most of them feel like they have their personality established at the beginning, and never really grow or gain depth. Main character, I am looking squarely at you. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond just the mystery, it tries to create a dark tone, and the animation does work really well for that. The animation is often full of deep colors that sets a tone that would make for the type of story it wants to tell, if only it ever actually utilized it. The tone can shift sporadically with many moments just being completely immersion breaking and again, detached from reality. That's really the underlying issue here, everything feels like it's detached from reality.\\n\\n\r\nEnding is not much better. I won't spoil it, but this is an ending that while not unfinished like so many anime that are out there, is just incredibly unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nNow to reprieve for a second, there are a couple of things that work. Episode 5 is actually very well done, easily being the best point in the series. Also, this has a really good soundtrack that fits well with the tone it's trying to establish. And I must mention this, the ending theme is one of the best ending themes I've ever heard. I'd honestly say it's worth it to check it out on it's own, since it's very well done. And the opening is also good, although not as much what I like. However, none of this is enough to save the show by any stretch. At best, it's a guide to what is worth checking out in this show, if anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a show that just fails so hard so often. And while I can't say it has nothing worthwhile, you could have an ounce of gold in a pile of poo and I still wouldn't recommend digging through it.",

            "content": "Story: 5(?)/10\r\nThis is the opposite of Death Note. It starts off mediocre but the end note is beautiful and philosophically accurate. People dislike this series because their expectations were that this was going to be a detective series where you are able to take part and guess the end result with the clues given. But this isn't like that, this is about philosophical theories which were executed. If you are familiar with theories such as Laplace's Demon/Superman, the Chaos Theory and the Butterfly Effect, then you will surely be satisfied with their execution in this anime. However, I am not so familiar with these theories,I only understand the basics and I do not have the time to delve into them. So, for me, it's a 7/10 in this department but it could just as easily been a 10/10 for someone who really understands it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nThe symbolic art used in this anime is pleasing. However, it gets a bit tiring to watch sometimes for people who don't know Japanese who have to keep up with both the art and the subs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending theme songs are both good, and are both relevant to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters leave something to be desired. However, this is to be expected from a short anime with such a complex story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is the most important factor for me when watching an anime. I give it this rating because it is inducing and makes you fully focused on the anime. However, for reasons mentioned above, I didn't get the full experience when watching this anime, so the rating could be higher if I had more time to delve deeper into the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 as a personal rating, but I believe that this anime still has potential and should be rated higher.\\n\\n\r\nSide-note: Rewatch value: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnd Note: DO NOT watch this anime if you are looking for a light watch, or if you do not plan to spend time understanding the plot.\\n",

            "content": "I went into this series completely blind without any knowledge of what even the heck it was. It was a recommendation since I\u2019m a big Danganronpa fan and I like mystery stories. So I bought it, watched it and well\u2026 it\u2019s OK. Think of it as one of those shows that while it starts off really strong it doesn\u2019t actually know where it\u2019s trying to go with its story and that in turn makes the characters feel a little underwhelming.\r\nSo let\u2019s start with the good. The art direction is amazing in this show, I loved the scenes when Kobayashi is breaking down the cases andit uses some amazing visuals to go through the process. I also love how other characters are grey, blank silhouettes to show just how Kobayashi\u2019s mind works.   I also dig the soundtrack and I can\u2019t 100% explain why but I just like it. The first episode is a good strong start that does an impressive job of introducing the main characters and the theme for the rest of the show. It\u2019s also kinda sorta completely F****D up but that\u2019s spoiler talk and we don\u2019t want that. \\n\r\nAnd now we come to the bad and unfortunately it doesn\u2019t take very long for the cracks and holes and CRATERS to start to form. So the main protagonist is Akechi, a young star detective that\u2026 wait a minute\u2026 What do you mean he\u2019s not the main guy\u2026 The entire plot after the first 2 episodes is about his story\u2026 What do you mean Kobayashi is the main protagonist he does nothing productive for 9 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nYeah this is what I mean about the story having a bad direction. While they try to make Kobayashi the main character and they start off well, after ep 2 he might as well not actually exist other than to be another obstacle for Akechi to get over while he actually does something productive. I\u2019m pretty sure Akechi gets more screen time as well. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t think Kobayashi would be a good character to follow so they made him a sidekick and hindrance to a plot that makes no god damn sense by the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot, Oh Boy\u2026 It makes you think that you\u2019re about to watch a gripping detective drama with complex crimes and difficult cases, but nope it\u2019s just a crappy rehash of Psycho-Pass\u2019s plot. As soon as Twenty Faces comes into the mix we get a bunch of random stuff happening for some reason and so many tragic backstories you become numb to whatever shock value it tries to throw at you. It\u2019s hard to talk about the story without spoilers but just know if you\u2019ve watched Psycho-Pass season 1 you know how this one ends. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s not a terrible series but don\u2019t expect to be blown away by the story. The art and music really hold it up but not enough from causing it to fumble and struggle. I feel like it need a much longer run time to give more depth and context to what was actually happening, 11 Episodes really isn\u2019t enough for a story like this.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. We get it, Kobayashi looks like a girl. You hammered that nail so hard it fell out the other side and stabbed someone in the eye, you don\u2019t need to bring it up every time he\u2019s in a scene it\u2019s trap overkill.\\n",

            "content": "If you want a serious mystery anime then Ranpo Kitan: Game Of Laplace is not for you. It completely fails at the mystery genre, as other reviewers have explained. However when I began watching it I didn't know it was meant to be a mystery anime, and I have completely enjoyed this anime. So I personally would encourage you not to approach this as a mystery anime, but instead as a psychological. This is an unrealistic psychological tragedy with a strange amount of comedy, in my opinion. I think this is why many people haven't enjoyed it- they wanted a proper mystery anime with properlyconstructed mysteries you can solve set in a realistic setting. If you want that too, give up on this anime. But if you enjoy things like Tokyo Ghoul and Death Note then this anime may be for you.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan is very stylistic, and accordingly it has a lot of artistic symbolism and a beautiful soundtrack which perfectly fits the mood of the show. The core idea that Ranpo Kitan seems to be trying to portray is that reality seems absurd to us but that's just because we fail to account for the infinite factors influencing us. As a determinist and someone interested in the irrationality of human psychology I found the exploration of this premise very interesting. Since the show is trying to depict reality as something absurd you'll find a lot strange and eccentric characters whose quirks seems pointless. I don't think the quirks are pointless though- I think they are all there to contribute to the idea I outlined above. Why does the new teacher act like an 11 year old and dress like a lolita? You won't find an answer in the show, but that's kind of the point: if we are to believe that all of the past influences all of the future then it'd be silly to think we'd understand our present since we are not omniscient beings who know all of the past.\\n\\n\r\nOh, plus there's an adorable trap as the main character. I understand many people don't like traps, which respect, so you can think of this as a warning if you're one of those people. But dang, I have weak spot for them.",

            "content": "Another re-interpretation of Ranpo Edogawa's work goes down to the wayside...though not as bad as it seems.\r\nRanpo Kitan: Game of Laplace is an anime adaptation of Ranpo Edogawa's work and commemorates his 50th anniversary of his death. So LA had some brushes with Ranpo Edogawa in watching anime, from his superpowered human self in Bungou Stray Dogs to another re-interpretation of his works in Trickster: Edogawa Ranpo \"Shounen Tanteidan\" yori. with hit and miss respectively. What about Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace?..well...\r\nLet's start off with the plot itself, the plot follows at first small isolated cases but the plot itself has a larger narrative, mainlyof Twenty Faces the main villain of the series, not a person as per say but the concept or deity that protects the weak and kill wrongdoers in society, with Akechi the \"genius\" detective voiced by Takahiro Sakurai, Kobayashi voiced by Rie Takahashi his assistant and Hashiba voiced by Daiki Yamashita, Kobayashi's best friend in helping Akechi with his cases...that is the bottom line of the anime. Plot wise LA liked many of the isolated cases though brief due to how quickly Kobayashi solves the cases, but it's not until the \"true\" Twenty Faces gets the spotlight and becomes the main driving force of the anime that LA actually took interest in the anime. Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace's pacing to say the least and how LA frames the plot as a whole, is RUSHED to say the least and no just because the anime was 11 episodes wasn't the point, as they just rush cases left right and center, only properly caring for Twenty Faces case as it's the only complex case in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, LA never really got invested in any character, except maybe Twenty Faces himself, mainly due to how much coverage as a character and concept he gotten is the main draw. The main cast of Akechi, Kobayashi and Hashiba however doesn't help as Akechi is the stoic detective archetype, Kobayashi the genki character obsessed with solving mysteries and Hashiba being Kobayashi's minder and all of them really don't change from most of the cases given, maybe Akechi but that's ONLY due to the Twenty Face case having a VERY strong link towards him. The minor cast might as well be red shirt army or the culprit, though LA was wrong a few times.\\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of which, since this is a \"mystery thriller\" anime, it's more of a psychological one than a mystery in all honesty, not only because of the rushed pacing but because most of the isolated cases Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace goes through have the smallest and LA says this very strongly detail becomes the clue to the culprit is. Like a good mystery is one which the audience can project along with the characters to how the culprit is, Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace doesn't give you that opportunity OR it's the most unassuming one that you can't predict at all. Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace is NOT a mystery anime to say the least...and doesn't help even further by Laplace which LA will get into later...\\n\\n\r\nAnimation done by Lerche is an ambitious one, having a tinge of SHAFTiness about itself with giving us wacky transitions even bleeding into the \"props\" of the backgrounding and characters themselves, like showing background characters as shadows or blank dolls. Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace seems rather fascinated with the light switch transition as it's used EXCESSIVELY and likes to play the metaphorical monologues in people's thinking processes (Akechi and Kobayashi using it the most). Though all of this together does make the animation stand out....as much as it started to annoy LA, even though these kind of animation flourishes are meant to draw us in, it oddly did the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was good with no real standout and hello Di- Takehito Koyasu your here as well!. Rie Takahashi as Kobayashi was something of a welcome reprieve as her voice acting helped levitate the dullness of the anime, Takahiro Sakurai's Akechi and Daiki Yamashita's Hashiba not helping matters. With the spectrum of either \"genki enthusiastic\" voice acting to dull and serene voice acting...LA was fine with the voice cast to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty about Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace, it was the imbalance and disconnect of the plot, mysteries and characters that really did it for LA. Individually all good stories but since the main characters are all geniuses and thus stock bland and never improving or changing, the story gets a little tainted as the mystery hardly grows, this includes Twenty Faces even though THAT got a full backstory! Well for Twenty Faces...the main problem with that one is the anticlimax it gave itself, which in turn LA can say for the ALL the cases.\\n\\n\r\n\"Laplace\" to which the Game the anime has set itself, is one such where a hyper-intelligence can know when, where and why of all particles are in the universe, another words, know what's gonna happen next. Because Akechi and Twenty Faces are highly linked to this, yes makes them utter geniuses, but as a counter, makes things up as it goes along with it's characters which the audience doesn't know with the vaguest of hints as the only through line. It cripples the narrative which not helped by it's bland characters but the mysteries as theatrical and wacky the anime seem to make them it doesn't help when the main characters crushes your rose tinted glasses every single turn.\\n\\n\r\nRanpo Kitan: Game of Laplace is no Trickster: Edogawa Ranpo \"Shounen Tanteidan\" yori as that anime utterly bored LA by BOTH it's annoying characters and dragged out nonsensically theatrical plot, Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace at the VERY least has it's isolated cases being interesting and Twenty Faces' story with a bit of animation pizzazz to keep LA interested...barely.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe having a Laplace demon in the anime itself was the spanner in the works in itself...",

            "content": "Ranpo Kitan Game of Laplace had so much potential. From the get-go, it slams its unique artwork, storytelling style and grasps you with a psychological mystery thriller vibe. As the series goes on, however, the initial chills and salivation for a potentially amazing anime I had was replaced by pure disappointment. If you're thirsting for an anime with a strong plot, I wouldn't recommend Game of Laplace. For general viewing pleasure, go for it.\r\nIn the beginning, it was awesome. Sure, some of the \"mysteries\" were simple, but the episodic feel and pacing felt right. Most of all, with rapid-fire dialogue and a tinge of darkhumor every other conversation, the show was intriguing. The attempt to explore the extent to which human emotion can become twisted was cheesy, but thrilling enough to keep me wanting for more. \\n\\n\r\nThe momentum builds up every episode, and I waited for the turning point, slowly reaching the peak of the roller coaster...\\n\\n\r\n... And it somehow stops, and stays stalled. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole show quickly becomes a mess of plot elements over the last few episodes. Many parts were rushed to the point where it was hurting the story, and the psychological thriller sees a bit of melodramatic teenage angst creeping in. All the elements and potential were there, and it was frustrating to see them thrown in not to make a point, but (my thoughts) just to put it in there before the anime ends. This in itself wasn't too bad, but the problem was in how strong of an impression the first few episodes left me, compared to how mediocre the final 2-3 episodes were.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that this anime does well is with its themes within its artwork. The ominous skull, silhouetted people, spotlights showcasing thought processes: all of it contributed to the overall atmosphere of Game of Laplace. It's easy to tell that it was a somewhat budget anime, but akin to Bakemonogatari, uses its constraints to create something a bit different and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are very unchanging and one-dimensional; by themselves, they're boring as hell. However, most of my enjoyment came in the various interactions between the characters philosophies, rather than the (non-existent) growth of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a reason why I would and wouldn't recommend this anime: it totally betrays your expectations and settles for a rushed, over-simplified ending. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVED the show. If the plot was done well, I would have it crowned in my top 10 personal anime favorites.",

            "content": "I am not a huge fan of the mystery genre, but what mysteries I have seen, I usually enjoy. Ranp Kitan: Game of Laplace is no different. While everyone seems to be willing to rip this anime to shreds, I believe that it is the type of anime that everyone should at least watch once. You won't come out of it confused or feeling like you wasted time; it's one of those anime that whether you think its lacking or rich, you won't regret watching it.\r\nThe anime starts off very interestingly, somewhat reminiscent of Psycho-Pass, with unusual murders, missing persons, and abnormal characters such asShadow Man. I was drawn in within the first 3 episodes with the need to learn more. Kobayashi is our main character, a young, bored little androgynous boy who finds enjoyment out of life in mysteries. I enjoyed watching the mysteries unfold and seeing how the characters figured out the murderers. It's not exactly Sherlock Holmes, but you'll be racking your brain for a bit.\\n\r\nThe main idea of the anime is to introduce to you several persons who have committed heinous crimes, and then they present the idea that these criminals get off easy due to the insanity plea. Sound familiar, anyone? It reminds me a lot of what is wrong with our own justice system as the story seems to be criticizing the Japanese justice system for making it easy for criminals. After this idea is introduced to the audience, the anime follows other vigilantes until we get to the main part of the plot.\\n\r\nThe climax of the plot is not all that exciting. They try to put a plot twist inside and then explain the incidents that led up to the present, which adds some depth to the characters, but isn't imperative. The ending isn't all that grand either. It was disappointing to say the least, but I can't deny that I did thoroughly enjoy this anime, which everyone seems to vehemently deny in their reviews.\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the anime is the overall idea behind it: the justice system is a flawed system, but again, it's nothing new. Even the video game Phoenix Wright toys with this idea. It was just interesting to see everything fall into a state of anarchy similar to Psycho-Pass. My favorite character has to be Kobayashi who really just cracks me up with his silly antics and unusual behavior. Sometimes I find myself wondering if he truly is a boy. I would have liked to learn more about him, truth be told, because while I understand that he's a brilliant young boy who's bored with the world, I'd like to know what exactly caused that. There needs to be more character development!!!\\n\r\nAnyway, here's my two cents. Just wanted to say that this anime isn't the worst anime in the world; it's actually worth watching.",

It was extremely different from the other shows that I had watched so it had an interesting and unique feel.\r\nStory:8/10\r\nThe story was great except for a few parts. I really liked how complex, crazy, and unique it was. This actually made me pause and try to figure out what was happening. I really like it when the show is extremely complex because it allows me to think and go over what has happened. At certain parts, the story would be very confusing. Without this complexity, I would have saw it as boring. I wouldalso have forgotten what had happened in the show. The unique story also caught my attention. It was very different from the normal and popular shows that I watch (which has started to bore me). The craziness of the story also really intrigued me. The flow of the story was weird but made sense. Moreover, how the story was able to mix weird comedy, suspense, and darkness together is really good and was shown throughout the show. However every story has its flaws. I didn\u2019t really like the ending because it felt like it ended abruptly. The ending also made me feel a need for a season 2 to clear up some things. This show should also be considered to be more of a thriller than a mystery. It lacks the variables that allow it to be considered a mystery.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nThe art style really fitted with the story. However, I was a little bit annoyed by how the unimportant characters were not really \u201cshown.\u201d I understand that there is a reason for this but I don\u2019t really like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nThe voices of the characters were really good. The voices of the person \u201cshowed\u201d a bit of the person\u2019s character. I also really liked the ending song since it felt calm. However, the opening song didn\u2019t feel correct.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nThe mishmash of strange characters were really interesting and unique. It felt like that they didn\u2019t belong in the story. However this feel made the story very interesting and made me want to see how things turned out. The main characters were all really well-rounded with unique abilities and differences. Furthermore, the main protagonist was really intriguing in his thoughts and actions. The villains of the story also had a reason to be there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed how fast pace and unique this story was and I\u2019m currently rewatching it even though I finished it a day ago. I would remember this anime as one of the best if not the best I had ever watched.",

            "content": "I am the polar opposite of the community on this one. Ranpo Kitan, in my own opinion, deserves a praise for the work and beauty placed inside of the show. Every episode had so much symbolism, each case showcases the disgusting crimes that we human beings commit on occasion. Ranpo Kitan doesn't make sense because of the simple minded approach that the majority came at it with. The show reflects and mirrors our own, asking our protagonist and antagonist, what is really right? Should we live our lives relying on justice systems incapable of justice, or bring it about through a sense of absolute anarchy?Ranpo Kitan challenges the viewers' attitudes, values, and beliefs with reality and that is why I consider it a masterpiece.\\n",
