Video games generally provide a reward system such as a score calculated based on the level of success achieved in completing tasks in the game.\r\nThe word \"video\" in \"video games\" initially refers to a raster display device. But with the use of the term \"video game\", now the word video game can be used to refer to games on any display device. The electronic systems used to run video games are called platforms, for example personal computers and game consoles.\r\ntaking the theme in the year one thousand ninehundred and ninety one in that year the video game is still experiencing its popularity, a child named \"Haruo Yaguchi\" spends his days playing video games regardless of how his future destiny is as if the world is just a link between himself and video games .\\n\\n\r\nThe manga composed by \"Oshikiri Rensuke\" has made JC Staff studios make this series as an anime series. JC Staff made this series feel good and have a big impact (to be honest this studio has adapted some good manga / light novels for example Shokugeki no Souma and of course Shakugan no Shana which was adapted by three seassons).\\n\\n\r\nno part of the voice is like eating without a drink, it doesn't feel complete if an anime doesn't have a supportive voice. For this series of voice actors, \"Suzushiro Sayumi\" acts as Oono Akira (although Oono's character rarely speaks) \"Hirose Yuuki\" acts as Hidaka Koharu and \"Amasaki Kouhei\" act as Haruo Yaguchi.\\n\\n\r\nfrom the song theme section, it might be quite fitting and well, the opening song \"New stranger\" which was sung by Sora Tob Sakana was so good even though I don't know who he was, but what made me like the series this time for the closing theme song could be a favorite \" Houkago die strauction \"which was sung by Etsuko Yakushimaru.\\n\\n\r\nin this series maybe at the beginning of the episode Haruo Yaguchi was an academic fool and only liked video games after the meeting with Oono Akira Yaguchi began to regard him as a rival but after a while Oono left Japan for a reason. When Oono left we got or the appearance of playing the third character, Hidaka Koharu, acts as an encouragement even though she also has feelings with Yaguchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe series adapted by JC Staff this time is more prominent on the impression of romance and honesty, I as an audience are very enthusiastic about this series and can't wait for the story to continue where a child who often goes to the place of video games begins to have feelings for his rival and his meeting with Oono Akira grow the seeds of love are very good to watch for teenagers and adults.\\n\\n\r\nin the end we as humans also have a sense where we want to relieve stress from our daily busyness with the existence of video game games which are now very sophisticated and this series reminds us that we do not fall into a world that is only temporary.\\n\\n\r\nif you expect a happy life forever then fight from now on because of the future what we do today.",

            "content": "High Score Girl is one of the theses seasonal shows that quietly snuck up on me at the of the Summer 18 season. It was a manga series done by Oshikiri, Rensuke and until mid August where it Netflix announced they will be streaming the series in December 2018 the show least for a short while was hanging around in obscure vile and even after that Netflix announced the series is still pretty obscure compared to almost every other anime from this summer season.\r\nFast forward to late September where I was done watching throwaway seasonal anime from this season like Angel Of Death, How toNot Summon a Demon Lord and Happy Sugar Life I decided to check out High Score Girl after leaving the show in my plan to watch list for so long. Then I watched it and after watching all 12 episodes of this I can defiantly say this. High Score Girl is not only the best anime from this season but it's also one of the best modern anime romcom to ever come period. I completely underestimated this show because at first, I thought this would be another forgetful romcom anime but this series completely blew me away in terms of writing, characters, music, romance and plot to a point where the series became a masterpiece\\n\r\nThe story follows Haruo Yaguchi who is a gamer who spends he's all free time at the arcades playing various retro games such as Street Fighter II than take his daily life seriously, earning him the title Beastly Fingers Haruo. However, things would take a turn one day when he encounters honour student and rich girl Akira Oono dominating everyone else at his favourite game with Zangief. Having lost to her 7 times in a row and eager to break her 29-win streak, he resorts to underhanded tactics with his own favourite character Guile, an act which earns him a solid right hook from the otherwise quiet and aloof girl\u2014and ultimately sparks their rocky relationship as she brazenly follows him from arcade to arcade after school.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of High Score Girl is brilliant and sweet.\\n\r\nRight from the gate, the show makes a great first impression where the show fantastically shows us the setting of the series with its early 90s gaming atmosphere where there are people standing up watching the players playing various arcade games. Not only that but it greatly introduces it's main two chararters in a form of a Street Fighter match where up to that point they have never interacted with each other.\\n\r\nIt is series is effectively a coming of age tale of two people who meet up thanks to the hobby of gaming as well them understanding how the world really works outside of gaming. \\n\r\nAt first this show may appear as your typical happy romcom anime however as the series progresses the show becomes more than just your typical romcom anime where the anime slowly dives into serious and relatable themes such as lack of free will, child abuse, letting go of your hobbies in favour of improving your studies and helping people get into the medium that you love and am glad that the show was able to handles theses theme with respect. \\n\r\nThe romance in this show is very well handled. At first, Haruo and Oona don't have much chararter chemistry with each other but at the series progresses these two started to understand each other thank to video games to a point by the end of the series you feel like they are made for each other.\\n\r\nEven though this show a rom-com at heart it was still a great detail that adds more life to this show world.\\n\r\nThe one thing that I loved about High Score Girl is how the show perfectly presents gaming in the 90s era. Before the days of Fortnite, Call Of Duty and League of Legends where people play these games online people would go to the arcades to play various games such as Street Fighter II, Final Fight, Vampire Hunter Darkstalkers Revenge etc. Not only that but compared to modern gamers today where they mostly spend the time talking to people online thanks to the power of the internet people around that time would ask face to face if they co-op/versus match with them.\\n\r\nAnother thing that I liked about High Score Girl that was that the gaming industry develops alongside the characters for example in episode 1 people are playing the arcades as well SNES/Genesis however after episode 8 onwards people in the show started to talk about Virtual Boy, Sega Saturn and PlayStation 1 showing us how much the technology has evolved since episode 1. You would think that the attention of detail would be pointless in the overall narrative but it isn't as it perfectly tackles the themes of catching up, pride and getting left behind. In episode 10 when Harou lost to Koharu in both Street Fighter and Vampire Hunter Darkstalkers Revenge he didn't simply lose the fight but he's slowly losing his gaming pride as while all the new games and consoles were coming out Haruo was studying hard to get the high school that Oono is in and because of all that hard work Haruo literally started to struggle to play games for a while. This doesn't end there the social commentary in High Score Girl is extremely well handled. Throughout the show, characters would often commentate on a certain games/consoles as well as nongamers giving they views on the game industry. For example Haruo mother despite her being clueless about video games she doesn't mind Haruo playing video game even if his grades are at rock bottom. On the other side, we have Oono's private tutor who thinks that video games are a big waste of time and she doesn't\u2019 want her to be part of the gaming crowd\\n\r\nOverall the story in High Score Girl was amazing as it\u2019s not only a great throwback to 90s gaming but it\u2019s the best modern love story I have ever seen.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nNow we have the charters and to be frankly honestly the characters are all awesome and enjoyable in they own ways.\\n\r\nFirst up have our main protagonist Haruo who is an anti-social boy who has a passion for video games. Haruo may start off as a generic romcom geek protagonist he quickly became one of the most relatable character I have ever seen in a long while.\\n\r\nThe way that he develops over the course of this series was as he went from being an anti-social kid who just sat down playing video games to a sociable person who starts caring more about the world as well Onna by trying his best to reduce his gaming addiction just so he can better person. It doesn't stop there the way he behaves and acts towards people was a nice portrayal of gamers from the 90s as whole were they so passionate toward video games that they either stay in the arcades playing games until closing time or pretending to be ill so they can play more games missing school in the progress. Overall brilliant chararter and he's by far my favourite chararter in the series. \\n\r\nNext, we have Akira Oona who is the silent rich daughter of the Onno family who sneaks away every so often to the gaming arcades to escape the harsh environment at home. Despite her being mostly silent in the anime I really enjoyed Oona. Instead of being another typical loud tsundere type she uses facial expressions that what she likes and what she hates. This alone makes Oono a complex chararter because the only way we relate communicate with Oono is by facial expressions. Unlike Haruo where he a great gaming life Oono gaming life is pretty sad as she has a strict private tutor that prevents her from going the hobbies that she enjoys doing like playing Video Games and while all that drama is going on she doesn't say a word as she show us her facial expression of what she's feeling. Overall great character.\\n\r\nFinally, we have Hidaka a girl who has no real hobbies. I really like her. At first, I thought she would just love triangle bait for the main two however as the series progresses she beings her own character where instead of interfering with the potential couple she actually supports Haruo by helping him get closer to Oono. Her character doesn't end there she actually starts getting interesting playing video games and by the 10th episode, she becomes a competent gamer for fighting games.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were great for what they were as they are all fun and entertaining to watch especially Haruo's mom.\\n\r\nOverall the characters High Score Girl were amazing and it's easily the series biggest strength\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhile the story and chararters were amazing I sadly cannot say the same thing the visuals because this is easily the weakest part of High Score Girl. Okay the visuals aren't necessarily bad in fact I don't mind if a show goes for a different visual style but the problem with High Score Girl is how the show uses it's CGI. When the show it's at best visually the anime can look pretty good however a lot of the show can look rough especially the first half where the CGI was at it's worst. It eventually did get better in the second half as the show more constraint with its CGI but I honestly wish the show could have handled the CGI a bit better where it can attract the mainstream audience of anime fans. It's such a shame really because the show is outside its use of CGI is very good especially when the show uses actual footage of video games that are been played by real skilled people. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in High Score Girl is an amazing throwback piece towards the 90s gaming as many of the tracks in the anime have that nice retro 16-bit mix to it along with a couple of modern tracks. \\n\r\nThe opening theme New Stranger by sora tob sakana is a fantastic opening theme that perfectly captures the show tone and setting of the series with a nice blend of modern and 16-bit style. Not to mention it's very catchy. \\n\r\nThe ending theme \"Houkago Diestrauction by Etsuko Yakushimaru is a clam and relaxing theme that perfectly closes each episode of High Score Girl. While it's not as great as the opening theme it's still a good song that is memorable on its own right. \\n\r\nThe voice acting in High Score Girl is incredible. The Seyiuss all did a fantastic job on the roles that they were given. Not only was the voice acting well acted but the characters react to the games based on voice acting alone was great as they all sound like actual gamers that either won or lose a game. \\n\r\nAt this time of the review, High Score Girl hasn't got an English Dub, however, like with Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan the show will be dubbed sometime in the future by Netflix.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nHigh Score Girl is another modern anime masterpiece.\\n\r\nSure the CGI in the show wasn't that great however the writing, romance, music, characters, and the great use of gaming references completely make up to a point where we can ignore the shows meh use of CGI. The show was truly a wonderful experience I will never forget and because of that, I thank the people who make High Score Girl for making this wonderful anime that perfectly shows that the story and characters come first before the production values.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 9.5/10",

            "content": "Summer 2018 will pass as one of the most mediocre seasons for me, but it was saved by High Score Girl.\r\nThe video game story concept is one of the most popular but also one of the most difficult to create. It requires an unusual plot to satisfy a difficult and demanding audience. Gladly, High Score Girl does a marvelous job and delivers one of the most amusement stories in this field. The series mixes the historical video game developing (the 90s) with an amazing plot where the memories of any gamer will have some empathy. In this world, we are all experts but also weare ignorant, and sooner or later our talents will meet challengers as happens in this fascinating story. But what can I tell you about the 90s? This decade is one of the most important technologically speaking. The internet was born on 1990, the CPU (first Pentium) and GPU (shading and rendering) appeared as we know them today. The video games transcended thanks to those hardware advances, Google appeared in 1995 and many other tech stuff that we use day after day saw the light in the 90s. We need to thank the 90s for our actual technology, and this anime is a tribute to all those developers that shaped our world. High Score Girl is one of the best gaming anime representations that follow a real historical timeline.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is straightforward and very easy to follow. It creates relationships from usual clich\u00e9s such as video game challenges. The plot occurs in a casual world filled with arcade machines and game centers; it creates a magnificent 90s ambiance where the main characters converge and interact refreshingly without the need of the average slice of life comedy story. The plot is hilarious, dramatical and romantic. However, the most amazing part is the characters' synergy with a well-elaborated plot. We have three main characters, the typical gaming freak, the challenger that never speaks but she is very expressive reminding me of the phrase \u201caction speaks louder than words\u201d and the converted. All the three characters in some way are rivals with certain personal interests but also friends. I like that idea of rivalry; it is not the typical garbage where the rival is awful, boring and pedantic. It is a rivalry where the main characters want to be noticed between them as rivals, friends and more.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great factor, the gaming references. The plot utilizes some games to boost the narrative. Perhaps the biggest reference is with the Street Fighter franchise. The series uses characters such as Guile to propel the narrative, and they do it very well. We can say this game character is an active part of the story. Additionally, all the arcade and classic game references are just amazing. I almost lost my breath after watching Bomberman and Elevator Action, and I am not that old. Furthermore, I am surprised that several companies agreed to allow the anime to use a massive group of references. It is not normal because the rights and licenses are a pain or ask the author because the manga was in a hiatus for a dispute with SNK.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the characters. In one word synergy. Perhaps the chemistry between the characters is the most important when you design a group of characters. As one of my old animation co-workers said: \u201cFirst create a background, then figure the synergy between the characters, and if you can't do it, the story will be a fiasco.\u201d  We have three main characters, the freak, the challenger and the converted as I said before. \\n\\n\r\nThe freak is Harou Yaguchi. The typical gaming lover. He likes the challenges and wants to be the best. Also, he has a charming side, and he cares of his friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe challenger, Oono Akira. For me, she is the most amazing character because never talks, but the actions and expressions help us to understand how she is feeling. She is Harou\u2019s main rival, very lonely and I think she suffers a lot.  I want to add a parenthesis here; it is unrespectful mocking the seiyuu because she never talks. If you pay attention, she needs to recreate some particular sounds or minimal sound ambiance to add emotion and action to the scene, if you think that it is easy you do not value all the work of a voice actor. \\n\\n\r\nThe converted, Hidaka Koharu. I am not going to spoil about her. I consider her as the story breaking point. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the art, it is good. The use of CGI is smooth. They combined some 3D and Live2D techniques creating a very appealing series that has a nice palette color, good lighting model and a very reasonable camera angle use. Furthermore, they add old video games references that improve the story flow and adds nostalgic feeling. The art, in general, is amazing, and I liked and enjoyed it   \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music are great. The ED for me is the best; I love those lyrics, no idea why :3. The VO is good, and the score and games sound is perfect. In general, the sound timing is good and does help the plot outcome and the main events. \\n\\n\r\nAs a negative aspect, we have the overuse of the CGI. The transition between CGI and 2DLive could be rough, but it is one of the small limitations between the techniques. I understand some spectators try to avoid the CGI shows. However, High Score Girl deserves a try no matter if you love video games or casual comedies.\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s often times when I feel a bit of nostalgia in life. Who doesn\u2019t really? The 1990s may not be technological advanced compared to our current modern times but it had great music, a more relaxing atmosphere, and moments that we\u2019ll never forget. I remember the days when people actually went to places like Blockbuster to rent home videos rather than binge watching Netflix. People weren't on their phones half the day. Nowadays, everything is just too convenient and people operate at their homes through the digital web. Why do I mention this?\r\nIt\u2019s because High Score Girl made me feel a bit of that nostalgia.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though. I love the convenience of our current times and everything being so simple. However, watching High Score Girl gave me the impression of old school video gaming nostalgia. I was never too big about retro games or playing at the arcades. However, the contemporary times of this show made it feel like it\u2019s both realistic and inspiring. As a series about video games, it takes an approach at decorating its story with a 1990s sensation.\\n\\n\r\nWe meet 6th grader Haruo Yaguchi from the start and he is not exactly someone I\u2019d describe as popular at school. He\u2019s a video game addict who spends his time playing games than studying or doing anything else. In many ways, Haruo doesn\u2019t really have a goal in life other than to be the best gamer. His favorite genre seems to be fighting games such as Street Fighter II. He even earned a self-proclaimed title by calling himself \u201cBeastly Fingers Haruo\u201d. His life seems to be unchanging until meeting a rich girl named Akira Oono. After getting curb stomped by her at video gaming, it became obvious that he is no longer the best. This sets the main story as we see the relationship between the two and how they develop.\\n\\n\r\nJumping into this series felt unusual at first. It felt like a coming of age story that mixes in drama, comedy, and even some romance. The last part isn\u2019t noticeable at first so I\u2019ll get to it later. Rather, the story chronicles about how Haruo\u2019s character changes throughout the series. In the beginning, he is more of a brat who tends to get angry when things don\u2019t go his way. You ever seen a kid rage at video games because he lost like a sore loser? That\u2019s the sort of imagery you can imagine coming from Haruo. However, meeting Oono changes his character as he matures and becomes a more tolerable person. I think it\u2019s rather ironic that he offers to be friends with Oono as the two are more like rivals in the beginning. However, the show makes it clear that there\u2019s a skill difference between the two though so perhaps it isn\u2019t really a close rivalry. I think it\u2019s important to address the friendship between Haruo and Oono as it develops into perhaps something more than just a bond. In later episodes, Oono seems to show feelings towards Haruo while the boy remains oblivious. It\u2019s more of an innocent affection than anything else since the series doesn\u2019t truly commit to romance. Despite this, I think it goes to show how far these two bonded together. Because let\u2019s face it, Oono is a character with a quiet nature. No one besides Haruo seems to be able to get close to her. Even with her popularity, she is shy and throughout the show, we never once hear her speak directly to a character. She is able to open herself more thanks to Haruo\u2019s influence and we see her show more emotions rather than being aloof all the time. There seems to be even feelings of jealousy coming from the girl in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWe eventually meet a girl named Koharu Hidata. Unlike Oono, she is more outspoken and easily fits with the crowd. Despite not being a child prodigy, Hidata is a much more sociable person as she is able to converse with anyone. Hidata\u2019s relationship with Haruo in the show is pretty typical that transforms from being normal friends to her developing a crush towards him. In terms of technical skills, she isn\u2019t as talented as Haruo or Oono when it comes to video games. However, the creators establishes her as a determined girl who wants to prove herself, and most importantly to Haruo. I\u2019d say that she is more of a tsundere after observing her behavior. You be the judge but Hidata does add a different side of the series. She fills the role of being a character that Haruo doesn\u2019t feel inferior to and can get along normally. Still, the series doesn\u2019t do a well job at building their relationship because as usual, Haruo is oblivious to romance like a stone cold rock. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of emphasis on these three characters so you\u2019re probably asking yourself if there are any others to worth mention. Unfortunately, most of the side characters in the series can be easily forgettable. Characters like Miyao (the chick magnet) hardly influences the story. The adult characters also makes little impact such as Oono\u2019s butler or Haruo\u2019s parents. It feels like these characters are just there and nothing more. Nonetheless, this really shouldn\u2019t sway your attention as the heart of the show is about how characters changes through common interests and how they understand each other. There\u2019s a good amount of heartwarming moments and clever comedy if you're into that too.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to not talk about the art style of this series. When it comes down to it, the show feels like a mixture of old school aesthetic blending with video game graphics. Even the theme songs is crafted with its peculiar video game style. Thankfully, it\u2019s very faithful to the manga especially in terms of character design. And on most parts, I think they did a phenomenal job at portraying Oono. Despite not speaking at all in the show, she is able to express herself with body language and facial expressions. It\u2019s important to also realize Oono\u2019s change in those expressions that represent her development. Meanwhile, I\u2019m also grateful for the realistic 1990s setting the series takes place in with the arcade games. Retro games like Street Fighter is shown with clever creativity while the graphic style represents the old school ways of playing. However, I wish the series presented more variety. Besides Street Fighter, there\u2019s hardly any other games that are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1990s really was a time that I missed. Everything just felt so simple and while I\u2019m not as dedicated to retro games as the characters in this show, it still made me want to play them. That is to say, they still exist in our modern times but playing them now just feels different. Nonetheless, this series isn\u2019t just about gaming but also how characters change. The creators really wanted us to get attached to the main characters and it worked. High Score Girl is a show that I recommend to anyone even if you\u2019re not a video game fanatic. It has enough of a story with themes and main characters that will get your attention.",

            "content": "I have been reading other opinions and positive praise around High Score Girl, but I still don't get why this is supposed to be so good and the savior of summer 2018 anime.\r\nIt's just a generic love story where the main dude is an over exaggerated character whose behavior is the outcome of \"anime\" and not any personality traits. The main female is perfect gamer and student, beautiful and ideal girl with tragic past story AKA a textbook example of a Mary Sue. There is also another girl in the series who creates the fallacy of harem, but she only appears in few episodes andher entire purpose in the series is to have silent monologue inside her head where she praises the main dude for being so amazing and kind and perfect, and cucks herself for the \"canon pairing\". \\n\\n\r\nThe romance is build around retro gaming and that arguably offers some nostalgia and the only content that is really worth of anything in the series. The romance writing itself almost entirely relies on the Mary Sue traits of the female lead where we get cliches that commonly occur in shoujo romances, and the main dude acting like prince charming whose life resolves around the Mary Sue chick. Of course, the anime is just a fraction of the story and almost nothing outside sol happens in the romance, mainly because the girl is awkward and weird and the dude is dense above all else. In fact, at this point it's safe to say that the whole thing exists just to advertise the manga which is an obligatory read unless S02 gets confirmed. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is almost never funny. In the first half of the series, it relies on goofy animation tricks and similar over exaggerated situations as the main dude's behavior. This is best seen in scenes where the mc gets hit by a car and spin in the air for something like 20 times or gets kicked in the nuts by other characters. The 2nd half didn't even attempt to do any comedy anymore outside mc's mom and few reliefs.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is real nice and the retro gaming side of the story is entertaining to watch, but the romance writing is closer to pathetic than anything else and our characters are mediocre, average at best. \\n\\n\r\nI already wrote a longer review earlier but it was buried under the praise so I will leave this as a short explanation on why I don't personally find this series to be amazing at all. Sure it was okay to watch, but I wouldn't personally go praising story or characters of this sort.",

            "content": "It's rare to see series like this that is very niche: Covering nostalgia in the form of retro arcade games, to their home conversions and the like. However, this is certainly not an anime for everyone, and solely caters to the gaming audience of old times lore, whom for all intensive purposes, will love this overlooked anime.\r\nThe story goes of the early gaming scenes in the early 90s (specifically 1991 and beyond), where Japanese retro arcades (at that time) had a massive following due to the big wave of top-tier games, and that accelerated with the release of Street Fighter II, that single-handedly revived oneof the best gaming periods ever in the history of gaming. So naturally, casual gamers flocked into the arcades to try out the hit sensational game, and that is no difference to 6th grader Yaguchi Haruo, who has been living his life off games. Unlike typical school children, he is neither every good thing nor entertaining at the greatest degree, his passion is just to be a crazy gaming fanboy cashing in on the video game craze. So one day, while tormenting rookies at Street Fighter II, he comes across an mysterious sight of fellow classmate Oono Akira, whom so happens to also play the game, and sadly got rekted embarrassingly badly by her. Determined by his flare to never concede defeat, amidst her quietness and shyness of following Haruo around to play arcade games, and finding himself conceivably getting \"cucked\" by Oono in EVERY game played, only once did he win over her with the reward being a punch in the face (ouch, Haruo). From there, the weirdness of both Oono and Haruo's love-comedic relationship ensues out of ridicule and resolution (for Haruo to defeat Oono, even once would be great to sing praises over himself).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime adaptation of the manga is perfectly synchronized and doesn't cut corners, explaining to us of the gaming backgrounds that perfectly set the charts of events that our male MC went through. Overtime, the gamer scenes backspaced into the core understanding of the characters, most notably, the struggles of Haruo with not wanting to let go of the gaming craze that set his heart ablaze, to Oono and rival Koharu Hidaka fighting for Haruo's love affection (which we all know he doesn't care, not even the slightest). From there the dignifying love rom-com aspect takes Numero Uno, first place to uncover what makes the characters tick their bones and define what they truly do.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I'm sad that the one-dimensional aspect of the characters played a big part here (which can be boring), but what I'm assured about is the same aspect that would help define the characters here and play a massive part of their exposition:\\n\\n\r\nYaguchi Haruo, typical gamer, has nothing worthy of his self-worth to add into his name, but his love for retro games serve as the main catalyst of his life as a growing gamer, basically nothing stands in his way of the love of games, and will not hesitate to trample on anyone to reach his desires.\\n\r\nOono Akira, the well-rounded character who is forced to be everything society demands of her: coming from a \"big house\" name and following in her parents' footsteps, she yearns for the outside life, and Haruo plays a major significance in her life, serving as her means of escape of everything that demands her attention and recognition.\\n\r\nKohaku Hidaka, the 3rd wheel in the relationship between Haruo and Oono, she seems like the atypical crush-after-boy figure, chasing after our male MC in the world of gaming (which at first isn't very accustomed to), eventually learning his traits and catching up to him in order for Haruo to notice her (see the similarity of love rom-com)?\\n\\n\r\nIt's impressive that this series manages to compartmentalize the characters and their growth, which in turn sets the overall pacing which is great and doesn't feel like an incomplete set of events that just so happened to trail past us by.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is one I'm actually caught by full surprise. Knowing how the manga actually try to incorporate the exact forms of the various amount of game aesthetics, the anime adaptation has to fulfill that core information, and it's very subjective. Having veterans J.C.Staff to do this adaptation is rest assured by all means (mostly for 2D background art), but that CGI animation, oh hell does it deliver despite its wonkiness and uncertainty that at anytime the production means will falter. The last time this actually happened is Fall 2017's Houseki no Kuni (which was a CGI masterpiece), and with High Score Girl, to be able to input this much effort with the perfect replication of retro games, it is something that you have to get used to it, with the overall quality up to your varying tastes for good CGI animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one hardcore reference to the retro game vibes of the 90s. Both the OP and ED forebodes the 8-bit musical style that will be noticeable and reminiscent to old retro gamers, along with the lyrics (if you have time to analyze them), and is a perfect fit for the entire show itself. Personally I had fun listening to the OST, never skipped them, which was a blessing indeed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, why does the Summer 2018 season have so many noticeable-and-mediocre and underrated-and-overlooked shows, we will certainly not know. What I do know is that this anime falls into the \"underrated-and-overlooked\" category, and is certainly another sleeper hit. I would only recommend this show to avid retro and casual gamers if you want to know how is it like for another medium to condense the entire retro gaming structure. Besides, what's not to have fun when games are at the central of it all?",

            "content": "I've been a fan of High Score Girl since the manga and I think the anime is a pretty good adaption of it overall. The score it currently has really doesn't suit it but it might be because it's not for everyone I personally think it's great due to the atmosphere, story, comedy and of course the retro video games.\r\nThe story takes place in 1991 when the main character, Haruo finds the rich quiet girl Ono, playing a game of Street Fighter 2 at an arcade and defeating everybody who challenges her, even our guy Haruo. Eventually through blood, sweat and cheap tactics Haruo stealsa win off her and in retaliation she punches him right in the face, and that's how this love story start.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let the CGI fool you, this isn't just some cheap anime that's trying to rope you in because it has retro video games (although, that is why I was roped in, and they're great). The anime itself has great comedic moments, heartfelt moments and even some dramatic and shocking moments. The anime can have you gawking at the accurate retro games to laughing your arse off to Ono punching Haruo whenever he gives a cheeky remark to worrying over whether or not Ono and Haruo will play another game at the arcade again! There can be cute moments from Ono being scared of spooky games and there can be uncute moments such as a guy asking to see the bone in Haruo's penis, but that's a story for another time.\\n\\n\r\nThe main aspect of the anime is obviously the retro video games, but as time goes on they take a backseat I'd say. You really get to love the characters and the games just become set pieces, but fun set pieces because you can feel the joy of seeing them just like the main characters. If you're a fan of cute romance stories, comedy and retro games then definitely give this one a try, I'd say it's AOTS just from the first four episodes., there really is nothing like it as well it's such a unique and interesting anime that even if you're not a huge fan of retro games you should give it a watch just for the environment it is set in.\\n\\n\r\nThe only negatives I can really give this show is that, the first episode can be quite slow due to setting things up and being a collection of stories but the later episodes don't have this, and another negative could be the CGI although you hardly notice it as you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find High Score Girl to be a unique and interesting anime just because of it's setting being untapped in anime, but it doesn't mean it's a story trying to sell itself with retro video games. It's a cute love story and I think that the games help give it a unique story and plot device to bundle it all up in.\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n-Retro games galore from the gameplay to the sound effects\\n\r\n-Cute Romance Story\\n\r\n-Has a lot of funny moments\\n\r\n-Cute heartfelt moments as well, has a few tearjerkers as well\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n-Episodes can be slow, the first one especially\\n\r\n-CGI can be an eyesore depending on who you ask\\n\\n\r\nAs of now, there are no subs from official groups, but there are some fansubs out there to find, so keep an eye out. I'd give it a 8/10 just because it's really what you can expect from the manga and more. I'm also happy that the score has gone up from a 6.7 to a 7.1, I hope this can at least break a 7.5.\\n\\n\r\nAlso please excuse how awful this review is, I just noticed there was none so I wrote one up at 3am, and then it was removed due last week and I just wanted to repost it when the 4th episode came out.",

            "content": "I love games. Yep, what a shocker. I played games since I was 1 and I know a lot about them. I especially have a soft spot from games around the 90s, even though I was born in the 00s. These games are just so cool, fun and iconic. So an anime that is centered around arcade machines in 90s would be great fun, right?  \r\nEh... it is a mixed bag. I already didn't have high standards for this season (because this season is the weakest season by far this year), but this just is not good. Not bad, but also notgood. Grab your joysticks and get the high score, this is my review of High Score Girl.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nHaruo is a gamer who fails at school and wants to escape that.. by playing games. One day a girl seems to be better then him, a strange fellow named Akira who doesn't talk. They form a strange bond. I don't want to get further into the story, because then it goes into spoilers, but I can at least say that it is an alright story. Not anything to complain or to praise.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe first thing that you notice when seeing High Score Girl is its animation. Yep, our good friend CG strikes again. And it is not even that bad, but there is also normal 2D animation and it just constantly switches. It annoys the heck out of me. The artstyle is also not that great, with the only good looking character being Akira. The art can look competent at times, the keywords being AT TIMES, because in every other instance it just looks ugly.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe OST is forgettable, except for the OP and ED. The OP is pretty good and catchy, but dammit don't I like the ED. If it was competent I would've given the music a 7, but that ED is just not good.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nLet's begin with Akira: She is the most expressive character despite saying nothing. She is shy, violent, but still is a kid. I like her, atleast gallons more then Haruo. Haruo has mastered the ''tell, don't show'' method. He explains everything. Oh, a game? LOOK AT HOW AWESOME THIS GAME. Oh, Akira shows emotion? LOOK AT HER SHOWING EMOTION. Oh, I have an emotion? I AM FEELING AN EMOTION! Good god if Telsell needed new hires he would be on the top of their list! And this only makes the biggest flaw of this anime worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nThis anime is sponsered (or something like that) by Square Enix and they make it pretty fucking clear. This anime is more a commercial for Square Enix then an anime. Don't get me wrong, I like some Square Enix games from time to time, but I don't like ads shoved into my face. They constantly show Square Enix games, they constantly pitch (yes, pitch!) Square Enix games, they have Square Enix ads in the middle and the whole plot is revolved around Square Enix games. The most apparent example for me was in episode 4 in the middle when they showed an Puyo Puyo app which the characters of show suposendly were playing. THERE WERE NO FUCKING MOBILE PHONE GAMES IN 1992 YOU FUCKING MONEY HUNGRY WOLVES. And it is a shame too, this anime has some genuine heartwarming and emotional moments and the humor is pretty good, but these constant ads shoved into my face just ruins my fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI am just more pissed of this anime existence then the anime itself. It has some quality put into it, but at the wrong fucking places. If you don't mind ads in your anime, then fine, more power to you, but I just can't stand this.",

            "content": "High Score Girl's soul fundamentally lies in it's throwback setting to the golden age of arcades, the fighting genre and videogames in general, but the show doesn't use this setting as a crutch but rather makes something special out of it.\r\nYaguchi is an arcade/videogame addict who self-proclaims that  his only value as a person is his talent in video games, so he always spends his time in arcade, beating other people and feeling good about himself. So naturally a girl named Oono comes and beats the sh*t out of him, both figuratively and literally, story ensues.\r\n  The show mainly uses videogames as aparallel to our world, but it's not forced, so it makes the show feel more legit and realistic. The main story on the other hand is more about the youth of these particular characters and how their interaction with each other affect them. It's basically a romance story with slice-of-life influences and video games as a bit of fanservice (and advertisements, a lot).\\n\\n\r\nThe very first moment I went into the show I immediately hated how anything looked, because this show unfortunately uses low-quality cg in it's art direction which is always concerning when it comes to anime. It's sad to know that this show will always look old and dated, as it already looks dated even today. But then things seemed to get better looking as the episodes went on, not sure if I was just getting used to the awful cg but then I realized what actually was going on.\\n\r\n The thing is, in stark contrast to it's low quality cg, this show actually has surprisingly good cinematography and atmosphere, provided by some nicely laid out background art. You're never confused as to where the characters are in relation to each other, it gives the show that visual depth to make the onscreen action believable.\\n\r\n It's snowing outside... we quickly rush into a local shop and play some video games as we catch some heat, it's cozy as hell.\\n\\n\r\nEven though one of the biggest reasons why I enjoyed this show is undoubtedly the characters, and they are decently written characters, when I look back I come to realize they were'nt really anything too exceptional. Rather, it's more interesting how these characters interact with each other, and how they shape each other as people as the show goes on, it's quite fun to see how much Oono changes Yaguchi as a person.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with the show is that it doesn't have any finality to it, as it quite simply can't since the manga is stil going. There will be two more episodes coming though (with the BD release if I'm not wrong) so maybe those will give some completeness to the show, but with the manga still going, I doubt it.\\n\\n\r\nHigh School Girl gets a strong 7.\\n\r\n While nothing too special, it's still a show I very much enjoyed and would recommend to anyone who likes cute romance stories, SoL and video games. It's definitely worth watching if you're into the genre.",

As someone that has is from the end '80's myself, I sure do remember it very slghty back then while I was still wetting the bed.\r\nStory: 6/10 (Fine)\r\nThe story sets off in 1991 when Street Fighter 2 gets released. But this animle is not really about games. It's more your generic love romance triangle story if you really have to boil it down with a lot of references with classic games like Street Fighter 2 back in the '90's. Since I never really played StreetFighter 2 myself since I was too young back in the day and I'm also not quite familiair with the whole francise. The closest of the series I had played for a bit was Street Fighter 3D Edition for the Nintendo 3DS. I'm more of a Tekken guy myself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 (Fine)\\n\r\nThe art-style is one of my biggest turn-off for this show for a show that's been made in the current year of 2018. When I saw the first episode, it was hard to decide I would contineu the series or not and to be honest; I don't really like to drop an anime just after one episode. But I somehow got used to it. It still doesn't mean I adore it. It feels so cartoony and blocky to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nIf you want to feel nogalistic about the '90's and you have played games from that era, this show got you covered. It's pretty much it's main selling point if you ask me. All those gaming sounds surely makes you long for the '90's a bit again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 (Fine)\\n\r\nThe charaters are however quite like-able, but what bothered really me the most is that Oono (one of our main carathers) havent said a single word in the entire show. Is she shy? Is she mute? It never got explained why in the anime and it feels you're pretty much forced to perhaps read the manga to get more answers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10 (Average)\\n\r\nOver time I started to enjoy this show however, even with all the neatives I told you before. But that's maybe because I'm a romantic type of guy. Don't judge me. I also got a chuckle every now and then with our MC the video game addict. Another big turn-off for me was they have putted every now and then a commercial in the middle of the episode about the latest games that are coming out or are already out for on the Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4 and such and I really feel the need to adress this, because this is a turn-off to me. I'm here to watch anime, not to be a consumer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 (Fine)\\n\r\nDespite with all it's negatieves, it was a good watch I guess. This show has it's flaws for sure, but if you're into arcade games and old-school gaming from the '90's and like a bit of (triangle) romance, this would be your anime to watch. High Score Girl gets from me an overal score of 6/10.",

            "content": "With the number of anime that air per season, even with the large amount of anime fans, it\u2019s a given that some shows will simply fall through the cracks. I feel that High Score Girl is one of those shows.\r\nBecause of this, I found High Score Girl a hidden gem of this anime season. Not a diamond, mind you, but gem, nonetheless (think topaz).\r\nHigh Score Girl tells the story of Haruo Yagauichi, a crude slacker, and Akira Oono, the academically talented heiress to a wealthy family. What ties these seemingly incongruent characters together is their mutual love for video games.\r\nAnd if you, the viewer, loveclassic video games, you\u2019ll love High Score Girl, which is a love letter to 90s gaming. Both the arcade and console scenes are given love. If you played the games of this time or simply are tied to decade, you\u2019ll be hit with a blast of nostalgia. I personally adore video games, so even though, unlike Haruo, I\u2019m not big on fighting games, I still got to geek out. It was also nice seeing time progress and seeing Haruo gush over new releases. The anime does move forward in time (going from upper-elementary to the first year of Japanese highschool (sophomore year in America), and the anime utilizes this passage of time well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are written surprisingly well, with Haruo not being quite as dense as you\u2019d expect for an MC of his personality. Oono is hands-down one of the cutest characters I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of viewing. Her violent tendencies, while annoying at times, don\u2019t really detract from her character. Unlike some people, it doesn\u2019t make her insufferable, and somehow makes her even more cute. Her biggest shtick is that she doesn\u2019t speak, ever. While this can prove frustrating for some viewers, I think the show worked around it well. If I had more money, I\u2019d get her nendoroid.\\n\\n\r\n...then there\u2019s Hidaka.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s a romance, which comes into play very soon. It\u2019s a cute romance and the couple is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. While the anime doesn\u2019t pussyfoot the relationship in the beginning, it quickly loses steam as, you guessed it, a third player joins the game. Enter Hidaka, a member of Haruo\u2019s class who quickly develops a crush on him as he introduces her to the wonderful world of gaming. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it could be seen as a \u201cspoiler\u201d that there\u2019s a love triangle, I think it\u2019s only fair to inform you all. Love triangles generally bog down a show, and High Score Girl isn\u2019t spared...kind of. As a main character, Hidaka is quite fleshed out and she\u2019s sure to have her fans. However, the show makes it painfully obvious that Oono is the endgame, yet a large portion is dedicated to Hidaka and Haruo. While she\u2019s not a bad character, her inclusion seems to just take away from Oono\u2019s. In my opinion the love triangle doesn\u2019t really add a new dimension to the plot. It doesn\u2019t detract from it either, but that just makes it seem kind of unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the show\u2019s still good. \\n\\n\r\nThe main thing High Score has going against it is that there isn\u2019t much more to it. What you see is what you get. If you like video games and romance, you\u2019ll probably love this show. If you like one or the other, it might be a bit of slog. If you like neither, there won\u2019t be much for you. Even if you do like both, the show still seems to be missing something. The side characters are inoffensive, at best. Midway through the show, I simply had the feeling that High Score Girl was adequate. It wasn\u2019t bad, no, but it wasn\u2019t great either. I didn\u2019t find myself compelled to watch episodes right away. Still, it picked up again.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty great, but the art might prove a sticking point. The show is completely CGI, which is sure to be a turn-off for some viewers. Watching it can feel off at times. If you like the story, you\u2019ll learn to get used to it. For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s pretty harmless.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t comment on the ending because it ends on a cliffhanger, with the final episodes premiering in march of next year.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show is far from perfect, as a video game and romance fan, High Score Girl scratched an itch I never knew I had, and I\u2019ll be sure to watch the show\u2019s conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n7.1/10\\n",

I have watched the anime (well 5 episodes for now, cause it seems the anime is still airing) , and read the manga (49 chapters). I will try to keep my review to the anime only, but there is something, and that's I don't trust this review. I don't want to spoil it for people who will read the manga. But when newer episodes come, this review may no longer hold.\r\nBut for now, it's a typical heartwarming anime, a good one, but not one with much to talk about. Oh and yes, theseratings only apply to the anime's story, not manga I've read.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10) : Kind of hard to decide, as it really doesn't have much of a story. It's pretty much a boy and a girl. The boy doesn't care about anything but games, so he's dense to the girl's feelings. That really is just it. There is one more girl too, but they didn't even meet yet (but they might in the oncoming episodes). It's heartwarming and cute.\\n\\n\r\nArt(4/10) : Can't really defend this. Just look at it.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10) : It's fair, I suppose. Not much to complain about, but not that great either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8.5/10) : This is good, especially considering the genre. The game crazy boy,  a rich \"ojou-sama\" who also happens to be a crazy gamer, and one more girl who's just a cute normie. And then there's protoganist's mom. BEST MOM EVER !!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7.5/10) : Pretty cute and heartwarming. Quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7.5/10) : I suggest it.",

            "content": "What happens when you mix retro games with anime school children? Well, in some ways, you show someone\u2019s ideal childhood back when they were kids. Just kidding, this show isn\u2019t really very ideal (not sure if anyone would really want to be in our main characters shoes most of the time), but it\u2019s interesting to have that little nostalgia while also seeing a bit of a romance bloom. Now for those who don\u2019t know, I have a passion for video games but not really a strong one in playing them. I\u2019m a very casual gamer. The love I have for them is their graphics andstory rather then play. Old games awe me in their pixel art, newer games awe me in their high detailed designs, and indie games always seem to have a place in my heart with how deep their stories go and how they break the mold of what everyone on the outside thinks about video games. This show has that and a little more added for your normal anime style trope. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the main characters, and just like a character select screen, I\u2019ll let you pick who\u2019s first\u2026 (Just kidding, I seriously wish that could actually work though.) Our main character is Haruo Yaguchi. This show follows his life through elementary school through high school so it\u2019s hard to pin point his exact personality. As people grow so to does their personality and the way they react to different things. There are some constants though, he loves video games, he is good at them, and he likes a good challenge in video games. Normally I wouldn\u2019t like a character like him much, but there is a very strange amount of charm that seems to come from him that I like. It\u2019s his passion I think that draws me in. It\u2019s the same for anyone really, the spark that shows up when someone has fallen in love with something else, I am always interested in that spark. \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time that I like Haruo, I kind of don\u2019t fully like Akira Ono who is our second character. She is a very rich and popular girl who all the boys seem to fall for even when they were elementary school students when boys would normally be trying to space themselves from girls. She gets good grades, attends after school studies at home including flower arranging, piano, and all the other lessons a typical rich kid in Japan is supposed to learn, but her greatest passion seems to be sneaking away from all that just to play video games at an arcade. She feels a lot like a typical Tsundere character as she always seems to beat up on poor Haruo except for one thing, she is mute throughout the whole show. When I say I don\u2019t fully like her, it\u2019s the Tsundere part of her that I\u2019m not to big on as I see that time and time again in anime, but what I find fascinating with this show is the fact they did leave her mute. You only know what she is thinking from her gestures and facial expressions (and sometimes her feelings show through her game play) so a lot of time your left guessing what she is thinking. \\n\\n\r\nThe next person I would like to talk about is Koharu Hidaka. She becomes a classmate of Haruo\u2019s in his junior year\u2026 basically in the 4th episode so it\u2019s not spoilers really. From the first moment that she came on screen, I knew she was going to become a \u2018option 2\u2019 for our main characters affections just from how she sort of starts to interact with him. She\u2019s a lot like me in a way where I would call her a beginner or casual player. Someone who likes to watch others play instead of playing themselves for the most part. While she does get a small interest in games near the end of the 4th episode, she seems to only get into it because of Haruo. I like her but at the same time don\u2019t like her which is a very odd thing to say. I think that because she feels so much like me in a way, I feel like she doesn\u2019t really fit in with the story line that they were trying to get to. It\u2019s like they put her in just to say \u2018here is your love triangle everybody, will the new girl get the guy or will it be the childhood friend?\u2019 If they had integrated her more into the story line somehow, I think there would be more of a reason to have her there but with the 12 episode limit, they didn\u2019t have enough time to flesh her out or show how close she could get to Haruo to give her a fighting chance really.\\n\\n\r\nI love the fact that they start the show with them in elementary school and work their way up. The different little breaks of years gone by is filled in with a very basic low down of the advancement of video games within Japan and just how advanced they got though the years that we are missing in the jumps. It also shows just how dedicated the characters are to their love of the games. What got me really excited was that Haruo\u2019s first console he talked about was the Turbographic-16 which was part of some of my earliest gaming memories. My family and I would sit around and play Dungeon Explorer together when I was in elementary school so the show really brought back some fond memories. I think that was the biggest reason why I actually got interested in where this show was going.\\n\\n\r\nThe English voice acting is interesting, especially since Ono doesn\u2019t actually talk. Christine Cabanos is the \u2018sound\u2019 actor for Ono and she does an ok job for her but sadly it doesn\u2019t show her talent. Haruo\u2019s voice actor kind of made me a bit annoyed at first but then started to grow on me a bit as he got older. I think it was because Johnny Yong Bosch was his voice actor and throughout the whole time I watched the show up until I looked it up on wiki, I had no clue it was him. There have been a couple new voice actors that sound similar to him that the familiarity of his voice had me racking my head trying to figure it out. Also, when Johnny plays a kid, his voice can get a bit annoying it seems\u2026 (Sorry Johnny, still love most of your voice acting.) \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a little odd in my opinion, reminding me a little like the Korean style of art I have seen before. It\u2019s not a style I\u2019m normally drawn to but it does have its own charms. I do like some of the consistency\u2019s they did with how children grow up as its sometimes hard to make a character look older without losing what they looked like when they were younger. They had to do that for at least three separate time frames and in all of them, the children do still have the same air about them as when they were younger in their design. The odd thing about the art style is that they do sometimes randomly have this strange shading on the characters that shows they were 3D models which sort of breaks the show for me. I\u2019m detail oriented so if it first looks hand drawn and then that strange 3D thing, I end up losing my immersion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do love the nostalgia the show brought to me and the interesting story that came with it. It\u2019s not high on my list but it is one I probably will end up watching again. Just one warning, I would watch the first 5 episodes before you say you don\u2019t want to watch anymore. The show kind of changes around then which will make you know if you like this show or not.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I know that this series has been in limbo for an adaptation until just recently, but why the fuck are you planning waiting two seasons to do it?\u00a0 Come on, don't make High Score Girl suffer more.\r\nStory:\r\nLet's take a step back in time to the 1990's, where arcade slot machines were virtually the only way you would be able to access video games, and home consoles/PC gaming had not yet been developed enough for commercial use.\u00a0 Here we meet Yaguchi Haruo, a grade schooler who spends a lot of his free time playing PvP fighting games and racking up consecutive wins against those lesserthan him.\u00a0 It's here that he meets the mysterious Akira Oono, a silent girl with the gaming skills of a god who finally puts Haruo's ego in its place, causing him to go into a frenzy and vow that he claims revenge.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we look at High Score Girl, what we're really looking at the development of our main characters through their school years alongside the evolution of gaming as they move through the grades and home consoles are introduced later on in the series.\u00a0 Each episode chronicles the journey of Haruo vying to get his rematch with Oono, and the audience becomes privy to their relationship as Oono's problems and insecurities become more apparent and Haruo becomes less of an egotistical dick as they age.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the romance aspect of the show is something that I find to be the show's most questionable quality.\u00a0 Because the series employs the love triangle method as its way of pushing its protagonists closer together and enforce said romance, what we end up getting is a cheap way of creating romantic tension and try to further the show's romantic agenda.\u00a0 Had the show not had this, it would've had a lot more time to really push the main couple and not spend much of its latter story for a 'battle for the boy scenario'.\u00a0 What makes this point even more apparent is how the show's ending is a result of this kind of plotline, creating a romantic-based plotline which feels natural for the character in question, but not for who the series is ultimately about.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Nostalgia trip for arcade fans\\n\r\n+ Character growth for protagonists\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Love triangle bogs it down\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nYaguchi Haruo, known in his early days as 'Beastly Fingers Haruo' is the show's resident game addict and protagonist, whose only hobby is video games and proving his dominance as being one of the best in Street Fighter.\u00a0 His throne is ultimately taken down by Akira Oono, where his ego and shitty attitude gets the best of him, sending him in a spiraling fit where he vows to get his revenge.\u00a0 The best part about this show is how we see him grow throughout his school years, transitioning into a more humble character with his ego only showing during the moments where his superiority in video games becomes challenged.\u00a0 As usual with romance protagonists, he's dense, but this is one of times where I don't blame the guy because unlike most love interests, Oono doesn't talk.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterized with a doll-like exterior, Akira Oono is the 'High Score Girl', a studious individual from a well off family who manages to be a kind of mary sue for video games, being proficient at them to the point that every time we see her, she brings about something new that only just serves to show \"Yeah, she's really good at this.\u00a0 Almost too good\".\u00a0 This, coupled with Haruo's one-sided rivalry against her ends up putting her on a pedestal for a majority of the show's first half.\u00a0 A lot of Oono's character is 'show, don't tell', as her character being purposefully mute leads Haruo to ask questions and take executive action to learn and understand this previously unknown girl, adding a lot to his growth.\u00a0 That being said, her muteness is a double edged sword, since romance as a whole is very difficult to pull off without verbal communication, made even more difficult when her only method of actually talking is to growl, hit, headbutt, and assault Haruo whenever he pisses her off, which understandably will send mixed messages to the individual in question.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of our trio is Koharu Hidaka, the series's unfortunate third wheel who really doesn't deserve the treatment she's given.\u00a0 Her own arc about finding a hobby and falling for Haruo is what we're treated to in the second half, where she spends much of her screentime trying to get eyes on her even though deep down she knows she won't win.\u00a0 As much as I like her character, I don't fully understand what the executive choice on her is.\u00a0 She really only seems to be there to throw her hat in the ring and push the other two together, which feels pretty insulting considering we're treated to the extent of growth and confidence that Koharu previously didn't have at the start of her introduction.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSide characters don't really add much and primarily add filler to populate the masses that stand behind these three.\u00a0 If anything, the recurring positions only serve to drive the plot, and not much else.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Growth for main protagonists\\n\r\n+ A mute character that (for the most part) actually works\\n\r\n-\u00a0 \"Third wheel\" character unfortunately only made to be the third wheel\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff seriously has no consistency when it comes to art quality.\u00a0 On one hand you can have pretty shows like \"The Pet Girl of Sakurasou\", and on the other you can get completely CG messes like High Score Girl.\u00a0 The show is essentially Oshikiri-sensei's style for the manga made into computer graphics.\u00a0 Its unique style is added with these almost blocky character models show is really telling to how low budget the overall product is.\u00a0 Hell, their faces are basically just textures, and the only have two mouth flaps when they speak!\\n\\n\r\nMy theory is that J.C. Staff just took it after it had been in limbo for a long time, and put in as little money into it thinking it probably wouldn't make a profit given the series's niche qualities.\u00a0 Which if it's true, man that sucks...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, we're treated to the duo of\u00a0\"New Stranger\" by sora tob sakana, and \"Houkago Di(e)stra(u)ction\" by Etsuko Yakushimaru, a quirky OP with a lot of guitar riffs and retro sounds mixed in to drive into the nostalgia of those that grew up with arcade machines, and a more somber ED that exemplifies the deep-rooted issues that Oono has but doesn't talk about throughout the series.\u00a0 While personally I'm not too much of a fan of either of these songs, they are good and quite memorable tracks, as their unique qualities stand out, and mesh well with an equally unique show.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHaving grown up with the sixth generation of virtual consoles, the nostalgia of arcade cabinets is lost on me and I sadly cannot relate to much of the hype for those who once spent hours in the afternoon inserting coins and playing them.\u00a0 That being said, High Score Girl is a show that garnered my interest and resulted in mixed feelings that make it difficult for me to find a place to put this show.\\n\\n\r\nOn one hand, the progressional eras provide a lot of growth for our protagonists and Oono's \"show, don't tell\" stylistic choice made with her being mute do a lot to better the overall storytelling of the show.\u00a0 Not only that, but Koharu is a great third addition to the cast, sadly held back by the fact that she's the show's coveted 'third wheel' in the relationship and has her role relegated as such later on, which is a shame because I like her more than Oono.\u00a0 Had the show just been about Haruo with either Oono or Koharu, I feel like the show would've been a lot better given how it could've just focused on one couple and develop that instead of devoting its time to a character meant to only catalyze the other relationship and feign romantic tension.\u00a0 It's just not good storytelling if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I still find that the show's good points outweigh its negatives.\u00a0 It's a niche show meant for those with nostalgia for an era where 3-D graphics were blocky and polygonal, yet still manages to find its footing in growing characters, even if the result of that is rocky at best.",

            "content": "What a clever little nuance factory cash grab...  is what I would say if I was an angsty hater predetermined to hipster up no matter what.  High score girl definitely surprised me,  scoring well enough in all 5 brackets to earn a mean score of 8.4 rounding down to a final [8/10].   So lets break down why High Score Girl is worth slamming your free time tokens into.\r\n          Thisstory has a multi tiered objective.  There are multiple themes coexisting, and the plot focus is balanced enough to not feel starved of any.  Not only are we being treated to a cute little story, we are getting a peek at social gamer stereotypes as well as a history lesson on the evolution of gaming.  It could have been so easy for this to have been a flop,  if they provided a weak balance of these elements expecting the nerd material to carry it to greatness,  oh the hate it would invoke.  Thankfully,  they took a risk and put in the effort, and the final result was a season of anime I think most anyone can watch and enjoy.   While it wasn't the most perfect fable,  I have no problem giving  High Score Girl an [8/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\n            Art and Sound:  The visuals were really flat despite the characters being more rounded, but it looked modern and fresh.  So nothing awe inspiring but nothing terrible. The ending theme to this anime was super fun and you can tell the voice actors had a good time recording their roles.   A lot of intentional over acting and I definitely enjoyed it.   Now,  the incorporation of visual and audio elements of the games showcased was done well.  However,  they were not designed for this anime.   That is just where they ended up.   So how do you score this?  Well with an agonizing bit of math and a calculator, of course.   After factoring in decision making as well as the original elements and other variables,  both visual and audio boast a [8/10].    \\n\\n\\n\r\n             The characters for this show were decently human, and the exaggerations were kept to a believable but still fantastic level for comedy.  Then there was Akira, to be able create and display a character that ..  well no spoilers, but I was bewildered by this character.  The coexistence and connection between the main and his rival, is seemingly impossible to create with those limitations. The greatness is real,  [9/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\n                  Enjoyment [9/10]  I watched an episode,  I did laundry,  I watched an episode, I did the dishes, eventually I found myself with a really clean apartment and no more episodes.  While loving it enough to binge in tandem of my spring cleaning,  completing the season has left me to blue to truly appreciate my newfound tidiness.  So whether you are looking for cute fun story, or your house is a mess,  I highly recommend watching High Score Girl.    -   Grizziff Kingsbeard, house maid.",

            "content": "We go back in time to the year 1991 where we get to relive the gaming industry\u2019s second golden age. A meteoric rise from the grassroots of Japanese Arcades thanks to a new wave of top-tier games, one in particular, Street Fighter ll that took the world by storm\u2014it\u2019s one of the most influential eras in time due to the advancements of technology. High Score Girl pays homage, like a love letter to those developers that built it and follows a historical timeline of real-world events when it comes to tech and the world of gaming. It\u2019s a romance that manages to care for itslove affair while equally caring for its portrayal of the 90\u2019s gaming era, a coming of age story that is truly a \u2018Blast from the Past.\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with 6th grader Haruo Yaguchi, seemingly a loser of sorts who is addicted to video games. On top of that he is a loud-mouth and boastful gamer that does terrible in school, neglects his studies, unpopular with girls and someone who would rather spend most of his time at an arcade in the next town where he is less likely to be hassled by his peers or teachers for breaking school rules against such places. Haruo is aware of how society perceives people like himself but he really isn\u2019t bothered by it, a matter of fact, he happily owns it and is very good at what he does. Games are his life, especially fighting games like Street Fighter. But one day the rug is pulled out underneath him by Akira Oono, a girl he sees as his polar opposite and rival.  She\u2019s rich, popular, quiet and most irritatingly, proves to be a prodigy at gaming. The mere thought of this is almost unbearable for Haruo.\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting bodied by Akira, Haruo declares her his rival and in hopes of one day getting his run-back. A bond develops between them, their mutual love for video games ties these two together which eventually leads to them falling in love. While the story is pretty straightforward, the complexity of it is really surprising given the type of series this is. It\u2019s something that catches you off guard and grabs your attention, wanting to see what happens next. The plot thickens when a new challenger appears in Koharu Hidaka, a fellow classmate of Haruo is introduced and becomes the third point in a love triangle. There\u2019s a stigma for love triangles in anime but have faith, High Score Girl handles it well. They show something we don\u2019t often like to talk about\u2014that love is messy. They show us that we don\u2019t always know as much about love as we originally planned, that love can create a wonderful relationship but sometimes love hurts because it doesn\u2019t always strike both ways. Sometimes, there will be someone left out.\\n\\n\r\nHigh Score Girl openly conveys the feelings of each character to the viewer and not to the other characters. The way its executed is really well done, it's like falling in love in the midst of self-discovery. It\u2019s made clear on who loves who but the characters themselves are holding it inside and waiting for that perfect moment. The characters have great chemistry\u2014they have strong motivation, dichotomous complexities, active within their roles, coherent conflict, they enact change and there\u2019s an ever-shifting dynamic of opposition and harmony. Despite the nuances mentioned about Haruo previously, he doesn\u2019t come across as annoying. There is a certain charm to his personality, he is relatable that he reminds you of the kid inside of us that enjoys the simple pleasures from the 90\u2019s. Despite his brashness, he slowly begins to realize that his rivalry with Akira is becoming something deeper, that he really does care for her. As excitement turned to obsession when playing against her, we see a transition where his goal to solidify the fact that he\u2019s number 1 shifted into wanting to just spend time gaming with her.\\n\\n\r\nAkira is very unique as in she doesn\u2019t say anything. Not a single word, rather her actions speak louder than words. The characters and us as viewers can tell exactly how she feels through her mannerisms and facial expressions, she speaks through her emotions from the heart. This is executed perfectly and she makes the show. Her upbringing could be the reason for her to be this way. Her family is trying to groom her in the most stereotypical way possible. Make her smart and marry her off to a pre-determined lover which will benefit the family greatly. This is another reason why she plays games, not only for the joy but to escape the reality that\u2019s been planned for her. Koharu is a daughter of a liquor store owner who just installed three-game cabinets in front of his shop. She is smart, responsible, and socially the opposite to Akira. She is someone who marvels at Haruo\u2019s passion for games, it\u2019s infectious and she becomes converted to it\u2014her and Haruo develop a really nice relationship. Naturally, she is talented and becomes really good, she plays to be acknowledged. She develops feelings and falls in love with him. She finds herself stuck between a rock as she struggles to find out if Haruo really loves her or does he just love games to the point where she\u2019s confusing his emotions. It\u2019s a prime example of how to feel a connection to a character through dialogue and this makes Koharu just as relatable.\\n\\n\r\nI am no fan of CGI and it was disappointing to see at first but quickly it just felt natural given the setting, the time period and the focus on retro gaming. The synergy between the gaming scenes and the main narrative had a fluidity to them. Credit to J.C Staff on a fantastic job, they absolutely nailed it with the art, colour palette and animation. Another great thing about High Score Girl is that Square Enix (the publisher) got permission from a lot of companies to use games like Street Fighter and incorporate the actual game into the anime. You see real Street Fighter gameplay with the exact in-game soundtracks\u2014this is for many other arcade games that are played by the characters. The soundtrack is amazing and it\u2019s brought to you by arguably the most prolific female video game composer in the world in Yoko Shimomura who is widely known for her works in Street Fighter ll, Kingdom of Hearts, Legend of Mana, Parasite Eve, Final Fantasy XV and the Mario & Luigi series. It\u2019s very nostalgic to hear all the 8-bit and 16-bit mix blended well with modern style tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from Rensuke Oshikiri\u2019s manga, High Score Girl was held back by licencing issues in 2014, at first, Square Enix had failed to get the proper permission to use trademarked games, even getting sued in the process by SNK Playmore. The anime was shelved and the manga was forced to cease publication. 4 years later, Netflix Japan picked it up and this is why the anime has flown under the radar. I was actually recommended to watch it by a friend and if he never did that I wouldn\u2019t have known of it. This easily makes it one of the hidden gems of 2018, it achieved everything it set out to be. One long arc taking place over several years, with each development flowing into the next which is like adolescence. It's surprisingly relevant in its depiction of the experience of growing up. High Score Girl is many things - a romance, a coming of age story, a homage to the world of Rensuke\u2019s youth. Rensuke\u2019s experiences are written into Haruo in the same way for Tsurumaki Kazuya\u2019s character Naota in FLCL. This series shows you exactly how to execute a generic story.\\n",

I like it especially when there are other main focuses of the plot. After finishing dozens of romance anime, I find it quite hard toget a romance show that would make me say \"wow, this looks interesting!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd High Score Girl was the hidden gem of this season.\\n\\n\r\nGood characters + good romance + good plot revolving about arcade games = watch it now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "Many times throughout my short existence, I truly believed that I grasped everything that there has been to see, that life could not throw anything at me that would faze me, surprise me, or make me lose the already very little faith I have in humanity, this anime managed to do that. I am absolutely shocked, dumbfounded, I cannot possibly begin to comprehend how this show has been not only given decent ratings, but excellent ratings, how anyone could possible like this show is beyond my level of comprehension and ability to empathize with other individuals. Hi-Score Girl should be shamed, a show that shouldbe highlighted as to why the industry has been going down the toilet ever since the early 2000's, This piece of \"entertainment\" is nothing more than a superficial merit-less piece of media that has managed to pull on people's nostalgia cords in order to pretend that it is something more than it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire premise is based around these middle schoolers playing video games back in the early 1990's, many avid video game fans will feel right at home with the numerous references to gaming culture. Hi-Score Girl entirely relies on nostalgia, as otherwise the show has absolutely no merit on its own, basically waving all these references to the viewer's face in order to distract them from the sheer incompetence and the utter lack of any talent that went into the production. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are not even characters, they are totally devoid of any reasonable human behavior and characteristics, the way they interact with one another is simply unhuman, the script suffers as a result with Hi-Score Girl just expecting the viewer to overlook nonsensical conversations between characters. Did I say conversations?, actually it's more like one-sided conversations, since the main female lead just refuses to speak, all she manages to do is to have a resting derp face, or to make a series of clueless experssions that she somehow expects everyone to grasp instantaneously. She is a horrid person, she hits and essentially abuses the male main lead due to the fact that she essentially expects him to mind read her in order to get along, if he doesn't immediately know what she wants, she retaliates in a physical manner, which of course is so incredibly romantic, considering somehow even with this obviously abusive/mentally-challenged behavior the male main lead starts to like the non-talking, physical abusive, derp looking girl. As for the main male lead, well he is not all that likable either, he is an overly hyper and irresponsible brat, his over dramatic reactions to every single event is beyond annoying and tedious. I could write an entire essay on how poorly written these two characters are, but I will save you the suffering from that, clearly whoever wrote these two characters has no understanding of how human conversations work or how humans behave in general. This has been a common theme the past few years in anime with human characters that don't behave/act even remotely human, Hi-Score Girl is one of the worst in recent memory in this regard, and should be taken notice as a study guide on how not to portray human characters in a relatively grounded setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is downright pathetic and ugly, the main girl who is suppose to be attractive in this universe supposedly, looks nothing more than a derp. The background are abysmal, lack detail and any sense of effort. Music is just awful, the opening theme is typical modern non-sense that doesn't even fit the horrendous opening animation. I had enough, just writing this review has given me a brain aneurysm, in short Hi-Score Girl is an abomination, devoid of any merit, meaning or skill, the fact that this is highly rated on this site has me worried for the future of this industry.",

Video games generally provide a reward system such as a score calculated based on the level of success achieved in completing tasks in the game.\r\nThe word \"video\" in \"video games\" initially refers to a raster display device. But with the use of the term \"video game\", now the word video game can be used to refer to games on any display device. The electronic systems used to run video games are called platforms, for example personal computers and game consoles.\r\ntaking the theme in the year one thousand ninehundred and ninety one in that year the video game is still experiencing its popularity, a child named \"Haruo Yaguchi\" spends his days playing video games regardless of how his future destiny is as if the world is just a link between himself and video games .\\n\\n\r\nThe manga composed by \"Oshikiri Rensuke\" has made JC Staff studios make this series as an anime series. JC Staff made this series feel good and have a big impact (to be honest this studio has adapted some good manga / light novels for example Shokugeki no Souma and of course Shakugan no Shana which was adapted by three seassons).\\n\\n\r\nno part of the voice is like eating without a drink, it doesn't feel complete if an anime doesn't have a supportive voice. For this series of voice actors, \"Suzushiro Sayumi\" acts as Oono Akira (although Oono's character rarely speaks) \"Hirose Yuuki\" acts as Hidaka Koharu and \"Amasaki Kouhei\" act as Haruo Yaguchi.\\n\\n\r\nfrom the song theme section, it might be quite fitting and well, the opening song \"New stranger\" which was sung by Sora Tob Sakana was so good even though I don't know who he was, but what made me like the series this time for the closing theme song could be a favorite \" Houkago die strauction \"which was sung by Etsuko Yakushimaru.\\n\\n\r\nin this series maybe at the beginning of the episode Haruo Yaguchi was an academic fool and only liked video games after the meeting with Oono Akira Yaguchi began to regard him as a rival but after a while Oono left Japan for a reason. When Oono left we got or the appearance of playing the third character, Hidaka Koharu, acts as an encouragement even though she also has feelings with Yaguchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe series adapted by JC Staff this time is more prominent on the impression of romance and honesty, I as an audience are very enthusiastic about this series and can't wait for the story to continue where a child who often goes to the place of video games begins to have feelings for his rival and his meeting with Oono Akira grow the seeds of love are very good to watch for teenagers and adults.\\n\\n\r\nin the end we as humans also have a sense where we want to relieve stress from our daily busyness with the existence of video game games which are now very sophisticated and this series reminds us that we do not fall into a world that is only temporary.\\n\\n\r\nif you expect a happy life forever then fight from now on because of the future what we do today.",

            "content": "High Score Girl is one of the theses seasonal shows that quietly snuck up on me at the of the Summer 18 season. It was a manga series done by Oshikiri, Rensuke and until mid August where it Netflix announced they will be streaming the series in December 2018 the show least for a short while was hanging around in obscure vile and even after that Netflix announced the series is still pretty obscure compared to almost every other anime from this summer season.\r\nFast forward to late September where I was done watching throwaway seasonal anime from this season like Angel Of Death, How toNot Summon a Demon Lord and Happy Sugar Life I decided to check out High Score Girl after leaving the show in my plan to watch list for so long. Then I watched it and after watching all 12 episodes of this I can defiantly say this. High Score Girl is not only the best anime from this season but it's also one of the best modern anime romcom to ever come period. I completely underestimated this show because at first, I thought this would be another forgetful romcom anime but this series completely blew me away in terms of writing, characters, music, romance and plot to a point where the series became a masterpiece\\n\r\nThe story follows Haruo Yaguchi who is a gamer who spends he's all free time at the arcades playing various retro games such as Street Fighter II than take his daily life seriously, earning him the title Beastly Fingers Haruo. However, things would take a turn one day when he encounters honour student and rich girl Akira Oono dominating everyone else at his favourite game with Zangief. Having lost to her 7 times in a row and eager to break her 29-win streak, he resorts to underhanded tactics with his own favourite character Guile, an act which earns him a solid right hook from the otherwise quiet and aloof girl\u2014and ultimately sparks their rocky relationship as she brazenly follows him from arcade to arcade after school.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of High Score Girl is brilliant and sweet.\\n\r\nRight from the gate, the show makes a great first impression where the show fantastically shows us the setting of the series with its early 90s gaming atmosphere where there are people standing up watching the players playing various arcade games. Not only that but it greatly introduces it's main two chararters in a form of a Street Fighter match where up to that point they have never interacted with each other.\\n\r\nIt is series is effectively a coming of age tale of two people who meet up thanks to the hobby of gaming as well them understanding how the world really works outside of gaming. \\n\r\nAt first this show may appear as your typical happy romcom anime however as the series progresses the show becomes more than just your typical romcom anime where the anime slowly dives into serious and relatable themes such as lack of free will, child abuse, letting go of your hobbies in favour of improving your studies and helping people get into the medium that you love and am glad that the show was able to handles theses theme with respect. \\n\r\nThe romance in this show is very well handled. At first, Haruo and Oona don't have much chararter chemistry with each other but at the series progresses these two started to understand each other thank to video games to a point by the end of the series you feel like they are made for each other.\\n\r\nEven though this show a rom-com at heart it was still a great detail that adds more life to this show world.\\n\r\nThe one thing that I loved about High Score Girl is how the show perfectly presents gaming in the 90s era. Before the days of Fortnite, Call Of Duty and League of Legends where people play these games online people would go to the arcades to play various games such as Street Fighter II, Final Fight, Vampire Hunter Darkstalkers Revenge etc. Not only that but compared to modern gamers today where they mostly spend the time talking to people online thanks to the power of the internet people around that time would ask face to face if they co-op/versus match with them.\\n\r\nAnother thing that I liked about High Score Girl that was that the gaming industry develops alongside the characters for example in episode 1 people are playing the arcades as well SNES/Genesis however after episode 8 onwards people in the show started to talk about Virtual Boy, Sega Saturn and PlayStation 1 showing us how much the technology has evolved since episode 1. You would think that the attention of detail would be pointless in the overall narrative but it isn't as it perfectly tackles the themes of catching up, pride and getting left behind. In episode 10 when Harou lost to Koharu in both Street Fighter and Vampire Hunter Darkstalkers Revenge he didn't simply lose the fight but he's slowly losing his gaming pride as while all the new games and consoles were coming out Haruo was studying hard to get the high school that Oono is in and because of all that hard work Haruo literally started to struggle to play games for a while. This doesn't end there the social commentary in High Score Girl is extremely well handled. Throughout the show, characters would often commentate on a certain games/consoles as well as nongamers giving they views on the game industry. For example Haruo mother despite her being clueless about video games she doesn't mind Haruo playing video game even if his grades are at rock bottom. On the other side, we have Oono's private tutor who thinks that video games are a big waste of time and she doesn't\u2019 want her to be part of the gaming crowd\\n\r\nOverall the story in High Score Girl was amazing as it\u2019s not only a great throwback to 90s gaming but it\u2019s the best modern love story I have ever seen.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nNow we have the charters and to be frankly honestly the characters are all awesome and enjoyable in they own ways.\\n\r\nFirst up have our main protagonist Haruo who is an anti-social boy who has a passion for video games. Haruo may start off as a generic romcom geek protagonist he quickly became one of the most relatable character I have ever seen in a long while.\\n\r\nThe way that he develops over the course of this series was as he went from being an anti-social kid who just sat down playing video games to a sociable person who starts caring more about the world as well Onna by trying his best to reduce his gaming addiction just so he can better person. It doesn't stop there the way he behaves and acts towards people was a nice portrayal of gamers from the 90s as whole were they so passionate toward video games that they either stay in the arcades playing games until closing time or pretending to be ill so they can play more games missing school in the progress. Overall brilliant chararter and he's by far my favourite chararter in the series. \\n\r\nNext, we have Akira Oona who is the silent rich daughter of the Onno family who sneaks away every so often to the gaming arcades to escape the harsh environment at home. Despite her being mostly silent in the anime I really enjoyed Oona. Instead of being another typical loud tsundere type she uses facial expressions that what she likes and what she hates. This alone makes Oono a complex chararter because the only way we relate communicate with Oono is by facial expressions. Unlike Haruo where he a great gaming life Oono gaming life is pretty sad as she has a strict private tutor that prevents her from going the hobbies that she enjoys doing like playing Video Games and while all that drama is going on she doesn't say a word as she show us her facial expression of what she's feeling. Overall great character.\\n\r\nFinally, we have Hidaka a girl who has no real hobbies. I really like her. At first, I thought she would just love triangle bait for the main two however as the series progresses she beings her own character where instead of interfering with the potential couple she actually supports Haruo by helping him get closer to Oono. Her character doesn't end there she actually starts getting interesting playing video games and by the 10th episode, she becomes a competent gamer for fighting games.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were great for what they were as they are all fun and entertaining to watch especially Haruo's mom.\\n\r\nOverall the characters High Score Girl were amazing and it's easily the series biggest strength\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhile the story and chararters were amazing I sadly cannot say the same thing the visuals because this is easily the weakest part of High Score Girl. Okay the visuals aren't necessarily bad in fact I don't mind if a show goes for a different visual style but the problem with High Score Girl is how the show uses it's CGI. When the show it's at best visually the anime can look pretty good however a lot of the show can look rough especially the first half where the CGI was at it's worst. It eventually did get better in the second half as the show more constraint with its CGI but I honestly wish the show could have handled the CGI a bit better where it can attract the mainstream audience of anime fans. It's such a shame really because the show is outside its use of CGI is very good especially when the show uses actual footage of video games that are been played by real skilled people. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in High Score Girl is an amazing throwback piece towards the 90s gaming as many of the tracks in the anime have that nice retro 16-bit mix to it along with a couple of modern tracks. \\n\r\nThe opening theme New Stranger by sora tob sakana is a fantastic opening theme that perfectly captures the show tone and setting of the series with a nice blend of modern and 16-bit style. Not to mention it's very catchy. \\n\r\nThe ending theme \"Houkago Diestrauction by Etsuko Yakushimaru is a clam and relaxing theme that perfectly closes each episode of High Score Girl. While it's not as great as the opening theme it's still a good song that is memorable on its own right. \\n\r\nThe voice acting in High Score Girl is incredible. The Seyiuss all did a fantastic job on the roles that they were given. Not only was the voice acting well acted but the characters react to the games based on voice acting alone was great as they all sound like actual gamers that either won or lose a game. \\n\r\nAt this time of the review, High Score Girl hasn't got an English Dub, however, like with Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan the show will be dubbed sometime in the future by Netflix.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nHigh Score Girl is another modern anime masterpiece.\\n\r\nSure the CGI in the show wasn't that great however the writing, romance, music, characters, and the great use of gaming references completely make up to a point where we can ignore the shows meh use of CGI. The show was truly a wonderful experience I will never forget and because of that, I thank the people who make High Score Girl for making this wonderful anime that perfectly shows that the story and characters come first before the production values.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 9.5/10",

            "content": "Summer 2018 will pass as one of the most mediocre seasons for me, but it was saved by High Score Girl.\r\nThe video game story concept is one of the most popular but also one of the most difficult to create. It requires an unusual plot to satisfy a difficult and demanding audience. Gladly, High Score Girl does a marvelous job and delivers one of the most amusement stories in this field. The series mixes the historical video game developing (the 90s) with an amazing plot where the memories of any gamer will have some empathy. In this world, we are all experts but also weare ignorant, and sooner or later our talents will meet challengers as happens in this fascinating story. But what can I tell you about the 90s? This decade is one of the most important technologically speaking. The internet was born on 1990, the CPU (first Pentium) and GPU (shading and rendering) appeared as we know them today. The video games transcended thanks to those hardware advances, Google appeared in 1995 and many other tech stuff that we use day after day saw the light in the 90s. We need to thank the 90s for our actual technology, and this anime is a tribute to all those developers that shaped our world. High Score Girl is one of the best gaming anime representations that follow a real historical timeline.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is straightforward and very easy to follow. It creates relationships from usual clich\u00e9s such as video game challenges. The plot occurs in a casual world filled with arcade machines and game centers; it creates a magnificent 90s ambiance where the main characters converge and interact refreshingly without the need of the average slice of life comedy story. The plot is hilarious, dramatical and romantic. However, the most amazing part is the characters' synergy with a well-elaborated plot. We have three main characters, the typical gaming freak, the challenger that never speaks but she is very expressive reminding me of the phrase \u201caction speaks louder than words\u201d and the converted. All the three characters in some way are rivals with certain personal interests but also friends. I like that idea of rivalry; it is not the typical garbage where the rival is awful, boring and pedantic. It is a rivalry where the main characters want to be noticed between them as rivals, friends and more.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great factor, the gaming references. The plot utilizes some games to boost the narrative. Perhaps the biggest reference is with the Street Fighter franchise. The series uses characters such as Guile to propel the narrative, and they do it very well. We can say this game character is an active part of the story. Additionally, all the arcade and classic game references are just amazing. I almost lost my breath after watching Bomberman and Elevator Action, and I am not that old. Furthermore, I am surprised that several companies agreed to allow the anime to use a massive group of references. It is not normal because the rights and licenses are a pain or ask the author because the manga was in a hiatus for a dispute with SNK.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the characters. In one word synergy. Perhaps the chemistry between the characters is the most important when you design a group of characters. As one of my old animation co-workers said: \u201cFirst create a background, then figure the synergy between the characters, and if you can't do it, the story will be a fiasco.\u201d  We have three main characters, the freak, the challenger and the converted as I said before. \\n\\n\r\nThe freak is Harou Yaguchi. The typical gaming lover. He likes the challenges and wants to be the best. Also, he has a charming side, and he cares of his friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe challenger, Oono Akira. For me, she is the most amazing character because never talks, but the actions and expressions help us to understand how she is feeling. She is Harou\u2019s main rival, very lonely and I think she suffers a lot.  I want to add a parenthesis here; it is unrespectful mocking the seiyuu because she never talks. If you pay attention, she needs to recreate some particular sounds or minimal sound ambiance to add emotion and action to the scene, if you think that it is easy you do not value all the work of a voice actor. \\n\\n\r\nThe converted, Hidaka Koharu. I am not going to spoil about her. I consider her as the story breaking point. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the art, it is good. The use of CGI is smooth. They combined some 3D and Live2D techniques creating a very appealing series that has a nice palette color, good lighting model and a very reasonable camera angle use. Furthermore, they add old video games references that improve the story flow and adds nostalgic feeling. The art, in general, is amazing, and I liked and enjoyed it   \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music are great. The ED for me is the best; I love those lyrics, no idea why :3. The VO is good, and the score and games sound is perfect. In general, the sound timing is good and does help the plot outcome and the main events. \\n\\n\r\nAs a negative aspect, we have the overuse of the CGI. The transition between CGI and 2DLive could be rough, but it is one of the small limitations between the techniques. I understand some spectators try to avoid the CGI shows. However, High Score Girl deserves a try no matter if you love video games or casual comedies.\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s often times when I feel a bit of nostalgia in life. Who doesn\u2019t really? The 1990s may not be technological advanced compared to our current modern times but it had great music, a more relaxing atmosphere, and moments that we\u2019ll never forget. I remember the days when people actually went to places like Blockbuster to rent home videos rather than binge watching Netflix. People weren't on their phones half the day. Nowadays, everything is just too convenient and people operate at their homes through the digital web. Why do I mention this?\r\nIt\u2019s because High Score Girl made me feel a bit of that nostalgia.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though. I love the convenience of our current times and everything being so simple. However, watching High Score Girl gave me the impression of old school video gaming nostalgia. I was never too big about retro games or playing at the arcades. However, the contemporary times of this show made it feel like it\u2019s both realistic and inspiring. As a series about video games, it takes an approach at decorating its story with a 1990s sensation.\\n\\n\r\nWe meet 6th grader Haruo Yaguchi from the start and he is not exactly someone I\u2019d describe as popular at school. He\u2019s a video game addict who spends his time playing games than studying or doing anything else. In many ways, Haruo doesn\u2019t really have a goal in life other than to be the best gamer. His favorite genre seems to be fighting games such as Street Fighter II. He even earned a self-proclaimed title by calling himself \u201cBeastly Fingers Haruo\u201d. His life seems to be unchanging until meeting a rich girl named Akira Oono. After getting curb stomped by her at video gaming, it became obvious that he is no longer the best. This sets the main story as we see the relationship between the two and how they develop.\\n\\n\r\nJumping into this series felt unusual at first. It felt like a coming of age story that mixes in drama, comedy, and even some romance. The last part isn\u2019t noticeable at first so I\u2019ll get to it later. Rather, the story chronicles about how Haruo\u2019s character changes throughout the series. In the beginning, he is more of a brat who tends to get angry when things don\u2019t go his way. You ever seen a kid rage at video games because he lost like a sore loser? That\u2019s the sort of imagery you can imagine coming from Haruo. However, meeting Oono changes his character as he matures and becomes a more tolerable person. I think it\u2019s rather ironic that he offers to be friends with Oono as the two are more like rivals in the beginning. However, the show makes it clear that there\u2019s a skill difference between the two though so perhaps it isn\u2019t really a close rivalry. I think it\u2019s important to address the friendship between Haruo and Oono as it develops into perhaps something more than just a bond. In later episodes, Oono seems to show feelings towards Haruo while the boy remains oblivious. It\u2019s more of an innocent affection than anything else since the series doesn\u2019t truly commit to romance. Despite this, I think it goes to show how far these two bonded together. Because let\u2019s face it, Oono is a character with a quiet nature. No one besides Haruo seems to be able to get close to her. Even with her popularity, she is shy and throughout the show, we never once hear her speak directly to a character. She is able to open herself more thanks to Haruo\u2019s influence and we see her show more emotions rather than being aloof all the time. There seems to be even feelings of jealousy coming from the girl in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWe eventually meet a girl named Koharu Hidata. Unlike Oono, she is more outspoken and easily fits with the crowd. Despite not being a child prodigy, Hidata is a much more sociable person as she is able to converse with anyone. Hidata\u2019s relationship with Haruo in the show is pretty typical that transforms from being normal friends to her developing a crush towards him. In terms of technical skills, she isn\u2019t as talented as Haruo or Oono when it comes to video games. However, the creators establishes her as a determined girl who wants to prove herself, and most importantly to Haruo. I\u2019d say that she is more of a tsundere after observing her behavior. You be the judge but Hidata does add a different side of the series. She fills the role of being a character that Haruo doesn\u2019t feel inferior to and can get along normally. Still, the series doesn\u2019t do a well job at building their relationship because as usual, Haruo is oblivious to romance like a stone cold rock. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of emphasis on these three characters so you\u2019re probably asking yourself if there are any others to worth mention. Unfortunately, most of the side characters in the series can be easily forgettable. Characters like Miyao (the chick magnet) hardly influences the story. The adult characters also makes little impact such as Oono\u2019s butler or Haruo\u2019s parents. It feels like these characters are just there and nothing more. Nonetheless, this really shouldn\u2019t sway your attention as the heart of the show is about how characters changes through common interests and how they understand each other. There\u2019s a good amount of heartwarming moments and clever comedy if you're into that too.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to not talk about the art style of this series. When it comes down to it, the show feels like a mixture of old school aesthetic blending with video game graphics. Even the theme songs is crafted with its peculiar video game style. Thankfully, it\u2019s very faithful to the manga especially in terms of character design. And on most parts, I think they did a phenomenal job at portraying Oono. Despite not speaking at all in the show, she is able to express herself with body language and facial expressions. It\u2019s important to also realize Oono\u2019s change in those expressions that represent her development. Meanwhile, I\u2019m also grateful for the realistic 1990s setting the series takes place in with the arcade games. Retro games like Street Fighter is shown with clever creativity while the graphic style represents the old school ways of playing. However, I wish the series presented more variety. Besides Street Fighter, there\u2019s hardly any other games that are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1990s really was a time that I missed. Everything just felt so simple and while I\u2019m not as dedicated to retro games as the characters in this show, it still made me want to play them. That is to say, they still exist in our modern times but playing them now just feels different. Nonetheless, this series isn\u2019t just about gaming but also how characters change. The creators really wanted us to get attached to the main characters and it worked. High Score Girl is a show that I recommend to anyone even if you\u2019re not a video game fanatic. It has enough of a story with themes and main characters that will get your attention.",

            "content": "I have been reading other opinions and positive praise around High Score Girl, but I still don't get why this is supposed to be so good and the savior of summer 2018 anime.\r\nIt's just a generic love story where the main dude is an over exaggerated character whose behavior is the outcome of \"anime\" and not any personality traits. The main female is perfect gamer and student, beautiful and ideal girl with tragic past story AKA a textbook example of a Mary Sue. There is also another girl in the series who creates the fallacy of harem, but she only appears in few episodes andher entire purpose in the series is to have silent monologue inside her head where she praises the main dude for being so amazing and kind and perfect, and cucks herself for the \"canon pairing\". \\n\\n\r\nThe romance is build around retro gaming and that arguably offers some nostalgia and the only content that is really worth of anything in the series. The romance writing itself almost entirely relies on the Mary Sue traits of the female lead where we get cliches that commonly occur in shoujo romances, and the main dude acting like prince charming whose life resolves around the Mary Sue chick. Of course, the anime is just a fraction of the story and almost nothing outside sol happens in the romance, mainly because the girl is awkward and weird and the dude is dense above all else. In fact, at this point it's safe to say that the whole thing exists just to advertise the manga which is an obligatory read unless S02 gets confirmed. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is almost never funny. In the first half of the series, it relies on goofy animation tricks and similar over exaggerated situations as the main dude's behavior. This is best seen in scenes where the mc gets hit by a car and spin in the air for something like 20 times or gets kicked in the nuts by other characters. The 2nd half didn't even attempt to do any comedy anymore outside mc's mom and few reliefs.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is real nice and the retro gaming side of the story is entertaining to watch, but the romance writing is closer to pathetic than anything else and our characters are mediocre, average at best. \\n\\n\r\nI already wrote a longer review earlier but it was buried under the praise so I will leave this as a short explanation on why I don't personally find this series to be amazing at all. Sure it was okay to watch, but I wouldn't personally go praising story or characters of this sort.",

            "content": "It's rare to see series like this that is very niche: Covering nostalgia in the form of retro arcade games, to their home conversions and the like. However, this is certainly not an anime for everyone, and solely caters to the gaming audience of old times lore, whom for all intensive purposes, will love this overlooked anime.\r\nThe story goes of the early gaming scenes in the early 90s (specifically 1991 and beyond), where Japanese retro arcades (at that time) had a massive following due to the big wave of top-tier games, and that accelerated with the release of Street Fighter II, that single-handedly revived oneof the best gaming periods ever in the history of gaming. So naturally, casual gamers flocked into the arcades to try out the hit sensational game, and that is no difference to 6th grader Yaguchi Haruo, who has been living his life off games. Unlike typical school children, he is neither every good thing nor entertaining at the greatest degree, his passion is just to be a crazy gaming fanboy cashing in on the video game craze. So one day, while tormenting rookies at Street Fighter II, he comes across an mysterious sight of fellow classmate Oono Akira, whom so happens to also play the game, and sadly got rekted embarrassingly badly by her. Determined by his flare to never concede defeat, amidst her quietness and shyness of following Haruo around to play arcade games, and finding himself conceivably getting \"cucked\" by Oono in EVERY game played, only once did he win over her with the reward being a punch in the face (ouch, Haruo). From there, the weirdness of both Oono and Haruo's love-comedic relationship ensues out of ridicule and resolution (for Haruo to defeat Oono, even once would be great to sing praises over himself).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime adaptation of the manga is perfectly synchronized and doesn't cut corners, explaining to us of the gaming backgrounds that perfectly set the charts of events that our male MC went through. Overtime, the gamer scenes backspaced into the core understanding of the characters, most notably, the struggles of Haruo with not wanting to let go of the gaming craze that set his heart ablaze, to Oono and rival Koharu Hidaka fighting for Haruo's love affection (which we all know he doesn't care, not even the slightest). From there the dignifying love rom-com aspect takes Numero Uno, first place to uncover what makes the characters tick their bones and define what they truly do.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I'm sad that the one-dimensional aspect of the characters played a big part here (which can be boring), but what I'm assured about is the same aspect that would help define the characters here and play a massive part of their exposition:\\n\\n\r\nYaguchi Haruo, typical gamer, has nothing worthy of his self-worth to add into his name, but his love for retro games serve as the main catalyst of his life as a growing gamer, basically nothing stands in his way of the love of games, and will not hesitate to trample on anyone to reach his desires.\\n\r\nOono Akira, the well-rounded character who is forced to be everything society demands of her: coming from a \"big house\" name and following in her parents' footsteps, she yearns for the outside life, and Haruo plays a major significance in her life, serving as her means of escape of everything that demands her attention and recognition.\\n\r\nKohaku Hidaka, the 3rd wheel in the relationship between Haruo and Oono, she seems like the atypical crush-after-boy figure, chasing after our male MC in the world of gaming (which at first isn't very accustomed to), eventually learning his traits and catching up to him in order for Haruo to notice her (see the similarity of love rom-com)?\\n\\n\r\nIt's impressive that this series manages to compartmentalize the characters and their growth, which in turn sets the overall pacing which is great and doesn't feel like an incomplete set of events that just so happened to trail past us by.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is one I'm actually caught by full surprise. Knowing how the manga actually try to incorporate the exact forms of the various amount of game aesthetics, the anime adaptation has to fulfill that core information, and it's very subjective. Having veterans J.C.Staff to do this adaptation is rest assured by all means (mostly for 2D background art), but that CGI animation, oh hell does it deliver despite its wonkiness and uncertainty that at anytime the production means will falter. The last time this actually happened is Fall 2017's Houseki no Kuni (which was a CGI masterpiece), and with High Score Girl, to be able to input this much effort with the perfect replication of retro games, it is something that you have to get used to it, with the overall quality up to your varying tastes for good CGI animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one hardcore reference to the retro game vibes of the 90s. Both the OP and ED forebodes the 8-bit musical style that will be noticeable and reminiscent to old retro gamers, along with the lyrics (if you have time to analyze them), and is a perfect fit for the entire show itself. Personally I had fun listening to the OST, never skipped them, which was a blessing indeed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, why does the Summer 2018 season have so many noticeable-and-mediocre and underrated-and-overlooked shows, we will certainly not know. What I do know is that this anime falls into the \"underrated-and-overlooked\" category, and is certainly another sleeper hit. I would only recommend this show to avid retro and casual gamers if you want to know how is it like for another medium to condense the entire retro gaming structure. Besides, what's not to have fun when games are at the central of it all?",

            "content": "I've been a fan of High Score Girl since the manga and I think the anime is a pretty good adaption of it overall. The score it currently has really doesn't suit it but it might be because it's not for everyone I personally think it's great due to the atmosphere, story, comedy and of course the retro video games.\r\nThe story takes place in 1991 when the main character, Haruo finds the rich quiet girl Ono, playing a game of Street Fighter 2 at an arcade and defeating everybody who challenges her, even our guy Haruo. Eventually through blood, sweat and cheap tactics Haruo stealsa win off her and in retaliation she punches him right in the face, and that's how this love story start.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let the CGI fool you, this isn't just some cheap anime that's trying to rope you in because it has retro video games (although, that is why I was roped in, and they're great). The anime itself has great comedic moments, heartfelt moments and even some dramatic and shocking moments. The anime can have you gawking at the accurate retro games to laughing your arse off to Ono punching Haruo whenever he gives a cheeky remark to worrying over whether or not Ono and Haruo will play another game at the arcade again! There can be cute moments from Ono being scared of spooky games and there can be uncute moments such as a guy asking to see the bone in Haruo's penis, but that's a story for another time.\\n\\n\r\nThe main aspect of the anime is obviously the retro video games, but as time goes on they take a backseat I'd say. You really get to love the characters and the games just become set pieces, but fun set pieces because you can feel the joy of seeing them just like the main characters. If you're a fan of cute romance stories, comedy and retro games then definitely give this one a try, I'd say it's AOTS just from the first four episodes., there really is nothing like it as well it's such a unique and interesting anime that even if you're not a huge fan of retro games you should give it a watch just for the environment it is set in.\\n\\n\r\nThe only negatives I can really give this show is that, the first episode can be quite slow due to setting things up and being a collection of stories but the later episodes don't have this, and another negative could be the CGI although you hardly notice it as you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find High Score Girl to be a unique and interesting anime just because of it's setting being untapped in anime, but it doesn't mean it's a story trying to sell itself with retro video games. It's a cute love story and I think that the games help give it a unique story and plot device to bundle it all up in.\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n-Retro games galore from the gameplay to the sound effects\\n\r\n-Cute Romance Story\\n\r\n-Has a lot of funny moments\\n\r\n-Cute heartfelt moments as well, has a few tearjerkers as well\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n-Episodes can be slow, the first one especially\\n\r\n-CGI can be an eyesore depending on who you ask\\n\\n\r\nAs of now, there are no subs from official groups, but there are some fansubs out there to find, so keep an eye out. I'd give it a 8/10 just because it's really what you can expect from the manga and more. I'm also happy that the score has gone up from a 6.7 to a 7.1, I hope this can at least break a 7.5.\\n\\n\r\nAlso please excuse how awful this review is, I just noticed there was none so I wrote one up at 3am, and then it was removed due last week and I just wanted to repost it when the 4th episode came out.",

            "content": "I love games. Yep, what a shocker. I played games since I was 1 and I know a lot about them. I especially have a soft spot from games around the 90s, even though I was born in the 00s. These games are just so cool, fun and iconic. So an anime that is centered around arcade machines in 90s would be great fun, right?  \r\nEh... it is a mixed bag. I already didn't have high standards for this season (because this season is the weakest season by far this year), but this just is not good. Not bad, but also notgood. Grab your joysticks and get the high score, this is my review of High Score Girl.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nHaruo is a gamer who fails at school and wants to escape that.. by playing games. One day a girl seems to be better then him, a strange fellow named Akira who doesn't talk. They form a strange bond. I don't want to get further into the story, because then it goes into spoilers, but I can at least say that it is an alright story. Not anything to complain or to praise.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe first thing that you notice when seeing High Score Girl is its animation. Yep, our good friend CG strikes again. And it is not even that bad, but there is also normal 2D animation and it just constantly switches. It annoys the heck out of me. The artstyle is also not that great, with the only good looking character being Akira. The art can look competent at times, the keywords being AT TIMES, because in every other instance it just looks ugly.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe OST is forgettable, except for the OP and ED. The OP is pretty good and catchy, but dammit don't I like the ED. If it was competent I would've given the music a 7, but that ED is just not good.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nLet's begin with Akira: She is the most expressive character despite saying nothing. She is shy, violent, but still is a kid. I like her, atleast gallons more then Haruo. Haruo has mastered the ''tell, don't show'' method. He explains everything. Oh, a game? LOOK AT HOW AWESOME THIS GAME. Oh, Akira shows emotion? LOOK AT HER SHOWING EMOTION. Oh, I have an emotion? I AM FEELING AN EMOTION! Good god if Telsell needed new hires he would be on the top of their list! And this only makes the biggest flaw of this anime worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nThis anime is sponsered (or something like that) by Square Enix and they make it pretty fucking clear. This anime is more a commercial for Square Enix then an anime. Don't get me wrong, I like some Square Enix games from time to time, but I don't like ads shoved into my face. They constantly show Square Enix games, they constantly pitch (yes, pitch!) Square Enix games, they have Square Enix ads in the middle and the whole plot is revolved around Square Enix games. The most apparent example for me was in episode 4 in the middle when they showed an Puyo Puyo app which the characters of show suposendly were playing. THERE WERE NO FUCKING MOBILE PHONE GAMES IN 1992 YOU FUCKING MONEY HUNGRY WOLVES. And it is a shame too, this anime has some genuine heartwarming and emotional moments and the humor is pretty good, but these constant ads shoved into my face just ruins my fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI am just more pissed of this anime existence then the anime itself. It has some quality put into it, but at the wrong fucking places. If you don't mind ads in your anime, then fine, more power to you, but I just can't stand this.",

            "content": "High Score Girl's soul fundamentally lies in it's throwback setting to the golden age of arcades, the fighting genre and videogames in general, but the show doesn't use this setting as a crutch but rather makes something special out of it.\r\nYaguchi is an arcade/videogame addict who self-proclaims that  his only value as a person is his talent in video games, so he always spends his time in arcade, beating other people and feeling good about himself. So naturally a girl named Oono comes and beats the sh*t out of him, both figuratively and literally, story ensues.\r\n  The show mainly uses videogames as aparallel to our world, but it's not forced, so it makes the show feel more legit and realistic. The main story on the other hand is more about the youth of these particular characters and how their interaction with each other affect them. It's basically a romance story with slice-of-life influences and video games as a bit of fanservice (and advertisements, a lot).\\n\\n\r\nThe very first moment I went into the show I immediately hated how anything looked, because this show unfortunately uses low-quality cg in it's art direction which is always concerning when it comes to anime. It's sad to know that this show will always look old and dated, as it already looks dated even today. But then things seemed to get better looking as the episodes went on, not sure if I was just getting used to the awful cg but then I realized what actually was going on.\\n\r\n The thing is, in stark contrast to it's low quality cg, this show actually has surprisingly good cinematography and atmosphere, provided by some nicely laid out background art. You're never confused as to where the characters are in relation to each other, it gives the show that visual depth to make the onscreen action believable.\\n\r\n It's snowing outside... we quickly rush into a local shop and play some video games as we catch some heat, it's cozy as hell.\\n\\n\r\nEven though one of the biggest reasons why I enjoyed this show is undoubtedly the characters, and they are decently written characters, when I look back I come to realize they were'nt really anything too exceptional. Rather, it's more interesting how these characters interact with each other, and how they shape each other as people as the show goes on, it's quite fun to see how much Oono changes Yaguchi as a person.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with the show is that it doesn't have any finality to it, as it quite simply can't since the manga is stil going. There will be two more episodes coming though (with the BD release if I'm not wrong) so maybe those will give some completeness to the show, but with the manga still going, I doubt it.\\n\\n\r\nHigh School Girl gets a strong 7.\\n\r\n While nothing too special, it's still a show I very much enjoyed and would recommend to anyone who likes cute romance stories, SoL and video games. It's definitely worth watching if you're into the genre.",

As someone that has is from the end '80's myself, I sure do remember it very slghty back then while I was still wetting the bed.\r\nStory: 6/10 (Fine)\r\nThe story sets off in 1991 when Street Fighter 2 gets released. But this animle is not really about games. It's more your generic love romance triangle story if you really have to boil it down with a lot of references with classic games like Street Fighter 2 back in the '90's. Since I never really played StreetFighter 2 myself since I was too young back in the day and I'm also not quite familiair with the whole francise. The closest of the series I had played for a bit was Street Fighter 3D Edition for the Nintendo 3DS. I'm more of a Tekken guy myself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 (Fine)\\n\r\nThe art-style is one of my biggest turn-off for this show for a show that's been made in the current year of 2018. When I saw the first episode, it was hard to decide I would contineu the series or not and to be honest; I don't really like to drop an anime just after one episode. But I somehow got used to it. It still doesn't mean I adore it. It feels so cartoony and blocky to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\nIf you want to feel nogalistic about the '90's and you have played games from that era, this show got you covered. It's pretty much it's main selling point if you ask me. All those gaming sounds surely makes you long for the '90's a bit again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 (Fine)\\n\r\nThe charaters are however quite like-able, but what bothered really me the most is that Oono (one of our main carathers) havent said a single word in the entire show. Is she shy? Is she mute? It never got explained why in the anime and it feels you're pretty much forced to perhaps read the manga to get more answers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10 (Average)\\n\r\nOver time I started to enjoy this show however, even with all the neatives I told you before. But that's maybe because I'm a romantic type of guy. Don't judge me. I also got a chuckle every now and then with our MC the video game addict. Another big turn-off for me was they have putted every now and then a commercial in the middle of the episode about the latest games that are coming out or are already out for on the Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4 and such and I really feel the need to adress this, because this is a turn-off to me. I'm here to watch anime, not to be a consumer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 (Fine)\\n\r\nDespite with all it's negatieves, it was a good watch I guess. This show has it's flaws for sure, but if you're into arcade games and old-school gaming from the '90's and like a bit of (triangle) romance, this would be your anime to watch. High Score Girl gets from me an overal score of 6/10.",

            "content": "With the number of anime that air per season, even with the large amount of anime fans, it\u2019s a given that some shows will simply fall through the cracks. I feel that High Score Girl is one of those shows.\r\nBecause of this, I found High Score Girl a hidden gem of this anime season. Not a diamond, mind you, but gem, nonetheless (think topaz).\r\nHigh Score Girl tells the story of Haruo Yagauichi, a crude slacker, and Akira Oono, the academically talented heiress to a wealthy family. What ties these seemingly incongruent characters together is their mutual love for video games.\r\nAnd if you, the viewer, loveclassic video games, you\u2019ll love High Score Girl, which is a love letter to 90s gaming. Both the arcade and console scenes are given love. If you played the games of this time or simply are tied to decade, you\u2019ll be hit with a blast of nostalgia. I personally adore video games, so even though, unlike Haruo, I\u2019m not big on fighting games, I still got to geek out. It was also nice seeing time progress and seeing Haruo gush over new releases. The anime does move forward in time (going from upper-elementary to the first year of Japanese highschool (sophomore year in America), and the anime utilizes this passage of time well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are written surprisingly well, with Haruo not being quite as dense as you\u2019d expect for an MC of his personality. Oono is hands-down one of the cutest characters I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of viewing. Her violent tendencies, while annoying at times, don\u2019t really detract from her character. Unlike some people, it doesn\u2019t make her insufferable, and somehow makes her even more cute. Her biggest shtick is that she doesn\u2019t speak, ever. While this can prove frustrating for some viewers, I think the show worked around it well. If I had more money, I\u2019d get her nendoroid.\\n\\n\r\n...then there\u2019s Hidaka.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s a romance, which comes into play very soon. It\u2019s a cute romance and the couple is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. While the anime doesn\u2019t pussyfoot the relationship in the beginning, it quickly loses steam as, you guessed it, a third player joins the game. Enter Hidaka, a member of Haruo\u2019s class who quickly develops a crush on him as he introduces her to the wonderful world of gaming. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it could be seen as a \u201cspoiler\u201d that there\u2019s a love triangle, I think it\u2019s only fair to inform you all. Love triangles generally bog down a show, and High Score Girl isn\u2019t spared...kind of. As a main character, Hidaka is quite fleshed out and she\u2019s sure to have her fans. However, the show makes it painfully obvious that Oono is the endgame, yet a large portion is dedicated to Hidaka and Haruo. While she\u2019s not a bad character, her inclusion seems to just take away from Oono\u2019s. In my opinion the love triangle doesn\u2019t really add a new dimension to the plot. It doesn\u2019t detract from it either, but that just makes it seem kind of unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the show\u2019s still good. \\n\\n\r\nThe main thing High Score has going against it is that there isn\u2019t much more to it. What you see is what you get. If you like video games and romance, you\u2019ll probably love this show. If you like one or the other, it might be a bit of slog. If you like neither, there won\u2019t be much for you. Even if you do like both, the show still seems to be missing something. The side characters are inoffensive, at best. Midway through the show, I simply had the feeling that High Score Girl was adequate. It wasn\u2019t bad, no, but it wasn\u2019t great either. I didn\u2019t find myself compelled to watch episodes right away. Still, it picked up again.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty great, but the art might prove a sticking point. The show is completely CGI, which is sure to be a turn-off for some viewers. Watching it can feel off at times. If you like the story, you\u2019ll learn to get used to it. For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s pretty harmless.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t comment on the ending because it ends on a cliffhanger, with the final episodes premiering in march of next year.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show is far from perfect, as a video game and romance fan, High Score Girl scratched an itch I never knew I had, and I\u2019ll be sure to watch the show\u2019s conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n7.1/10\\n",

I have watched the anime (well 5 episodes for now, cause it seems the anime is still airing) , and read the manga (49 chapters). I will try to keep my review to the anime only, but there is something, and that's I don't trust this review. I don't want to spoil it for people who will read the manga. But when newer episodes come, this review may no longer hold.\r\nBut for now, it's a typical heartwarming anime, a good one, but not one with much to talk about. Oh and yes, theseratings only apply to the anime's story, not manga I've read.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10) : Kind of hard to decide, as it really doesn't have much of a story. It's pretty much a boy and a girl. The boy doesn't care about anything but games, so he's dense to the girl's feelings. That really is just it. There is one more girl too, but they didn't even meet yet (but they might in the oncoming episodes). It's heartwarming and cute.\\n\\n\r\nArt(4/10) : Can't really defend this. Just look at it.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10) : It's fair, I suppose. Not much to complain about, but not that great either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8.5/10) : This is good, especially considering the genre. The game crazy boy,  a rich \"ojou-sama\" who also happens to be a crazy gamer, and one more girl who's just a cute normie. And then there's protoganist's mom. BEST MOM EVER !!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7.5/10) : Pretty cute and heartwarming. Quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7.5/10) : I suggest it.",

            "content": "What happens when you mix retro games with anime school children? Well, in some ways, you show someone\u2019s ideal childhood back when they were kids. Just kidding, this show isn\u2019t really very ideal (not sure if anyone would really want to be in our main characters shoes most of the time), but it\u2019s interesting to have that little nostalgia while also seeing a bit of a romance bloom. Now for those who don\u2019t know, I have a passion for video games but not really a strong one in playing them. I\u2019m a very casual gamer. The love I have for them is their graphics andstory rather then play. Old games awe me in their pixel art, newer games awe me in their high detailed designs, and indie games always seem to have a place in my heart with how deep their stories go and how they break the mold of what everyone on the outside thinks about video games. This show has that and a little more added for your normal anime style trope. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the main characters, and just like a character select screen, I\u2019ll let you pick who\u2019s first\u2026 (Just kidding, I seriously wish that could actually work though.) Our main character is Haruo Yaguchi. This show follows his life through elementary school through high school so it\u2019s hard to pin point his exact personality. As people grow so to does their personality and the way they react to different things. There are some constants though, he loves video games, he is good at them, and he likes a good challenge in video games. Normally I wouldn\u2019t like a character like him much, but there is a very strange amount of charm that seems to come from him that I like. It\u2019s his passion I think that draws me in. It\u2019s the same for anyone really, the spark that shows up when someone has fallen in love with something else, I am always interested in that spark. \\n\\n\r\nAt the same time that I like Haruo, I kind of don\u2019t fully like Akira Ono who is our second character. She is a very rich and popular girl who all the boys seem to fall for even when they were elementary school students when boys would normally be trying to space themselves from girls. She gets good grades, attends after school studies at home including flower arranging, piano, and all the other lessons a typical rich kid in Japan is supposed to learn, but her greatest passion seems to be sneaking away from all that just to play video games at an arcade. She feels a lot like a typical Tsundere character as she always seems to beat up on poor Haruo except for one thing, she is mute throughout the whole show. When I say I don\u2019t fully like her, it\u2019s the Tsundere part of her that I\u2019m not to big on as I see that time and time again in anime, but what I find fascinating with this show is the fact they did leave her mute. You only know what she is thinking from her gestures and facial expressions (and sometimes her feelings show through her game play) so a lot of time your left guessing what she is thinking. \\n\\n\r\nThe next person I would like to talk about is Koharu Hidaka. She becomes a classmate of Haruo\u2019s in his junior year\u2026 basically in the 4th episode so it\u2019s not spoilers really. From the first moment that she came on screen, I knew she was going to become a \u2018option 2\u2019 for our main characters affections just from how she sort of starts to interact with him. She\u2019s a lot like me in a way where I would call her a beginner or casual player. Someone who likes to watch others play instead of playing themselves for the most part. While she does get a small interest in games near the end of the 4th episode, she seems to only get into it because of Haruo. I like her but at the same time don\u2019t like her which is a very odd thing to say. I think that because she feels so much like me in a way, I feel like she doesn\u2019t really fit in with the story line that they were trying to get to. It\u2019s like they put her in just to say \u2018here is your love triangle everybody, will the new girl get the guy or will it be the childhood friend?\u2019 If they had integrated her more into the story line somehow, I think there would be more of a reason to have her there but with the 12 episode limit, they didn\u2019t have enough time to flesh her out or show how close she could get to Haruo to give her a fighting chance really.\\n\\n\r\nI love the fact that they start the show with them in elementary school and work their way up. The different little breaks of years gone by is filled in with a very basic low down of the advancement of video games within Japan and just how advanced they got though the years that we are missing in the jumps. It also shows just how dedicated the characters are to their love of the games. What got me really excited was that Haruo\u2019s first console he talked about was the Turbographic-16 which was part of some of my earliest gaming memories. My family and I would sit around and play Dungeon Explorer together when I was in elementary school so the show really brought back some fond memories. I think that was the biggest reason why I actually got interested in where this show was going.\\n\\n\r\nThe English voice acting is interesting, especially since Ono doesn\u2019t actually talk. Christine Cabanos is the \u2018sound\u2019 actor for Ono and she does an ok job for her but sadly it doesn\u2019t show her talent. Haruo\u2019s voice actor kind of made me a bit annoyed at first but then started to grow on me a bit as he got older. I think it was because Johnny Yong Bosch was his voice actor and throughout the whole time I watched the show up until I looked it up on wiki, I had no clue it was him. There have been a couple new voice actors that sound similar to him that the familiarity of his voice had me racking my head trying to figure it out. Also, when Johnny plays a kid, his voice can get a bit annoying it seems\u2026 (Sorry Johnny, still love most of your voice acting.) \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a little odd in my opinion, reminding me a little like the Korean style of art I have seen before. It\u2019s not a style I\u2019m normally drawn to but it does have its own charms. I do like some of the consistency\u2019s they did with how children grow up as its sometimes hard to make a character look older without losing what they looked like when they were younger. They had to do that for at least three separate time frames and in all of them, the children do still have the same air about them as when they were younger in their design. The odd thing about the art style is that they do sometimes randomly have this strange shading on the characters that shows they were 3D models which sort of breaks the show for me. I\u2019m detail oriented so if it first looks hand drawn and then that strange 3D thing, I end up losing my immersion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do love the nostalgia the show brought to me and the interesting story that came with it. It\u2019s not high on my list but it is one I probably will end up watching again. Just one warning, I would watch the first 5 episodes before you say you don\u2019t want to watch anymore. The show kind of changes around then which will make you know if you like this show or not.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I know that this series has been in limbo for an adaptation until just recently, but why the fuck are you planning waiting two seasons to do it?\u00a0 Come on, don't make High Score Girl suffer more.\r\nStory:\r\nLet's take a step back in time to the 1990's, where arcade slot machines were virtually the only way you would be able to access video games, and home consoles/PC gaming had not yet been developed enough for commercial use.\u00a0 Here we meet Yaguchi Haruo, a grade schooler who spends a lot of his free time playing PvP fighting games and racking up consecutive wins against those lesserthan him.\u00a0 It's here that he meets the mysterious Akira Oono, a silent girl with the gaming skills of a god who finally puts Haruo's ego in its place, causing him to go into a frenzy and vow that he claims revenge.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we look at High Score Girl, what we're really looking at the development of our main characters through their school years alongside the evolution of gaming as they move through the grades and home consoles are introduced later on in the series.\u00a0 Each episode chronicles the journey of Haruo vying to get his rematch with Oono, and the audience becomes privy to their relationship as Oono's problems and insecurities become more apparent and Haruo becomes less of an egotistical dick as they age.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the romance aspect of the show is something that I find to be the show's most questionable quality.\u00a0 Because the series employs the love triangle method as its way of pushing its protagonists closer together and enforce said romance, what we end up getting is a cheap way of creating romantic tension and try to further the show's romantic agenda.\u00a0 Had the show not had this, it would've had a lot more time to really push the main couple and not spend much of its latter story for a 'battle for the boy scenario'.\u00a0 What makes this point even more apparent is how the show's ending is a result of this kind of plotline, creating a romantic-based plotline which feels natural for the character in question, but not for who the series is ultimately about.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Nostalgia trip for arcade fans\\n\r\n+ Character growth for protagonists\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Love triangle bogs it down\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nYaguchi Haruo, known in his early days as 'Beastly Fingers Haruo' is the show's resident game addict and protagonist, whose only hobby is video games and proving his dominance as being one of the best in Street Fighter.\u00a0 His throne is ultimately taken down by Akira Oono, where his ego and shitty attitude gets the best of him, sending him in a spiraling fit where he vows to get his revenge.\u00a0 The best part about this show is how we see him grow throughout his school years, transitioning into a more humble character with his ego only showing during the moments where his superiority in video games becomes challenged.\u00a0 As usual with romance protagonists, he's dense, but this is one of times where I don't blame the guy because unlike most love interests, Oono doesn't talk.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterized with a doll-like exterior, Akira Oono is the 'High Score Girl', a studious individual from a well off family who manages to be a kind of mary sue for video games, being proficient at them to the point that every time we see her, she brings about something new that only just serves to show \"Yeah, she's really good at this.\u00a0 Almost too good\".\u00a0 This, coupled with Haruo's one-sided rivalry against her ends up putting her on a pedestal for a majority of the show's first half.\u00a0 A lot of Oono's character is 'show, don't tell', as her character being purposefully mute leads Haruo to ask questions and take executive action to learn and understand this previously unknown girl, adding a lot to his growth.\u00a0 That being said, her muteness is a double edged sword, since romance as a whole is very difficult to pull off without verbal communication, made even more difficult when her only method of actually talking is to growl, hit, headbutt, and assault Haruo whenever he pisses her off, which understandably will send mixed messages to the individual in question.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of our trio is Koharu Hidaka, the series's unfortunate third wheel who really doesn't deserve the treatment she's given.\u00a0 Her own arc about finding a hobby and falling for Haruo is what we're treated to in the second half, where she spends much of her screentime trying to get eyes on her even though deep down she knows she won't win.\u00a0 As much as I like her character, I don't fully understand what the executive choice on her is.\u00a0 She really only seems to be there to throw her hat in the ring and push the other two together, which feels pretty insulting considering we're treated to the extent of growth and confidence that Koharu previously didn't have at the start of her introduction.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSide characters don't really add much and primarily add filler to populate the masses that stand behind these three.\u00a0 If anything, the recurring positions only serve to drive the plot, and not much else.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Growth for main protagonists\\n\r\n+ A mute character that (for the most part) actually works\\n\r\n-\u00a0 \"Third wheel\" character unfortunately only made to be the third wheel\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff seriously has no consistency when it comes to art quality.\u00a0 On one hand you can have pretty shows like \"The Pet Girl of Sakurasou\", and on the other you can get completely CG messes like High Score Girl.\u00a0 The show is essentially Oshikiri-sensei's style for the manga made into computer graphics.\u00a0 Its unique style is added with these almost blocky character models show is really telling to how low budget the overall product is.\u00a0 Hell, their faces are basically just textures, and the only have two mouth flaps when they speak!\\n\\n\r\nMy theory is that J.C. Staff just took it after it had been in limbo for a long time, and put in as little money into it thinking it probably wouldn't make a profit given the series's niche qualities.\u00a0 Which if it's true, man that sucks...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, we're treated to the duo of\u00a0\"New Stranger\" by sora tob sakana, and \"Houkago Di(e)stra(u)ction\" by Etsuko Yakushimaru, a quirky OP with a lot of guitar riffs and retro sounds mixed in to drive into the nostalgia of those that grew up with arcade machines, and a more somber ED that exemplifies the deep-rooted issues that Oono has but doesn't talk about throughout the series.\u00a0 While personally I'm not too much of a fan of either of these songs, they are good and quite memorable tracks, as their unique qualities stand out, and mesh well with an equally unique show.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nHaving grown up with the sixth generation of virtual consoles, the nostalgia of arcade cabinets is lost on me and I sadly cannot relate to much of the hype for those who once spent hours in the afternoon inserting coins and playing them.\u00a0 That being said, High Score Girl is a show that garnered my interest and resulted in mixed feelings that make it difficult for me to find a place to put this show.\\n\\n\r\nOn one hand, the progressional eras provide a lot of growth for our protagonists and Oono's \"show, don't tell\" stylistic choice made with her being mute do a lot to better the overall storytelling of the show.\u00a0 Not only that, but Koharu is a great third addition to the cast, sadly held back by the fact that she's the show's coveted 'third wheel' in the relationship and has her role relegated as such later on, which is a shame because I like her more than Oono.\u00a0 Had the show just been about Haruo with either Oono or Koharu, I feel like the show would've been a lot better given how it could've just focused on one couple and develop that instead of devoting its time to a character meant to only catalyze the other relationship and feign romantic tension.\u00a0 It's just not good storytelling if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I still find that the show's good points outweigh its negatives.\u00a0 It's a niche show meant for those with nostalgia for an era where 3-D graphics were blocky and polygonal, yet still manages to find its footing in growing characters, even if the result of that is rocky at best.",

            "content": "What a clever little nuance factory cash grab...  is what I would say if I was an angsty hater predetermined to hipster up no matter what.  High score girl definitely surprised me,  scoring well enough in all 5 brackets to earn a mean score of 8.4 rounding down to a final [8/10].   So lets break down why High Score Girl is worth slamming your free time tokens into.\r\n          Thisstory has a multi tiered objective.  There are multiple themes coexisting, and the plot focus is balanced enough to not feel starved of any.  Not only are we being treated to a cute little story, we are getting a peek at social gamer stereotypes as well as a history lesson on the evolution of gaming.  It could have been so easy for this to have been a flop,  if they provided a weak balance of these elements expecting the nerd material to carry it to greatness,  oh the hate it would invoke.  Thankfully,  they took a risk and put in the effort, and the final result was a season of anime I think most anyone can watch and enjoy.   While it wasn't the most perfect fable,  I have no problem giving  High Score Girl an [8/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\n            Art and Sound:  The visuals were really flat despite the characters being more rounded, but it looked modern and fresh.  So nothing awe inspiring but nothing terrible. The ending theme to this anime was super fun and you can tell the voice actors had a good time recording their roles.   A lot of intentional over acting and I definitely enjoyed it.   Now,  the incorporation of visual and audio elements of the games showcased was done well.  However,  they were not designed for this anime.   That is just where they ended up.   So how do you score this?  Well with an agonizing bit of math and a calculator, of course.   After factoring in decision making as well as the original elements and other variables,  both visual and audio boast a [8/10].    \\n\\n\\n\r\n             The characters for this show were decently human, and the exaggerations were kept to a believable but still fantastic level for comedy.  Then there was Akira, to be able create and display a character that ..  well no spoilers, but I was bewildered by this character.  The coexistence and connection between the main and his rival, is seemingly impossible to create with those limitations. The greatness is real,  [9/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\n                  Enjoyment [9/10]  I watched an episode,  I did laundry,  I watched an episode, I did the dishes, eventually I found myself with a really clean apartment and no more episodes.  While loving it enough to binge in tandem of my spring cleaning,  completing the season has left me to blue to truly appreciate my newfound tidiness.  So whether you are looking for cute fun story, or your house is a mess,  I highly recommend watching High Score Girl.    -   Grizziff Kingsbeard, house maid.",

            "content": "We go back in time to the year 1991 where we get to relive the gaming industry\u2019s second golden age. A meteoric rise from the grassroots of Japanese Arcades thanks to a new wave of top-tier games, one in particular, Street Fighter ll that took the world by storm\u2014it\u2019s one of the most influential eras in time due to the advancements of technology. High Score Girl pays homage, like a love letter to those developers that built it and follows a historical timeline of real-world events when it comes to tech and the world of gaming. It\u2019s a romance that manages to care for itslove affair while equally caring for its portrayal of the 90\u2019s gaming era, a coming of age story that is truly a \u2018Blast from the Past.\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with 6th grader Haruo Yaguchi, seemingly a loser of sorts who is addicted to video games. On top of that he is a loud-mouth and boastful gamer that does terrible in school, neglects his studies, unpopular with girls and someone who would rather spend most of his time at an arcade in the next town where he is less likely to be hassled by his peers or teachers for breaking school rules against such places. Haruo is aware of how society perceives people like himself but he really isn\u2019t bothered by it, a matter of fact, he happily owns it and is very good at what he does. Games are his life, especially fighting games like Street Fighter. But one day the rug is pulled out underneath him by Akira Oono, a girl he sees as his polar opposite and rival.  She\u2019s rich, popular, quiet and most irritatingly, proves to be a prodigy at gaming. The mere thought of this is almost unbearable for Haruo.\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting bodied by Akira, Haruo declares her his rival and in hopes of one day getting his run-back. A bond develops between them, their mutual love for video games ties these two together which eventually leads to them falling in love. While the story is pretty straightforward, the complexity of it is really surprising given the type of series this is. It\u2019s something that catches you off guard and grabs your attention, wanting to see what happens next. The plot thickens when a new challenger appears in Koharu Hidaka, a fellow classmate of Haruo is introduced and becomes the third point in a love triangle. There\u2019s a stigma for love triangles in anime but have faith, High Score Girl handles it well. They show something we don\u2019t often like to talk about\u2014that love is messy. They show us that we don\u2019t always know as much about love as we originally planned, that love can create a wonderful relationship but sometimes love hurts because it doesn\u2019t always strike both ways. Sometimes, there will be someone left out.\\n\\n\r\nHigh Score Girl openly conveys the feelings of each character to the viewer and not to the other characters. The way its executed is really well done, it's like falling in love in the midst of self-discovery. It\u2019s made clear on who loves who but the characters themselves are holding it inside and waiting for that perfect moment. The characters have great chemistry\u2014they have strong motivation, dichotomous complexities, active within their roles, coherent conflict, they enact change and there\u2019s an ever-shifting dynamic of opposition and harmony. Despite the nuances mentioned about Haruo previously, he doesn\u2019t come across as annoying. There is a certain charm to his personality, he is relatable that he reminds you of the kid inside of us that enjoys the simple pleasures from the 90\u2019s. Despite his brashness, he slowly begins to realize that his rivalry with Akira is becoming something deeper, that he really does care for her. As excitement turned to obsession when playing against her, we see a transition where his goal to solidify the fact that he\u2019s number 1 shifted into wanting to just spend time gaming with her.\\n\\n\r\nAkira is very unique as in she doesn\u2019t say anything. Not a single word, rather her actions speak louder than words. The characters and us as viewers can tell exactly how she feels through her mannerisms and facial expressions, she speaks through her emotions from the heart. This is executed perfectly and she makes the show. Her upbringing could be the reason for her to be this way. Her family is trying to groom her in the most stereotypical way possible. Make her smart and marry her off to a pre-determined lover which will benefit the family greatly. This is another reason why she plays games, not only for the joy but to escape the reality that\u2019s been planned for her. Koharu is a daughter of a liquor store owner who just installed three-game cabinets in front of his shop. She is smart, responsible, and socially the opposite to Akira. She is someone who marvels at Haruo\u2019s passion for games, it\u2019s infectious and she becomes converted to it\u2014her and Haruo develop a really nice relationship. Naturally, she is talented and becomes really good, she plays to be acknowledged. She develops feelings and falls in love with him. She finds herself stuck between a rock as she struggles to find out if Haruo really loves her or does he just love games to the point where she\u2019s confusing his emotions. It\u2019s a prime example of how to feel a connection to a character through dialogue and this makes Koharu just as relatable.\\n\\n\r\nI am no fan of CGI and it was disappointing to see at first but quickly it just felt natural given the setting, the time period and the focus on retro gaming. The synergy between the gaming scenes and the main narrative had a fluidity to them. Credit to J.C Staff on a fantastic job, they absolutely nailed it with the art, colour palette and animation. Another great thing about High Score Girl is that Square Enix (the publisher) got permission from a lot of companies to use games like Street Fighter and incorporate the actual game into the anime. You see real Street Fighter gameplay with the exact in-game soundtracks\u2014this is for many other arcade games that are played by the characters. The soundtrack is amazing and it\u2019s brought to you by arguably the most prolific female video game composer in the world in Yoko Shimomura who is widely known for her works in Street Fighter ll, Kingdom of Hearts, Legend of Mana, Parasite Eve, Final Fantasy XV and the Mario & Luigi series. It\u2019s very nostalgic to hear all the 8-bit and 16-bit mix blended well with modern style tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from Rensuke Oshikiri\u2019s manga, High Score Girl was held back by licencing issues in 2014, at first, Square Enix had failed to get the proper permission to use trademarked games, even getting sued in the process by SNK Playmore. The anime was shelved and the manga was forced to cease publication. 4 years later, Netflix Japan picked it up and this is why the anime has flown under the radar. I was actually recommended to watch it by a friend and if he never did that I wouldn\u2019t have known of it. This easily makes it one of the hidden gems of 2018, it achieved everything it set out to be. One long arc taking place over several years, with each development flowing into the next which is like adolescence. It's surprisingly relevant in its depiction of the experience of growing up. High Score Girl is many things - a romance, a coming of age story, a homage to the world of Rensuke\u2019s youth. Rensuke\u2019s experiences are written into Haruo in the same way for Tsurumaki Kazuya\u2019s character Naota in FLCL. This series shows you exactly how to execute a generic story.\\n",

I like it especially when there are other main focuses of the plot. After finishing dozens of romance anime, I find it quite hard toget a romance show that would make me say \"wow, this looks interesting!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd High Score Girl was the hidden gem of this season.\\n\\n\r\nGood characters + good romance + good plot revolving about arcade games = watch it now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "Many times throughout my short existence, I truly believed that I grasped everything that there has been to see, that life could not throw anything at me that would faze me, surprise me, or make me lose the already very little faith I have in humanity, this anime managed to do that. I am absolutely shocked, dumbfounded, I cannot possibly begin to comprehend how this show has been not only given decent ratings, but excellent ratings, how anyone could possible like this show is beyond my level of comprehension and ability to empathize with other individuals. Hi-Score Girl should be shamed, a show that shouldbe highlighted as to why the industry has been going down the toilet ever since the early 2000's, This piece of \"entertainment\" is nothing more than a superficial merit-less piece of media that has managed to pull on people's nostalgia cords in order to pretend that it is something more than it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire premise is based around these middle schoolers playing video games back in the early 1990's, many avid video game fans will feel right at home with the numerous references to gaming culture. Hi-Score Girl entirely relies on nostalgia, as otherwise the show has absolutely no merit on its own, basically waving all these references to the viewer's face in order to distract them from the sheer incompetence and the utter lack of any talent that went into the production. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are not even characters, they are totally devoid of any reasonable human behavior and characteristics, the way they interact with one another is simply unhuman, the script suffers as a result with Hi-Score Girl just expecting the viewer to overlook nonsensical conversations between characters. Did I say conversations?, actually it's more like one-sided conversations, since the main female lead just refuses to speak, all she manages to do is to have a resting derp face, or to make a series of clueless experssions that she somehow expects everyone to grasp instantaneously. She is a horrid person, she hits and essentially abuses the male main lead due to the fact that she essentially expects him to mind read her in order to get along, if he doesn't immediately know what she wants, she retaliates in a physical manner, which of course is so incredibly romantic, considering somehow even with this obviously abusive/mentally-challenged behavior the male main lead starts to like the non-talking, physical abusive, derp looking girl. As for the main male lead, well he is not all that likable either, he is an overly hyper and irresponsible brat, his over dramatic reactions to every single event is beyond annoying and tedious. I could write an entire essay on how poorly written these two characters are, but I will save you the suffering from that, clearly whoever wrote these two characters has no understanding of how human conversations work or how humans behave in general. This has been a common theme the past few years in anime with human characters that don't behave/act even remotely human, Hi-Score Girl is one of the worst in recent memory in this regard, and should be taken notice as a study guide on how not to portray human characters in a relatively grounded setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is downright pathetic and ugly, the main girl who is suppose to be attractive in this universe supposedly, looks nothing more than a derp. The background are abysmal, lack detail and any sense of effort. Music is just awful, the opening theme is typical modern non-sense that doesn't even fit the horrendous opening animation. I had enough, just writing this review has given me a brain aneurysm, in short Hi-Score Girl is an abomination, devoid of any merit, meaning or skill, the fact that this is highly rated on this site has me worried for the future of this industry.",

            "content": "I'm so very confused by all the love for this anime. I'm shocked. Here's my honest minimal spoiler review:\r\nLet me go ahead and point out: I'm not a fan of romance. I do like video games, and I'm the perfect age to ride the nostalgia train of this anime. \r\nBut, I just don't get it.  (VERY SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD) The plot is a dumb little boy and a smart little girl. DUmb boy is only good at games, failing in school. Little girl intelligent and from a nice family, but is physically abusive and very violent, but never speaks. He speaks out loud verballydissecting what he thinks her actions mean. They both play games, bond over it, but he's a young brat that doesn't realize he's building a relationship (he just sees her as a rival). She moves. Two years later another girl enters his life, less of a gamer. She shows interest in him romantically, but he is young and dumb and doesn't see it. Time progresses, other girl comes back, romantic drama ensues. (END OF SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 4/10 The story is a fairly generic love story, I don't see the appeal. If you like love stories maybe you will enjoy this. It just isn't for me. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 4/10 Meh. Dumb boys grow up, girls learn how to be a little more forward. It's average anime character growth, nothing ground breaking here. \\n\\n\r\nART: 1/10 Absolutely the worst CG anime I have ever witnessed. It is not my cup of tea. It makes me feel sea sick trying to watch it. They don't move fluidly in their space, the faces look like decals slapped to a vinyl figure, the hands are always awkward. HATE. The cuts between old games and this CG nonsense breaks any attention I had for the show. I don't feel immersed because of the breaks. I honestly think if the art was traditional anime I would enjoy this series a lot more. I'm not going to dwell on this, may you will like it. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10 I love the sound! The opening and ending tracks are beautiful. Voice actors are great. Not ground breaking, but it's good stuff!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 2 I think I'm immune to love stories and nostalgia. I honestly don't see how anyone can get past the awful art of this series. After forcing myself through dizziness and nausea of the art on multiple occasions, I just started listening to it/catching glimpses as I did chores around the house. I couldn't devote sit down relax time to this show. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Not for those who dislike romance and shows playing off nostalgia alone. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I don\u2019t think it was made for me, but I resonated with it all the same. High score girl. Whatever I write here probably won\u2019t put everything I love about this show on paper. This show takes place in the early 90\u2019s with our protagonist, a 6th grader named Yugichi Haruo. He\u2019s not very kind, and his grades aren\u2019t the best, to be honest he\u2019s kind of a shithead. But he is good at one thing, his passion, video games. He spends a majority of his time just dicking around at various arcades around town. On one faithful day, Haruo encounters a beautiful, smart, richgirl from his class named Ono. Who absolutely decimates him in street fighter 2. After 30 consecutive wins against him, Ono follows him around various arcades playing various different games. From then on, the two create a strange bond with each other.\\n\\n\r\n\tHigh score girl is a small slice of life comedy that takes place over Haruo\u2019s life. From his elementary school years, until his first year in high school. The story describes his growth and how Ono along with the various other characters in his life, help Haruo grows and improve. This, by itself, sets itself off of a lot of other slice of life shows. Where they don\u2019t go through long periods of someone\u2019s life. The only example I can think of off the top of my head is Clannad, which is in my top ten and is considered one of the greatest anime of all time. Main difference is, aside from the smaller eyes, is that the characters are a bit more one dimensional then Clannad is. It's not that they\u2019re bad, it's safer and uninspired. They fit into normal protagonist and -dere stereotypes, but they are handled in a wonderful way where you don\u2019t mind. I must say, Ono is the only main character I\u2019ve seen who never says a word over the course of the entire show. She only communicates by facial expressions, actions, and the occasional grunt. She\u2019s cute though. Its heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs you can guess, the show\u2019s main driving point initially was that it has to do with being a kid in the 90\u2019s and an obsession with video games. This describes its audience pretty well. It was appealing to mid to late 30\u2019s Japanese men who grew up to playing these games. To them, it's a nice nostalgia trip tied up with a protagonist that they could easily imprint themselves on. I understood this from the beginning of the show, and I didn\u2019t think I would particularly enjoy it due to how I couldn't relate to growing up in the 90\u2019s. But, I was wrong, and ending up being very invested in these characters and how they\u2019re relationship grows. I loved their character dynamic, and what they did together as friends. Just friends playing video games, Harou treating her as a rival and Ono just following him around.\\n\\n\r\n\tVideo games is the backbone of this entire show. If video games were involved I doubt this show would have gotten any traction at all for reasons I will explain later. This show was made/sponsored by square enix themselves. Therefore, they had enough to get entire clips of game footage where the characters explain and react to what's happening on screen. The very first episode they explained how some cheap strategies worked in Street Fighter 2. It's not just Street Fighter they reference and directly mention a bunch of big time games that were popular or hyped at the time. There was an entire scene talking about how hype they were for the new virtual boy coming out, which if you know you\u2019re gaming history, didn\u2019t do very well. High Score Girl really put you in the place of a kid that\u2019s hyped for the newest games in the 90\u2019s. I\u2019m not even a fan of arcade games and I feel like I\u2019m that kid being excited.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe main problem, which is pretty major when watching this show, is the animation. High Score Girl is an entirely CG show, but do not take that away from the experience this show can give you. But man, it does look pretty garbage. I loved the soundtrack for this show, especially with the OP \u201cNew Stranger\u201d and ED \u201cHoukago Di(e)stra(u)ction\u201d. I mostly compare this show to Dagashi Kashi. Mostly where 1) its 2 people being brought together by the same passion, and 2) it's a show made to sell things. Yeah High Score Girl is an advertising show, it displays games coming out now in the transition periods between in the middle of the show where ad breaks would role. It\u2019s sort of off putting, but it's neatly and clearly separated from what's happening in the actual show, so it doesn\u2019t really matter. I give this show a 10 out of 10, with the recommendation for everyone and anyone to watch if they don\u2019t mind some CG that isn't really disruptive to the type of show. This was truly the best show of the Summer anime season. This has been PixEFit\u2019s spoiler free but not really review of High Score Girl.\\n",

The story is different because of the retro gaming and romance. The retro gaming is amazing for people who really enjoyed these games at their peak. Even if you\u2019re not a fan of retro game you will definitely fall in love with the story and characters. The art style which is 3D I think was something weird at first for me.When I saw this I didn\u2019t like it but became very fond of it. This art style is very unique, lovable, and memorable.The op was pretty good but the Ed was something cute that I really like. By the end of watching the series I am gladly to recommend this series to anyone that likes romance and retro game. Also hope for season 2.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review.",

            "content": "Sometimes in life you come across something that\u2019s been under the hype radar that turns out to be a gem, that\u2019s what this is. Back to a day an age when you went to arcades and rented movies at blockbuster, the nostalgia factor alone had me intrigued in this show. One of the other things that hooked me was having a character who never speaks but conveys their emotions so well that I can\u2019t not care for them. These things hooked me in but I stayed and discovered so much more. \r\nIn just three episodes I couldn\u2019t put this series down, I ended up cryingand being so connected to the characters in such a short time. It does a great job of setting up not only a rivalry but a romance as well. The boy who escapes his mundane life through a hobby he loves is something anyone can connect with immediately and having a rival along the way adds in that good goal to progress towards. \\n\\n\r\nThe weirdness of this love-comedy relationship is done in an excellent balance so we can understand the character\u2019s motivations and feelings towards each other. To see them progress throughout the series is a great sight. Even though most of the characters seem one dimensional and the main girl doesn\u2019t even speak you still somehow manage to care for them. When the love triangle is added I felt weird at first but found myself at some points not knowing who to root for. It added an extra layer to an already rich setup personally. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not usually a person that harps on animation, art or sound so I\u2019ll keep this short. Some people will be turned off by the design an animation. I didn\u2019t see it as a problem and frankly, when we see the arcades and the 2D fights from the screen adapted it\u2019s done superb. So I\u2019d say it looks wonky but delivers in what they wanted the show to look like. As for the sound, as you would expect for an anime about games, is extremely well done. It made me feel like I was at the arcade playing Street Fighter 2. Even going so far as to add in sound from those games and voice lines too gives the show an added layer of depth that not only connects you with the characters, but the entire world they\u2019ve built. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was pretty intense and left me wanting so much more after a cliffhanger like that. It\u2019s a great place to end though so I can\u2019t complain. Also with 3 additional episodes being added as OVA later it works. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 I loved every minute of this and the wide range of emotions I felt watching it.",

            "content": "High Score Girl Review \u2013 A Brilliant Series Even for Non-Arcade Era People\r\nNotes \u2013 High Score Girl may be referred to as HSG for easier typing purposes.\r\nThere is only one minor spoiler in paragraph 2. It is noted in parentheses. \r\nTLDR: Amazing show with likeable characters, neat OP/ED, and a compelling story make this my AOTS - 10/10. \r\nGames are fun. Although they may result in many side effects such as you losing friends because you used the infamous Blue shell in Mario Kart while your friend wasin first place, causing them to get passed by the person in 2nd place. They are a great source of entertainment and some are even played competitively in official tournaments around the world. Today, games feature massive detailed worlds that are powered by fast components in either our computers or consoles. High Score Girl takes us back to a time where video game arcades are the norm and not our personal computers or consoles that sit in our homes. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of HSG features a 1990\u2019s Japan and initially features two characters. Haruo Yaguchi, an extremely good arcade game player, and Akira Oono, an even better arcade player. Arcades, while being prevalent, are frowned upon by schools. This explains why the ending theme song (After School Distraction - \u653e\u8ab2\u5f8c \u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 or alt. After School Destruction) is titled that way. The song is excellent and the animation is well done. How else could our characters meet but in an arcade? Initially, their relationship is rocky, and Haruo gets his butt kicked in the many games they play against each other. This gives Haruo a new goal; to get even better at games so that he can beat Oono. (spoiler starts here) Unfortunately, Oono and Haruo get separated. (end spoiler). Mind you, this all happens at the end of episode 3. Which shows pretty amazing character development already. This however allows our third character, Koharu Hidaka, to step into the spotlight. Hidaka, not much of a gamer herself, meets Haruo and gets closer to him also via games. More specifically at the arcades and the arcade machine that is installed outside her house. She gets to shine for the next few episodes, and even gets better than Haruo at arcade games after Haruo takes some time off to study. She helps Haruo remember his original goal \u2013 become better than Oono. She gets better at games to try to improve her relationship with Haruo. Yeah there\u2019s an implied (totally not obvious) love triangle here.  \\n\\n\r\nOono is such an interesting character that so doesn\u2019t even talk. Why? Probably to show her sheltered lifestyle in a rich family that has everything predetermined for her. She gets no say in what she wants to do because of this. Her rebellious act in skipping out on lessons to play arcade games and it shows that even sheltered girls in high ranking families can show their \u201csilent voice\u201d. That\u2019s totally not Koe no Katachi reference by the way.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound? \u2013 Some people don\u2019t like CGI. Bad news. There\u2019s CGI in this. Not that I really care. You might though\u2026\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a single ad in the middle of the show. I don\u2019t mind, but you might though\u2026\\n\r\nOP/ED are in my top 3 this season. I think that\u2019s pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point you\u2019ve probably already realized how central games are in this show. It helps Haruo find two people that can understand him and help him achieve his goal. While I\u2019m not from the golden age of arcade games and video arcades, the show does an excellent job in making me more interested in learning more about arcade games and get a greater appreciation for the games that came before the ones that we have today. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score \u2013 10/10 AOTS.",

            "content": "Highscore Girl, I never thought that an anime about videogame could so well engage the genres of Romance and Drama from the making of the universe to its protagonists and Secondary Characters.\r\nI'm crying.\r\nStory: We know the story of Haruo Yakult, I mean, Yaguchi, an Otaku-type Videogame, fascinated in arcade and especially fighting games.\r\nUntil one day, he is beaten by a girl from his room, Akira Oona, the only problem was that she was his counterpart: Rich, Intelligent and educated.\r\nFrom this, history is advancing in the 90's, with their rivalry.\r\nWhen we think of an anime of this genre some (like me) will think of the Animeof 2017, Gamers !, which ended up taking the sub genre of Romance a bit seriously and transformed the anime into a Romance Comedy, somewhat forgetting the initial plot, the video game and the relationship it can bring.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime was totally faithful to the behavior of the protagonist and to their lifestyle, it is as if you were watching a history lesson about the explosion of video games in the early 90's.\\n\\n\r\nIn some moments the anime impresses with the plot, in others they end up sinning, but this comes from the manga and the own conception of the Yaguchi and the Oona, as for example the behaviors.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is an area to be debated, the anime was mounted in CGI, which ended up combining in some comic situations of the work. However from time to time the CGI seems a bit different in some scenes, but it does not compromise the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening fit correctly with the story, but something that caught my attention was definitely Ending, because it shows the essence of the 90's, especially in the beats, of course taking a little of the new of our time from now.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Haruo Yaguchi, Akira Oona and Koharu Hidaka, each of them has a depth set throughout the anime, not to mention much of the story, Haruo ends up discovering that life is more than just Video Games, even though sometimes it ends up being a asshole with your friends and colleagues.\\n\\n\r\nHowever we have the girls of the story, Akira and Koharu, they have a gigantic change during the years of the anime, especially Koharu. One of the most shocking scenes of the anime is that of Akira, but I will not say in which episode, being his criterion to discover;)\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters are unique as well, each one has a characteristic that differentiates them from the others around them, such as Onizuka's look, Doi's player way, Yaguchi's Mother's novels vice plus her wrestling skills, her attentive eyes of the Miyao.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's an anime to have fun, it still uses a lot of the sentimental appeal of the one who is watching, I've watched a lot over the course of my life but it was the first time I was sad, I even cry in some scenes, tried to understand the side of the character in question.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a faithful anime for people who love classic video game, romance and school life, remembering what happens in the 90's, it's rare to see an anime that decided to focus on the past instead of the future. But Warn, Watch with a clean mind.\\n\r\nNote 9/10!",

It follows our main protagonist, \"self proclaimed video game maser\"chan as he gets brutally slaughtered by girl who doesn't speak, and as he grows through school and accidentally causes another girl to fall for him so hard she becomes a video game master just to impress him.\\n\r\nNow I'll admit, it suffers from the Netflix \"make everything CG for no good reason\" effect, so i cant really give i credit in the art department, except i did find myself greatly appreciating the legit game play and the random cutouts of 2D video game characters being inserted into the scene for a good joke. \\n\r\nThe sound track is pretty nice, intro is alright, not exactly what I'm looking for but I'm glad they actually showcased a ton of different games from that era instead of taking a cheap way out and just using a bunch of easily identifiable objects that scream \"gamers\". Skipping that ED is a crime btw, The police are already on their way.\\n\r\nWith another box checked off my \"all the anime that Netflix has uploaded in the last year\" list, I'd say this is a pretty solid choice if you're looking for some good comedy and great character building. Just don't expect any major growths in animation style, it doesn't really get any better as the show goes on, except for some pretty impressive scenes on episode 12 that I'm pretty sure weren't actually CG.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 Maybe I should just start talking to random girls about anime so I can start a fan following already...",

            "content": "Finished watching High Score Girl on Netflix and I'll say that it exceeded my expectations in some places while also failing to meet them in others. It's a very likable show I'll say at the least. It's begins in 1990 centered around a young fresh out of elementary school gamer named Haruo Yaguchi who spends all his free time, and then some, playing down at his local arcade and one day meets a mysterious and beautiful girl there named Akira Ono. Causing his life to forever be changed. \r\nSounds simple I know. Cause it kinda is. Good before the bad shall we. Firstly the charactersare all pretty good. Small cast like less than 10 recurring speaking character roles but really only about 3-4 \"main characters\" so it's a very manageable bunch. Haruo I actually kinda hated for a while. He's a major idiot for about the first 8ish episodes, like stupid dumb at times. But he does grow and change which i have to respect. He focuses more on other things then gaming and becomes a legitimately good person compare to where he is when this started. \\n\\n\r\nAkira herself isn't much of a vocal character as she is a physical one. By that I mean she's kinda violent. More so at the start when they're all like 10 and less by The end when they're around 16. But she too grows and changes at the story does. While still not being any more vocal, she does express herself more and do more of what she wants and less of what her restricting parents want. The other major character is Koharu Hidaka. She probably grows the most as she goes from novice gamer to cold blooded killer on the joystick. Her crush on Haruo is adorable too. Probably my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise it's very basic. Just follows their every day lives as they game away and grow from elementary kids to young high schoolers. Something I did really enjoy about the story was as I said above it takes place over multiple years. So it's not so like within a week or whatever like tons of stories do. You can feel the change in the characters as the years literally tick by. The character interactions are adorable and That's pretty much it's leading quality. Like I said I didn't really like Haruo for majority of the show so the adorableness of it all kept me engaged. \\n\\n\r\nNow I did say it failed my expectations in some regards and it's really only with the animation. It's awful. Plain and simple. JC Staff I swear. Now I'm not one to rag on CG anime, in fact I normally welcome it, but this one is that bad. Sometimes I didn't notice it and others it was garbage. The story doesn't rely on the animation to drive it forward but it's just not good. Dub is great though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say it was an enjoyable and adorable time. The characters got better for me and I came to really enjoy them all by these 12 eps end. also super happy more are coming in March since this ends on such a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

            "content": "This is gonna be a plain and simple review...So, this summer season we got a start fresh anime High Score Girl, which is compared to the typical game anime we're getting these few years is a hidden gem.\r\nThe anime got quiet less attention, either it's because of the CGI or the anime timeline I'm not exactly sure. So, I recommend to ignore that for now.\r\nPlot: It starts off with a veteran arcade gamer, Yaguchi Haruo, who is terrible at everything except he's got pro gaming skills and wrecks other players in arcades until one day he got his ass completely whooped by a player, OonoAkira, who's from the same class as him who's popular, beautiful, everyone loves her and top of her class, enraged and frustrated after multiple defeats from someone like her who has the complete opposite background of him, he decides to eliminate her for good who was at 29 consecutive victories no matter how dirty and unfair he has to play, finally managing to stop her win streak with cheap play style, the girl gets pissed and punches him on the face for real (lol), from there the duo starts to cross each other arcades to arcades. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are directed decently except the romance part is slow pace and I, who's picky with anime couldn't help but wanting for more with almost every episode, both characters starts off as rivals but at the same time with a mutual respect for each other's hobbies but the story doesn't just show their gaming progress and how they react to each other and rinse and repeat on every episode, as the story progresses so does the timeline with the evolution of gaming from 2D to 3D and goes on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are shown in my opinion are hilarious and unique, Yaguchi Haruo, is the typical pro gamer with an unparalleled ego who rules in the arcades and tortures the noob players whenever he feels like it (lol), goddamn! I would say he's one of the very few MCs that their personality was worth exploring, \\n\\n\r\n..........and we got the mysteriously unique, Oono Akira, who never says a freakin' damn word but reacts with some facial expressions but mostly with punches and kicks (lolol). So, how could two people understand each other when one is pride fully expressive and one only blinks in front of others (lol)? well, I'll leave that up to you to find out, \\n\\n\r\n..........and finally we got Hidaka Koharu, who is a typical book nerd at first, who doesn't know how to have fun with her life and having a kinda tough time if she could change that, but after meeting with Yaguchi Haruo, and spending time together, her character was shown to expand and for someone who only was a book nerd was capable to develop feelings for someone and interest into the gaming as well. The rest of the side characters are I would say \"okay and all\".\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I can't say much on this as this highly depends on the viewers but the anime was done with CGI and most of the viewers didn't like or preferred the 2D animation for that, but if that doesn't pose a bother then the anime is still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime to the end, really liked the decent showcase of the games we had back during the 1990s, the character development, the execution and for the nostalgic feeling overall, it has become one of my top tier anime of all time, but that's just my opinion, maybe you think differently, if you agree with my opinion for this then that's great but if you don't then that's great too.\\n",

            "content": "High Score Girl's characters are its defining strength.  Every single one is endearing and feels more personable than you would expect, and by some godsend of a miracle there are no conventional tropes just for the sake of it.  You may be fearful of our MC falling to the shounen stereotype or best girls Oono and Hidaka succumbing to the disease that is tsunderism, but these guys have a lot more nuance and depth than that.\r\nHaruo (the MC himself) can be loud and gets frustrated, but he is genuinely kind and furthermore somewhat socially intelligent.  It's so refreshing to see him acceptfault and recognize the problems/merits of other characters in a medium where people like him usually just make excuses or need to be confronted on their arrogance.  Because of these redeeming qualities, the development of his relationships with other characters seems natural.  His personality quirks attract people despite him being a weird video game nerd, and the way each character rubs off each other propels the plot - no hamfisted drama involved!\\n\\n\r\nOf course, that implies other characters are just as pleasant... and thank god they are.  For instance, Oono isn't particularly honest with herself in the beginning but grows to openly enjoy Haruo's company.  Although she doesn't speak, she communicates her feelings with actions of the same magnitude of her emotions and might as well be talking for all that's going on.  Her presence is also a welcome facet of comedy and challenges other characters to take risks and progress.  Without her, the show would stagnate.\\n\\n\r\nHidaka is by far the best character in anime as of now (10 episodes released).  I suggest you watch it to find out why!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, if you're looking for an anime that takes video games seriously (Esports), this probably isn't the one for you. Go watch The King's Avatar.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, Highscore Girl may be pretty interesting for people that want to see some more retro stuff.  It takes place in the 1990s so arcade games are a the primary plot device and there's a lot of old-game fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: As of this edit, season 1 is over and season 2 is confirmed for March of 2019.  Join us on this wild ride, I promise it's worth it!",

An anime where the main female character doesn't spit a word during the entire show can express clear and genuine \"characteristic\" than countless anime with seem-to-be complex girl but turnout flat. High Score Girl nail that part brilliantly right off the start.\r\nDifferentiate itself from the \"recent\" trended anime, this one give viewer a detour to gaming life during the 1990s, the time in which arcade is everything. Obviously, it is out-dated to most of the young 2000s generation and I don't blame you guys if this show doesn't ring a bell. However, it gives a nostalgia feeling to thosewho live in the era when happiness is getting a few coins for the arcade. On top of that, the show also paint vividly what it mean to live in the 1990s, how people think and behave (in general), which make it a refresh taste after a swam of isekai and surreal comedy anime this season.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThis will be the most controversial part and as I said before, for those who this anime offer little to non meaning to you, feel free to criticize it. However, apart from that, the story is captivating and make us feel related. So far the romance part is good if not amazing, the main couple is cute. The reactions are captured realistically. I am not a fan of love quarrel especially since they are middle schoolers. But the love seems adequate without exaggeration as well as typical trope, simply put, it is what it is, feelings develop gradually from small moment, gaming together, etc rather than the typical awkward situation often seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nJust like the story, the artstyle is simple yet very effective. At a glance, it doesn't look a bit fancy like 2018 anime but it get it job done impressively. What I especially like about this anime is the facial expression. They show clearly and correctly the emotion, feeling of the characters at that moment even with simple artstyle, what a lot of recent anime fails to deliver. Just for example, I am impressed that I can clearly understand what Ono is feeling just by looking at her face even though she doesn't say a word at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing much to say here. The sound effect of the games, the use of the arcade machine are correctly delivered. I especially enjoy the hatred, trashtalking when gamers lose (that is so typical). The OP and ED are nice but nothing really special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI don't have much to talk about Harou, he is as typical a gamer as he could be, simple minded, gaming freak, carefree, but easily irritated when losing a game. That is about to wrap up everything one need to know about gamers. The way he interact with other characters are also great. It doesn't get awkward just because some one is opposite gender (I wonder why recent anime make it feel so sensitve about that). Instead, if you are gaming then we are fighting buddy, simple as that.\\n\r\nFor Ono, the only way we learn about her is through her facial expression and how other ppl talk about her since she is silent almost the entire show (except for some roaring moment). But damn, they does not fail to amaze me with how deep Ono can be. She genuinely express what she like and what she hate (that moment when she play the horror game is so cute), and if she doesn't like something, she make sure she doesn't give a damn about it. Just by watching how she interact with Harou, it make me feels a bit sad because it is so relatable even if one doesn't have a rich family.\\n\r\nKoharu, on the other hand, is portrait as a typical game watching person, surprisingly good with game but have doubt about themselves and rather enjoy watching other playing. She doesnt have much screen time yet for us to know more about her but she is definitely not an annoying third person in many love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you like something more tangible, something more direct in every aspect, slide of life, gamer, romance, then this show is not for you. But if you like something light for a relaxing evening, maybe be able to recall some good old time gaming with a gameboy or arcade machine then I highly recommend this anime.",

This one dropped off as a surprise, I mean, I started reading the manga, but reading and imagining doesn't compare to actually watching...\r\nI will be level with you guys, I am coming biased massively towards this one, considering that literally the first scene is my childhood in a nutshell (only with 100% less Guile and 1000% more Ryu) so, finally being able to watch the scenes moving is... Viewtiful...\r\nThe story on itself is not that bad either and it's fun to watch the lead guy go from a douche that abuses every dirty trick to win (then again, when the HiScore Girl beats the stuffing out of you 29 times in a row it gets desperate...) To a gentleman gamer letting a noisy weakling that happens to be an older guy only to have the Hi Score Girl mercilessly beat the stuffing out of him AND the girl he was trying to impress and end up taking the beating the two older morons were going to give to the Hi Score Girl To finally becoming a somewhat adequate partner in a co-op game of Final Fight... after a merciless beating consisting of an attack for every mistake from the Hi Score Girl...\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the story is equalkly fun, it was so sad to watch Ono Leave for the US, only to get back finding that another girl has been insinuating herself to her man... hijinks ensue while the rest of the boy declare themselves at Ono just to be violently rejected...\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention deserves the framing device used in the story... Our lead actress Hi Score Girl doesn't talk, so every piece of information we hear gets given to us by the rest of the cast, and it's adorable to see the Hi Score Girl eternal state of Pink (be read as blushing) or the raging mad faces in-between the even more eternal deadpan she is...\\n\\n\r\nIn short a decent story, pretty animation and a truckload of nostalgia make Hi Score Girl an anime I will recommend massively, who knows, it might make new gamers of some people...",

            "content": "This show reminds me a lot of Ready Player One. It has a bunch of cool nostalgia and references. It also has a main character that will annoyingly explain the reference to the audience, just to make sure you know that the show made a reference.\r\nThe story is simple, an arcade otaku meets the most perfectest and popularest girl in his school at an arcade and loses to her in street fighter 2. This sparks an almost one sided rivalry between the two which blossoms into something more, as the show goes on. I found the story a little better than the generic romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is pretty ugly though. The backgrounds are flat and boring. The characters are all cg with not much animation. The cg was probably used to make the characters feel different from the video games. However, there are also tons of animation shortcuts, whether it's using game footage to pad the run-time or long pauses that would make 'One Piece' jealous. So something tells me that cg was not used as an artistic choice but as a cheap one. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is good in the show. The op and ed are a little bland but the in background music and the arcade sounds are done adequately. No real complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the worst part of the show for me, specifically the two mains. The main boy Yaguchi, is the type of MC that never stops talking. He is constantly inner monologuing and explaining what is happening on the screen. You could probably get a good understanding of the main plot if you watched this show blindfolded. The Main girl Oono (which im just now realizing is a street fighter reference) on the other hand, never speaks. The best you get, is grunting and sighing. On top of not speaking, she also has almost no facial expressions or personality. This means she is whatever the MC and the viewer wants to imprint on her. She has two defining traits. She is good at literally everything and she is afraid of scary things. THAT'S IT. There is also the third MC who is the 3rd wheel on this love triangle. She is clearly the one the viewer should root for, as she has character motivation and development. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment of the show was weird. It was an easy watch and it had its good episodes mixed in the series. Actually, my favorite episode was when the MC and Secondary love interest get left behind on a school field trip and spend the whole day just hanging out. However, with annoying, very cheap cg characters on top of an average story and hit or miss comedy, I don't think I'd recommend this unless you just want to see some old 90s games get referenced.",

            "content": "When talking about a show that leans this heavily into licensed content, I feel like there is one question that must be asked: Would the show still stand on it's own without the inclusion of this licensed content? Sadly, I believe the answer for High Score Girl would be no. \r\nThe first thing most people will notice when watching HSG is the particular art style J.C. went with. The show is largely CG, which I particularly don't mind, but to call the animation 'budget' would be putting it lightly. It's not horrendously bad enough to ruin the show single-handedly, but it certainly isn't doing itany favors. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing in HSG is... not great. Momentarily ignoring the shtick of including licensed games, what we have is a largely generic and uninspired rom-com whose writing ranges from inoffensively mediocre to laughably bad, with a remarkably forced romance at its core. Now, add in the fact that a good half of the show is comprised of the writers nerding out about almost every notable early 90's game release, narrated by one of the most annoying protagonists to ever be on screen, but I'll come back to *him*. It's actually somewhat confounding how knowledgeable the writing staff seem to be about these games, and yet completely failed to capture how people would casually talk about them. Imagine several Steve Buscemi's walking around, fully decked out in 'fellow kids' gear, talking about 90's arcades. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, sadly, remarkably flat. At the three points of the obligatory love triangle are the main characters:  Ono, Hidaka, and the protagonist Yaguchi. Ono is tsundere to the max, and inexplicably *does not speak throughout the entire show*. No, she's not mute, she's just 'quiet' or so the show will tell you. Already riding the crutch of not having any dialogue to express herself, she instead relies on Yaguchi to mind-read her intentions and explain them to the viewer. The show already has a \"tell, don't show\" problem, but this is kinda ridiculous. Next is Hidaka, an uptight girl unfamiliar with games who inexplicably drops madly in love with a guy who does literally nothing but play games and act like a general asshole. She is, after this point, completely defined as a character by this forced romance. \\n\\n\r\nNow for Yaguchi, and oh man is he the WORST. This protagonist is easily my biggest grievance in what was already a mediocre-at-best show. Taking up a good 90% of the screen time, Yahuchi is exaggerated to the point of being a parody of all those negative early gaming stereotypes, to the point of being borderline offensive. His dial is permanently stuck at 100 while he screams in everyone's face about how much of a GAMER he is, while acting like a douche to everyone he interacts with and self-admittedly not giving a shit about anything that isn't a game, which *of course* causes all the panties in his harem to drop. His personality is that of an intentionally hateable side-character that was pushed into the role of protagonist. For someone framed by the show to be relatable, man is he annoying as all hell. Even by the end he, and the other characters for that matter, undergo little to no development other than realizing they like a person, and maybe working up the guts to tell them about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, High School Girl is a show that rides exclusively on the novelty of incorporating licensed games. It got people's attention with it's catch line, but had little of substance to actually offer once people got through the door. I have a feeling that without the 90's gaming frame, this show wouldn't be getting nearly as much praise. \\n",

            "content": "I feel like I should probably start this off on the note that I'm not exactly the target audience for this show. I've only ever been a casual gamer at best and can't claim to have ever really gotten into any arcade games. But I do tend to enjoy stories about protagonists who are unabashedly passionate about their nerdy hobbies-- so I can appreciate that aspect of its charm-- and it did feel insightful in regards to how gaming and attitudes around gaming have changed over time. Something I don't have a ton of experience with, as even the last little arc takes place ayear before I was even born. \\n\\n\r\nBut I was expecting the real draw of this anime to be the characters... and for about the first half it was... but by the end, they never really develop in the meaningful ways I was hoping. I think Oono and Hidaka are both very interesting. (Or had the potential to be at least.) They do--almost-- develop Oono. A girl who's well-off and well-liked but only Haruo really understands is seriously misunderstood. And there was a little development there, in how he came to be able to read her subtle expressions... but she doesn't say a single word over the course of the whole series, which, along with her penchant towards violent reactions when she doesn't know how to express herself, I interpreted as a sort of cry for attention. Clearly her parents don't care enough to get to know her, so it's going mostly unheard, but I expected for Oono and Haruo to have to some big heart to heart where they finally accomplish something and she determines to better stand up for herself. But it just... doesn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nHidaka, too, I found interesting and to have a lot of potential-- as a girl who doesn't know how to have fun but finds herself with a lot of natural talent for video games... but then her entire character is taken over by her crush, and her storyline really stops being about her own growth. She's just another presence to motivate Haruo. Honestly, I think I would have been okay with a much simpler story that wrote out Hidaka entirely and just focused on Haruo and Oono getting to know each other over time, and then having a more conclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\n Haruo might be the one exception. I could appreciate his storyline as well--as a boy who's escaped into video games so thoroughly because he doesn't feel like he could ever succeed at anything else. I do feel like he learns a little more about being a human being through his experiences with the two girls and some of his other classmates, but even he ends the series feeling like he's basically still where he started. Honestly, I don't even care that they don't properly resolve the love triangle. That's really not what I was here for. I would have been perfectly happy with a good friendship story, but it feels like a stretch to even call it that. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, I didn't dislike this show... It felt very easy to watch and I enjoyed it well enough. But I don't feel like it really holds up on a critical level.\\n\r\n(However, I did just notice that three more episodes are set to come out in March, so perhaps there's still hope after all.)\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: Just watched the last three episodes... Eh. They weren't bad. I enjoyed them as much as the rest of the show, but I didn't get enough out of them to feel the need to write a separate review. It still feels a little inconclusive.",

It's cool how each character has a reason to enjoy videogames: Haruo feels like it's the only thing he's better than majority of people and surprises other's expectations; Ono feels like videogames are a escape her sadness built upon very strict parents and Hidaka feels like videogames are a way to make Haruo pay attention to her. The charactersare enjoyable, relatable and very well constructed. You can tell a lot about Ono's personality and feelings even with the lack of dialogues, wether by her expressions or, more impressively, by the way she plays. The art style is cute and fits well, so does the animation. The inserts of pixelated videogame characters throughout the scenes are marvelous . The opening and ending are awesome and so are the sound effects. The story is simple but very enjoyable and captivating. Overall, this is a great anime and I highly recommend!",

            "content": "As a gamer since 1990... This may be the romance anime closest to my heart. Makes me remember my childhood when games were essentially the only thing I talked endlessly about (much to the discontent of my friends) and the only thing on my mind (not that anything has changed 28 years later XD).\r\nIt's so amazing to see a show that doesn't paint excessive gamers in a negative light but embraces this (most beautiful!!) passion to such an extent. As someone who is as passionate when it comes to this hobby High Score Girl feels so refreshing and especially so encouraging. I might add thatthe background knowledge the original writer/mangaka had is out of this world, this show goes way beyond little references, way way beyond. Also seeing all those game developers (I just wished there were also Nihon Falcom references... well, it can't be helped) cooperate in an attempt to create what I would call the definitive love letter to an bygone era of gaming, seeing this most important period of mankind's history made me literally tear up. In addition to that none other than Yoko Shimomura, who composed game OSTs since Front Mission on the Super Famicom, who became most famous for the soundtrack of Kingdom Hearts and who most recently made the OST for Final Fantasy XV composed the soundtrack for this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I'm regretting is not having watched it much earlier. Either way, this is my personal anime of 2018. One might criticize that this is a CG animated show, but unlike most shows I didn't mind at all. The stylistic approach is very coherent and the way the countless in-game sequences blend into the show seemlessly is really impressive.\\n\\n\r\nBut what shines the most are the very human feeling characters. Each character has been given enough time to grow and develop, they feel very \"tangible\", real. I can't overstate how important this is in a romance show and High Score Girl totally nails it. Despite being quite comedy centric the show strikes the perfect balance between humor and serious moments. It's actually quite the emotional rollercoaster.\\n\\n\r\nThis might be purely subjective on my part, but for me as an excessive gamer High Score Girl is absolutely flawless and I can't help but truly giving it the highest score.",

            "content": "Deeply nostalgic, unabashedly sentimental, and filled with melancholy longing, High Score Girl is a romantic comedy wrapped in a geeky love letter to 1990s arcade gaming. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story about searching for, discovering, and embracing your passions; and the realization that you can\u2019t always get what you want.\r\nHaruo Yaguchi is a boy who loves arcade gaming more than anything. The author takes great care in portraying him as a decent, generous and caring person who has a one-track mind that can seemingly only handle three things: breathing and gaming and talking about gaming. Indeed, Haruo just can\u2019t shut up about games.\r\nAkira Oono is inmany ways your standard-issue \u201cpoor little rich girl.\u201d From an extremely wealthy family, she gets driven around by a chauffeur who is also charged with keeping close tabs on her doings. Good at everything, pretty, and popular, she\u2019s actually enormously unhappy, with no real friends, and feeling absolutely crushed under the pressure her parents have put on her to be flawless at everything. While she doesn\u2019t live and breathe gaming like Haruo, she clearly loves it, and uses it as an outlet and escape from the huge coercions she feels filling up her everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as with everything else, she\u2019s also pretty much the best at every game she plays, as well.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and one other thing: Akira never speaks. At least not in the presence of the audience. Her thoughts and feelings are portrayed solely through her actions, her facial expressions, and ultimately, through Haruo, who seemingly understands her like no one else. I\u2019ve seen people complain that they don\u2019t like our male protagonist because he annoyingly talks too much. Personally, I think that misses the point, because by the halfway mark of the very first episode, he\u2019s already talking for both himself AND Akira, able to explain to the audience most everything that\u2019s on her mind.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I can understand why someone might find such chattering off-putting, but I think it\u2019s charming, and more importantly, it deftly shows what an ineffable bond the two share.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s Koharu Hidaka, a reserved girl who, in Haruo, sees someone unafraid to pretty much always do whatever he wants \u2013 a boy who never sweats the repercussions. It is his willingness to follow his passions that makes her quickly fall for him. Although it turns out she\u2019s a natural at gaming, it\u2019s never quite clear that she shares the love for it that Haruo and Akira have. Rather, Koharu\u2019s passion seems solely focused on Haruo, someone who represents the freedom and exuberance she\u2019s been missing from her life.\\n\\n\r\nHigh Score Girl follows the relationship between these three characters over the course of several years, from elementary to middle to high school, efficiently developing them through dialogue that at one and the same time is both ridiculous and heartrendingly real. It is not an easy trick to make a line like, \u201cDid you know SNK is releasing a fighting game called Fatal Fury soon?\u201d feel both profoundly emotional and intensely romantic, but High Score Girl does it repeatedly over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWith shows like Just Because and Takagi-san, in recent seasons, anime has had a pretty good run of heartfelt adolescent romances. Yet even though this series doesn\u2019t have a definitive ending (hopefully, they can pull that off with the upcoming three extra episodes), High Score Girl stands above them all as one of the most genuine, keenly observed, and yes, passionate portrayals of growing up and falling in love you will ever see.\\n\\n\r\nYou can watch High Score Girl purely for the gaming nostalgia and be perfectly satisfied. But the wistful, yearning love story at its heart is what makes it truly unforgettable.",

            "content": "High Score Girl is a hidden gem of the season\r\nI thought this kind of anime will only show us what we expect it is gonna be, like a lot expected things or scene happen in the episode and i thought its gonna be a repitive story where every episode will only fill with the character play in the arcade. And i realize how wrong i am. \r\nIf the story only tells us about game, it's gonna be really boring but fortunately this anime not only tell us about what kind game is it or what the character really likes about those games, but the storyis actually interesting because it has childhood romance which really really fit the story. The anime also has an unique storytelling, sometimes when the protagonist are having some 'big event' or 'flag' there will be some of his fantasy from his favorite character of the game cheering him up. That unique style of storytelling really enhance the anime because it makes us feel like we are a kid who feels game are everything in our life just like the protagonist.\\n\r\nThe balance between the romance and the game of this anime is not one-sided but both are balanced which makes the anime so enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\nI would really love to watch those 3 OVA as soon as possible. \\n\\n\r\nIt's CGI anime so i expect less from this anime, but after finishing the anime i think the CGI is not as bad as \"that anime that everyone wait for, and ended up with bad, awful CGI and it got 2 SEASON\". But in this anime even though looks like both shows have a same CGI style, the CGI in this anime is properly done. It got emotion, which actually enhanced the experience of watching a CGI anime which i personally not like that much, but this one works. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending song of this anime is so creative and it really pictured in my mind. I usually skip an opening, but for this anime, i dont skip the opening just to watch the creative scene and listen the song.\\n\\n\r\nI really really love those game from late 80 and 90s because it's just so unique and simple. And that feeling of the games are created on the anime. The anime done so properly that even excite me enough to want to play those games that are exist on anime. I even try those 'ad' games that show up on the middle of each episode, those 'ad's have a really good place to show it up. I even try some of those.\\n\\n\r\nFor that, i recommend this anime for you who enjoy anime with retro game vibe with good 'osananajimi' or childhood romance story.",

            "content": "High Score Girl was obviously not going to be a flashy hit. It's wonky art style, niche setting, and lack of typical tropes. But it managed to be different and endearing. The three main characters were all relatable and their actions and feelings were both novel and understandable for the most part. It managed to tell a decent story very well, embracing the retro game culture it set itself in. The music also was very well done and fit the theme of the show.\r\nThat said, it's problems were clear. The art, while refreshingly different, was still below par. There were times it was noticeably reallybad; the blush on his mom's cheeks going over her hair come to mind. The supporting characters outside of the main three were either annoying, shallow, nondescript, or all three. The show put very little focus on these characters so it was not a huge issue, but I hated or was neutral on all of them with the possible exception of the mom. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, its far and away largest problem , which may not be one, is the ending. It was done fantastically. In fact, it might be my favorite scene of the show. The problem is that it wasn't a damn ending, it was a huge cliffhanger that will hurt the show immensely if it isn't resolved. A 13th episode or a 2nd season could obviously cure this, so we'll have to wait in see if it happens. Till then, off to the manga I guess. \\n\\n",

            "content": "High Score Girl's main appeal seems to be it's retro setting. I get how many may how nostalgia for this time, but as I personally don't, it won't really be a focus of the review.\r\nRomance is a genre that focuses on characters, as it usually doesn't  have much of a plot. This of course isn't a bad thing, as there are an ample amount of great character-driven shows, however, High Score Girl seems to fail at being one of them.\r\nStory:\r\nWhen it comes down to it, there isn't much to discuss here. The show does have a few plot lines, but nothing that really stoodout for me, or that I viewed as exceptionally great -- it seemed like a rather typical romance, just with added video games. Its inclusion of a pointless love triangle also rather annoyed me, which isn't really much of an issue since it's rather common, but the way they incorporated it into the season's \"ending\" doesn't really excuse it.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of CG in anime in slightest -- however, I knew this going into High Score Girl, and therefore decided not to hold any gripe against the animation whilst watching it, in case the show actually managed to wow me (which it didn't). It did fit the theme of the show, despite being somewhat unappealing, so it wasn't much of an issue.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack (excluding the intro and outro) was pretty decent. It had a retro vibe that fit its \"arcade\" setting, although I'd lie if I said any of it really stood out.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is probably where my biggest issue with the show comes forth. The main protagonist, Haruo, is one of the least likable characters I've come across, and I'll tell you why that's such a major issue. When you have a character driven show and your main character is a douche, why should I feel any inclination for the protagonists to be together -- you know, the main aspect of a \"romance\". Even when the show attempts to redeem the character, they pretty much immediately revert him to his childish petty ways. I know it's nothing new to have an unlikable protagonist, but as I've expressed earlier, this show doesn't really have anything to fall back on (unless you count the retro games). Oono (other than being a violent \"mute\" dandere) is pretty much the stereotypical\"perfect\" rich girl, who tries to escape to do things she likes (be it in this anime, playing games). Most of the side characters also seem to take after Haruo and be rather unlikable.\\n\r\n4/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall Thoughts (5.5/10):\\n\r\nAlthough this show isn't my cup of tea, it's rather short, so it's hard to complain that it's a complete waste of time. I believe there are way better romances to watch, but if you have nostalgia for the retro theme, this might be something up your alley.",

            "content": "Nostalgia, the reason this show works. High Score Girl is an odd anime, it isn't the kind of anime that will blow you away with amazing visuals or have you gripping your seat in suspense, but it is somehow one of the most enjoyable anime i've seen in a while. High Score Girl is about a boy named Haruo, he likes video games and that's pretty much all there is to him at first. Now the reason i like this anime so much is because of it's characters and the atmosphere created by them. The music is nice, not extravagant or innovative in any wayyet is somehow very memorable, this is likely down to the previously mentioned atmosphere that is really the selling point of the show. The music complements the other aspects of the show perfectly, it feels very nostalgic and always manages to fit the scene very well. The main focus of the show is fighting games, mainly street fighter but not exclusively. Now this might sound wierd but if you never played fighting games alot, either now or as a kid, you probably won't like this anime as much as the rest of us. This anime is filled with references to fighting games and for that reason alot of it won't make sense if you don't get the refereces. However if you do get them this show is an absolute delight to watch. This show is funny at times and Hilarious at others, it's been a while since an anime had me in tears from laughter, this anime did it multiple times. When the show isn't funny it's heart warming, and where it's neither it's oddly entertaining just watching the bizarre characters interact with each other. This show is also on netflix so it's easily accessible to many. I can promise you that you won't regret watching this show, even if you dont get the references it is still funny, heartwarming and captures an atmosphere like no other show. 8/10",

            "content": "Disclaimer: As part of an effort to sharpen my comprehension skills, I watched Hi-Score Girl entirely in Japanese most of the time, and therefore did not catch every plot detail or fully take in every bit of characterization. Therefore, I won't try to make this review as in depth as some of my others, and everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt. However, High Score Girl still entertained me by taking me on a tour through video game history with funny characters and spot-on 3D animation.\r\nI'm a huge nerd for 3D animation, and the animation style here is what most enticedme to give this series a chance. From the few pages of the manga that I've glimpsed, I have to say that this was a pretty good fit for the original art style. Not everyone will be on board with the look of this series, but if you don't mind 3D animation, it might surprise you with just how anime it still looks. The outlines rendered on the character models are sharp, and there are no sharp dips in quality because they don't have to redraw the characters in every scene.\\n\\n\r\nI must admit, the soundtrack never once caught my attention, so I can't really assess it. The opening is a bombastic electronic extravaganza, however, and easily one of the best parts of each episode. The ending song is pretty sleepy, but it sounds cute enough. Perhaps the coolest part of the sonic experience comes from the numerous games they play, with full music and sound effects. The Japanese voice cast is very entertaining, and the couple of episodes I saw in English were way decent as well. I even watched a couple of episodes in Spanish with my roommate, which was very interesting, and it didn't sound bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the 12 episodes, I was utterly uninterested in the plot. What kept me coming back was seeing all of the arcade games of the era and peering into the rich history of early 90s gaming, which I can only assume comes from the firsthand experience of the mangaka. As I witnessed Yaguchi-kun remain totally oblivious to the interest of girls around him, I kept telling myself that I didn't care and that I was only here for the games. However, by the final episode I was into it, and ensnared in the drama of his love interests.\\n\\n\r\nYaguchi himself is a pretty vanilla protagonist, focused so much on gaming that he doesn't care much for anything or anyone else. As I thought about it more, I found myself relating to him because of all the time I spent more concerned with pursuing my own nerdy interests in school over hanging out with people or chasing girls. Eventually I ended up rooting for him to succeed and find a badass gamer girl companion! Which brings me to our two other main characters, Koharu and Oono (The titular High Score Girl). Oono is definitely the less developed of the two, mostly because her character gimmick is that she's stubbornly silent. In fact, I don't know if she spoke a single word throughout all 12 episodes, yet her tsundere personality shines right through. On the other hand, we can actually see into Koharu's thoughts and feelings, which gives her a bit more depth, but not by much. Either way, their gaming prowess makes both of them the stuff of dreams, and very entertaining to watch even if the show couldn't possibly pass the Bechdel test.\\n\\n\r\nSo who should watch High Score Girl? I would recommend it if you have any interest in DOPE AF 90s arcades and fighting game history in particular. It may also appeal to you if you enjoy high school slice of life anime, but if you have any reservations about 3D animation this might not be for you.",

            "content": "I just wanted to leave a short and sweet review here as someone who just decided to check out and watch the anime on a whim. It was better than I was expecting for an anime that's pretty much a giant Capcom commercial, they give you plenty video game references and teach neat fun facts here and there which are all great. I find myself enjoying the main character more than any others because he's the only one that actually seems fun and someone fresh and original a good plenty including the hi score girl herself feel a bit cliche, but that's honestly fine becausethe show manages to use these characters and put them in such interesting situations that create for a well made scenarios that are immensely entertaining whether it makes you laugh or tear up it's all thrilling. The weakest point is definitely the predictability of the characters and how they act around each other, I've seen these cliche archetypes in many anime before and it's always easy to call out what'll happen next in the show, but it's definitely still a fun watch. I highly recommend it as a filler anime for sure, and I thoroughly enjoyed it as someone who's into old video games and fighting games in general, it was right up my alley with it's nostalgia factor, but your mileage may vary depending on how much you like video games yourself. But similar to the film Wreck-it-Ralph, it can be enjoyed by non-gamers as well, it's just harder to pick up on the references.",

            "content": "High Score Girl...\r\nAn actual Romantic Comedy about gamers, involving gaming! Unlike that other series that came out a few years ago!\r\nI remember many years past when the manga source of this series began, I read it since chapter 1 and how fun the story seemes to be. It has become one of my best loved RomComs about gamers from the many that had come years prior, and that other novel one that made certain controversy.\r\nWhat I liked about High Score Game was the down to earth story about typical gamers and their life. It also teaches about the gaming history for console games and gamesthat came our since 1980s.\\n\r\nThe flow is regular, and they actually show gaming in it.\\n\r\nThe romance is the typical rival-turns-love type, and the love rivalry drama Japanese otaku loves to much (with the competition of who is best waifu).\\n\\n\r\nI remember that half way I started wishing that the manga would obtain an anime adaptation... and I was disappointed that, that other one got the anime adaptation instead.\\n\\n\r\nBut when I heard High Score Girl had the chance, I pumped my fist up and yelled \"YIOSH TTAAAA!!!\"\\n\r\nAnd then I finally managed to hear Oono Akira's unpoken voice for the first time... I actually cried.\\n\\n\r\nIt was so adorable!!!\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like much about the series was the animation though... I can't believe this story, having the better story plot, recieve such poor cheap animation.\\n\\n\r\nIts all corcky and sometimes looks like stop-motion.\\n\\n\r\nBut what you expect when this anime was animated using 3-D models in an advance form of Cell-shading instead of the normal digital animation of frames by frames.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe if they had used motion-capture, it would had look better or at least give it a bit more revision for more fluid movements, but most of the characters moves as if they were robots.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways... High Score Girl is the story about Yagushi Haruo, a gamer Otaku who started his unbeatable championship in fighting games since elementary school, and his meeting with his arch rival, Oono Akira... a Ojou-sama that became his beacon in life for the crown of gaming in his town.\\n\\n\r\nHaruo is just a typical kid, laid back and loves games. He always talks about games and always playing games. He had the title of undefeated until Little Akira stole the crown from him, and since then he has seen her as a rival and object in life (to beat).\\n\\n\r\nAkira is just your average rich girl \"princess\" who was submitted into carrying the family inheritance since her older sister abandoned everything. Since she could not make a life, she dedicated herself to play games as a stress relief making her a gaming genius.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Koharu Hidaka... the love rival... because Japan can't live without the stereotype love rivalry drama in their series....\\n\\n\r\nKoharu was Haruo's class mate in middle school, she began to get interest in him after seeing him playing a fighting game in her dad's shop and then got introduced to gaming. She went into the world of games to try to make a place for herself in Haruo's heart just to learn that Haruo mostly does things for just one girl... his arch rival, Oono Akira.\\n\r\nSince then the love rivalry for Haruo's attention began between the rich girl and the commoner girl.\\n\\n\r\nOf and all, I really love this series and how the author was creative with it to make something believable in romance between gamers.\\n\\n\r\nBut acquired all those copyrights to be able to use official names for actual games must had cost a ton of money... which maybe is why the budget was so limited and the animation was mediocre.\\n\r\nIt would had been epic if it had fluent well done animation.\\n\\n\r\nSo my final judgement would be:\\n\r\n10 for such an unique story and well done plot.\\n\r\n10 for such an original artwork that is not like another.\\n\r\n7 for sound because well it was average.\\n\r\n10 for such unique human-like characters.\\n\r\n10 for enjoyment because I love this story.\\n\r\nand 7 for overall because well... like I said; the animation could had been better.",

Even though I may not be as old as some of the other people watching this show talking about their childhood it still brought back memories of my own going PvP against my brother, messing with the cord when the controller disconnected memorisingthe countless combos for fighting games and grinding my way through RPG's. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I have no complaints about the show it was a massive and an amazing nostalgia trip. The music in the show was amazing the OP and ED were beautifully done and i could never skip either of them, even the CGI which some people may disagree with me as being bad I personally thought was amazingly done especially compared to other shows (Berserk 2017 I'm looking at you) all in all I really recommend this show if your a fan of old games or are looking for a nice romance story between to childhood friends/rivals",

I found the pacing a bit too fast, not letting me take in the atmosphere of retro arcade gaming and life as someone who's just interested in games.\r\nSeries I am comparing it to: No Game No Life, Sword Art Online\r\nI'm going to speak of the story in terms of the manga\r\nStory: 10 and Character: 10\r\nOne of the best romance series ever. The problem with romance series is that the characters create needless stupid problems, and overtly makes it hard for me to engage in.\r\nHigh Score Girl expresses it's romance through a common interestshared by all characters and the harem aspect just feels natural, believable and realistic.\\n\r\nThe characters are kids going through the boring system of education, and it's down right relatable. It perfectly captures the 3 situations students face today, being:\\n\\n\r\nFreedom, to let go and do what you want when you want, not take everything too seriously - Yaguchi\\n\r\nConformity, to fit in and try to do what is told, not being able to be free -\\n\r\nOno\\n\r\nLost / empty, not knowing what to do and can't decide between conformity or freedom - Hideaka.\\n\\n\r\nGirls mature faster than boys and it makes absolute sense that Yaguchi is not in tune with romance. People want what they can't have, and the outcome of trying to sway Yaguchi to like you, is a huge wild card, making pursing him more enticing.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no accidental hentai moments, no annoying tropes add little to the series, this is just a pure no nonsense romance series. \\n\r\nThe world and atmosphere feels ALIVE. The environment of games changing left and right and seeing how it fits into the lives of the characters. \\n\r\nThe environment of life, going through the change from childhood to adulthood, and how they impact each character. What more can I ask??\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSee profile for explanation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nIt really missed out on chances to use game soundtracks and or 8bit OST in a lot of places.

            "content": "[Note: Some spoilers ahead.]\r\n\"Tsuki Guile Kirei / As The Melee So Beautiful\" is a rather accurate description for \"High Score Girl\" (HGS) anime. For a young teen romance it has parallels with 2017's celebrated \"Tsuki ga Kirei / As The Moon So Beautiful\" series. Meanwhile the story never loses focus of its video arcades theme, the main characters play person-vs-person fighting games obsessively. Haruo, the boy MC even receives occasional guidance from his entrant of choice, the famed american Street Fighter warrior Guile-san.\r\nThe rudeness of neon blood on screen could form unsettling contrast with a rivalry which turns into affection, but the director manages tobalance visuals with the story. I think the anime surpasses its manga origins in success of execution and general opinion holds HGS on TV is best described as \"charming\". The simplistic, low framerate,cheap CGI animations blends tolerably with gaming footage copied verbatim from actual vintage CAPCOM titles. Characters are drawn in caricature-like \"nendoroid\" style but still easy to emphasize with - after all, we are in the post-Yapari Park era and poor animation is OK if the studio has a compelling story and the heart to tell it.\\n\\n\r\nOn to characters: Haruo Yaguchi a.k.a. \"Forcible Fingers\" is a single-minded action games otaku who has suprising facets of personality: he cares about those in his neigbourhood or at school and appears to grow at a suprising pace as the series progresses, eventually taking up work before school hours. Him being the focus of two cute girls' affection isn't unexpected: the carefree and jolly lifestyle he leads early on must be enviable to the cram-school oppressed young ladies.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are two ladies for our guy, HGS is not a harem, already the OP makes it clear who wins in the end. The clever and beautiful heiress Oono Akira hails from an elite family and has adopted voluntary muteness in the face of excessive strictness shown by her private tutor. She sneaks out to play fighting games at video arcade and has achieved unparalleled success, like 100+ consecutive wins, able to capitalize on her piano-trained manual skills and martial arts induced tactical prowess.\\n\\n\r\nHaruo initially defeats her but only through the use of obscure and unethical / unfair movement combinations. Oono expreses her excitment over a true rival through physical violence and a gaming pals' bond quickly forms between them, aided by Haruo's tolerance for injury and his ability to decipher the girl's emotional faces. On the other hand, there is a limit to how interesting and mysterious the completely mute princess Akira can be, so the manga author relies on time-skips to keep the story flowing. Yet it is done in an unobstrusive manner and allows for some great dramatic scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nUnusually, the main couple avoids the theme of love and by the end of the anime (first season) they seem to have progressed from pals straight to virtually waifu / husbando status. Thus a third character enters to form a triangle: Hidaka is a diligent and calm schoolgirl who secretly finds her life boring. She quickly falls for Haruo in Oono's absence and takes up gaming to approach him. Hidaka quickly finds out Haruo is playing games ever more just to be able to keep up with Oono as she returns one day from the USA but she refuses to give up on hopeless love.\\n\\n\r\nThe re-union of Oono and Haruo doesn't go smoothly and Hidaka reacts by doubling her gaming efforts, eventually curb-stomping the depressed boy who has abandoned PvP arcades for fighting console CPUs alone at home. The shock of such humiliation by a rookie motivates Haruo to re-learn the path of the arcade warrior, in time to become helpful in a big crisis for Akira. Hidaka sees firm proof that she became the third wheel but still refuses to give up and proposes a daring love gambit.\\n\\n\r\nThat's where the HGS series has ended as of now, but 3 OVAs are already scheduled for March 2019 (ooh the long wait...) The franchise may even earn a second cour of 12 eps and further OVAs, based on already strong Blu-Ray sales in the japanese market. All in all, the outcome of HGS's TV adaptation is great gratification for those who have followed the manga and witnessed its protracted copyright clash with a certain game industry brand. The franchise was in grave danger but come out victoriously!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime isn't without faults, but one has abandon pure enjoyment to notice them. OP sounds a bit weird and has apparently been composed with the grand sponsor's screen chime as the main theme... ED is childishly cute, but its references to fringe theories are jarring: what does NASA's conspiracy have to do with Lennon's killing? Animation sometimes feels like a Powerpoint slide struggling on a Celeron netbook. The MCs \"delinquency\" or lack thereof may seem shallow from a US point of view, they are not true \"rebels without a cause\" but that's probably the most creators could show to socially strict japanese audiences.\\n\\n\r\nSome side characters should also have received more or more evenly distributed screen time, I mean HGS has the best mom and best bro ever! The mid-episode ad breaks for modern games are nerve-wacking and best skipped. Certain gamer otaku gags / visual clues occur in the series but quite hard to note and decipher, yet fansubbers did a great job of referencing them. (Incidentally, the series isn't available overseas in a business-like manner until end of 2018. One has to turn left at the Indian to find it now...)\\n\\n\r\nCan one watch HSG as a non-gamer? Certainly! I'm no gamer, only played prboom / doom for a few weeks over a decade ago. Never been to arcades, thus unaffected by nostalgia and solely recognized the in-game character of Guile from some movie poster. Yet the anime's story is compelling enough to suck in the viewer, the ladies are cuter than anything \"moe / tsundere\" trends have ever produced and gaming is even better integrated into the story than with Wotakoi, up to par with MMO Junkie.\\n\\n\r\nI even dare to say HGS is 2018's Kemono Friends: a miracle borne from peas thrown to creators instead of a production budget, subbed on a tablet by some anon sitting on a bench at Comiket. Embarrassing comments are prohibited though, so I finish this review here!",

            "content": "A love letter to retro fighting games...ohh and there's a love triangle in there somewhere.\r\nHigh Score Girl follows Haruo Yaguchi voiced by Kouhei Amasaki, a 6th grader who lives on games, no one has defeated him in games, that is until Akira Oono voiced by Sayumi Suzushiro, the silent ojou of his school utterly dominates him in multiple games, thus a rivalry and a friendship starts to blossom.\r\nHigh Score Girl mainly looks into video games in the early to late 90's thus the love letter to video games, such as Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, references to early consoles like the SNES, Neo Geo and arcadegames during those times. \\n\\n\r\nBut the video games are a crutch for the main characters of Haruo and Oono to interact with from rivalry to a budding friendship and maybe even further, well unless Haruo isn't completely obsessed with video games that he's too dense to figure it out. Oh right love triangle, well about halfway through the anime, our other love interest comes into play, one Koharu Hidaka voiced by Yuuki Hirose, a friend of Haruo's in middle school as they became video game friends due to her family running a dagashi shop with mini arcades thus naturally the meet up. Koharu and Haruo's relationship like Oono is built on video games but also developed Koharu in a ways as she was the shy type, but Haruo opened her up with video games and because of this, Koharu has a soft spot for Haruo, but not so much when it comes to video games considering how new she was to it, but had some natural talent. LA is actually perfectly fine with this love triangle as LA kinda rooted for both Oono and Koharu and they both had good reasons in liking Haruo as Haruo by all means changed their lives or just made that much happier in the process and that's mainly due to playing video games. If LA did have to choose who LA would want to win, then LA would say Oono, it it just made sense, both Oono and Haruo had a bond together through video games and though Haruo is more per-occupied with wanting to win against Oono, Oono had her own troubles when considering her strict family life that caused multiple problems throughout the anime and her only solace became Haruo and video games. Koharu IS adorable around Haruo and like Oono helped Koharu break her out her own shell but in comparison to Oono, it's like night and day. LA talked soo much about the love triangle LA forgotten about Haruo himself, well he does develop along side Koharu and Oono in a ways but considering his goals of wanting to defeat Oono in a game changing to wanting to go to same school as Oono and abstaining from video games is something of a change for Haruo and he doesn't exactly become one note, LA will have to say it High Score Girl, for a main male protagonist who's dense, LA actually dig the love triangle and how it worked, if anything character development was key in getting us to like these characters and it worked!\\n\\n\r\nWith the ending, it did make LA wonder what would happen to the love triangle but LA was also thinking of it just ending where it did would had been fine, but with High Score Girl announcing three OVA's to probably finish off this love triangle and to finally lay to rest who Haruo would choose made this love triangle actually difficult to say the least considering all the investment LA put into these three characters as well as the fact of LA not wanting any of them to get emotionally hurt and the OVA's though yes is great as it finishes the plot of this love triangle (most likely) but at the same time LA doesn't want it to happen (or hopefully copout)...yes LA is soo invested in this love triangle that LA wants a copout so no one will get hurt even though LA knows it's inevitable anyways...nonetheless a good ending cliffhanger High Score Girl...\\n\\n\r\nNow for the biggest elephant in the room, which would be the animation, well the animation was done by JC Staff and it mostly using 3D, ALOT of people didn't like this and when LA saw an interview with the director of High Score Girl, Yoshiki Yamakawa saying he wanted the anime to have that 90's vibe thus the 3D use, LA could get behind it, considering the entire source material and anime itself is a love letter to video games in the 90's. Also like how LA felt about Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova use of 3D in it's entirety, especially on it's entire character designs, this was no different, yes jarring and subpar at first but LA got used to it and the matter of fact that the animation was trying to feel like the 90's intentionally and not for budgetary reasons was reason enough for LA to give the animation some grace. The gaming aesthetics for High Score Girl was pretty loyal, especially with many of sprite work and all things considered that they had licensing from SNK and the like though that LA will get into a bit later...\\n\\n\r\nVoice work was fine all things considered, from the hyperactive Kouhei Yaguchi as Haruo to the mild mannered but with a sharp tongue Yuuki Hirose as Koharu but the biggest mystery was Sayumi Suzushiro as Oono, as she really...never talked a single line instead having some small grunts and bouts of anger but that was it, in a ways it shows magnitudes for the animation to show how Oono is feeling by showing instead of telling and though LA won't say that Sayumi was shafted but more or less it was an interesting role that Sayumi picked up, for a newbie no less. \\n\\n\r\nOk so High Score Girl was plagued with development hell even before it's release in Summer of 2018, as LA remembered this anime was suppose to be released as far back as 2013?, so why the development hell, well it was mainly caused by Square Enix ignoring the complaints dealt by SNK and several smaller gaming developers as they had found about the manga and it's copyrighted material and Square in their \"infinite wisdom\" instead looked to bigger gaming companies like Capcom and Sega thus causing a huge debacle and even to the point of a police crackdown and the confiscation of documents from Square almost indefinitely as Square violated SNK's copyrights thus the delay in the anime production but easily the fault of this legal mess went to Square. High Score Girl went through alot of shit ok...but both the anime and manga came out ok at the end.\\n\\n\r\nOk, that got too judicial, but back to High Score Girl the anime, well for a love letter to the 90's, from consoles, arcades and it's games and fine LA was a Playstation boy thus LA didn't have the same experience as Haruo and the cast with their SNES' but the tinge of nostalgia of going to the arcades at least gave LA the same feelings as Haruo so that is something. LA felt that High Score Girl did what was promised even under the veil of being a love triangle romance as LA will say it again, because of it's characters and the love triangle being interesting and investable due to the developing characters was a huge bonus for LA even to the point that LA could excuse the 3D animation as even that has a defense for itself (which you can take it how you like, LA was fine with it really).\\n\\n\r\nHigh Score Girl, you went through tons of crap and delays to get yourself finally animated and by all means LA enjoyed your presences in Summer 2018 and LA wouldn't say your LA's guilty pleasure of Summer 2018, no more like LA's underdog of Summer 2018 and much like Haruo, it made it out ok by the end...sure battered and bruised but still up and rearing to fight.",

What I also found interesting is that fact that this anime spends time early in the characters lives to really let you know how close they are, I loved how it\u2019s starts with them in elementary school and ends with them in highschool. I loved the characters (and am an avid Oono fan), andall the little facts about old style video games really had me imagining how it was to live back in the 90s and the time of arcades. I\u2019m excited for episodes 13-15 to come out and will be waiting patiently for them to.",
