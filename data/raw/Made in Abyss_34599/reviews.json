            "content": "Are you looking for a good, fun, light-hearted adventure? This has that.\r\nAre you looking for a wonderful, sci-fi thriller? This has its thrilling moments.\r\nAre you looking for wonderful chemistry between the characters? This presents that.\r\nDo you want an anime with well-animated fight scenes? This gives us that.\r\nAre you looking for an anime that has a wonderful staff backing it up, always checking to make sure they bring out the anime\u2019s fullest potential, based from its manga source, faithfully adapting it? They both have, and do that.\r\nMade in Abyss is an anime that can abide to almost anyone\u2019s taste in anime. I personally believe that Madein Abyss is an anime and manga that will ring throughout time as one of the best classics to come out in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? I\u2019ll tell you.\\n\\n\r\nAs said before, Made in Abyss has a staff of people running it that always checks to make sure that every episode is doing great, always trying their hardest into their works. A wonderful story, great character chemistry, a harmonious soundtrack, effects, and voice actors, and beautiful, fluid animation. All of that came onto the screen because of such a wonderful staff (except story, for the most part. Credit to the author, Akihito Tsukushi!). Everything about the series was able to grab me and pulled me in like a roped hostage on a train or bank scandal. While that may sound rough, what is truly meant is that, just from the first episode, I could tell that Made in Abyss was going to be great. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, it panels off immediately into a beautiful waterfall within the first layer of the Abyss and then into an abundance of flowers, trying to make you feel as if you\u2019re standing right next to the lead in their journey into the abyss. The staff did that to have world build for the viewers, but it was a lot more than that. With the waterfall and pacing through the first episode, the waterfall and what happens after foreshadows what is to come later in the story. EVERYTHING that happens in the first episode is foreshadowing the story within the Abyss. But let me get back to what happens shortly after the waterfall and flower clip. We are introduced to the lighthearted driver of the story and her friend, Riko and Nat. They walk down a path where they see a gondola, foreshadowing that Riko will be going down into the abyss. Then she goes on an excavation to find relics, only to find a dead body in prayer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then.. The craziest part of the episode that foreshadows the darkness of the story.\\n\r\nA child, an inch away from death, from being eaten by the monster with the most peculiar characteristics that will have importance in the show. The monster can be compared to that of a Manta Ray, a slug and a snake.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, because Riko is the main character, she cannot just standby and watch it all happen. So, she tries to attract the monster away from the child by blowing her whistle, and she runs away as hard as she can, and she gets hurt. Just when it seems everything is hopeless, A robotic child, or maybe I should say a knight in shining armor, saves Riko with a blast of light, and is found unconscious shortly after. Riko can\u2019t just leave him, being the main character. So, she brings him. That robot\u2019s name is Reg.\\n\\n\r\nThus, starts the wonderful character chemistry between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWith the first episode, whenever the characters interact with each other, it always brings great joy for how well they work together. It might be that the leads are kids (no, not lolis, they range from ages 10-12, and Kiwi is, like, 4), but because they are kids, it makes me feel as if I, myself, am a kid again. Just watching them do what they do across the screen, pulls my heart even more into the story. It truly feels as though I\u2019m standing next to them during their interactions. Due to the leads being kids, they give off the light-hearted sense of adventure. Living joyously, actively, and having fun. This is just between Nat, Riko, Reg, and Sigy. Don\u2019t even get me started on the interactions with Lyza, Ouzen and Nanachi. Their interactions are some of the biggest reasons why this anime is great, along with the fight scenes. Lyza being the narrator, Ouzen being the badass grandmother, and Nanachi (My favorite!) breaking your average anime tropes. If you want to know how great they are, just watch the anime. After the encounter with Ouzen, the story shows that, not even the main characters have plot armor. The definition of humanity treads onto many uncomfortable grounds for its viewers to display dark desires from within.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great attachment to the anime is the sound. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is beautiful. In an instant, from hearing the insert song from the first episode, I pre-ordered the soundtrack. The soundtrack sounds as if it came straight out of a game, and really has an adventurous beat to it. Thank you, Kevin Penkin. However, if I were to compare the soundtrack to the sound effects, the sound effects are some of the best sounds I have heard out of anime, especially when Reg shoots his arms or laser. What I can describe those sound effect as, is organic. With the voice actors, the kids sound like kids, and the old adults sound like old adults. But, when the intensity rises, comedically and dramatically, or narration within the anime, say, the fight scenes and Maaya Sakamoto (Her narration is wonderful to hear), the voice acting is great. It rounds about the sense of adventure, just like everything else the anime provides. With the voice acting, one can tell that there is passion going on behind the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing to talk about that the anime provides is the animation.\\n\\n\r\nI have not seen many anime with such fluid flowing animation besides those of Ghibli films. Speaking of which, the background animator of Made in Abyss comes from the Ghibli films! Will that motivate you to watch and finish Made in Abyss? ...No? Okay, then I\u2019ll provide more than that to motivate you. Time frame 19:57 to 20:10 in the first episode. That should be enough to talk about the animation, because animation like that is all the anime will provide, making eye candy for the viewer. From the grainy wood, to the cavities on rock walls, and the sun coming over the horizon are wonderful details added by the animators.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/TL;DR | Enjoyment: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is quite original in handling the fantasy setting, and I have to say that I\u2019m glad something like Made in Abyss was able to come by. How the author was able to build a culture around an enormous crater is quite plausible. Made in Abyss provides variety and satisfaction, and it even provides the knowledge of the author, such as medical assistance and ecological terminology. Made in Abyss is an anime I can universally recommend. A great story that compels the viewer to finish from the start, active and lively characters that can be described even more as such through their interactions, the wonderful music from the soundtrack, sound effects, voice actors, and the Ghibli-comparable animation. I utterly, truly, from the bottom of the abyss within my heart, recommend this anime to anyone who seeks a great story. Made in Abyss provides just that.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, a great fan.",

            "content": "Made in Abyss isn't at all what it appears to be. Though it may seem little more than an adventurous children's anime, chibi art and all, it gradually reveals itself as something much darker, as Riko's and Reg's hopeless ascent continues, stumbles along, no happy ending in sight, death\u2014 and worse\u2014 awaiting them for each step they fall.\r\nMany anime give off the facade of maturity: gratuitous gore, sadistic and loony villains, self-serving themes ripped from entry-level philosophers such as Nietzsche - features that make a story palatable to rebellious teenagers, rather than the adults they so desperately wish to be.\r\nBut Made in Abyss doesn't fallinto these trappings. It contains graphic, violent scenes, occasionally even outright disturbing, but never is there a moment where it feels unnecessary. It is a story of adventure, of survival, and of finding life within death. \\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss has one of the most interesting settings in anime. A city built around a giant pit, gaping downwards for tens of thousands of metres, its nature unknown, treasure and terrifying beasts awaiting any who wish to test their luck. What's at the very bottom of the pit? How deep can one truly go before death is an inevitability? In many ways, the pit is reminiscent of Hell: for each layer they reach, they encounter something more ghastly than the last, the stench of death progressively growing stronger. But Riko and Reg press onward, determined to find Riko's mother, no matter if they succumb to the dangers and find themselves a permanent resident of the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there exists ample world-building, the story instead puts the focus on the duo rather than the world at large, preferring instead to carefully reveal the details of the world through their eyes and ears, evolving the viewer from mere spectator to active participant. You don't know much about the pit's third and fourth layers until they reach that part themselves, and the fifth and beyond remain a complete mystery because nobody has ever actually survived to tell the tale. It's an elegant way to keep the viewer interested: I don't want to be told what to expect - I want to see for myself what monsters and contamination and other awfulness await the further they fall, and so I find myself with the next episode playing as soon as the credits hit roll. \\n\\n\r\nIt can be difficult for some (myself included) to empathise with child characters in anime, but Made in Abyss does an excellent job of making the viewer concerned about and emotionally invested in the survival of Riko and Reg. Their friendship with one another is deeply heart-warming, as they have, much like real children, no ulterior motives, and genuinely enjoy their time together. They rely on one another, their abilities complimenting the other's: intellect and cooking in Riko's case, and combat and acrobatics in Reg's. There is no journey without the other\u2014 it is either two or it is zero. And so it is difficult not to have a visceral emotional response when one of the two is desperately, miserably trying to save the other's life.\\n\\n\r\nSome caution should be taken when watching Made in Abyss, as it is by no means a happy adventure. With every episode, there is fear that one of them may die, that they may be betrayed, that they may become permanently disfigured or forced to kill or commit some other horrid act. This is seldom a concern for most anime, as the protagonists will always survive and reach some sort of happy ending to their story. But not Made in Abyss. It makes very clear that bad things are inevitable, which, given the setting, is perhaps only appropriate. Corpses, vomit, grossly deformed wounds, blood bleeding from and seeping into the eyeballs\u2014 Made in Abyss is by no means something that should ever be viewed by children, and even adults would do well to prepare themselves if they are not accustomed to these sorts of horrors. The abyss is not a wonderful land of treasure, but an awful place where awful things happen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still some minor issues with the story, however. Most prominent is the fact that there is as of yet no actual ending, something I did not realise until the final episode when I looked at the source material and found out that, oh, the manga was still ongoing. This ceases to be a problem in the event of future seasons and adaptations, but will there be any? Will this be where the anime ends, in the middle of their journey? \"Hey, this is the end of the anime, so go and read the manga\" is not quite what you want to hear when you are emotionally invested in an anime. But, I suppose, a faithful, if potentially incomplete adaptation is still preferable to the dreadful anime-only endings that plague many unfortunate adaptations. The story is too grand in scale, too personal for it to end after only thirteen episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story could have also done without the more sexual situations\u2014 the references to penises, and one ungraceful moment where Reg returns from trying to save someone's life, only to blush and freak out immediately after when he sees Riko being undressed. With how serious the mood was at that point in the story, it effectively killed all the tension that had been building for the entire episode. That's not to imply this scene existed to create sexual arousal in the audience\u2014 Made in Abyss has more integrity than that\u2014 as she was being undressed solely for health reasons, but certainly it was not a scene that felt in any way necessary. There's a time and place in the story for comedic relief, and that was not the time.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is fairly impressive in terms of its sound and artwork. The background music starts adventurous and gradually becomes more ominous as the story progresses, even if the ending theme remains almost hilariously light-hearted and incongruently so\u2014 its lyrics being more appropriate to Barney & Friends than a graphic life-or-death struggle. While the artstyle may not be to everyone's taste, it at least remains detailed and consistent throughout the series (the map after the ending sequence being a nice addition), although there are perhaps two or three odd moments during the action sequences where the animation will suddenly become sketchy, for reasons that are mystery to me.\\n\\n\r\nIn one of the weakest seasons for anime, where interesting series may well be nonexistent, Made in the Abyss is a genuine surprise. While I might reserve claims such as it being the best anime of the year (Sangatsu no Lion takes that one for me), it is a  truly special anime, one which had me worried and invested in the characters' fate in a way that very few anime ever have. \\n\\n\r\nI want to see a future where Riko and Reg return to a happy life on the surface. But, much like them, I am determined to see their journey to its end, no matter the result.",

            "content": "I want to be honest. I was evading this anime and manga. My first impression was the picture of Riko, Regu, and Nanachi, I thought: An anime about children, with some strange plot, fanservice and maybe a big bunny. I was not expecting anything from this anime. I was preparing to skip and to \"bury\" it in a review, but now I can eat my own words. This anime is a jewel. The adaptation is incredible. It has a good narrative with an impressive artistic design, combined with the most beautiful soundtrack of the year and an acceptable character development.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAn anime with a goodstory. It has everything, mystery, emotion, sadness, love, action, tears and much more. The story could be straightforward and conceptually very simple, several details are added as the story progresses. The show highlights concepts such as friendship, trust, why the abyss became important to the locals and the curse that surrounds it without being too complicated for the viewer to understand. Also, we can observe the constant need to find the truth and the need to resolve the abyss' mysteries. Besides, the story blended very well with the art and soundtrack to produce a beautiful animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe abyss is an incredibly creative world. For me, it has its own set of laws where all the characters converge. The story never contradicts the abyss but uses it to propel the mysteries and characters. The plot is very attractive, and the details are revealed at the right pace to keep you hooked to the end. Also, some details are never shared, we can try to guess about them.\\n\\n\r\nLowering the abyss is a dangerous task. However, it is gratifying to see the consistency between hazards and depth. Perhaps the only negative point I have is that the story is not going to be finished as the manga is still going on. In addition, it was only adapted to chapter 26 of the manga. I'm sure we'll have to wait a while for an ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Riko and Regu. I consider Nanachi and Ouzen as secondary characters but those two added important details to the story. \\n\\n\r\nRiko radiates great enthusiasm. She wants to explore and to understand the abyss. Besides, she is anxious to go deeper because she wants to see her mom. She suffers, cries, worries, but always tries to be active no matter how weak she is. She is brilliant, but her body is not that strong. She trusts Regu unconditionally.\\n\\n\r\nRegu. Is it a machine? Is it a hybrid? This character has a mystery that maybe will not be explained. He is powerful but lacks thoughtful analysis. For that reason, he is the best partner for Riko because she is the rational one and they trust each other.\\n\\n\r\nOuzen (Ozen): She is a human being but could be a monster. She does not care if you're weak or strong. She will show you the reality and if necessary will put you in your place.\\n\\n\r\nNanachi is more a survivor of the abyss curse. She (I'm assuming she's a girl) is very intelligent and has suffered a lot. However, there may be an error in her age. She might look young as Riko, but is she so young? I think she's older than Riko and Regu. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters look good together because their traits are very different. The show portrayed them very well. However, I would consider the characters as the weakest link in the series. Do not get me wrong, they are good, but they were not explored enough to explain some parts of the story. At times I felt that we just touched the surface of these characters. There are some background questions, and I'm sure we will get the answers in the future.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe best of the season. They pay attention to details. For example, in episode one at the end, we can see the talent of this group when they combined the shadows and the lighting at dawn and created a perfect movement. The precise colors and design created an impressive effect that for the spectator's eyes could be one of the best of the year. That quality remained throughout the series. In addition, the choice of colors and a smart move adjusted within the scenes helps you to focus on what matters, not forgetting or letting go of the details if you choose to focus on other parts of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences have an excellent design and do not lose quality. They also combine very well with the sound mixing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nWith one word I want to praise this \"exceptional\" sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST has several scores that help the storytelling. For example, a mixed composition such as \"Underground River\" (Ep1, Disc1), \"Hanazeve Caradhina\" (Ep1), \"Swings and Roundabouts\" combined with an intelligent sequence, an impressive story and a witty artistic direction created the perfect environment to catch any viewer and make them anxious for more. We can find another example in the score \"The first layer.\" This score helps to add to the plot the feeling of the unknown and the expectation for the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe music runs in the best time possible. It creates excitement, drama, conveys feelings to viewers and makes the plot and characters shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs Deep in Abyss (OP) and Tabi no Hidarite, Saihate no Migite (ED) are the perfect complement to this anime. These songs are very catchy and have a great rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the VO. I'm not used to talking about it, but in this case, the voices helped to portray the characters. For example, Ouzen's voice. That voice adds excitement to the scenes and creates a great twisted mystery to the character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this anime. It does not matter if the characters were not explored in detail, no matter the lack of answers about some characters or if the story did not end. The show brings a lot of excitement to any viewer. The story is solid, well structured and consistent almost all the time. The pace is good and the details never hurried. Another good point is that they followed the manga so none could complain. The art and sound led the narration out of the chart. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI was tempted to give a 10 to this anime, but the questions about the characters and the unfinished story lowered the score. Unfortunately for us, we do not know if we will get a continuation of the anime in the future, but it does not matter. I recommend this anime, the art, the adaptation are exceptional with a unique soundtrack. It was the best of the season so skipping it will be a mistake. In the end, I became a fan of this story and I don't regret it. \\n\\n\r\nPS: Yes! Another messy review by Pipe and I didn't proofread again, sorry.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's been a long time since I saw an anime which manages to immediately get you captivated as much as Made in Abyss did. At first glance it might look like a kids' show of sorts, but you really couldn't be much further from the truth. This is a pretty dark anime past a certain point, but even before that it's still fantastic.\r\nMade in Abyss is a perfect example of an adventure anime done right. When I first started watching it, it reminded me of the feeling you get when you jump into some beautiful-looking open-world RPG for the first time, as the world ofMade in Abyss simply looks stunning. The environments are breathtaking by themselves, but the nature of the giant hole into the underworld known as the Abyss is also so fascinating to think about. Just what could lie down there? How could such a thing possibly even exist? It teases your imagination with its unique flora and fauna, and there are so many mysteries to unravel about both the Abyss itself but also the main characters' personal intrigues which are related to it. It's like a legendary dungeon which is just begging to be explored to see what new fascination lies just around the corner.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the peculiar robot boy Regu and his human friend Riko as they embark on a perilous journey into the depths of the Abyss in search of Riko's long lost mother. During their travels they have to learn first-hand about all the different types of hazards that lie within the Abyss, and what kind of strange creatures inhabit it. The main characters are both children and as a result still quite immature in nature, yet they're still filled with unwavering determination and courage to push onwards. Riko is ultimately quite helpless and incapable of defending herself or traversing difficult terrain, so Regu helps her out with his multi-purpose robotic arms to get the job done instead. But above all, they both feel very believable. Riko is very humane in nature and quite quickly becomes someone you want to cheer for, and even Regu is surprisingly genuine despite being an amnesiac robot of unknown origins. There are also a handful of side characters making appearances of different sorts throughout the show, but while most of their roles are relatively brief, they all feel like they serve a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just a well-written and exciting adventure anime though, but past a certain point the story also becomes very serious. In an almost Madoka-like twist of fate, it's like the author suddenly snapped his fingers and decided to take the series to the next level, which resulted in one of the most gruesome anime episodes I've seen in a long time. It was legitimately hard to watch (you'll know it when you see it). However, this only serves to further add to the feeling of peril and caution when trying to proceed further down into the Abyss, because the viewers are shown first-hand that this place is not to be underestimated. The show may have childlike characters and beautiful environments, but death might just lurk around any nearby corner nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is one of those anime which may be fairly straightforward in nature, but is still just so interesting in so many different ways that it's hard to stop watching. You never know what you're going to find next in this fantasy-like place, and the danger and intensity of the Abyss is showcased so well in order to get the appropriate atmosphere across to the viewers. It's beautiful yet deadly at the same time. It may have merely been a potential dark horse when the season started, but by the end of it there's no question which horse won the race any longer.",

            "content": "\"If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.\" - Some anime bad guy, probably.\r\nWell, I've gazed into this abyss long enough. I might get more enjoyment or value from staring at a literal black pit than watching another episode of this plodding, interminable slog of a manga adaptation.\r\nMade In Abyss is enticing enough at the start. The art style, which reminds me of something like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance or Studio Ghibli's projects, is right up my alley. While I could take or leave the OP, the ED is catchy as hell (especially when those claps hit, my God). Thestory's setting is probably its greatest strength, and I was interested in learning more about the Abyss, its inhabitants, and the mysteries it holds after the first episode. Even the characters were initially decent enough for me to want to see more of them. Hell, the second episode is basically a bunch of adults telling the MC in quick succession \"Your mom's fucking dead, kiddo.\" How could I resist? What could go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer: The pacing. The painfully slow, drawn out, mind-numbing, meandering, excitement-killing pacing. That's what could go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI think the first warning sign was how it took three entire episodes to actually get into the abyss. Now, I'm not saying everything has to be all action, all the time, and there's always value in a good build up, but that felt like wasted time when so much of those episodes were spent on (seemingly) superfluous characters. You want to establish the setting along with Riko and Regu's motivations, sure, but it felt like belaboring the point to the point of tedium.\\n\\n\r\nBut while that at least served a narrative purpose, the following episodes utterly crash and burn. For a show that tries to tell us there's some sort of urgency, the pacing sure as hell doesn't reflect that. Worse, the beginning of every episode is taken up by an unnecessary, minutes long recap (a debilitating case of One Piece Syndrome). Then, to add insult to injury, it starts relying on cheap cliffhangers and cliche shonen bullshit as if desperate to convince you that, yes, things are actually happening and this is worth your time.\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh, we killed 15 minutes faffing about Ozen's house? Well, now she's acting weird. Spooky, right? Bam. Cliffhanger.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Here's a protracted scene of Ozen just beating the shit out of Regu and nearly shooting Riko with an incineration cannon at point blank range. How do our heroes get out of this? Ha, they don't, she was just testing them! That doesn't feel like a cheap cop-out at all, does it?\"\\n\\n\r\nIf Riko and Regu were dimensional enough, maybe they could carry the story, but they feel pretty flimsy as characters. I don't dislike them, but I'm not compelled to keep tuning in to see what happens to them next. A lot of people hype the show by mentioning how dark the manga supposedly gets, but if I'm not invested in the characters, then what does it matter to me if fucked up shit happens to them later down the line?\\n\\n\r\nLook, I don't necessarily mind a show that's slow paced if it feels deliberate and purposeful. The Sopranos is 86 episodes of Tony Soprano going to therapy, dealing with his family, and eating gabagool, and that's perhaps the greatest television program of all time; its length serves the story because it is a complex and meditative character study. Similarly, you don't need action or fights for an episode to leave an impact. NGE Episode 15 is probably my favorite of the whole series, and that one features no angels or mech battles, and is instead \"just\" about Misato going to a wedding.\\n\\n\r\nSo understand that when I say nothing fucking happens in this show, I'm not asking for mindless action and instant gratification. However, I need something of substance - character, plot, a worthwhile mystery - and I'm not getting any of that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've got nothing to say about the source material, because I've heard great things about the manga. I hope that this is just a lackluster adaptation that's failed to translate what makes the manga work into the anime format. However, I'm not going to continue watching a bad adaptation just because the original is supposed to be good. I'll just get around to reading the manga instead.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't the worst thing ever. It's pretty, and it's got a pretty good hook, but it's totally insubstantial and not worth your time. Instead of 13 episodes of Made in Abyss, you could watch any number of more worthwhile shows instead. Believe me when I say you'd have more fun playing cave explorer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by \"cave explorer\" I mean getting a finger up the butt.",

            "content": "Made in Abyss. So many people said so many good things about it around the web, as well as having tons of positive reviews.\r\nI would assume I'm the minority here. \r\nMade in Abyss is a show which follows two main characters- A girl called \"Riko\" and some kind of a mysterious robot called \"Reg\". They got \"summoned\" to the bottom of the Abyss by Riko's mother (which is probably the best cave raider out there).\r\nNow, We have some great \"world building\"... kind of.\r\nWe see interesting layers of the Abyss, and interesting monsters and such, but one thing annoys me the most:\r\nRiko is a kid, shedoesn't understand anything about the Abyss. Even full fledged adults who have cave raiding experiences of tens of years wouldn't make it to the bottom, so why would Riko get there? A random, normal, 12 years old girl.\\n\\n\r\nSo there she goes down there with the robot called \"Reg\". But let's not mistake- Reg isn't some \"military robot\" which is capable of some fantasic features, machine guns and stuff. He can extend his arms and has some kind of a blaster (and he collapses after using it). \\n\\n\r\nWe see already from the first episode what the horrors of the Abyss are. People sent from down there what they look like. Huge monsters with shields and shells. How the hell are these two kids supposed to beat the monsters? Not sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe show just feels extremely unrealistic, and don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with it being unrealistic, but it makes me think like this anime underestimates your IQ.\\n\\n\r\nI can easily say, \"Hype killed the anime\". You see, it might be enjoyable to watch it, but I don't agree with all the hype and \"Wow, such a good anime\". This anime will definitely not be anywhere close to my AOTS (Anime of the season).\\n\\n\r\nI think in these paragraphs I've summarised my opinions of the Story, which I'll give 5/10 and character, which will get 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give art a 9/10. Not too much to say, but the anime \"looks good\" visual-wise.\\n\\n\r\nSound- While I don't find any of the soundtracks too interesting or unique, the OP is really good. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nLast words, enjoyment and overall, I rate it 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you got to read the review before watching the anime and you are interested, please, do yourself a favor and watch it before reading anything else about it. The hype is too great you might find yourself hating this anime because of it (Like me).",

            "content": "Welcome to the most overhyped show of 2017. Made in Abyss is a perfect example of an above average show that gets hyped up by every body which forces others into believing that the show is something it really isn't. I, for a change, am not blinded by \"hype\", and can see the flaws in Made in Abyss, which are quite numerous.\r\nStory : 2/10\r\nSometimes it speeds up and gets somewhat interesting, sometimes it slows down and gets really boring. The show is basically boring up to episode 6, then somewhat interesting up to episode 9, and then a snoozefest until the end, unless you happento like the characters, which I didn't. Episode 13 is dedicated to the backstory of 2 characters I honestly couldn't care less about.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Made in Abyss tries to be this grand mystery with multiple intriguing plot lines, but fails at doing so. One of these seemingly important plot points only gets a half of the final episode dedicated to it, the other is a superficial motivation for the main character to go down the Abyss. So the plot ends up relying on the adventures of Riko and Reg, which I must say, are the \"interesting\" part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss builds a vast, colourful world that it ends up forgetting to explore. Something that I was wondering while watching this show is \"Do other countries exist? Is there anything beyond the mountain-island on which the characters live?\", a question to which I didn't get a reply. What does the show actually explore then? The Abyss? Sort of, up to a certain point at which the main characters stop at a layer which happens around episodes 8-9. Thing is, the show starts exploring the world it has built around episodes 3-4, so that's only 4-5 episodes of exploration, in an anime in which the story is held up by the adventures of the main characters. You're left with an empty shell of a promise you were given by the set-up episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Mady in Abyss is a spark of originality and good ideas with nothing to back those ideas up.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I'm not a fan of the artstyle, which lowers my mark a tad bit, I must say that the art in Made in Abyss is great. The world is drawn beautifully and down in the Abyss we can witness variety filled scenery in the various levels of the aforementioned shaft. However, since the show stagnates at certain points, some of the this scenery gets old.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't outstanding, but for a show made in 2017, it's surprisingly not poor outside of the BD releases. The small chibi characters are easier to animate after all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is beautiful. The opening has some nice vocals. The ending is catchy. The voice actors all did an amazing job at their characters. This is the one point where Made in Abyss shines.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I giving such a low mark to a show that heavily focuses on the relationship and adventures of 2 characters? Simple. 4/10 is for the 4 good characters of this show: Riko, Reg, Ouzen, and Nanachi. I will admit that these 4 are all quite charismatic and memorable. However, I hate kids, so I couldn't stand Riko and Reg most of the time. Ouzen, being one of the 2 characters I actually liked in Made in Abyss should have been developed more. I'd gladly watch an episode dedicated to her rather than the 13th episode which was dedicated to Nanachi and Mitty.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss never made it past the \"it's ok\" phase for me. It hang during its airtime at a 6, sometimes showing the potential of peaking at a 7, only to nose dive to a 4 with the boring last episode. It's one of the shows I'd switch on in the background while doing something else, only paying about 3/4s of my attention to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you like adventure anime? This show isn't for you. Do you like captivating or relatable characters? This show isn't for you. Do you like empty promises? This show might be for you. Do you like eye candy? Watch Made in Abyss, otherwise, don't.",

            "content": "Open up an endless world of possible settings. A Giant hole in the middle of civilization, in which lies a gigantic hole dangerous to mankind. What could it be? How does it work? What lies within it?\r\nMade in Abyss is one of my personal favourites of Summer 2016 due to its amazing setting, atmosphere, and world building with amazing execution along with an amazing narrative. It shows us the dangerous and more grim side of things while making it completely thought provoking. \r\nWe start off this adventure with Riko, a girl with curiosity and the need to adventure the depths of the Abyss thoroughly. Withno signs of fear, she heads on strong until her partner Nat gets into trouble with a creature. She does save him and with this, she meets a robotic boy named Reg. His origins at the time were mysterious and unknown to Riko. Thus their adventure as boy and girl, in search for a purpose begins.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do they feel the need to enter the Abyss? Why risk it all and go into a deadly place? For the search of Riko\u2019s Mom and her whereabouts. Her curiosity and duty like feeling called her into the Abyss and Riko wanted to find the answer to it all. While they adventure and stray from what was called their home, they delve deep into deaths row. While they do this, their personality matures while they grow significantly as characters. Proceeding with caution and making the right decisions is all that matter. Because one little mistake and it may be then over for our adventurers.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I can appreciate about Made in Abyss is its use of colours and looking at the atmosphere within its full beauty telling us that great Storytelling isn't all they can do. While they're at it, why not insert a beautiful song while we look at some beautiful scenery? Setting the tone like that in the first episode and I knew that this series would be great. \\n\\n\r\nI have read the manga before hand and seeing it brought out to life is much more satisfying. The way the voice acting is brought out, to how the creatures look, to the soundtrack. I might be praising the music too much, but I think it deserve just that much praise. \\n\\n\r\nThe objective here mainly is Riko and Reg in search for Riko\u2019s mother and descending further into the Abyss, with more risks to come. The system of the Abyss is explained and how it works. Riko and Reg knows that this will be a very difficult trip. But they head in otherwise. Despite them being a lower rank (red whistle), they show bravery and proceeds.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say this to those who might not have a clue, but I suggest heading into this anime cautiously. It is by no means a kids show, so don't be fooled by the childlike artstyle. You'll find it more enjoyable and it might give you a more interesting experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime for me is the atmosphere and the feeling once they go deeper and deeper. It seems ok at first, but as it progresses, the atmosphere becomes more dark and fearful along with an uncomfortable feeling. It's weird how Riko, who is only a little girl, dives into this deathly hole with little to no hesitation. Her drive is that insane. Which I find very odd in some ways. It's just not normal for a little girl to conceive all the consequences and dangers that lies ahead and just disregard those things in a sense and be on her merry way. Interesting how she's like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and character design is not something you usually see, which gives Made in Abyss a more unique touch to it. The design will not appeal to everyone I'm sure, but I for one really appreciate how each character looks. With the Chibi looking artstyle to the very beautiful looking layers in the Abyss, the unique story, the execution, working together with the beautiful Soundtrack, Art, and animation, this anime is like ear gasms plus eye gasms. It\u2019s very satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses, so does Reg and Riko. They learn to trust each other better (although Riko looked like she liked Reg from the start with her happy go lucky attitude). They learn that the Abyss is no small thing and that they must learn that no help will come for them in times that they are in danger.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything to complain about, it may be the fact that the narrative aspect of the show seems a bit slow. I found the character development to be ok, but overall this anime is my favourite of Summer 2017. I loved the death vibes as they went deeper. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is mostly based around Reg and Riko and their adventure within the abyss. This is how you world build, this is how you make an adventure series, this is how you add violent scenes, this is how you create suspense, this is how to make someone truly cringe, this is how you execute storytelling correctly.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss does it all, with minor errors or flaws, it proves that little children going on a nice adventure isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows.",

I would be lying if I said there hasn\u2019t been any good shows for a long time. Many great animes have released over the last few years, yet I was yearning for something that wasn\u2019t just a show with a great plot twist, or even a show that wrote believable and memorable characters.\r\nI wanted an anime that stolemy heart.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss was a series I never even heard of before Summer 2017. In fact, I didn\u2019t even know of its existence till half-way through the Summer season. When I first saw the picture for the show here on MAL, I was unimpressed. The art came across as childish and goofy. The rating, on the other hand, was extremely high for a show I dismissed as \u201cchildish,\u201d at first glance. Thank you MAL faithful, if it wasn\u2019t for the oddly high score, I would have passed on this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you aren\u2019t sitting there reading this review to hear how I had the wonderful accident of crossing paths with this anime. You want to know why you should watch it. After all, you are probably wondering how this show got to the top 50 highest ranked shows on MAL. I\u2019ll tell you how:\\n\\n\r\nThey tried.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the characters are the heart of this great anime. I can go on about describing how they look one-dimensional and at first you may be confused as to how these little children can even begin to be involved in a fantastical original story, but I won\u2019t. You see, Made in Abyss isn\u2019t a show to be described. It is a show to be experienced. The art, the music, and the characters are done in such a way that if you took a step back and analyzed it all, you would see the love and care the original manga author and the anime creators had for them. They aren\u2019t just here to entertain the audience, they are here to take the audience on a journey with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe journey is full of trials and triumphs, heartache and despair, yet they aren\u2019t shoved down your throat. It all unfolds naturally before the audience\u2019s eyes. The originality drips from this anime like sweet and soothing nectar for my soul. My heart could only take so many \u201cvideo game worlds\u201d and \u201cmoe overload\u201d animes. Finally, a fantasy adventure that doesn\u2019t tell me how to think or what to feel. The only small complaint I can conjure for this master-level display of originality and heart is that the plot doesn\u2019t start to unravel until the tail end of the series (see what I did there fellow Nanachi fans?), yet the world and characters more than make up for this small shortcoming.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I could write an in-depth analysis on why the opening episodes are brilliant, how the music accompanies the atmospheric art and sets the tone for certain scenes, how the characters are naturally fleshed out, how the actual world the characters live in feels like a character itself, or how the story progresses at just the right pace. But I won\u2019t. Listen, I may not know what you look for in an anime, but I can tell you why I love anime, and I why I continue to watch it even when more than half of the shows that come out every season are literal garbage. I want to find that one anime that can steal my heart. Even if it may be for one season. I want it to take me for a ride I won\u2019t forget. Fate/Zero, Eureka Seven, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist \u2013 they are all great animes, don\u2019t get me wrong. However, they didn\u2019t steal my heart.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss stole my heart.\\n",

            "content": "Made in Abyss aired in the Summer season of 2017 and ran for 13 episodes; the last occupying a double time slot. It's about children who delve into a great chasm called \"The Abyss\" in order to find treasures to sell in order for their village to profit. The protagonists embark on a quest to find information about the main girl's mother.\r\nQuality\r\nMade in Abyss is very misleading about a lot of things, but none so much as the quality of the show. The world shows much promise when it is introduced, but instead of answering the questions we have about the Abyss, the village theylive in, the surrounding countries that trade with the village, and the inhabitants of the Abyss, we are left with more questions. The total lack of explained depth of the world is a big mark against the show since, although the premise sounds great, very little substantial detail is provided. Although the world building is mediocre at best, the plot keeps itself above the line and is intriguing enough to justify the slower pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters range from quite good to insultingly poorly written. Riko is a run of the mill child protagonist that keeps wanting to push further than she is capable of. She does get punished, which makes for an interesting turn in the plot, though the gratuitousness is similar to Evil Dead levels which detracts from the immersion. Reg is a walking plot convenience device. He can conveniently do literally everything that he is demanded by the plot to do, ranging from infinitely extending arms, an overpowered blast cannon with a minor downside, a near unbreakable body, and resistance to the curse of the Abyss. Since he also conveniently has plot amnesia, he is a lazily written character and nothing to be impressed by. The only impressive characters didn't have a large part. Ozen, who appeared halfway through, was plenty interesting and Bondrewd, appearing in the last episode, was a good charismatic villain. Nanachi is nothing to write home about, but nothing all that bad. She doesn't do much other than help the cast and have a sad backstory.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation, in contrast to the weak characters and bad world building, is excellent. Made in Abyss was the best looking show in its airing season and one of the best this year. Kinema Citrus hasn't made a good looking show since Barakamon. The soundtrack was very appropriate and well made. There are several tracks that stand out. Kevin Penkin did most of the composition and was the correct choice for the show. His style is contemplative and artsy without sounding obnoxious, and uses the orchestra often enough to appeal to fans of orchestral music.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment Factor\\n\\n\r\nIf a show is lacking in quality, like Made in Abyss is, entertainment factor can be redeeming enough to make a show worth watching. If you enjoy watching cardboard cutouts make their way down a dangerous, large hole that has pretty backgrounds Made in Abyss is for you. If you want something wholesome, Made in Abyss is not for you. A potential turn off is the gratuitous gore, abuse and fetishisation of innocent seeming children. Riko is wearing nothing fairly often in the show, Reg gets his genitalia inspected at multiple points during the show and there are a few scenes where children suffer in extreme ways, resulting in death some of the time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the last episode, which involves children suffering, is the most entertaining part due to the charismatic and lawful evil villain. This episode also happens to have the least amount of Riko and Reg, which is a factor in it being enjoyable. Sadly, even in this episode children are fetishised which detracts immensely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Message\\n\\n\r\nThe short length (13 episodes) makes it hard to determine exactly what the message is. It seems to be that if you surround yourself with strong people that you will be able to work towards your goals effectively. This message is a selfish one, but accurate and not a bad takeaway. Bondrewd's episode has the message that progress at all costs isn't necessarily a good thing, but the rewards can be alluring despite the atrocities that need to be committed in order to obtain them. These are good messages, but they can hide the truth about this show.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important takeaway is that although Made in Abyss looks like an alright show on the surface, there is a dark truth: it fetishises children and the author is a pedophile. This explains why many things happen in the show and presents them in a potentially different light. The target audience clearly isn't children due to the gory and violent nature, which means it's for teens and adults. The teens may be impressed by the edgy turn the plot takes, but there's nothing that an adult would like unless they're a creep that likes watching children suffer, or be fetished. Made in Abyss is a fetish show for creeps which passes itself as an edgy suffering trip for the youths and the people willing to sweep the disturbing truth under the rug. It's not a well written show, and it's not a worthwhile show. The entertainment value isn't nearly high enough to justify watching a degenerate show made by a pedophile.\\n\\n\r\nShould you really watch Made in Abyss?\\n\r\nNo. No you shouldn't.",

I can't\r\nsay I regretted it though since the shock value was good. \r\nStory: Children go somewhere they know might kill them, the expected happens. I haven't seen the whole thing yet but I'm guessing it's hard or tragic obstacle after another. \r\nCharacters: Riko is unchanging and is just energetic and determined. Reg is developed and changes a tiny bit about caring for Riko, but his moral values and mindset are nothing new and this in my opinion makes a bland character. In the end, they just fall into categories and aren't multidimensional, unlikeother anime MCs. So far they're predictable and uninteresting but that may change later.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is unique and plot based. If you like interesting characters and good character development, I don't recommend this and you'll find it very boring. \\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you like sci fi, symbolism, and predictable conflicts, or possibly children, I do recommend it.",

            "content": "[CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS]\r\nThe world of Made in Abyss is a fascinating one. It is filled with strange creatures and relics of a time long forgotten. Most fascinating though, is the Abyss. At the centre of the town of Oosu, there lies a pit which stretches far into the Earth. No one knows how far or has ever made it down to the bottom. In the Abyss, there are a multitude of relics that can be found and sold to foreign countries. The brave people who go into the pit are called Cave Raiders and they form the backbone of the economy in Oosu, the buyingand selling of these precious relics. But it is dangerous work, and many die while in the Abyss. This story is about a girl named Riko and her friend, Reg who traverse the Abyss, hoping to find Riko\u2019s mother and to seek answers about Reg\u2019s past. Made in Abyss produced by studio Kinema Citrus has captivated the curiosity of its viewers through an excellent use of worldbuilding, great characters, and stellar art and sound direction.  \\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is a prime example of how to do worldbuilding right. The first episode starts off with some excellent shots of the Abyss. We see a waterfall and lush green vegetation as we are introduced to our protagonist Riko. To put it bluntly, the world of Made in Abyss looks gorgeous. To top it off, there is expansive worldbuilding that fleshes out the setting of the story. The first four episodes are chock full of worldbuilding but it is never boring. We are not told everything, but get to witness certain events take place and learn more about the world through it. A great example of this is the classroom in the orphanage. Riko\u2019s mother is down in the Abyss and since her father is dead, she is placed in an orphanage. There, the children learn the skills necessary to become cave raiders. In the classroom where the children learn, there is great amounts of verticality. Their desks are attached high up onto a wall; they need to climb just to get to their seats. It\u2019s with moments such as this that it becomes clear that there has been great care put into the world of Made in Abyss. This effort put in really shows and it helps to really immerse the viewer into the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main character that we have met so far in Made in Abyss are Riko and Reg or Regu. Riko is a bright bubbly person and loves just about cave raiding. She wishes to reach heights of fame comparable to that of Lyza, her mother and become a white whistler, the highest rank of all cave raiders. She is very inquisitive and her energetic nature is positively infectious. It was a nice touch to see how immature she is when thinking about the dangers of the Abyss. Reg is a robot who met Riko when he saved her from a beast in the Abyss. He had no idea how he got there but Riko had a hunch that he was from the bottom of the Abyss. He is quite shy and lacks confidence. He has recollection of where he came from and follows Riko into the Abyss to hopefully get answers as to who he is and where he came from. The great thing about these characters is that they react according to their character traits, but are not so far removed from reality that they act like a stereotype or a trope. Currently, they are developing into mature into multifaceted characters, and I hope it stays that way rather than regressing into simple caricatures.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design and the artwork for this show is stunning. As I mentioned before, the background art is amazing. Props need to be given to Osamu Masuyama, who has also worked on beautiful pieces such as Your Name and Spirited Away. The sound design for this show was also amazing. It would be better if you just listened to it instead of me talking about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Made in Abyss is a story about a two friends as they adventure into the depths of the Abyss that is held up mainly by its worldbuilidng, art and sound, but also has characters that are great due to their well-roundness and their ability to entertain the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (Great)\\n\\n",

            "content": "You can't say shows featuring a combination of lolis, furries and traps are all shit anymore because of this amazing adaptation of an exceptional manga. Bummer, innit?\r\nWe get to follow a story of a small girl going on a suicide mission trying to reach her mommy stuck in a deep part of a glorified manhole, which is possible only because she conveniently finds an overpowered chibi cyborg on one of her practice strolls. This guy also happens to represent the average male MAL user as he gets a boner every time he cuddles a loli, including furry lolies with unknown type of genitals. Nice.You can find the full description of the cyborg at the end of the review.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I mentioned a glorified manhole, didn't I. It is called \"the Abyss\", as the title suggests. It is as gorgeous as it is dangerous, the feeling of suspense and the visuals are both marvelous. As there is little known about deeper parts of the pit, the shroud of mystery thickens with every meter of our descent. No worries about backtracking, a convenient decompression syndrome called \"the curse of the glorified manhole\" makes sure our little girl is positively suicidal, because, go figure, jumping too high in this manhole may turn you into a blobfish (true story).\\n\\n\r\nOn a serious note, lets talk about the good stuff:\\n\r\nEnvironments are glorious. The complexity of the layers is something very rarely seen in the medium. Chibi character design creates chilling contrast between the innocence of the children and the darkness of the abyss. It works very well, especially in later episodes.\\n\r\nVisuals are spectacular overall, I very rarely, if ever, see landscapes/background so datailed and vivid. Huge bow before the man in the lead of the design. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack album to this series is one of the best  I have ever heard. Peaceful ambience emphasizes the mystery of the abyss, while the well executed build up in some of the more aggressive tracks accompanies our little friends during their struggles. Every environment has it's theme, also, which gives more substance to the world. Sound utilization in the final episode is a masterwork.\\n\\n\r\nJapanese voice actors do a great job during the intense scenes. Nanachi sounds adorable.\\n\\n\r\nStrongest points of the source material are definitely the coldness of the abyss, world design, dependence between the main characters and the consciousness that \"there is no going back\". Dark twists accompanying the story development are the main reason of success of the series.\\n\r\nThis is the type of show that gives out the impression of cuteness and peacefulness at first, hints at something thrilling about the setting in the beginning, keeps the suspense troughout the entirety of the series and absolutely blows your mind with the climax. Time spent watching this show is a time spent well.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n___________________\\n\r\nCHAMPION SPOTLIGHT\\n\r\nReg, the Treasure of the Deep.\\n\r\nOur new champion, Reg, is a jungler. His passive, \"artificial body\", grants him immunity to auto-attacks and many skillshots. His Q skill, \"graple\", allows him to grab an object in his field of view and transport him and nearby allies to a target location. His W \"restrain\" wraps a pair of ropes around his target, immobilizing it, but rendering him unable to use his Q. His E, \"empowered perception\", grants him vision on nearby enemies. His ultimate is called \"incinerator\". After channeling energy into his palm, he fires a ray of hot plasma in a straight line, destroying everything in the way. Using \"incinerator\" forces Reg to sleep after ten minutes. This skill has a 2 hour cooldown. These game mechanics allow us to skip to the fun part of the story pretty quickly.\\n\r\nIt is important to note that Reg reaches his full potential in a team full of underage female champions.",

            "content": "Lost destiny, power at a price, the tolls of exploration. That is what goes on to drive them, to lead destiny forward to a world behind comprehension. That is.... the Abyss. \r\nIt's certainly an interesting place to be sure. Those who return from it rarely bring back all its secrets, but receive worship regardless as more and more people are conditioned to go in and do work for their society. In that setting, this show is most definitely a journey, one where two young kids, drawn by their pasts beyond their understanding, discover a world where everything is dangerous and cooperation is a necessity.\r\nMade inAbyss is quite the interesting show. Being the critical standout in a generally disappointing anime season, it proved that having ambition and being willing to take risks to not sugarcoat content is very much appreciated, where something with a simple synopsis as \"kids go into hole\" can be so captivating, atmospheric, perilous, heart wrenching, mysterious, and even sweet. \\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with our young protagonist Riko. Being an explorer in training, one day when in the titular Abyss, she is nearly eaten by a giant worm monster that wouldn't be out of place in Monster Hunter. Thankfully she is saved by a mysterious robot, seemingly unusual from anything she'd seen in the pit. The robot takes on the name Reg, and with both it being curious about its origin and Riko wanting to wonder what happened to her mother after a Call to Adventure, they set off into the giant pit, possibly to never return, but not before the show takes the time to worldbuild first and create a very distinct atmosphere for itself. \\n\\n\r\nWorldbuilding, you see, is one of the show's greatest strengths, and one of the elements about it that stands out best, often in ways that are shown more than said. Upfront, it offers the pure exhilaration of exploring a rich fantasy world. Its compelling premise compacts the heart of adventure into two contrasting forces: fragile, ever-optimistic humans and the yawning, endless abyss.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's direction is wonderful at establishing scope, as when in the early layers of the Abyss, shaping shots to have an upward pan do wonders to illustrate the great vertical descent there is compared to the surface, and even in the orphanage where Riko is staying, nifty details like the elevation of desk chairs and the way White Whistles are practically revered as messiahs regardless of moral implications of their actions help give a sense of identity to the world. This is to say nothing of the different layers, uniquely designed monsters, and locations we see Riko and Reg head towards, characterized beautifully and designed with a special tone, while still conforming to the general rules of the world and the expectations initially set up. It makes the Abyss feel like a fully functional setting, even if there's still FAR more to see overtime to make it compete with say, the dystopia in Shinsekai Yori. \\n\\n\r\nThis is helped a lot by the production values. Kinema Citrus (Black Bullet, Barakamon) did a great job with this one. The landscapes are luscious, the character designs are nicely unique from the standard mold, the character animation is consistently smooth, and they really nail all the different details of the world visually. The soundtrack is even better, in fact it's phenomenal. Done by Kevin Penkin, an Australian composer who worked a lot with Square Enix, the soundtrack has a grand and wonderful feel to it. The beautiful atmospheric scenes are made even better with the excellent music choices, the tense scenes are truly tense, and even the quiet scenes can have very nice and memorable little melodies, it\u2019s a win all around with great insert songs, starting from Episode 1 before the title is even revealed.  I even give the sound design some points that come together with the character animation. Whenever Reg moves around with his metal armor pieces, you hear the little \u201cchink\u201d sounds as the parts move around in diverse ways. It\u2019s a small element but goes to show a greater appreciation of little things, which is very nice if you want to give your show plenty of charm.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story outline goes, it feels like a \"Castle in the Sky meets Cave Story scenario\". The show's atmosphere seemingly prepares it for an adventurous tone through a variety of colorful set pieces, the two protagonists have a youthful energy that never felt dishonest with co-dependence on each other, and the way the fantasy elements are integrated are very much classic myth, rather than falling into the ever popular Isekai MMO worlds known in anime nowadays. It lets things sink in, and like the director's previous effort in Monster, many moments are presented free of dialogue to let the tone play out with a wonderful musical score, accurately representing the source material's panels and accentuating the thrills and plot twists, whether meant to be exhilarating or disturbing. Which brings me to the Cave Story elements, aside from the similar plot point of an amnesiac robot in a massive below ground system, Riko and Reg getting through situations can be VERY difficult, and what lies beyond the initial curiosity of adventure at times reaches very cruel and heart wrenching levels. They also both have a cute bunny involved in lab experiments. The horror elements of the story come through this way, a natural consequences of two kids being prepared for the outside world and how often they appear at death's door, with Episode 9 being one of the best examples on how hard it can be to adapt for everything the Abyss throws at them. \\n\\n\r\nTo the show's credit, these elements rarely come off as edgy, but rather, the tone is set right from the first episode to accommodate both the adventurous and underlying dread elements that it rarely breaks, and the idea of suffering a pain while trying to go back up the pit is well established and used to its potential, however heartbreaking it might be. Except for a slow gap midway through in which three episodes are spent in one location, the plot has a steady momentum as we follow Riko and Reg on their journey. It's amazing how a show description as simple as \"kids go into giant hole to discover themselves\" can have so much backing it up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are simple in construction, but compelling enough to buy into their journey. The show mainly follows two characters, Riko and Reg, along with a handful of others they meet along the way including the super bro Habolg, the VERY tough love figure Ozen, and one other character introduced very late who was very entertaining in sardonic trolling as well as how the show concluded with her prominence.\\n\\n\r\nRiko on paper is a very simple character, an energetic girl who wants to find her mother with a positive outlook ahead of her regardless of danger. Despite this, I admired her character for two reasons, both for her optimistic attitude and her basically having a pinch of \"murder hole street smarts\". Certain elements of being a cave raider, even if a rookie, go a long way to show how resourceful she can be, and when going with Reg on this journey, she has more forewarning of protocols, mapping and certain creatures, enough to make it seem like she has proper experience for her journey, but not SO much that it makes it seem like she can maneuver around everything. Without Reg, she'd be disadvantaged, but not entirely nonfunctional. She was a sweet character I enjoyed seeing be enthused and hoped for her quest to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nReg, the robot, is a bit different. Coming from the pit itself without a memory, he's understanding the generalities of human interaction through being with Riko, and in a few cases, he's the one to take charge, having some nifty tools at his disposal but in certain cases at a heavy cost that could be devastating at the worst of times. Easy comparisons are drawn between Riko\u2019s intelligence and societal upbringing but generally poor constitution, and Reg\u2019s physical strength but lack of awareness or mental fortitude.\\n\r\nAs a newcomer to the societal mores, rules, and general knowledge of the Abyss, Reg also acts as an audience insert, but not in a power fantasy way, more in the sense that he\u2019s drawing lines between who knows what. Although Riko knows far less about the Abyss than her mother or her initial Leader, she knows a lot more than Reg, and this becomes invaluable throughout their journey.\\n\\n\r\nIn this way, their roles are sometimes reversed. Rather than Reg being sent as a gift to Riko for her journey, Riko is a gift to Reg on his journey because she provides him with necessary knowledge and training that he does not have. Together they create an interesting and compelling dynamic, with an additional sidenote that the way Riko was raised, she's conditioned to deal with many horrible things while Reg is not, making the innocuous robot's path to humanity ironically clearer. It's their journey, them having just enough to make it through and cover for each other, but still having to endure their way through many easily life-threatening situations that make Made in Abyss so damn compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the show was always perfect. The low point was Episodes 6-8, and being stuck in one general location on one specific thing ground the journey to a screeching halt, and having a certain character make expressions that were\u2026a bit extreme, even by this show. The character herself was very well executed in context, but it made things a bit more drawn out than needed.\\n\r\nThere are quite a few...............awkward jokes, mostly innocent enough to let slip by but still noticeably weird focusing around the kids in odd, curious ways. Another thing would be the small supporting cast, but to the show\u2019s credit, it knows when it needs to leave things to the main characters while still giving the sides some expression. \\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s the unfortunate general lack of a conclusion common with many adaptation shows given short lengths, but with the content we were given, it more than carried its weight. Plus, unlike other shows that shamelessly cock tease us with a cliffhanger, we get a legitimately beautiful montage scene to close off this portion of adventure. When it shined, it REALLY shined. The final double length episode especially is an amazing showing of this element, combining strong character climax with just enough inspiration to not feel cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is a true gem, a shining pillar in a mostly bleak and disappointing season. Is it perfect? Of course not, but the amazing atmosphere, unique worldbuilding, solid tone accompanying horror and dread, and likable, compelling cast of characters make this a great series for what we have. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone hoping for a fairly ambitious title or for fans of wondrous media.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve always had a fascination for fictional stories about fantasy adventures that adds a bit of survival horror to the mix. The type that stick to my memories the most are those that follows a journey to the unknown. As such, Made in Abyss came as no exception when I discovered this adaptation. It\u2019s a show bringing in mystique that captivated me from start to finish. An anime like Made in Abyss takes on an approach with dynamic emotions to heart and it\u2019s really an anime that people shouldn\u2019t miss out.\r\nReading the synopsis itself can feel a bit intimidated. As a manga reader, I wasintimidated at first when I realized what the series had to offer. The idea of a young girl journeying to the Abyss, a place with the darkest secrets and dangerous creatures really draws potential. What really bought my attention to heart for this show is how emotional the journey turned out to be. Make no mistake. Made in Abyss is more than just surviving in some unknown world.\\n\\n\r\nMy first impression of this show is its colorful character cast. We have Riko, a 12-year old young girl who often seems to bring trouble wherever she goes. Joining her in this adventure story is a young robot boy named Reg. These two brings together a journey with various emotions. To me, it\u2019s this pair that carries the journey as they take on unforeseen challenges. Individually, the two aren\u2019t too alike. In fact, Reg isn\u2019t even human but he does express a lot of human behavior. The first few episodes makes it clear that Reg cares about Riko a lot as a friend. Similarly, Riko is fascinated by Reg because of his nature and she also values him greatly. What really makes this show stand out is their character chemistry. Between the pair, Riko is the brain while Reg is the brawn. This is easily evidenced with Riko\u2019s knowledge with the creatures they encounter. On the other hand, Reg is physically tough and is able to perform difficult feats that Riko cannot. However, Reg is mentally weak and thus need Riko\u2019s support to survive. Together, this pair really sells the emotional drama of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of this duo, we also meet their friends such as Nat, Shiggy, and Jiruo. The show only features them in the first few episodes as the main journey is undertaken by Riko and Reg. Nonetheless, their roles are also noticeable with Jiruo being the leader, Shiggy helping Reg, and Nat\u2019s character chemistry with Riko. As the journey ventures on, we discover characters that are not so human-like and in fact possess otherworldly traits. Characters such as Nanachi and Ozen are featured in this season for their valuable roles. It\u2019s important to realize that without them, Riko and Reg\u2019s lives may have perished very early on. Ozen\u2019s character also extends to relation with Riko\u2019s mother during their past. The series cleverly convey their background stories that can be very appealing and also important. Speaking of Riko\u2019s mother, she is her inspiration. Throughout the show, it\u2019s made clear that Riko has an ambition to become just like or perhaps even surpass her. The background story regarding Mitty and Nanachi can also create various feelings for viewers as they realize the darker side of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this anime stands out as a fantasy/sci-fi adventure, there\u2019s also many mystery elements that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. The mystery of the Abyss itself is one of the biggest factors as it creates a fear of uncertainty. If you\u2019re an anime only viewer, then you\u2019re in for a ride. For Riko and Reg, they face dangers that tests their physical and mental abilities. The \u201cCurse of the Abyss\u201d is also a recurring ideal that is revisited between some episodes. No one is really sure exactly what it is but the show makes it clear that it\u2019s something malevolent. Other mystery elements to take notice of includes the origins of the Abyss, Ozen\u2019s motives, the White Whistles, and among others. The exposition of this anime is also very consistent and doesn\u2019t rely on boring narratives to do the work. Technical terms are also made easy to understand. To be honest, watching this anime always invited me to think and anticipate what may happen next. I have read the manga but it still makes me wonder how this anime will handle the adaptation. After completing the show, I have to admit that it does it brilliantly. Despite being an incomplete adaptation and inserting in some original content, its selling factors hits their mark. \\n\\n\r\nThe Abyss itself is also filled with colorful world fiction. An anime like this really sets the bar for world building as each layer reveals its unknowns. The creatures our adventurers encounter are also unique and arouse various feelings. I can\u2019t remember how many times I felt a chill down my spine whenever Riko or Reg stands in the face of danger. The emotional drama between the pair also feels very realistic. If you\u2019re familiar with any survival horror media (books, tv shows, movies), then you\u2019ll be surprised at how well this anime delivers its emotions.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Citrus may not be a powerhouse name but they definitely deserve the praise for crafting such an interesting world. It has the right fantasy elements with its eldritch creatures, the eye-catchy backgrounds, uncharacteristic architectures, and creative horror. Indeed, a show like this has violence so expect some body horror and graphic scenes. Character expressions has a good deal of psychology that really brings out its survival horror content. For the character designs, it shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to get used to them. I actually find it unique as its main character cast is mostly children. They represent youth and potential as Riko and Reg embarks on their journey. The creatures in the Abyss possesses otherworldly traits that make stand out. These ranges from monster birds, deadly insects, giant porcupine-like beasts, and horrific snakes. In addition, this anime has ancient artifacts that each has their own unique traits. Visually, Made in Abyss is really a special show that is appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is also impressive if we take a closer look at the voice mannerisms. Riko and Reg\u2019s VA both deserves praise for their ability to step into the shoes of these kids. However, the most noticeable character in this anime would be Ouzen. I have to confess that Sayaka Ohara did a phenomenal job with her role. Thanks to her talent, Ouzen\u2019s voice sounds haunting that always brings an eerie feeling whenever she appears. The words she speaks, the way she moves, and her personality is easily made possible with such a talented voice actress. The theme songs of the show holds a distinction of its fantasy themes. OST is eerie that helps this show stand out for its darker elements.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is a solid example of how a fantasy-adventure/survival horror should be made. It has a small yet memorable cast of characters, an exceptional death world with its fictional elements, and emotional drama that is endearing to watch. The show doesn\u2019t tell its story with narratives that may put you to sleep. Instead, it delivers its journey with the sharp instinct and stylish storytelling. This is an anime that isn\u2019t easily recommendable to anyone. The pacing can take some patience to get by and it has a character cast that may not be so likeable. Still, give this anime a try. There\u2019s an old saying that goes \u201csuccess is a journey, not a destination\u201d. For this show, I couldn\u2019t agree more.",

I searched about anime that came out this year, 2017 and I found \"Made In Abyss\". I loved the art and the design in general from the first view. I knew nothing about the story, I just thought it would be an adventure with kids.. but it's more than just that! I was surprised by how amazing the story is, how dark and evil this anime could get. I must admit I got emotional many many times while watchingit. It's not just the unique story, the cute characters who have their own story, the art... it's also the music! It's been ages since I LOVED an anime OST so much! Everything is so well produced... I ended up finishing it in 2 days... It was one of the most enoyable anime I've ever watched. I recommend it! \\n\\n\r\nP.S.; I even finished the manga! Which is amazing, if you ask me. Can't wait for the new season in 2019.",

            "content": "The Abyss is a true wonder, it is the curiosity that draws us in and leads us to our inevitable metamorphosis that comes from growing up.\r\nI always used to explore the forests surrounding my home as I child, I shared the same desire to explore the unknown as the protagonist, Riko, from Made in Abyss does. My friends and I would search for the forest for the fabled Bigfoot. We knew that we couldn\u2019t venture too far lest we lose our way back (keep in mind that this is before we had cell phones) we were equipped with just the bare necessities to explore; flashlights,a swiss army knife if we were feeling daring, and hats gloves if it was cold out. Not only was the forest populated by our imagination, it also was home to coyotes, bloodsucking ticks, and hunters. Looking back at my time in the woods I can safely say I\u2019ve never been happier in my life, but simultaneously I can\u2019t help think of how much danger we were in that we just simply couldn't comprehend due to our lack of worldly knowledge. \\n\r\nWe didn\u2019t find Bigfoot when we explored in the woods, or rather, we didn\u2019t find the Abyss, but it wasn\u2019t ever about finding it, it was about our journey. \\n\r\nAnd what a journey Made in Abyss is.\\n\\n\r\nThe show begins in the mysterious Abyss, following the protagonist Riko, a girl whose ambitions to explore often gets her in trouble. She and her friends search for artifacts in the Abyss to pay for their room and board at the orphanage they live at. The Abyss is a horrible and frightening place, but from the enchanted eyes of a child, it seems like a land of wonder. Like the real world, the longer you spend in the Abyss, the more you will begin to see its ability to harm you. The tone of the story is established immediately, Riko's irreverent personality prevents her from grasping the full danger of the Abyss until it is actually upon her.\\n\r\nThe orphanage Riko lives in is in a town called Orth that was literally built surrounding the Abyss, the town couldn\u2019t be more clear of a metaphor for childhood. \\n\\n\r\nFantastic world building is on display throughout the show; one of the best examples is in the early episodes when the townspeople rush to the edge of the Abyss as raiders emerge from the elevator, it instills the idea that the citizens are all intrigued by the Abyss, but only a brave few have the courage to tackle its hazards. \\n\r\nIn the early scenes of the first episode, Riko is attacked by a horrifying eldritch monster in the Abyss while searching for artifacts, but she\u2019s saved by an amnesiac robot boy and his laser ability, he is later introduced as Reg. She handles the ordeal quite well and is able to hide him from the orphanage leaders. Riko is almost instantly a 3-dimensional character; her eccentric personality immediately stands out from those of her friends, she has wild ambitions to explore the depths of the Abyss in search of her mother. I identified with her desire to explore, but with my newfound knowledge that comes from adulthood, I felt irony as she and Reg peered into the Abyss with wonder. Riko\u2019s passion for the unknown and Reg\u2019s questioning of his origin made their journey an engaging one indeed. Even the rounded character designs gave the impression that the kids were inexperienced to the true terrors of the real world.\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode to the last Made in Abyss resonated with me like a nostalgia trip, even though it's a world that I could never live in, the metaphors at play are what made me connect so well with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story arc follows Riko search of her mother and Reg\u2019s journey to find his origin, it begins in Orth and progresses through the layers Abyss. In the beginning, they have little knowledge of what lies ahead, only inklings based on the records of past explorers. Their delve into the Abyss showcases how the real world is no place for children, but their ambitions get the better of them and now they have to grow up faster than any child should. Tension is driven by the dangers they face in the Abyss, fear of the dangerous beasts that lurk within is everpresent. Made in Abyss showcases excellently how tension can be derived from only two lead characters, tense moments are always tense because you can never be sure of how it will turn out for them. Whether they survive or suffer life-altering consequences they have to push forward, it always feels as though they're just kids stumbling to get a grip on the world they\u2019ve been thrust into far too soon. \\n\r\nWhat prevents Riko and Reg from being able to turn back and return to Orth is \u201cThe Curse of The Abyss\u201d. The Curse causes a human who ventures into the Abyss to sustain side effects if they try to return to the surface, the side effects range from a fever all the way to a violent and painful death depending on how deep you go.\\n\r\nLike growing up, you can never turn the clock back, and the further you delve into the Abyss the harder it becomes to return. Once you\u2019ve experienced the unseeable horrors this world has to offer, you can\u2019t return to innocence, you have no choice but to muster up your courage and persevere onwards. \\n\r\nEmotional moments punctuate the narrative\u2019s high points, and they are always impactful, as they\u2019re mostly evoked by the Curse and its allegory the permanence of growing up. Whenever the characters were forced to make a life-altering decision that accelerated their worldly experiences I couldn\u2019t help but imagine what it would have been like if I caught Bigfoot when I still had the imagination to innocently explore the world. The Curse drives a significant amount of the show's conflict and it's a great concept that is astonishingly well executed.\\n\\n\r\nI have naturally found Bigfoot through experiencing the world over time, but Riko and Reg have yet to reach the bottom of the Abyss, even so, their journey is an unforgettable one. Their hardships were my hardships. Thanks to an acute understanding of the coming-of-age genre, the story makes a science-fantasy story surprisingly human.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Made in Abyss is stunning, environments appear with the level of detail that approaches realism, gaze at it long enough you will uncover horrors disguised in the details. Each layer shook up the formula and added new visual pleasantries that I dare not spoil. Built upon metaphors, I never struggled to find a nonliteral way to view the show during my time watching it. \\n\r\nThe visuals add plenty to the characters as well. As I mentioned before, the round character designs and so much to make them into believable kids. The characters appear much simpler than the environments, which may bother some people, but it never got in the way of my enjoyment. All of the characters have dispositions and mannerisms that went very far in establishing their personalities, some of them never even needed a line of dialogue to be understood, which is especially impressive considering their simple appearances.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are visceral and comprehensive, from the sound of an uncouth character eating food to the shrill shriek of the hamster-like creatures. The musical score is, without a doubt, the best I've heard this year and possibly the best I've heard in an animated series ever. I\u2019ll be listening to it for years to come, reminiscing on the experience that it compliments so well.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is one of the most resonant animes I have ever experienced. I\u2019ll be returning to it in the future to relive my childhood, and to pick up on details that I missed my first few times I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nI loved every minute of it from beginning to end. Keep in mind that the story is not over and hopefully it will be renewed for a second season because by the end of Made in Abyss there is much left unsaid about Riko and Reg's adventure.\\n\\n",

They both have, and do that.\r\nMade in Abyss is an anime that can abide to almost anyone\u2019s taste in anime. I personally believe that Madein Abyss is an anime and manga that will ring throughout time as one of the best classics to come out in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? I\u2019ll tell you.\\n\\n\r\nAs said before, Made in Abyss has a staff of people running it that always checks to make sure that every episode is doing great, always trying their hardest into their works. A wonderful story, great character chemistry, a harmonious soundtrack, effects, and voice actors, and beautiful, fluid animation. All of that came onto the screen because of such a wonderful staff (except story, for the most part. Credit to the author, Akihito Tsukushi!). Everything about the series was able to grab me and pulled me in like a roped hostage on a train or bank scandal. While that may sound rough, what is truly meant is that, just from the first episode, I could tell that Made in Abyss was going to be great. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, it panels off immediately into a beautiful waterfall within the first layer of the Abyss and then into an abundance of flowers, trying to make you feel as if you\u2019re standing right next to the lead in their journey into the abyss. The staff did that to have world build for the viewers, but it was a lot more than that. With the waterfall and pacing through the first episode, the waterfall and what happens after foreshadows what is to come later in the story. EVERYTHING that happens in the first episode is foreshadowing the story within the Abyss. But let me get back to what happens shortly after the waterfall and flower clip. We are introduced to the lighthearted driver of the story and her friend, Riko and Nat. They walk down a path where they see a gondola, foreshadowing that Riko will be going down into the abyss. Then she goes on an excavation to find relics, only to find a dead body in prayer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then.. The craziest part of the episode that foreshadows the darkness of the story.\\n\r\nA child, an inch away from death, from being eaten by the monster with the most peculiar characteristics that will have importance in the show. The monster can be compared to that of a Manta Ray, a slug and a snake.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, because Riko is the main character, she cannot just standby and watch it all happen. So, she tries to attract the monster away from the child by blowing her whistle, and she runs away as hard as she can, and she gets hurt. Just when it seems everything is hopeless, A robotic child, or maybe I should say a knight in shining armor, saves Riko with a blast of light, and is found unconscious shortly after. Riko can\u2019t just leave him, being the main character. So, she brings him. That robot\u2019s name is Reg.\\n\\n\r\nThus, starts the wonderful character chemistry between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWith the first episode, whenever the characters interact with each other, it always brings great joy for how well they work together. It might be that the leads are kids (no, not lolis, they range from ages 10-12, and Kiwi is, like, 4), but because they are kids, it makes me feel as if I, myself, am a kid again. Just watching them do what they do across the screen, pulls my heart even more into the story. It truly feels as though I\u2019m standing next to them during their interactions. Due to the leads being kids, they give off the light-hearted sense of adventure. Living joyously, actively, and having fun. This is just between Nat, Riko, Reg, and Sigy. Don\u2019t even get me started on the interactions with Lyza, Ouzen and Nanachi. Their interactions are some of the biggest reasons why this anime is great, along with the fight scenes. Lyza being the narrator, Ouzen being the badass grandmother, and Nanachi (My favorite!) breaking your average anime tropes. If you want to know how great they are, just watch the anime. After the encounter with Ouzen, the story shows that, not even the main characters have plot armor. The definition of humanity treads onto many uncomfortable grounds for its viewers to display dark desires from within.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great attachment to the anime is the sound. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is beautiful. In an instant, from hearing the insert song from the first episode, I pre-ordered the soundtrack. The soundtrack sounds as if it came straight out of a game, and really has an adventurous beat to it. Thank you, Kevin Penkin. However, if I were to compare the soundtrack to the sound effects, the sound effects are some of the best sounds I have heard out of anime, especially when Reg shoots his arms or laser. What I can describe those sound effect as, is organic. With the voice actors, the kids sound like kids, and the old adults sound like old adults. But, when the intensity rises, comedically and dramatically, or narration within the anime, say, the fight scenes and Maaya Sakamoto (Her narration is wonderful to hear), the voice acting is great. It rounds about the sense of adventure, just like everything else the anime provides. With the voice acting, one can tell that there is passion going on behind the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing to talk about that the anime provides is the animation.\\n\\n\r\nI have not seen many anime with such fluid flowing animation besides those of Ghibli films. Speaking of which, the background animator of Made in Abyss comes from the Ghibli films! Will that motivate you to watch and finish Made in Abyss? ...No? Okay, then I\u2019ll provide more than that to motivate you. Time frame 19:57 to 20:10 in the first episode. That should be enough to talk about the animation, because animation like that is all the anime will provide, making eye candy for the viewer. From the grainy wood, to the cavities on rock walls, and the sun coming over the horizon are wonderful details added by the animators.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/TL;DR | Enjoyment: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is quite original in handling the fantasy setting, and I have to say that I\u2019m glad something like Made in Abyss was able to come by. How the author was able to build a culture around an enormous crater is quite plausible. Made in Abyss provides variety and satisfaction, and it even provides the knowledge of the author, such as medical assistance and ecological terminology. Made in Abyss is an anime I can universally recommend. A great story that compels the viewer to finish from the start, active and lively characters that can be described even more as such through their interactions, the wonderful music from the soundtrack, sound effects, voice actors, and the Ghibli-comparable animation. I utterly, truly, from the bottom of the abyss within my heart, recommend this anime to anyone who seeks a great story. Made in Abyss provides just that.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, a great fan.",

            "content": "Made in Abyss isn't at all what it appears to be. Though it may seem little more than an adventurous children's anime, chibi art and all, it gradually reveals itself as something much darker, as Riko's and Reg's hopeless ascent continues, stumbles along, no happy ending in sight, death\u2014 and worse\u2014 awaiting them for each step they fall.\r\nMany anime give off the facade of maturity: gratuitous gore, sadistic and loony villains, self-serving themes ripped from entry-level philosophers such as Nietzsche - features that make a story palatable to rebellious teenagers, rather than the adults they so desperately wish to be.\r\nBut Made in Abyss doesn't fallinto these trappings. It contains graphic, violent scenes, occasionally even outright disturbing, but never is there a moment where it feels unnecessary. It is a story of adventure, of survival, and of finding life within death. \\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss has one of the most interesting settings in anime. A city built around a giant pit, gaping downwards for tens of thousands of metres, its nature unknown, treasure and terrifying beasts awaiting any who wish to test their luck. What's at the very bottom of the pit? How deep can one truly go before death is an inevitability? In many ways, the pit is reminiscent of Hell: for each layer they reach, they encounter something more ghastly than the last, the stench of death progressively growing stronger. But Riko and Reg press onward, determined to find Riko's mother, no matter if they succumb to the dangers and find themselves a permanent resident of the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there exists ample world-building, the story instead puts the focus on the duo rather than the world at large, preferring instead to carefully reveal the details of the world through their eyes and ears, evolving the viewer from mere spectator to active participant. You don't know much about the pit's third and fourth layers until they reach that part themselves, and the fifth and beyond remain a complete mystery because nobody has ever actually survived to tell the tale. It's an elegant way to keep the viewer interested: I don't want to be told what to expect - I want to see for myself what monsters and contamination and other awfulness await the further they fall, and so I find myself with the next episode playing as soon as the credits hit roll. \\n\\n\r\nIt can be difficult for some (myself included) to empathise with child characters in anime, but Made in Abyss does an excellent job of making the viewer concerned about and emotionally invested in the survival of Riko and Reg. Their friendship with one another is deeply heart-warming, as they have, much like real children, no ulterior motives, and genuinely enjoy their time together. They rely on one another, their abilities complimenting the other's: intellect and cooking in Riko's case, and combat and acrobatics in Reg's. There is no journey without the other\u2014 it is either two or it is zero. And so it is difficult not to have a visceral emotional response when one of the two is desperately, miserably trying to save the other's life.\\n\\n\r\nSome caution should be taken when watching Made in Abyss, as it is by no means a happy adventure. With every episode, there is fear that one of them may die, that they may be betrayed, that they may become permanently disfigured or forced to kill or commit some other horrid act. This is seldom a concern for most anime, as the protagonists will always survive and reach some sort of happy ending to their story. But not Made in Abyss. It makes very clear that bad things are inevitable, which, given the setting, is perhaps only appropriate. Corpses, vomit, grossly deformed wounds, blood bleeding from and seeping into the eyeballs\u2014 Made in Abyss is by no means something that should ever be viewed by children, and even adults would do well to prepare themselves if they are not accustomed to these sorts of horrors. The abyss is not a wonderful land of treasure, but an awful place where awful things happen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still some minor issues with the story, however. Most prominent is the fact that there is as of yet no actual ending, something I did not realise until the final episode when I looked at the source material and found out that, oh, the manga was still ongoing. This ceases to be a problem in the event of future seasons and adaptations, but will there be any? Will this be where the anime ends, in the middle of their journey? \"Hey, this is the end of the anime, so go and read the manga\" is not quite what you want to hear when you are emotionally invested in an anime. But, I suppose, a faithful, if potentially incomplete adaptation is still preferable to the dreadful anime-only endings that plague many unfortunate adaptations. The story is too grand in scale, too personal for it to end after only thirteen episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story could have also done without the more sexual situations\u2014 the references to penises, and one ungraceful moment where Reg returns from trying to save someone's life, only to blush and freak out immediately after when he sees Riko being undressed. With how serious the mood was at that point in the story, it effectively killed all the tension that had been building for the entire episode. That's not to imply this scene existed to create sexual arousal in the audience\u2014 Made in Abyss has more integrity than that\u2014 as she was being undressed solely for health reasons, but certainly it was not a scene that felt in any way necessary. There's a time and place in the story for comedic relief, and that was not the time.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is fairly impressive in terms of its sound and artwork. The background music starts adventurous and gradually becomes more ominous as the story progresses, even if the ending theme remains almost hilariously light-hearted and incongruently so\u2014 its lyrics being more appropriate to Barney & Friends than a graphic life-or-death struggle. While the artstyle may not be to everyone's taste, it at least remains detailed and consistent throughout the series (the map after the ending sequence being a nice addition), although there are perhaps two or three odd moments during the action sequences where the animation will suddenly become sketchy, for reasons that are mystery to me.\\n\\n\r\nIn one of the weakest seasons for anime, where interesting series may well be nonexistent, Made in the Abyss is a genuine surprise. While I might reserve claims such as it being the best anime of the year (Sangatsu no Lion takes that one for me), it is a  truly special anime, one which had me worried and invested in the characters' fate in a way that very few anime ever have. \\n\\n\r\nI want to see a future where Riko and Reg return to a happy life on the surface. But, much like them, I am determined to see their journey to its end, no matter the result.",

            "content": "I want to be honest. I was evading this anime and manga. My first impression was the picture of Riko, Regu, and Nanachi, I thought: An anime about children, with some strange plot, fanservice and maybe a big bunny. I was not expecting anything from this anime. I was preparing to skip and to \"bury\" it in a review, but now I can eat my own words. This anime is a jewel. The adaptation is incredible. It has a good narrative with an impressive artistic design, combined with the most beautiful soundtrack of the year and an acceptable character development.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAn anime with a goodstory. It has everything, mystery, emotion, sadness, love, action, tears and much more. The story could be straightforward and conceptually very simple, several details are added as the story progresses. The show highlights concepts such as friendship, trust, why the abyss became important to the locals and the curse that surrounds it without being too complicated for the viewer to understand. Also, we can observe the constant need to find the truth and the need to resolve the abyss' mysteries. Besides, the story blended very well with the art and soundtrack to produce a beautiful animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe abyss is an incredibly creative world. For me, it has its own set of laws where all the characters converge. The story never contradicts the abyss but uses it to propel the mysteries and characters. The plot is very attractive, and the details are revealed at the right pace to keep you hooked to the end. Also, some details are never shared, we can try to guess about them.\\n\\n\r\nLowering the abyss is a dangerous task. However, it is gratifying to see the consistency between hazards and depth. Perhaps the only negative point I have is that the story is not going to be finished as the manga is still going on. In addition, it was only adapted to chapter 26 of the manga. I'm sure we'll have to wait a while for an ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Riko and Regu. I consider Nanachi and Ouzen as secondary characters but those two added important details to the story. \\n\\n\r\nRiko radiates great enthusiasm. She wants to explore and to understand the abyss. Besides, she is anxious to go deeper because she wants to see her mom. She suffers, cries, worries, but always tries to be active no matter how weak she is. She is brilliant, but her body is not that strong. She trusts Regu unconditionally.\\n\\n\r\nRegu. Is it a machine? Is it a hybrid? This character has a mystery that maybe will not be explained. He is powerful but lacks thoughtful analysis. For that reason, he is the best partner for Riko because she is the rational one and they trust each other.\\n\\n\r\nOuzen (Ozen): She is a human being but could be a monster. She does not care if you're weak or strong. She will show you the reality and if necessary will put you in your place.\\n\\n\r\nNanachi is more a survivor of the abyss curse. She (I'm assuming she's a girl) is very intelligent and has suffered a lot. However, there may be an error in her age. She might look young as Riko, but is she so young? I think she's older than Riko and Regu. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters look good together because their traits are very different. The show portrayed them very well. However, I would consider the characters as the weakest link in the series. Do not get me wrong, they are good, but they were not explored enough to explain some parts of the story. At times I felt that we just touched the surface of these characters. There are some background questions, and I'm sure we will get the answers in the future.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe best of the season. They pay attention to details. For example, in episode one at the end, we can see the talent of this group when they combined the shadows and the lighting at dawn and created a perfect movement. The precise colors and design created an impressive effect that for the spectator's eyes could be one of the best of the year. That quality remained throughout the series. In addition, the choice of colors and a smart move adjusted within the scenes helps you to focus on what matters, not forgetting or letting go of the details if you choose to focus on other parts of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences have an excellent design and do not lose quality. They also combine very well with the sound mixing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nWith one word I want to praise this \"exceptional\" sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST has several scores that help the storytelling. For example, a mixed composition such as \"Underground River\" (Ep1, Disc1), \"Hanazeve Caradhina\" (Ep1), \"Swings and Roundabouts\" combined with an intelligent sequence, an impressive story and a witty artistic direction created the perfect environment to catch any viewer and make them anxious for more. We can find another example in the score \"The first layer.\" This score helps to add to the plot the feeling of the unknown and the expectation for the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe music runs in the best time possible. It creates excitement, drama, conveys feelings to viewers and makes the plot and characters shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs Deep in Abyss (OP) and Tabi no Hidarite, Saihate no Migite (ED) are the perfect complement to this anime. These songs are very catchy and have a great rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the VO. I'm not used to talking about it, but in this case, the voices helped to portray the characters. For example, Ouzen's voice. That voice adds excitement to the scenes and creates a great twisted mystery to the character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this anime. It does not matter if the characters were not explored in detail, no matter the lack of answers about some characters or if the story did not end. The show brings a lot of excitement to any viewer. The story is solid, well structured and consistent almost all the time. The pace is good and the details never hurried. Another good point is that they followed the manga so none could complain. The art and sound led the narration out of the chart. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI was tempted to give a 10 to this anime, but the questions about the characters and the unfinished story lowered the score. Unfortunately for us, we do not know if we will get a continuation of the anime in the future, but it does not matter. I recommend this anime, the art, the adaptation are exceptional with a unique soundtrack. It was the best of the season so skipping it will be a mistake. In the end, I became a fan of this story and I don't regret it. \\n\\n\r\nPS: Yes! Another messy review by Pipe and I didn't proofread again, sorry.\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's been a long time since I saw an anime which manages to immediately get you captivated as much as Made in Abyss did. At first glance it might look like a kids' show of sorts, but you really couldn't be much further from the truth. This is a pretty dark anime past a certain point, but even before that it's still fantastic.\r\nMade in Abyss is a perfect example of an adventure anime done right. When I first started watching it, it reminded me of the feeling you get when you jump into some beautiful-looking open-world RPG for the first time, as the world ofMade in Abyss simply looks stunning. The environments are breathtaking by themselves, but the nature of the giant hole into the underworld known as the Abyss is also so fascinating to think about. Just what could lie down there? How could such a thing possibly even exist? It teases your imagination with its unique flora and fauna, and there are so many mysteries to unravel about both the Abyss itself but also the main characters' personal intrigues which are related to it. It's like a legendary dungeon which is just begging to be explored to see what new fascination lies just around the corner.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the peculiar robot boy Regu and his human friend Riko as they embark on a perilous journey into the depths of the Abyss in search of Riko's long lost mother. During their travels they have to learn first-hand about all the different types of hazards that lie within the Abyss, and what kind of strange creatures inhabit it. The main characters are both children and as a result still quite immature in nature, yet they're still filled with unwavering determination and courage to push onwards. Riko is ultimately quite helpless and incapable of defending herself or traversing difficult terrain, so Regu helps her out with his multi-purpose robotic arms to get the job done instead. But above all, they both feel very believable. Riko is very humane in nature and quite quickly becomes someone you want to cheer for, and even Regu is surprisingly genuine despite being an amnesiac robot of unknown origins. There are also a handful of side characters making appearances of different sorts throughout the show, but while most of their roles are relatively brief, they all feel like they serve a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just a well-written and exciting adventure anime though, but past a certain point the story also becomes very serious. In an almost Madoka-like twist of fate, it's like the author suddenly snapped his fingers and decided to take the series to the next level, which resulted in one of the most gruesome anime episodes I've seen in a long time. It was legitimately hard to watch (you'll know it when you see it). However, this only serves to further add to the feeling of peril and caution when trying to proceed further down into the Abyss, because the viewers are shown first-hand that this place is not to be underestimated. The show may have childlike characters and beautiful environments, but death might just lurk around any nearby corner nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is one of those anime which may be fairly straightforward in nature, but is still just so interesting in so many different ways that it's hard to stop watching. You never know what you're going to find next in this fantasy-like place, and the danger and intensity of the Abyss is showcased so well in order to get the appropriate atmosphere across to the viewers. It's beautiful yet deadly at the same time. It may have merely been a potential dark horse when the season started, but by the end of it there's no question which horse won the race any longer.",

            "content": "\"If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.\" - Some anime bad guy, probably.\r\nWell, I've gazed into this abyss long enough. I might get more enjoyment or value from staring at a literal black pit than watching another episode of this plodding, interminable slog of a manga adaptation.\r\nMade In Abyss is enticing enough at the start. The art style, which reminds me of something like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance or Studio Ghibli's projects, is right up my alley. While I could take or leave the OP, the ED is catchy as hell (especially when those claps hit, my God). Thestory's setting is probably its greatest strength, and I was interested in learning more about the Abyss, its inhabitants, and the mysteries it holds after the first episode. Even the characters were initially decent enough for me to want to see more of them. Hell, the second episode is basically a bunch of adults telling the MC in quick succession \"Your mom's fucking dead, kiddo.\" How could I resist? What could go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer: The pacing. The painfully slow, drawn out, mind-numbing, meandering, excitement-killing pacing. That's what could go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI think the first warning sign was how it took three entire episodes to actually get into the abyss. Now, I'm not saying everything has to be all action, all the time, and there's always value in a good build up, but that felt like wasted time when so much of those episodes were spent on (seemingly) superfluous characters. You want to establish the setting along with Riko and Regu's motivations, sure, but it felt like belaboring the point to the point of tedium.\\n\\n\r\nBut while that at least served a narrative purpose, the following episodes utterly crash and burn. For a show that tries to tell us there's some sort of urgency, the pacing sure as hell doesn't reflect that. Worse, the beginning of every episode is taken up by an unnecessary, minutes long recap (a debilitating case of One Piece Syndrome). Then, to add insult to injury, it starts relying on cheap cliffhangers and cliche shonen bullshit as if desperate to convince you that, yes, things are actually happening and this is worth your time.\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh, we killed 15 minutes faffing about Ozen's house? Well, now she's acting weird. Spooky, right? Bam. Cliffhanger.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Here's a protracted scene of Ozen just beating the shit out of Regu and nearly shooting Riko with an incineration cannon at point blank range. How do our heroes get out of this? Ha, they don't, she was just testing them! That doesn't feel like a cheap cop-out at all, does it?\"\\n\\n\r\nIf Riko and Regu were dimensional enough, maybe they could carry the story, but they feel pretty flimsy as characters. I don't dislike them, but I'm not compelled to keep tuning in to see what happens to them next. A lot of people hype the show by mentioning how dark the manga supposedly gets, but if I'm not invested in the characters, then what does it matter to me if fucked up shit happens to them later down the line?\\n\\n\r\nLook, I don't necessarily mind a show that's slow paced if it feels deliberate and purposeful. The Sopranos is 86 episodes of Tony Soprano going to therapy, dealing with his family, and eating gabagool, and that's perhaps the greatest television program of all time; its length serves the story because it is a complex and meditative character study. Similarly, you don't need action or fights for an episode to leave an impact. NGE Episode 15 is probably my favorite of the whole series, and that one features no angels or mech battles, and is instead \"just\" about Misato going to a wedding.\\n\\n\r\nSo understand that when I say nothing fucking happens in this show, I'm not asking for mindless action and instant gratification. However, I need something of substance - character, plot, a worthwhile mystery - and I'm not getting any of that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've got nothing to say about the source material, because I've heard great things about the manga. I hope that this is just a lackluster adaptation that's failed to translate what makes the manga work into the anime format. However, I'm not going to continue watching a bad adaptation just because the original is supposed to be good. I'll just get around to reading the manga instead.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't the worst thing ever. It's pretty, and it's got a pretty good hook, but it's totally insubstantial and not worth your time. Instead of 13 episodes of Made in Abyss, you could watch any number of more worthwhile shows instead. Believe me when I say you'd have more fun playing cave explorer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd by \"cave explorer\" I mean getting a finger up the butt.",

            "content": "Made in Abyss. So many people said so many good things about it around the web, as well as having tons of positive reviews.\r\nI would assume I'm the minority here. \r\nMade in Abyss is a show which follows two main characters- A girl called \"Riko\" and some kind of a mysterious robot called \"Reg\". They got \"summoned\" to the bottom of the Abyss by Riko's mother (which is probably the best cave raider out there).\r\nNow, We have some great \"world building\"... kind of.\r\nWe see interesting layers of the Abyss, and interesting monsters and such, but one thing annoys me the most:\r\nRiko is a kid, shedoesn't understand anything about the Abyss. Even full fledged adults who have cave raiding experiences of tens of years wouldn't make it to the bottom, so why would Riko get there? A random, normal, 12 years old girl.\\n\\n\r\nSo there she goes down there with the robot called \"Reg\". But let's not mistake- Reg isn't some \"military robot\" which is capable of some fantasic features, machine guns and stuff. He can extend his arms and has some kind of a blaster (and he collapses after using it). \\n\\n\r\nWe see already from the first episode what the horrors of the Abyss are. People sent from down there what they look like. Huge monsters with shields and shells. How the hell are these two kids supposed to beat the monsters? Not sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe show just feels extremely unrealistic, and don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with it being unrealistic, but it makes me think like this anime underestimates your IQ.\\n\\n\r\nI can easily say, \"Hype killed the anime\". You see, it might be enjoyable to watch it, but I don't agree with all the hype and \"Wow, such a good anime\". This anime will definitely not be anywhere close to my AOTS (Anime of the season).\\n\\n\r\nI think in these paragraphs I've summarised my opinions of the Story, which I'll give 5/10 and character, which will get 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give art a 9/10. Not too much to say, but the anime \"looks good\" visual-wise.\\n\\n\r\nSound- While I don't find any of the soundtracks too interesting or unique, the OP is really good. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nLast words, enjoyment and overall, I rate it 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you got to read the review before watching the anime and you are interested, please, do yourself a favor and watch it before reading anything else about it. The hype is too great you might find yourself hating this anime because of it (Like me).",

            "content": "Welcome to the most overhyped show of 2017. Made in Abyss is a perfect example of an above average show that gets hyped up by every body which forces others into believing that the show is something it really isn't. I, for a change, am not blinded by \"hype\", and can see the flaws in Made in Abyss, which are quite numerous.\r\nStory : 2/10\r\nSometimes it speeds up and gets somewhat interesting, sometimes it slows down and gets really boring. The show is basically boring up to episode 6, then somewhat interesting up to episode 9, and then a snoozefest until the end, unless you happento like the characters, which I didn't. Episode 13 is dedicated to the backstory of 2 characters I honestly couldn't care less about.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Made in Abyss tries to be this grand mystery with multiple intriguing plot lines, but fails at doing so. One of these seemingly important plot points only gets a half of the final episode dedicated to it, the other is a superficial motivation for the main character to go down the Abyss. So the plot ends up relying on the adventures of Riko and Reg, which I must say, are the \"interesting\" part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss builds a vast, colourful world that it ends up forgetting to explore. Something that I was wondering while watching this show is \"Do other countries exist? Is there anything beyond the mountain-island on which the characters live?\", a question to which I didn't get a reply. What does the show actually explore then? The Abyss? Sort of, up to a certain point at which the main characters stop at a layer which happens around episodes 8-9. Thing is, the show starts exploring the world it has built around episodes 3-4, so that's only 4-5 episodes of exploration, in an anime in which the story is held up by the adventures of the main characters. You're left with an empty shell of a promise you were given by the set-up episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Mady in Abyss is a spark of originality and good ideas with nothing to back those ideas up.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I'm not a fan of the artstyle, which lowers my mark a tad bit, I must say that the art in Made in Abyss is great. The world is drawn beautifully and down in the Abyss we can witness variety filled scenery in the various levels of the aforementioned shaft. However, since the show stagnates at certain points, some of the this scenery gets old.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't outstanding, but for a show made in 2017, it's surprisingly not poor outside of the BD releases. The small chibi characters are easier to animate after all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is beautiful. The opening has some nice vocals. The ending is catchy. The voice actors all did an amazing job at their characters. This is the one point where Made in Abyss shines.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I giving such a low mark to a show that heavily focuses on the relationship and adventures of 2 characters? Simple. 4/10 is for the 4 good characters of this show: Riko, Reg, Ouzen, and Nanachi. I will admit that these 4 are all quite charismatic and memorable. However, I hate kids, so I couldn't stand Riko and Reg most of the time. Ouzen, being one of the 2 characters I actually liked in Made in Abyss should have been developed more. I'd gladly watch an episode dedicated to her rather than the 13th episode which was dedicated to Nanachi and Mitty.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss never made it past the \"it's ok\" phase for me. It hang during its airtime at a 6, sometimes showing the potential of peaking at a 7, only to nose dive to a 4 with the boring last episode. It's one of the shows I'd switch on in the background while doing something else, only paying about 3/4s of my attention to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you like adventure anime? This show isn't for you. Do you like captivating or relatable characters? This show isn't for you. Do you like empty promises? This show might be for you. Do you like eye candy? Watch Made in Abyss, otherwise, don't.",

            "content": "Open up an endless world of possible settings. A Giant hole in the middle of civilization, in which lies a gigantic hole dangerous to mankind. What could it be? How does it work? What lies within it?\r\nMade in Abyss is one of my personal favourites of Summer 2016 due to its amazing setting, atmosphere, and world building with amazing execution along with an amazing narrative. It shows us the dangerous and more grim side of things while making it completely thought provoking. \r\nWe start off this adventure with Riko, a girl with curiosity and the need to adventure the depths of the Abyss thoroughly. Withno signs of fear, she heads on strong until her partner Nat gets into trouble with a creature. She does save him and with this, she meets a robotic boy named Reg. His origins at the time were mysterious and unknown to Riko. Thus their adventure as boy and girl, in search for a purpose begins.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do they feel the need to enter the Abyss? Why risk it all and go into a deadly place? For the search of Riko\u2019s Mom and her whereabouts. Her curiosity and duty like feeling called her into the Abyss and Riko wanted to find the answer to it all. While they adventure and stray from what was called their home, they delve deep into deaths row. While they do this, their personality matures while they grow significantly as characters. Proceeding with caution and making the right decisions is all that matter. Because one little mistake and it may be then over for our adventurers.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I can appreciate about Made in Abyss is its use of colours and looking at the atmosphere within its full beauty telling us that great Storytelling isn't all they can do. While they're at it, why not insert a beautiful song while we look at some beautiful scenery? Setting the tone like that in the first episode and I knew that this series would be great. \\n\\n\r\nI have read the manga before hand and seeing it brought out to life is much more satisfying. The way the voice acting is brought out, to how the creatures look, to the soundtrack. I might be praising the music too much, but I think it deserve just that much praise. \\n\\n\r\nThe objective here mainly is Riko and Reg in search for Riko\u2019s mother and descending further into the Abyss, with more risks to come. The system of the Abyss is explained and how it works. Riko and Reg knows that this will be a very difficult trip. But they head in otherwise. Despite them being a lower rank (red whistle), they show bravery and proceeds.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say this to those who might not have a clue, but I suggest heading into this anime cautiously. It is by no means a kids show, so don't be fooled by the childlike artstyle. You'll find it more enjoyable and it might give you a more interesting experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime for me is the atmosphere and the feeling once they go deeper and deeper. It seems ok at first, but as it progresses, the atmosphere becomes more dark and fearful along with an uncomfortable feeling. It's weird how Riko, who is only a little girl, dives into this deathly hole with little to no hesitation. Her drive is that insane. Which I find very odd in some ways. It's just not normal for a little girl to conceive all the consequences and dangers that lies ahead and just disregard those things in a sense and be on her merry way. Interesting how she's like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and character design is not something you usually see, which gives Made in Abyss a more unique touch to it. The design will not appeal to everyone I'm sure, but I for one really appreciate how each character looks. With the Chibi looking artstyle to the very beautiful looking layers in the Abyss, the unique story, the execution, working together with the beautiful Soundtrack, Art, and animation, this anime is like ear gasms plus eye gasms. It\u2019s very satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses, so does Reg and Riko. They learn to trust each other better (although Riko looked like she liked Reg from the start with her happy go lucky attitude). They learn that the Abyss is no small thing and that they must learn that no help will come for them in times that they are in danger.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything to complain about, it may be the fact that the narrative aspect of the show seems a bit slow. I found the character development to be ok, but overall this anime is my favourite of Summer 2017. I loved the death vibes as they went deeper. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is mostly based around Reg and Riko and their adventure within the abyss. This is how you world build, this is how you make an adventure series, this is how you add violent scenes, this is how you create suspense, this is how to make someone truly cringe, this is how you execute storytelling correctly.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss does it all, with minor errors or flaws, it proves that little children going on a nice adventure isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows.",

            "content": "They actually tried.\r\nI always come back every season with a ting of hope in my heart. \u201cMaybe this time a studio with some talented people WHO CARE about their work will make a show that will be worth watching.\u201d A lot of seasons have come and gone. I would be lying if I said there hasn\u2019t been any good shows for a long time. Many great animes have released over the last few years, yet I was yearning for something that wasn\u2019t just a show with a great plot twist, or even a show that wrote believable and memorable characters.\r\nI wanted an anime that stolemy heart.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss was a series I never even heard of before Summer 2017. In fact, I didn\u2019t even know of its existence till half-way through the Summer season. When I first saw the picture for the show here on MAL, I was unimpressed. The art came across as childish and goofy. The rating, on the other hand, was extremely high for a show I dismissed as \u201cchildish,\u201d at first glance. Thank you MAL faithful, if it wasn\u2019t for the oddly high score, I would have passed on this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you aren\u2019t sitting there reading this review to hear how I had the wonderful accident of crossing paths with this anime. You want to know why you should watch it. After all, you are probably wondering how this show got to the top 50 highest ranked shows on MAL. I\u2019ll tell you how:\\n\\n\r\nThey tried.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the characters are the heart of this great anime. I can go on about describing how they look one-dimensional and at first you may be confused as to how these little children can even begin to be involved in a fantastical original story, but I won\u2019t. You see, Made in Abyss isn\u2019t a show to be described. It is a show to be experienced. The art, the music, and the characters are done in such a way that if you took a step back and analyzed it all, you would see the love and care the original manga author and the anime creators had for them. They aren\u2019t just here to entertain the audience, they are here to take the audience on a journey with them. \\n\\n\r\nThe journey is full of trials and triumphs, heartache and despair, yet they aren\u2019t shoved down your throat. It all unfolds naturally before the audience\u2019s eyes. The originality drips from this anime like sweet and soothing nectar for my soul. My heart could only take so many \u201cvideo game worlds\u201d and \u201cmoe overload\u201d animes. Finally, a fantasy adventure that doesn\u2019t tell me how to think or what to feel. The only small complaint I can conjure for this master-level display of originality and heart is that the plot doesn\u2019t start to unravel until the tail end of the series (see what I did there fellow Nanachi fans?), yet the world and characters more than make up for this small shortcoming.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I could write an in-depth analysis on why the opening episodes are brilliant, how the music accompanies the atmospheric art and sets the tone for certain scenes, how the characters are naturally fleshed out, how the actual world the characters live in feels like a character itself, or how the story progresses at just the right pace. But I won\u2019t. Listen, I may not know what you look for in an anime, but I can tell you why I love anime, and I why I continue to watch it even when more than half of the shows that come out every season are literal garbage. I want to find that one anime that can steal my heart. Even if it may be for one season. I want it to take me for a ride I won\u2019t forget. Fate/Zero, Eureka Seven, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist \u2013 they are all great animes, don\u2019t get me wrong. However, they didn\u2019t steal my heart.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss stole my heart.\\n",

            "content": "Made in Abyss aired in the Summer season of 2017 and ran for 13 episodes; the last occupying a double time slot. It's about children who delve into a great chasm called \"The Abyss\" in order to find treasures to sell in order for their village to profit. The protagonists embark on a quest to find information about the main girl's mother.\r\nQuality\r\nMade in Abyss is very misleading about a lot of things, but none so much as the quality of the show. The world shows much promise when it is introduced, but instead of answering the questions we have about the Abyss, the village theylive in, the surrounding countries that trade with the village, and the inhabitants of the Abyss, we are left with more questions. The total lack of explained depth of the world is a big mark against the show since, although the premise sounds great, very little substantial detail is provided. Although the world building is mediocre at best, the plot keeps itself above the line and is intriguing enough to justify the slower pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters range from quite good to insultingly poorly written. Riko is a run of the mill child protagonist that keeps wanting to push further than she is capable of. She does get punished, which makes for an interesting turn in the plot, though the gratuitousness is similar to Evil Dead levels which detracts from the immersion. Reg is a walking plot convenience device. He can conveniently do literally everything that he is demanded by the plot to do, ranging from infinitely extending arms, an overpowered blast cannon with a minor downside, a near unbreakable body, and resistance to the curse of the Abyss. Since he also conveniently has plot amnesia, he is a lazily written character and nothing to be impressed by. The only impressive characters didn't have a large part. Ozen, who appeared halfway through, was plenty interesting and Bondrewd, appearing in the last episode, was a good charismatic villain. Nanachi is nothing to write home about, but nothing all that bad. She doesn't do much other than help the cast and have a sad backstory.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation, in contrast to the weak characters and bad world building, is excellent. Made in Abyss was the best looking show in its airing season and one of the best this year. Kinema Citrus hasn't made a good looking show since Barakamon. The soundtrack was very appropriate and well made. There are several tracks that stand out. Kevin Penkin did most of the composition and was the correct choice for the show. His style is contemplative and artsy without sounding obnoxious, and uses the orchestra often enough to appeal to fans of orchestral music.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment Factor\\n\\n\r\nIf a show is lacking in quality, like Made in Abyss is, entertainment factor can be redeeming enough to make a show worth watching. If you enjoy watching cardboard cutouts make their way down a dangerous, large hole that has pretty backgrounds Made in Abyss is for you. If you want something wholesome, Made in Abyss is not for you. A potential turn off is the gratuitous gore, abuse and fetishisation of innocent seeming children. Riko is wearing nothing fairly often in the show, Reg gets his genitalia inspected at multiple points during the show and there are a few scenes where children suffer in extreme ways, resulting in death some of the time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the last episode, which involves children suffering, is the most entertaining part due to the charismatic and lawful evil villain. This episode also happens to have the least amount of Riko and Reg, which is a factor in it being enjoyable. Sadly, even in this episode children are fetishised which detracts immensely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Message\\n\\n\r\nThe short length (13 episodes) makes it hard to determine exactly what the message is. It seems to be that if you surround yourself with strong people that you will be able to work towards your goals effectively. This message is a selfish one, but accurate and not a bad takeaway. Bondrewd's episode has the message that progress at all costs isn't necessarily a good thing, but the rewards can be alluring despite the atrocities that need to be committed in order to obtain them. These are good messages, but they can hide the truth about this show.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important takeaway is that although Made in Abyss looks like an alright show on the surface, there is a dark truth: it fetishises children and the author is a pedophile. This explains why many things happen in the show and presents them in a potentially different light. The target audience clearly isn't children due to the gory and violent nature, which means it's for teens and adults. The teens may be impressed by the edgy turn the plot takes, but there's nothing that an adult would like unless they're a creep that likes watching children suffer, or be fetished. Made in Abyss is a fetish show for creeps which passes itself as an edgy suffering trip for the youths and the people willing to sweep the disturbing truth under the rug. It's not a well written show, and it's not a worthwhile show. The entertainment value isn't nearly high enough to justify watching a degenerate show made by a pedophile.\\n\\n\r\nShould you really watch Made in Abyss?\\n\r\nNo. No you shouldn't.",

I can't\r\nsay I regretted it though since the shock value was good. \r\nStory: Children go somewhere they know might kill them, the expected happens. I haven't seen the whole thing yet but I'm guessing it's hard or tragic obstacle after another. \r\nCharacters: Riko is unchanging and is just energetic and determined. Reg is developed and changes a tiny bit about caring for Riko, but his moral values and mindset are nothing new and this in my opinion makes a bland character. In the end, they just fall into categories and aren't multidimensional, unlikeother anime MCs. So far they're predictable and uninteresting but that may change later.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is unique and plot based. If you like interesting characters and good character development, I don't recommend this and you'll find it very boring. \\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you like sci fi, symbolism, and predictable conflicts, or possibly children, I do recommend it.",

            "content": "[CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS]\r\nThe world of Made in Abyss is a fascinating one. It is filled with strange creatures and relics of a time long forgotten. Most fascinating though, is the Abyss. At the centre of the town of Oosu, there lies a pit which stretches far into the Earth. No one knows how far or has ever made it down to the bottom. In the Abyss, there are a multitude of relics that can be found and sold to foreign countries. The brave people who go into the pit are called Cave Raiders and they form the backbone of the economy in Oosu, the buyingand selling of these precious relics. But it is dangerous work, and many die while in the Abyss. This story is about a girl named Riko and her friend, Reg who traverse the Abyss, hoping to find Riko\u2019s mother and to seek answers about Reg\u2019s past. Made in Abyss produced by studio Kinema Citrus has captivated the curiosity of its viewers through an excellent use of worldbuilding, great characters, and stellar art and sound direction.  \\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is a prime example of how to do worldbuilding right. The first episode starts off with some excellent shots of the Abyss. We see a waterfall and lush green vegetation as we are introduced to our protagonist Riko. To put it bluntly, the world of Made in Abyss looks gorgeous. To top it off, there is expansive worldbuilding that fleshes out the setting of the story. The first four episodes are chock full of worldbuilding but it is never boring. We are not told everything, but get to witness certain events take place and learn more about the world through it. A great example of this is the classroom in the orphanage. Riko\u2019s mother is down in the Abyss and since her father is dead, she is placed in an orphanage. There, the children learn the skills necessary to become cave raiders. In the classroom where the children learn, there is great amounts of verticality. Their desks are attached high up onto a wall; they need to climb just to get to their seats. It\u2019s with moments such as this that it becomes clear that there has been great care put into the world of Made in Abyss. This effort put in really shows and it helps to really immerse the viewer into the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main character that we have met so far in Made in Abyss are Riko and Reg or Regu. Riko is a bright bubbly person and loves just about cave raiding. She wishes to reach heights of fame comparable to that of Lyza, her mother and become a white whistler, the highest rank of all cave raiders. She is very inquisitive and her energetic nature is positively infectious. It was a nice touch to see how immature she is when thinking about the dangers of the Abyss. Reg is a robot who met Riko when he saved her from a beast in the Abyss. He had no idea how he got there but Riko had a hunch that he was from the bottom of the Abyss. He is quite shy and lacks confidence. He has recollection of where he came from and follows Riko into the Abyss to hopefully get answers as to who he is and where he came from. The great thing about these characters is that they react according to their character traits, but are not so far removed from reality that they act like a stereotype or a trope. Currently, they are developing into mature into multifaceted characters, and I hope it stays that way rather than regressing into simple caricatures.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design and the artwork for this show is stunning. As I mentioned before, the background art is amazing. Props need to be given to Osamu Masuyama, who has also worked on beautiful pieces such as Your Name and Spirited Away. The sound design for this show was also amazing. It would be better if you just listened to it instead of me talking about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Made in Abyss is a story about a two friends as they adventure into the depths of the Abyss that is held up mainly by its worldbuilidng, art and sound, but also has characters that are great due to their well-roundness and their ability to entertain the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (Great)\\n\\n",

            "content": "You can't say shows featuring a combination of lolis, furries and traps are all shit anymore because of this amazing adaptation of an exceptional manga. Bummer, innit?\r\nWe get to follow a story of a small girl going on a suicide mission trying to reach her mommy stuck in a deep part of a glorified manhole, which is possible only because she conveniently finds an overpowered chibi cyborg on one of her practice strolls. This guy also happens to represent the average male MAL user as he gets a boner every time he cuddles a loli, including furry lolies with unknown type of genitals. Nice.You can find the full description of the cyborg at the end of the review.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I mentioned a glorified manhole, didn't I. It is called \"the Abyss\", as the title suggests. It is as gorgeous as it is dangerous, the feeling of suspense and the visuals are both marvelous. As there is little known about deeper parts of the pit, the shroud of mystery thickens with every meter of our descent. No worries about backtracking, a convenient decompression syndrome called \"the curse of the glorified manhole\" makes sure our little girl is positively suicidal, because, go figure, jumping too high in this manhole may turn you into a blobfish (true story).\\n\\n\r\nOn a serious note, lets talk about the good stuff:\\n\r\nEnvironments are glorious. The complexity of the layers is something very rarely seen in the medium. Chibi character design creates chilling contrast between the innocence of the children and the darkness of the abyss. It works very well, especially in later episodes.\\n\r\nVisuals are spectacular overall, I very rarely, if ever, see landscapes/background so datailed and vivid. Huge bow before the man in the lead of the design. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack album to this series is one of the best  I have ever heard. Peaceful ambience emphasizes the mystery of the abyss, while the well executed build up in some of the more aggressive tracks accompanies our little friends during their struggles. Every environment has it's theme, also, which gives more substance to the world. Sound utilization in the final episode is a masterwork.\\n\\n\r\nJapanese voice actors do a great job during the intense scenes. Nanachi sounds adorable.\\n\\n\r\nStrongest points of the source material are definitely the coldness of the abyss, world design, dependence between the main characters and the consciousness that \"there is no going back\". Dark twists accompanying the story development are the main reason of success of the series.\\n\r\nThis is the type of show that gives out the impression of cuteness and peacefulness at first, hints at something thrilling about the setting in the beginning, keeps the suspense troughout the entirety of the series and absolutely blows your mind with the climax. Time spent watching this show is a time spent well.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n___________________\\n\r\nCHAMPION SPOTLIGHT\\n\r\nReg, the Treasure of the Deep.\\n\r\nOur new champion, Reg, is a jungler. His passive, \"artificial body\", grants him immunity to auto-attacks and many skillshots. His Q skill, \"graple\", allows him to grab an object in his field of view and transport him and nearby allies to a target location. His W \"restrain\" wraps a pair of ropes around his target, immobilizing it, but rendering him unable to use his Q. His E, \"empowered perception\", grants him vision on nearby enemies. His ultimate is called \"incinerator\". After channeling energy into his palm, he fires a ray of hot plasma in a straight line, destroying everything in the way. Using \"incinerator\" forces Reg to sleep after ten minutes. This skill has a 2 hour cooldown. These game mechanics allow us to skip to the fun part of the story pretty quickly.\\n\r\nIt is important to note that Reg reaches his full potential in a team full of underage female champions.",

            "content": "Lost destiny, power at a price, the tolls of exploration. That is what goes on to drive them, to lead destiny forward to a world behind comprehension. That is.... the Abyss. \r\nIt's certainly an interesting place to be sure. Those who return from it rarely bring back all its secrets, but receive worship regardless as more and more people are conditioned to go in and do work for their society. In that setting, this show is most definitely a journey, one where two young kids, drawn by their pasts beyond their understanding, discover a world where everything is dangerous and cooperation is a necessity.\r\nMade inAbyss is quite the interesting show. Being the critical standout in a generally disappointing anime season, it proved that having ambition and being willing to take risks to not sugarcoat content is very much appreciated, where something with a simple synopsis as \"kids go into hole\" can be so captivating, atmospheric, perilous, heart wrenching, mysterious, and even sweet. \\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with our young protagonist Riko. Being an explorer in training, one day when in the titular Abyss, she is nearly eaten by a giant worm monster that wouldn't be out of place in Monster Hunter. Thankfully she is saved by a mysterious robot, seemingly unusual from anything she'd seen in the pit. The robot takes on the name Reg, and with both it being curious about its origin and Riko wanting to wonder what happened to her mother after a Call to Adventure, they set off into the giant pit, possibly to never return, but not before the show takes the time to worldbuild first and create a very distinct atmosphere for itself. \\n\\n\r\nWorldbuilding, you see, is one of the show's greatest strengths, and one of the elements about it that stands out best, often in ways that are shown more than said. Upfront, it offers the pure exhilaration of exploring a rich fantasy world. Its compelling premise compacts the heart of adventure into two contrasting forces: fragile, ever-optimistic humans and the yawning, endless abyss.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's direction is wonderful at establishing scope, as when in the early layers of the Abyss, shaping shots to have an upward pan do wonders to illustrate the great vertical descent there is compared to the surface, and even in the orphanage where Riko is staying, nifty details like the elevation of desk chairs and the way White Whistles are practically revered as messiahs regardless of moral implications of their actions help give a sense of identity to the world. This is to say nothing of the different layers, uniquely designed monsters, and locations we see Riko and Reg head towards, characterized beautifully and designed with a special tone, while still conforming to the general rules of the world and the expectations initially set up. It makes the Abyss feel like a fully functional setting, even if there's still FAR more to see overtime to make it compete with say, the dystopia in Shinsekai Yori. \\n\\n\r\nThis is helped a lot by the production values. Kinema Citrus (Black Bullet, Barakamon) did a great job with this one. The landscapes are luscious, the character designs are nicely unique from the standard mold, the character animation is consistently smooth, and they really nail all the different details of the world visually. The soundtrack is even better, in fact it's phenomenal. Done by Kevin Penkin, an Australian composer who worked a lot with Square Enix, the soundtrack has a grand and wonderful feel to it. The beautiful atmospheric scenes are made even better with the excellent music choices, the tense scenes are truly tense, and even the quiet scenes can have very nice and memorable little melodies, it\u2019s a win all around with great insert songs, starting from Episode 1 before the title is even revealed.  I even give the sound design some points that come together with the character animation. Whenever Reg moves around with his metal armor pieces, you hear the little \u201cchink\u201d sounds as the parts move around in diverse ways. It\u2019s a small element but goes to show a greater appreciation of little things, which is very nice if you want to give your show plenty of charm.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story outline goes, it feels like a \"Castle in the Sky meets Cave Story scenario\". The show's atmosphere seemingly prepares it for an adventurous tone through a variety of colorful set pieces, the two protagonists have a youthful energy that never felt dishonest with co-dependence on each other, and the way the fantasy elements are integrated are very much classic myth, rather than falling into the ever popular Isekai MMO worlds known in anime nowadays. It lets things sink in, and like the director's previous effort in Monster, many moments are presented free of dialogue to let the tone play out with a wonderful musical score, accurately representing the source material's panels and accentuating the thrills and plot twists, whether meant to be exhilarating or disturbing. Which brings me to the Cave Story elements, aside from the similar plot point of an amnesiac robot in a massive below ground system, Riko and Reg getting through situations can be VERY difficult, and what lies beyond the initial curiosity of adventure at times reaches very cruel and heart wrenching levels. They also both have a cute bunny involved in lab experiments. The horror elements of the story come through this way, a natural consequences of two kids being prepared for the outside world and how often they appear at death's door, with Episode 9 being one of the best examples on how hard it can be to adapt for everything the Abyss throws at them. \\n\\n\r\nTo the show's credit, these elements rarely come off as edgy, but rather, the tone is set right from the first episode to accommodate both the adventurous and underlying dread elements that it rarely breaks, and the idea of suffering a pain while trying to go back up the pit is well established and used to its potential, however heartbreaking it might be. Except for a slow gap midway through in which three episodes are spent in one location, the plot has a steady momentum as we follow Riko and Reg on their journey. It's amazing how a show description as simple as \"kids go into giant hole to discover themselves\" can have so much backing it up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are simple in construction, but compelling enough to buy into their journey. The show mainly follows two characters, Riko and Reg, along with a handful of others they meet along the way including the super bro Habolg, the VERY tough love figure Ozen, and one other character introduced very late who was very entertaining in sardonic trolling as well as how the show concluded with her prominence.\\n\\n\r\nRiko on paper is a very simple character, an energetic girl who wants to find her mother with a positive outlook ahead of her regardless of danger. Despite this, I admired her character for two reasons, both for her optimistic attitude and her basically having a pinch of \"murder hole street smarts\". Certain elements of being a cave raider, even if a rookie, go a long way to show how resourceful she can be, and when going with Reg on this journey, she has more forewarning of protocols, mapping and certain creatures, enough to make it seem like she has proper experience for her journey, but not SO much that it makes it seem like she can maneuver around everything. Without Reg, she'd be disadvantaged, but not entirely nonfunctional. She was a sweet character I enjoyed seeing be enthused and hoped for her quest to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nReg, the robot, is a bit different. Coming from the pit itself without a memory, he's understanding the generalities of human interaction through being with Riko, and in a few cases, he's the one to take charge, having some nifty tools at his disposal but in certain cases at a heavy cost that could be devastating at the worst of times. Easy comparisons are drawn between Riko\u2019s intelligence and societal upbringing but generally poor constitution, and Reg\u2019s physical strength but lack of awareness or mental fortitude.\\n\r\nAs a newcomer to the societal mores, rules, and general knowledge of the Abyss, Reg also acts as an audience insert, but not in a power fantasy way, more in the sense that he\u2019s drawing lines between who knows what. Although Riko knows far less about the Abyss than her mother or her initial Leader, she knows a lot more than Reg, and this becomes invaluable throughout their journey.\\n\\n\r\nIn this way, their roles are sometimes reversed. Rather than Reg being sent as a gift to Riko for her journey, Riko is a gift to Reg on his journey because she provides him with necessary knowledge and training that he does not have. Together they create an interesting and compelling dynamic, with an additional sidenote that the way Riko was raised, she's conditioned to deal with many horrible things while Reg is not, making the innocuous robot's path to humanity ironically clearer. It's their journey, them having just enough to make it through and cover for each other, but still having to endure their way through many easily life-threatening situations that make Made in Abyss so damn compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say the show was always perfect. The low point was Episodes 6-8, and being stuck in one general location on one specific thing ground the journey to a screeching halt, and having a certain character make expressions that were\u2026a bit extreme, even by this show. The character herself was very well executed in context, but it made things a bit more drawn out than needed.\\n\r\nThere are quite a few...............awkward jokes, mostly innocent enough to let slip by but still noticeably weird focusing around the kids in odd, curious ways. Another thing would be the small supporting cast, but to the show\u2019s credit, it knows when it needs to leave things to the main characters while still giving the sides some expression. \\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s the unfortunate general lack of a conclusion common with many adaptation shows given short lengths, but with the content we were given, it more than carried its weight. Plus, unlike other shows that shamelessly cock tease us with a cliffhanger, we get a legitimately beautiful montage scene to close off this portion of adventure. When it shined, it REALLY shined. The final double length episode especially is an amazing showing of this element, combining strong character climax with just enough inspiration to not feel cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is a true gem, a shining pillar in a mostly bleak and disappointing season. Is it perfect? Of course not, but the amazing atmosphere, unique worldbuilding, solid tone accompanying horror and dread, and likable, compelling cast of characters make this a great series for what we have. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone hoping for a fairly ambitious title or for fans of wondrous media.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve always had a fascination for fictional stories about fantasy adventures that adds a bit of survival horror to the mix. The type that stick to my memories the most are those that follows a journey to the unknown. As such, Made in Abyss came as no exception when I discovered this adaptation. It\u2019s a show bringing in mystique that captivated me from start to finish. An anime like Made in Abyss takes on an approach with dynamic emotions to heart and it\u2019s really an anime that people shouldn\u2019t miss out.\r\nReading the synopsis itself can feel a bit intimidated. As a manga reader, I wasintimidated at first when I realized what the series had to offer. The idea of a young girl journeying to the Abyss, a place with the darkest secrets and dangerous creatures really draws potential. What really bought my attention to heart for this show is how emotional the journey turned out to be. Make no mistake. Made in Abyss is more than just surviving in some unknown world.\\n\\n\r\nMy first impression of this show is its colorful character cast. We have Riko, a 12-year old young girl who often seems to bring trouble wherever she goes. Joining her in this adventure story is a young robot boy named Reg. These two brings together a journey with various emotions. To me, it\u2019s this pair that carries the journey as they take on unforeseen challenges. Individually, the two aren\u2019t too alike. In fact, Reg isn\u2019t even human but he does express a lot of human behavior. The first few episodes makes it clear that Reg cares about Riko a lot as a friend. Similarly, Riko is fascinated by Reg because of his nature and she also values him greatly. What really makes this show stand out is their character chemistry. Between the pair, Riko is the brain while Reg is the brawn. This is easily evidenced with Riko\u2019s knowledge with the creatures they encounter. On the other hand, Reg is physically tough and is able to perform difficult feats that Riko cannot. However, Reg is mentally weak and thus need Riko\u2019s support to survive. Together, this pair really sells the emotional drama of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of this duo, we also meet their friends such as Nat, Shiggy, and Jiruo. The show only features them in the first few episodes as the main journey is undertaken by Riko and Reg. Nonetheless, their roles are also noticeable with Jiruo being the leader, Shiggy helping Reg, and Nat\u2019s character chemistry with Riko. As the journey ventures on, we discover characters that are not so human-like and in fact possess otherworldly traits. Characters such as Nanachi and Ozen are featured in this season for their valuable roles. It\u2019s important to realize that without them, Riko and Reg\u2019s lives may have perished very early on. Ozen\u2019s character also extends to relation with Riko\u2019s mother during their past. The series cleverly convey their background stories that can be very appealing and also important. Speaking of Riko\u2019s mother, she is her inspiration. Throughout the show, it\u2019s made clear that Riko has an ambition to become just like or perhaps even surpass her. The background story regarding Mitty and Nanachi can also create various feelings for viewers as they realize the darker side of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this anime stands out as a fantasy/sci-fi adventure, there\u2019s also many mystery elements that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. The mystery of the Abyss itself is one of the biggest factors as it creates a fear of uncertainty. If you\u2019re an anime only viewer, then you\u2019re in for a ride. For Riko and Reg, they face dangers that tests their physical and mental abilities. The \u201cCurse of the Abyss\u201d is also a recurring ideal that is revisited between some episodes. No one is really sure exactly what it is but the show makes it clear that it\u2019s something malevolent. Other mystery elements to take notice of includes the origins of the Abyss, Ozen\u2019s motives, the White Whistles, and among others. The exposition of this anime is also very consistent and doesn\u2019t rely on boring narratives to do the work. Technical terms are also made easy to understand. To be honest, watching this anime always invited me to think and anticipate what may happen next. I have read the manga but it still makes me wonder how this anime will handle the adaptation. After completing the show, I have to admit that it does it brilliantly. Despite being an incomplete adaptation and inserting in some original content, its selling factors hits their mark. \\n\\n\r\nThe Abyss itself is also filled with colorful world fiction. An anime like this really sets the bar for world building as each layer reveals its unknowns. The creatures our adventurers encounter are also unique and arouse various feelings. I can\u2019t remember how many times I felt a chill down my spine whenever Riko or Reg stands in the face of danger. The emotional drama between the pair also feels very realistic. If you\u2019re familiar with any survival horror media (books, tv shows, movies), then you\u2019ll be surprised at how well this anime delivers its emotions.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Citrus may not be a powerhouse name but they definitely deserve the praise for crafting such an interesting world. It has the right fantasy elements with its eldritch creatures, the eye-catchy backgrounds, uncharacteristic architectures, and creative horror. Indeed, a show like this has violence so expect some body horror and graphic scenes. Character expressions has a good deal of psychology that really brings out its survival horror content. For the character designs, it shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to get used to them. I actually find it unique as its main character cast is mostly children. They represent youth and potential as Riko and Reg embarks on their journey. The creatures in the Abyss possesses otherworldly traits that make stand out. These ranges from monster birds, deadly insects, giant porcupine-like beasts, and horrific snakes. In addition, this anime has ancient artifacts that each has their own unique traits. Visually, Made in Abyss is really a special show that is appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is also impressive if we take a closer look at the voice mannerisms. Riko and Reg\u2019s VA both deserves praise for their ability to step into the shoes of these kids. However, the most noticeable character in this anime would be Ouzen. I have to confess that Sayaka Ohara did a phenomenal job with her role. Thanks to her talent, Ouzen\u2019s voice sounds haunting that always brings an eerie feeling whenever she appears. The words she speaks, the way she moves, and her personality is easily made possible with such a talented voice actress. The theme songs of the show holds a distinction of its fantasy themes. OST is eerie that helps this show stand out for its darker elements.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is a solid example of how a fantasy-adventure/survival horror should be made. It has a small yet memorable cast of characters, an exceptional death world with its fictional elements, and emotional drama that is endearing to watch. The show doesn\u2019t tell its story with narratives that may put you to sleep. Instead, it delivers its journey with the sharp instinct and stylish storytelling. This is an anime that isn\u2019t easily recommendable to anyone. The pacing can take some patience to get by and it has a character cast that may not be so likeable. Still, give this anime a try. There\u2019s an old saying that goes \u201csuccess is a journey, not a destination\u201d. For this show, I couldn\u2019t agree more.",

I searched about anime that came out this year, 2017 and I found \"Made In Abyss\". I loved the art and the design in general from the first view. I knew nothing about the story, I just thought it would be an adventure with kids.. but it's more than just that! I was surprised by how amazing the story is, how dark and evil this anime could get. I must admit I got emotional many many times while watchingit. It's not just the unique story, the cute characters who have their own story, the art... it's also the music! It's been ages since I LOVED an anime OST so much! Everything is so well produced... I ended up finishing it in 2 days... It was one of the most enoyable anime I've ever watched. I recommend it! \\n\\n\r\nP.S.; I even finished the manga! Which is amazing, if you ask me. Can't wait for the new season in 2019.",

            "content": "The Abyss is a true wonder, it is the curiosity that draws us in and leads us to our inevitable metamorphosis that comes from growing up.\r\nI always used to explore the forests surrounding my home as I child, I shared the same desire to explore the unknown as the protagonist, Riko, from Made in Abyss does. My friends and I would search for the forest for the fabled Bigfoot. We knew that we couldn\u2019t venture too far lest we lose our way back (keep in mind that this is before we had cell phones) we were equipped with just the bare necessities to explore; flashlights,a swiss army knife if we were feeling daring, and hats gloves if it was cold out. Not only was the forest populated by our imagination, it also was home to coyotes, bloodsucking ticks, and hunters. Looking back at my time in the woods I can safely say I\u2019ve never been happier in my life, but simultaneously I can\u2019t help think of how much danger we were in that we just simply couldn't comprehend due to our lack of worldly knowledge. \\n\r\nWe didn\u2019t find Bigfoot when we explored in the woods, or rather, we didn\u2019t find the Abyss, but it wasn\u2019t ever about finding it, it was about our journey. \\n\r\nAnd what a journey Made in Abyss is.\\n\\n\r\nThe show begins in the mysterious Abyss, following the protagonist Riko, a girl whose ambitions to explore often gets her in trouble. She and her friends search for artifacts in the Abyss to pay for their room and board at the orphanage they live at. The Abyss is a horrible and frightening place, but from the enchanted eyes of a child, it seems like a land of wonder. Like the real world, the longer you spend in the Abyss, the more you will begin to see its ability to harm you. The tone of the story is established immediately, Riko's irreverent personality prevents her from grasping the full danger of the Abyss until it is actually upon her.\\n\r\nThe orphanage Riko lives in is in a town called Orth that was literally built surrounding the Abyss, the town couldn\u2019t be more clear of a metaphor for childhood. \\n\\n\r\nFantastic world building is on display throughout the show; one of the best examples is in the early episodes when the townspeople rush to the edge of the Abyss as raiders emerge from the elevator, it instills the idea that the citizens are all intrigued by the Abyss, but only a brave few have the courage to tackle its hazards. \\n\r\nIn the early scenes of the first episode, Riko is attacked by a horrifying eldritch monster in the Abyss while searching for artifacts, but she\u2019s saved by an amnesiac robot boy and his laser ability, he is later introduced as Reg. She handles the ordeal quite well and is able to hide him from the orphanage leaders. Riko is almost instantly a 3-dimensional character; her eccentric personality immediately stands out from those of her friends, she has wild ambitions to explore the depths of the Abyss in search of her mother. I identified with her desire to explore, but with my newfound knowledge that comes from adulthood, I felt irony as she and Reg peered into the Abyss with wonder. Riko\u2019s passion for the unknown and Reg\u2019s questioning of his origin made their journey an engaging one indeed. Even the rounded character designs gave the impression that the kids were inexperienced to the true terrors of the real world.\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode to the last Made in Abyss resonated with me like a nostalgia trip, even though it's a world that I could never live in, the metaphors at play are what made me connect so well with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story arc follows Riko search of her mother and Reg\u2019s journey to find his origin, it begins in Orth and progresses through the layers Abyss. In the beginning, they have little knowledge of what lies ahead, only inklings based on the records of past explorers. Their delve into the Abyss showcases how the real world is no place for children, but their ambitions get the better of them and now they have to grow up faster than any child should. Tension is driven by the dangers they face in the Abyss, fear of the dangerous beasts that lurk within is everpresent. Made in Abyss showcases excellently how tension can be derived from only two lead characters, tense moments are always tense because you can never be sure of how it will turn out for them. Whether they survive or suffer life-altering consequences they have to push forward, it always feels as though they're just kids stumbling to get a grip on the world they\u2019ve been thrust into far too soon. \\n\r\nWhat prevents Riko and Reg from being able to turn back and return to Orth is \u201cThe Curse of The Abyss\u201d. The Curse causes a human who ventures into the Abyss to sustain side effects if they try to return to the surface, the side effects range from a fever all the way to a violent and painful death depending on how deep you go.\\n\r\nLike growing up, you can never turn the clock back, and the further you delve into the Abyss the harder it becomes to return. Once you\u2019ve experienced the unseeable horrors this world has to offer, you can\u2019t return to innocence, you have no choice but to muster up your courage and persevere onwards. \\n\r\nEmotional moments punctuate the narrative\u2019s high points, and they are always impactful, as they\u2019re mostly evoked by the Curse and its allegory the permanence of growing up. Whenever the characters were forced to make a life-altering decision that accelerated their worldly experiences I couldn\u2019t help but imagine what it would have been like if I caught Bigfoot when I still had the imagination to innocently explore the world. The Curse drives a significant amount of the show's conflict and it's a great concept that is astonishingly well executed.\\n\\n\r\nI have naturally found Bigfoot through experiencing the world over time, but Riko and Reg have yet to reach the bottom of the Abyss, even so, their journey is an unforgettable one. Their hardships were my hardships. Thanks to an acute understanding of the coming-of-age genre, the story makes a science-fantasy story surprisingly human.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Made in Abyss is stunning, environments appear with the level of detail that approaches realism, gaze at it long enough you will uncover horrors disguised in the details. Each layer shook up the formula and added new visual pleasantries that I dare not spoil. Built upon metaphors, I never struggled to find a nonliteral way to view the show during my time watching it. \\n\r\nThe visuals add plenty to the characters as well. As I mentioned before, the round character designs and so much to make them into believable kids. The characters appear much simpler than the environments, which may bother some people, but it never got in the way of my enjoyment. All of the characters have dispositions and mannerisms that went very far in establishing their personalities, some of them never even needed a line of dialogue to be understood, which is especially impressive considering their simple appearances.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are visceral and comprehensive, from the sound of an uncouth character eating food to the shrill shriek of the hamster-like creatures. The musical score is, without a doubt, the best I've heard this year and possibly the best I've heard in an animated series ever. I\u2019ll be listening to it for years to come, reminiscing on the experience that it compliments so well.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is one of the most resonant animes I have ever experienced. I\u2019ll be returning to it in the future to relive my childhood, and to pick up on details that I missed my first few times I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nI loved every minute of it from beginning to end. Keep in mind that the story is not over and hopefully it will be renewed for a second season because by the end of Made in Abyss there is much left unsaid about Riko and Reg's adventure.\\n\\n",

After receiving information about her mother, and wanting to discover who he is, both Riko & Reg decide to embark on a journey to the bottom of the Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of the Abyss is awe-inspiring, bursting with imagination and creativity with stunning environments and mystical creatures. Half the treat of this series is exploring this beautiful environment which resembles that from Ghibli films. However don\u2019t be fooled into think that this series is just going to be a happy-go-lucky walk in the park adventure, far from it actually. The Abyss is a dangerous environment where literally everything wants to (and will) kill you. The Abyss is made up of different layers with increasing amounts of danger the deeper you travel down as the monsters become stronger and stronger. Getting back up ain\u2019t no easy feat either as the whole Abyss is covered by a curse with its effects worsening the deeper you are. Ascending even a couple of metres can cause vomiting, nausea, external bleeding, and in the worst case scenario, the loss of your humanity or death. Our poor protagonists have literally embarked on a suicide mission!\\n\\n\r\nAs a result this anime won't hesitate at being violent and gory when it needs to be. If you don\u2019t like seeing little kids getting hurt then be warned; this anime is NOT for you. The Abyss is a place of despair where happy endings aren\u2019t guaranteed. The green environments and cute character designs give off a false impression that this is a kids show; IT ISN\u2019T! It\u2019s a show designed for more mature audiences with lewd and disgusting moments. And that\u2019s just the start as according to the manga-reader overlords, the non-adapted material later on is even more messed up.\\n\\n\r\nHowever I urge you to stick around because the story is FANTASTIC! It\u2019s completely unpredictable with a lot of plot-twists, suspenseful moments and cliffhangers that will leave you quickly wanting more. It\u2019ll charge your emotions through moments of torment and despair, but also make you smile and laugh during its light hearted moments. A common complaint while the show was airing was that each episode only felt 5 minutes long as we all became so immersed in the story, then plummeted into despair when the episode ended and had to wait a week for the next one. Time flies when you\u2019re having fun doesn\u2019t it? \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another highlight as all the main and supporting characters are well developed. Love or hate them, each character has unique personalities with their own set of traits and flaws. In particular I loved the dynamic relationship between Riko & Reg; they not only become great friends but also work well together; compensating for each-others weaknesses. Reg\u2019s combat abilities prove invaluable but he\u2019s rather naive, and indecisive in the heat of the moment. He therefore relies on the intellect of Riko who despite her optimistic and childish nature, is quite knowledgeable about the Abyss. Both Riko & Reg would both be lost without each other. I really came to like these characters and felt bad for them during their times of hardship. The mysterious Ouzen and the lovable sarcastic fuzzball Nanachi are great too! \\n\\n\r\nDuring production Kinema Citrus spared no expense; Made in Abyss is a visual treat with stunning environments, cute character designs and (mostly) fluid animation. The god-like soundtrack is on another level entirely! It not just complements the anime, it literally sets the mood! It\u2019s primarily soft ambience that makes use of piano, violin and percussion. It adds to the awe-inspiring environments and creates all those suspenseful moments. It has to be one of the best anime soundtracks that I\u2019ve heard in recent memory!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Made in Abyss is a must watch! It has a real sense of adventure with a great unpredictable story and well developed characters. It\u2019s an anime that I\u2019ll never forget and has earned a special place on my favourites list. \\n",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that Made in Abyss is a series that deserves to be bestowed with the title of a Masterpiece of an anime series. This may sound like I'm placing the series on a pedestal, and you could say that personal bias has influenced by decision to rate MIA a full 10/10 for all the components, but please allow me to try my best to break down and pinpoint just exactly why it has earned such a place in my heart. \r\nBeginning with the first episode, which took me by serious surprise when I was left in absolute awe by themystical vibes exuded by the astounding visuals and the beautiful soundtrack. MIA has one of the best first episodes I have ever seen thus far because unlike other shows where they bombard the audience with a complex plot in a desperate attempt to bait them into watching the rest of the show, MIA does that exact opposite. Instead, we tag along with our protagonist, Riko, and her adventures down into the abyss. Some things occur, and right off the bat, episode one was sufficient to leave me tense at the edge of my seat, yet the premise is simple and digestible enough for me to follow along. And at the end, we are treated with a stunning picturesque overview of the abyss, and that alone was enough to leave me desiring to be transported into their world and explore the abyss along with Riko. They had successfully pulled off their intended effect \u2013 to reproduce that sort of charm and mystery of the abyss, something that is so dangerous, slightly sinister, yet people, both the characters in MIA, along with the audience, are drawn to it. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the crux of MIA, the plot. The first few episodes mask the true sinister reality of the show and I was tricked into thinking this would be a cute adventure series with Riko and friends, but boy does that completely change in the next few episodes to come. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, being \u2018dark\u2019 or \u2018deep\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to a good compelling story, as plenty of shows that seek to achieve such an effect often go beyond their capacity and all that remains is simply a cringefest of wasted potential. Yet, MIA absolutely nails in its execution. Even in earlier parts where there was a lighter more upbeat tone, the story never got stale and it was just downright entertaining to witness the happenings and adventures of Riko and those around her. And now that I think about it, it wasn\u2019t really the plot itself that was unique or fantastic, rather, it's the perfect pacing and storytelling the series chose to adopt that really sold the show to me. I would go so far as to say that MIA is somewhat like a deconstruction of adventure genres and how behind the excitement and thrill of going on a journey of never return, lies the harsh brutal reality, something that even 12 years olds are not immune to, and are in fact more prone to its effects due to their fragility. \\n\\n\r\nI could not have asked for a better two main characters, Riko and Reg. One is an enthusiastic fearless adventurer and the other a shy yet fiercely protective friend. This iconic pair are extremely well written characters that spoke out to me on a profound level, weaving my emotional attachment towards them, and thus cue the tears and heartache when misfortune befell them. The complement and supplement each other in so many ways that it is just really darn endearing to see them interact. And due to spoiler reasons, I shall not delve deep into the third main character that only appears in the later episodes, but she, too, is absolutely precious and I honestly cherish the chemistry and relationships that they foster over the span of the series. Even side characters, including the most minor ones, and even ones that don\u2019t even appear apart from through flashbacks and recollections, are memorable and they have that sense of quirkiness and originality that is in its own way a breath of fresh air after so many reused anime troupes that we have seen time and time again. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single Friday for 13 weeks, this show was something that I really looked forward to. It was a spectacular journey and one that I am so happy I decided to start. It is absolutely magical and a feast for my eyes as with such a unique art style accompanied with the most detailed backgrounds. Every piece of music matched the scene so well and it was truly a beautiful symphony of sounds, visuals and storytelling. Thank you for reading my review of this Masterpiece and I hope that you will embark on the same journey as me and finish it with the same feelings as I did. :) \\n",

Another thing about this Anime adaptation is that it follows the Manga PERFECTLY! Its just so damn wonderful. This really is a Must-Watch Anime.

            "content": "How long has it been since I've encountered a work of art like this? After months away from anime I truly thought I had grown up, lost interest in the themes that eastern cartoons offer. Yet ironically, the show that revitalised my love for anime, was a show about various children, and it was just... INCREDIBLE!!! I want this feeling to last forever, staying up all night rewatching my favourite episodes, my heart beating out of time as I fall asleep listening to the beautiful soundtrack. This show truly wells up every emotion I can comprehend; Be it distress, solace, love, you name it! Thisseries, so delicately put together, invokes it all, and I'm gonna tell you why! (You're welcome in advance)\\n\\n\r\nLet's kick it off with some context: Our journey begins in the city of Orth, which surrounds a certain curious hole in the ground named the Abyss. The Abyss is an unexplained phenomenon filled to the brim with precious artifacts and history from previous generations. This provides reason for plenty of adventurers to explore it's depths, be it a sense of adventure, or means to make some cash. However exploring this pit spells more dangers than you might expect. If you manage to fend off the wide array of creatures that roam it's walls, you must deal with \"the curse of the Abyss\": Basically, as you move further into the Abyss, rising back out causes burdens on the body, ranging from minor headaches to more concerning issues such as bleeding from all orifices. Our main character is an enthusiastic little loli, who is for some reason absolutely desperate to explore each centimetre of the Abyss, despite the various risks and consequences. \\n\\n\r\nRight! Now let's talk about what makes this show so great. I'm sure I don't need to touch upon the premise (I can tell you're already brimming on the edge of your seat with curiosity), but I'll expand on the themes, story quality and pacing. Allow me to tell you right away, Masayuki did not fuck around here. The script is wonderfully laid out, almost never wasting time. Every scene seems to have a proper meaningful purpose that felt necessary for the story to progress. One thing that surprised a lot of people (myself included) is how dark and brutal this show can be from the very first episode. I've seen plenty of people admit to their preconceptions concerning cute little prepubescent characters going on a carefree adventure. Hell, I only picked up this show because Nanachi looked adorable and I wanted to see her in action (I know, I'm terrible). However, as I'm implying, this series offers much, much, more. It expertly builds tension and constantly forces you to expect the worst. When things turn out well, the level of relief you experience is something I can't quite put into words.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of that, lets move on to the characters, the heart of the production! I'd like to begin by mentioning how wonderful the character designs are. I'm certainly biased by my opinion, but the simple aesthetic really mixed well with me, I love how interesting and unique the characters are to look at; I love Nanachi's fluffy paws, I love the little satchels strapped to Maruruk's head, I love the way Reg actually questioned Ozen's weird skunk hairstyle, and I love the fact that Riko looks so simple despite her bottomless potential. They were all an absolute pleasure to look at. Moving on from appearances though, it needs to be said that the main cast is very young (generally around twelve years old). Many people find it hard to empathise with childish personalities, however, I for one found it to be delightful. I enjoyed the sense of innocence; The lack of shame when it came to nudity, and the simplistic pure bonds that the characters established with each other. It was refreshing in a way, and the age of the characters was not something that bothered me whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to artwork, animation, and sound direction, this production really strives to impress. I wasn't exaggerating earlier when I said I listen to the OST as I fall asleep, each track is expressive in a meaningful way and fits a scene nice and snug. I particularly enjoyed the carefree piano track and 'Hanezeve Caradhina' which boasts beautiful vocals and a tempo that never failed to get me excited. If you're not planning to watch the series, please, please go listen to that track, it is moving beyond words. Besides music, the Series also has an arsenal of really nice, satisfying, and most of all, realistic sounds that really help you to get immersed in the obscure and marvellous world. This falls hand in hand with beautiful  animation and scenery, which consistently had me mesmerised with awe. You know those moments where you think \"damn, I wish that place was real\", you'll probably get that a lot if you're anything like me.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose my biggest disappointment with this series is that it flew by so fast. While the ending was more than satisfying, it has simply been so long since I last became so heavily invested in a cast of characters and the world that they live in. It's truly a shame that I won't get to see their further adventures any time soon (although I will definitely be picking up the manga). I hope with all my heart that this series manages to pull off the second season that it deserves, but till then, I will be keeping this first season close to my heart, for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nCheers for reading  (\u10e6\u02d8\u2323\u02d8\u10e6) Happy cave raiding!",

There's always something to pick at when it comes to an anime like Made in Abyss.  Whether it's inconsistent artwork, pacing issues, or even repetitive/questionable background music-- there's always a part of an adventure series that can leave a bad impression in comparison to the rest of its qualities.\r\nMade in Abyss has broken that commonality.  There is no element of this anime that deserves anything less than a 10.  It is the closest thing to a perfect series that we've gotten sofar in this industry-- and I say closest only because there's another season on the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is absolutely phenomenal.  This studio took a detailed, immersive world, originally presented with bare minimum detail in manga form, and adapted it into something absolutely magical.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is extraordinary.  The people our protagonists meet display characteristics that continue to surprise you as the story unfolds their past experiences, and their immediate limits through pure adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is breathtaking in every way.  With the exception of some character themes, you will have a progressive, transformative listening experience with every step our protagonists take in their adventure.  The Australian composer behind this incredible soundtrack, Kevin Penkin, has truly brought this world to life with this work.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil the story in any form.  I will only say this: The first episode is an effective introduction to this world, and as a viewer, you will recognize the potential this story has to offer from this alone.  There is great reward in watching this anime with as little information as possible, because every new moment you experience will feel as if you're right alongside the protagonists in their adventure.  I can't say you'll get a feeling like that from many other series.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss truly is one of a kind.  It has set the bar high above all other series in a spectacular way.  There is not a single part of this anime that I did not appreciate as a viewer, and that is extremely rare for me.  What makes me most excited is-- this is only the beginning.  A new season (or movie?) is on the way, and the manga is still ongoing (as of Feb 2018).  I'm incredibly excited to see where this adventure will take us, and how much higher they could potentially set this bar.",

            "content": "This show broke me.\r\nLet's gloss over all the amazing qualities about the world building, characters, story, or just how impossibly engrossing and endearing it is right from the first minute, because everyone and their mom has probably already raved about that. There's no doubt this show's got charm, and lots of it. Only those kinds of show can make me sit down and binge-watch them without wanting to do something else.\r\nInstead, I'll head right to the reason I feel compelled to not only rate this 10/10 (a rating I reserve for only the best), and not only add this to my favorites, and NOT ONLYto go as far as rank it above even Steins;Gate, but to even add this glowing review mentioning something that I should probably be super embarrassed about, since I'm a man and gender stereotypes, blah blah blah.\\n\\n\r\nI have never cried so much at a TV Show. \\n\\n\r\nNot even Bojack Horseman. Yeah, I can hear the weebs sneering at me mentioning an American show. But hear me out. Steins;Gate took a few viewings to really draw any tears out of me. Godfather Part III choked me up real bad. Bojack's season 4 is extremely depressing, and I couldn't help but tear up by the end of it. A game called Doki Doki Literature Club has a mod that made me tear up even harder than that. This show. THIS FUCKING SHOW. It made me bawl. I have literally never done that before at a piece of media.\\n\\n\r\nI saw it coming. Once it was revealed (light spoilers) this episode was going to be about Mitty and the experiment, I knew it was going to be hard to watch. And I tried so hard to brace myself. I really tried. But when the time came, it pierced so harshly and stung so bad that I just lost my mind and started crying. Lip quivering, tear-jerking, can't-breathe crying. In that one moment, I had lost all composure and broke down. I had to pause it mid-scene. It was almost like the curse in the show had manifested itself in real life, as cheesy as that sounds. I sounded like an idiot when I tried to speak, even if it was only an attempt to utter something simple like \"you tear-jerking bastards\" or \"holy shit!\". I still have yet to calm down. It still hurts. And not just emotionally, but physically, too. My face hurts!\\n\\n\r\nIt's been probably almost a decade since I've broken down like that, so I also started to mildly freak out in the middle of it, trying desperately to calm down and such. I know that sounds weird, but it's a foreign experience to me. As much as I've talked about those forms of media getting to me, crying is something I just can't get used to. It messes up my sinus and kinda ruins my day. I don't know how to deal with it. I don't like crying T_T\\n\\n\r\nOh, and my hands are also numb right now. I don't know why. So that's fun.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this show succeeded where the other tear jerkers failed.\\n\\n\r\nThis show broke me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for pulling that off, I have immense respect for this show.",

            "content": "* THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *\r\nAfter reading the synopsis, I instantly knew that Made in Abyss was an anime created for me. I expected (and I believe most of us who didn't read the manga before expected as well) it to be a lightweight, easy to watch adventure anime, in which a couple of adventurous kids are roaming in caves and dungeons in search for treasure and danger. I didn't expect anything serious, anything deep or dramatic from this show. To tell you the truth, I couldn't be more wrong.\r\nIt's not easy to create new in the fantasy/sci-fi genre, still, Tsukushi Akihito, the creatorof the original manga, could achieve that. He created a world which is not just breathtakingly beautiful, but it truly feels fresh, new, and real, thanks to the complex and detailed elaboration of its culture, characters and wildlife. Orth and the Abyss are not just mere settings for the show, but parts of a well-crafted, believable world, such one might expect from a great fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses around Riko's and Reg's journey in the Abyss, a mysterious chasm with unique creatures, special natural laws, relics of a bygone civilization, and unknown depth. This is a place of constant insecurity and suspense, where you can never know what's going to happen, or who or what might be waiting for you at your next turn. It never runs out of wonders, and it never stops to amaze and astound us. Discovering the Abyss is a thrilling adventure itself, and, since its just the first season, I'm pretty sure there are lots of secrets still waiting to be discovered. Even if the show wouldn't offer more than roaming in this enchanting world, it still would worth watching it. However, just like the Abyss has many different layers, the show has many ones as well.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts as a careless adventure of two little kids, who want to discover the Abyss and find answers for questions regarding themselves. Despite the facts that Riko already knows much about the Abyss and that Reg seemingly originates from there, none of them are actually aware of the real nature of it. It gives an innocent, childish charm to the show in the beginning, and also highlights the difference between knowing something and experiencing it.\\n\r\nRiko and Reg act like as it's expected from children: they are naive, curious, excited to learn, and not afraid of any of the lurking danger; at least not until they must face those themselves. As they're descending to the lower layers, the Abyss' more dreadful nature unfolds, and, as the once so beautiful forests fill with terror and monstrosities, the anime's darker, more dramatic aspects begin to bloom and flourish as well. Still, despite all the challenges the Abyss puts in their way and all the difficulties and suffering they must go through, Riko and Reg keep up their positive, childish attitude and steadfastly continue their journey. They never renounce their goal, which is nothing other than the very bottom of the Abyss itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual style of the anime is a pleasure to the eye. The Abyss offers rich and diverse wildlife to those who are brave enough to explore it, since its flora and fauna differs from layer to layer. The forests of the Abyss are alive and breathing, and together with the sound effects and the outstanding soundtrack, it creates a unique atmosphere which grips you right away and won't release until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the world and the story (what is told in a perfect harmony, enough time given for the setup, confrontation and resolution as well), the characters of this show are also well-developed. The \"rounded\" design of the child characters make them look more childish, which helps to take a liking to them almost instantly. Their personalities are also well-written (as I wrote above, they truly act like children in every situation), and I'm not talking only about the main characters here. The supporting characters also have their own individual personalities. Maybe their art is rough and not so detailed, but it's still enough to reflect their persona. For example, Ozen gives the impression of a fearful, strong and respectable cave raider from the very first sight of her, while Bondrewd... Well, Bondrewd is like Darth Vader. His mere appearance is terrifying. You can feel the darkness and power which pervades his whole character in every single moment while he's on the screen, which is not much, but more than enough to make you feel unpleasantly. I don't know if I've ever seen such a strong and powerful villain before, who can make your blood freeze in your veins only with his voice and appearance.\\n\r\nMasterful character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this show is also something which worth mentioning at least. Kevin Penkin's wonderful scores exquisitely return the sensations of being lost and alone, the joy and excitement of adventure and discovery, and the anxiety and fear of the unknown. I can't remember when did I hear a soundtrack the last time (if ever) which fit so naturally to an anime. It's always there, but sometimes you don't even realize it. You just feel its beating deep in your bones and soul.\\n\r\nSome of the scores are dramatic and depressing, others are joyful and uplifting. The composer is brave enough to mix acoustic elements with modern, electronic tones and sound effects to bring the eerie atmosphere of the Abyss to life. Even months after I finished watching the anime, I'm still listening to the soundtrack almost on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is like a pearl among the pebbles. An anime everyone should watch. It offers everything why we love watching anime. It's gripping and mysterious enough to make you curious until the end. It's equally funny and dramatic. It does an exceptional job in story-telling, world-building, and character design. Even though the series consist only 13 episodes, the creators still found time for a long and detailed exposition, which helps us place our heroes in their world, to get to know them better, and to start bonding with them even before their real adventure begins. The show doesn't flood us with informations and facts, but reveals everything slowly and patiently from one episode to another. It constantly leaves us in gloom, wanting to know more, even after the ending, but tust me! Made in Abyss worth watching every single moment of it!\\n\r\nBesides all of the above, though, the deep and dramatic narrative change which the anime goes through is what truly makes it such an amazing, rich, and meaningful creation; at least for me. The intelligent, well-written, and perfectly directed way it slowly transforms from the loose adventure story everyone expects into something no one can even suspect is simply remarkable. Kinema Citrus did an extraordinary job, a job for which we all should say thanks!\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if Made in Abyss will become a classic in later time (it would surely deserve it), if anime can become classics these days, but in my opinion, it's one of the greatest ones of all time.\\n\r\nFar the best of 2017.\\n",

            "content": "This is probably the best anime I have watched in my 20 years since dragon ball days. If you are on the fence about watching Made in Abyss or not, I highly recommend this. In fact I believe this series is going to be even more popular as time goes on. Kinema Citrus has outdone themselves bringing this amazing web manga to anime format.\r\nStory - 10\r\nFrom the first episode I was intrigued on how the Abyss works in the series. Main plot is our character needs to venture to the depth of the Abyss to meet her mother. It is simple and doesn't drag outthe entire purpose of the journey. The entire show brings out that charm of going on an adventure with your trusted friend for an important purpose. I adore all 13 episodes with joy, sadness and excitement!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nFUCK YES! The series has great animation! From little mannerism of a kid who twiddle their fingers when anxious to reacting at a shocking moment, its all feels natural. The animation is very fluid, you can tell the animators care very much down to small details like leaves and water to move like it does in nature. Speaking of leaves and water, the background art is outstanding... You can take any moment in the series as a singular painting and it still puts a smile on my face. This is in my opinion, great art style and animation working together in harmony. If you are interested pick up the manga too! I can't recommend enough to get both the manga and anime-blu-ray(when it release)!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nI usually watch with an open back headphones, so sound stage is pretty important to me. That being said the sound effect, is as close to perfect as you can. The rustling noise of plants when being stepped on and so on is very detailed. I appreciate all the attention it gets when it comes to sound effect. The OST is memorable as well, you can distinguish Made in Abyss sound track easily and it fits very well with the series. Overall not invasive in a scene and accompany it very well. The voices of the main characters are great too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nWith exception of a few characters the motivation and development is fantastic. I honestly put this next to My Hero Academia for how much emotional investment I have for almost all of the characters to do well. The author of the web manga did an amazing work overall on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nYou can not miss this anime if you care about top quality story telling, animation, art style, sound. I highly recommend this to all anime fans from all level. This kind of anime doesn't come very often, that is why it is important we recognize and support them to continue producing amazing anime such as this right here.",

don't even get me started on the relationships and character dynanmics of this show, because i haven't been THIS invested in an anime protagonist duo since fucking SPICE AND WOLF)\\n\\n\r\ngorgeous eye-watering art (there is never, NEVER a reused background, rarely even a fucking reused LOCATION for more than two episodes; we're always moving, always descending deeper, deeper into the abyss to new and just absolutely spectacularly-painted vistas, and our eyes are constantly thanking us for it), and \\n\\n\r\nthe mounting, mounting, mounting mystery of the abyss (with how fast the anime moves, i was shocked that by the end of it, the appeal of the mystery not only remains, but is instead, swollen, the questions swirling in my head more plentiful than at the beginning, my investment in its world multiplied tenfold). \\n\\n\r\nit really is pretty much perfect in regards to what i personally search for in an anime, from the characters (again, the considerable main cast are all given ample time, and i'm sure if this was a 50+ episode show, it would rival legend of the galactic fucking heroes in how masterful it is at fleshing out and spending time to expand upon them) to the score (just....just watch the first episode man, you'll see), made in abyss is an achievement of adventure storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nlike, if you really want me to find any flaws, i'd be goddamn nitpicking. like there are a total of two or three shots i found a little off since the CG was pretty sketchy and noticeable. other than that.......uh.........\\n\\n\r\n......uh...???????\\n\\n\\n\r\nso yeah, this show is as perfect as you can get in terms of establishing the beginning of what is hopefully, HOPEFULLY a long-ass, expansive saga, because there is no way a world with this much potential, and characters with this much potential for growth can be expended in two or even three seasons. \\n\\n\r\nhell, i could watch this show, watching the characters grow up from 12 years old to fucking 22 years old for 5, 6+ seasons man, that's how invested i am. \\n\\n\r\ngo out there and fucking watch and support this shit, because i am thirsty for more. godDAMN\\n\\n\r\n(ps, i didn't even touch upon how UNFLINCHINGLY BRUTAL this show is, not for the shock value or anything gimmicky like that, but because the world they've established is fucking horrific in a \"damn nature, you're a fucking monster!!\" kind of way, and boy does it lead to some of the most EXCRUCIATING scenes i've ever put myself through in the world of nipponese animation. so if you're evading the show because you think it's loli/shotabait or if it's a cutesy fantasy slice of life, then let me tell you, your expectations are fucking wrong, and go watch this, now, go watch, watch this NOW)",

            "content": "Made in Abyss: When I first stumbled across it, I was reluctant to try it out, because it looked far too cutesy and peaceful for my tastes at that time. Eventually, though, the artwork had my curiosity peaked, so I began watching it. What I was greeted with was a first episode that was about as close to \u2018perfect\u2019 as anything I had seen before. I was officially hooked from episode one. And while some following episodes didn\u2019t quite live up to the first episode\u2019s quality, that was to be expected with the bar set so high. Everything in this show was presented fairly naturally,and any exposition felt like it fit quite well into the show without breaking immersion.\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters are Riko and Regu. Riko is a 12 year old \u2018Cave Raider,\u2019 someone who ventures down into the deep chasm that the world is centered around. Regu is a robot (or maybe cyborg?) boy who saves Riko from being attacked in the first episode, and his origin is one of the central intrigues of Made in Abyss. The two primary characters play off of each other very well, often to either comedic or adorable effect. A series of events leads Riko to believe that her mom is deep in the Abyss, so she and Regu start an adventure to the bottom of the Netherworld. The greatest thing about these characters is that, even though they have simple personalities that are easily summed up, they behave flexibly and are believable in the context of the world. For example, Riko, although being na\u00efve and childish, is also rather brave and knowledgeable about the Abyss, likely because of her aspirations of becoming one of the highest ranking cave raiders.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also phenomenal, and one of the show\u2019s biggest draws. Made in Abyss has 3 distinct art styles. There\u2019s the beautiful, painterly background that helps convey the World of Made in Abyss, and does a mesmerizingly wonderful job of it, too. Then there is the chibi character art, used to display the characters as cute (and that\u2019s pretty much it). Finally, there\u2019s also the fact that may of the creatures found in the Abyss are drawn in a completely different style than characters. You\u2019d imagine that this would lead to chaos amongst the clashing art styles, but you\u2019d be sorely mistaken. In fact, it does a wonderful job of making the creatures fit in with the world, while making the characters appear unnatural in comparison, which works really well with this world.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the phenomonal sound design. Made in Abyss features a magnificent soundtrack, courtesy of Kevin Penkin. Also, the general sound effects vary from either very realistic to very cartoonish, which helps to convey the current tone of the events taking place. Additionally, the sound design can also be horrific (in a good way). This applies especially to the horrendous, gut-wrenching scenes, which were disturbing on their own, but made significantly more so by the incredible sound design. This also applies to the phenomenal voice acting, which also helped convey said scenes in the most fittingly disturbing way possible.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, I consider Made in Abyss to be my number 1 anime of all time. However, there are a few serious gripes, as with any other show. My only real gripe, personally, is the sexualisation of a twelve year old girl, which I do not find O.K. However, I do my best to ignore it, as it isn\u2019t ever presented in an overtly sexual manner, thankfully. A major gripe I have seen, however, is that those who read the webcomic say that the pacing is too slow. I would have to say that I disagree with that, however, and I would have honestly preferred if the anime were a few episodes longer so they could have slowed down the pace even more, specifically in the First Layer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Comments\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is my personal favorite Anime, and I would highly recommend it if you think you are prepared for the (surprisingly intense) horror scenes that comes later on in the series.",

            "content": "\u201cIf you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.\u201d\r\nPerhaps Nietzsche had something to say about this show as the longer I watches it, the more I\u2019m consumed by its captivating landscapes and eldritch horror found within its depth. \r\n[Contains Minor Spoilers]\r\nLocated on the island of \u014csu where its single defining feature is an one kilometer wide hole, that is speculated to be over twenty kilometers deep, Made in Abyss follows the pair of Riko and Reg as they progress on their one-way journey to the very bottom. The biggest strength is its immersion that Made in Abyss submerges its viewers withby crafting an entire society that has every facet of it revolve around the mythos of the Abyss. Everything from the hierarchy of the cave raiders, the harsh reality of the orphans left behind, and the general nihilistic attitude towards the Abyss is expertly encapsulated by visual cues like the color of the whistles awarded to each cave raider, the town\u2019s architecture or the rituals that are reverently performed in respect to the giant hole in the ground. \\n\\n\r\nWhereas other fantasy shows, that feature a singular towering dungeon, has its characters ascending and conquering its levels, Made in Abyss goes the opposite direction with its descent into the unknown, the unrelinquishing power of the Abyss to dominate all those who enter into its domain. In addition to the nightmarish creatures found below is the presence of a curse that exponentially worsen when a diver attempts to go back to the surface which depends on how deep they are. In effect, if one wants to reach the bottom of the Abyss, they can never return to the town of Osu. This isn\u2019t a cheap gimmick for it pushes our characters past the point of no return and pays off in spades in some truly heart-wrenching moments later down the road. While the main plot-line of two characters going to lowest layer may seem simple but the way that is meshed together with interesting characters, danger and the prevailing ambience of mystery is what make this show so special.\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from contemporary anime character designs, Made in Abyss characters have a very cute style of rounded faces wouldn\u2019t be out of place on a children morning show. Given the utter ruthlessness of the Abyss, it presents an odd juxtaposition to have these two polar opposite meld together and only adds to the distinct vibe of the show.  Reg, being a robot originating from the Abyss, remains an enigma due to his memory loss but still acts like like a child due to his programming while Riko is relentless on fulfilling her desire to go to the bottom of the Abyss. Individually, they are not the most compelling characters but it is their inseparable bond that is the real draw and it only grows stronger, the deeper they go. For while Reg is powerful with his integrated firepower and grappling hands, the knowledge and drive that Riko brings to the table forms a symbiosis relationship that neither is going to reach the bottom without one another. While Riko does have the maturity of a twelve-year-old girl at the end of the day, she is quite believable when view within the context of a society that trains its children to excavate for ancient artifacts kilometers below the surface in a hostile environment full of carnivorous monsters. I don\u2019t want to spoil the rest of the cast but they range from childhood love to suffering personified to being unsettling and menacing in their pursuit of experimental research.     \\n\\n\r\nAnimated by Kinema Citrus, known their work on Black Bullet, Barakamon and Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, this is probably the studio\u2019s best visual work to date. The real star is the how the Abyss is shown in both its vibrant and foreboding nature that shares many parallels to the many critically acclaimed works by Studio Ghibli. It comes as no surprise that the show\u2019s art director of Osamu Masuyama is actually a former background artist from Studio Ghibli. Under his direction, there is a real sense of verticality and expansiveness that stretches to the void. Furthermore, complementing the gorgeous background art is the soundtrack composed by Australian-born Kevin Penkin where he uses an orchestral ensemble supplemented by electronic effects to give the abyss its sound. However, as good as his standard tracks are, the insert songs seems to be the popular with the audience with its hip-hop influence and haunting vocals.  \\n\\n\r\nIf I had one complaint about Made in Abyss, it would be that the show doesn\u2019t offer significant  challenges to its two main characters until the last third of its run-time. All the elements are there in the background with nature of the curse, the ferocity of the creatures that inhabit the abyss and the adversarial geography of its individual layers but they are fully realized towards the conclusion. The fault doesn\u2019t lie with how the anime was produced but rather the plot progression found within source material of the manga. I have a feeling that the production staff was very well aware of this issue and did everything its could within the constraints of a one-cour show with a slightly above-average run-time of thirteen episodes along with a double-length finale. In the end, they did an admirable job of pacing out the plot without rushing its story or creating an original shoddy conclusion.  \\n\\n\r\nIt is so refreshing to have a fantasy adventure that stands alone on the merits of its world building, atmosphere and journey without dipping into the more unsavory aspects found within other shows of its genre. For a show to leave its audience only wanting to venture deeper into Abyss\u2019s hauntingly beautiful and terrifying mysteries is indeed a very commendable accomplishment.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first mistake that I made when seeing the cover is thinking that it is a kids show that my little sister could watch... I couldn't be any further from the truth. This show is a god damn masterpiece and it outright deserves a 10. I made my first MAL account just so I could praise this show. Now on to the actual review...\r\nStory:\r\nThe storytelling elements that are used such as having the narrator set the tone or mood for the episode really make the episode great. The story as you can tell from the synopsis is one full of adventure.  The plotline isestablished at the very beginning of the series and maintains a clear sense of direction as our adventurers go into the abyss.  There is a sense of progress in the story with friendships and goodbyes as they descend further deeper into the mysterious abyss.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt is so beautiful... from the adorable characters to the vivid backgrounds vibrating with life and energy. It helps set the tone and mood of the episode but this is on a whole different level as it uses the art to contrast different things to further emphasize the importance of that subject. Everything is unique and it really feels as if it is a new world full of quirky fun monsters to dangerous life-threatening beasts. The art is just simply amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nTHE SOUND IS ONE OF THE HIGH POINTS OF THE SHOW. My god with the art and the sound and the voice acting of the characters it truly elevates this show to the top... The music is always used to set the correct tone and mood at the correct times creating this effect where you are on this adventure with Riko. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characterization that the director uses to make them seem humane-like and real is just pure genius. From the characterization of the robot to the characterization of Riko it is just absolutely brilliant. You really feel as if they are actual people with actual motivations you can relate to and the way they use characterization to bring out their personalities. Each character feels unique and doesn't feel like a rip-off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI've never actually made a timer for when an anime would release its finale until today. It is so good that it deserves to be AOTS definitely and a front runner for AOTY. I absolutely loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n10/10 If you skipped to the end just don't read my review. Just go right now and start watching.",

            "content": "I have to say that Made in Abyss is really something special to me. I really did not expect to love this show as much as I did before picking it up, and as with most people, simply disregarded it or underestimated it based on the art style of the character's on the cover. \r\nI see many people complain about the age of the characters, but this is definitely better than having older, more mature characters in place simply due to the nature of the entire show and the abyss itself. Having children who are innocent, naive and oftentimes clueless of their surroundings creates amuch greater feeling of horror. It makes their advancements and accomplishments feel far greater, and their struggles and battles far more harrowing. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the main things that I think instantly drew me into this anime was the world-building. Right from the beginning, MiA gives you these small snippets of information about the world in an indirect way, not just spoon-feeding it to the audience like SO many others do. It helps that this world is absolutely breathtaking and mysterious, instantly drawing you in to learn more. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this show is beyond words, I really cannot give it high enough praise. Kevin Penkin, who is behind some of the best songs in the OST, blows you away with the vocals that he produces. The OST is able to position you in the perfect atmosphere for the current scene, and amplifies moments of tension, sadness and panic. Even listening to the songs again puts me back into that moment of awe that I felt when watching the show for the first time, and very well nearly brings me to tears. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that many people complain about with this show is the way that the children are sometimes portrayed, finding it to be oversexualised or 'gross'. Although controversial, these scenes are never depicted as sexual. They always feel to be normal childish manners, never is there a moment where these 'oversexualised' scenes feel forced or simply for the fan-service. What IS more concerning, though, is the fact that people believe these normal behaviors to be overly-sexual in nature. \\n\\n\r\nThe more violent and gruesome struggles that our characters face also never feel forced or to satisfy and fulfill the gore-lovers. It always feels painfully real and relevant, and never overdone. This is very rare for me to see in a show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as you can probably already tell, this show holds an extremely important place in my heart. I think that Made in Abyss has single-handedly taken the spot for my favorite anime series ever made, and probably any piece of media I've ever seen. I really DO hope that I find something out there to overtake this spot, and make me feel such intense emotions like this show has done... but I highly doubt that. \\n\\n\r\nWatch Made in Abyss.",

Teach her how to brave the wonderful adventures waiting for her afterwards.\" - Lyza\r\nLet me level with you here. There is beauty in art. There is beauty in the telling of a good story. This story is as beautiful of a piece of art in its writing as it is to visually watch unfold in front of you. \r\nWhat\u2019s it about?\r\nMade in Abyss is set in a world where a giant hole in the earthwas discovered by mankind, with no knowledge of just how far down the bottom of it really is, and deep within this hole, are treasures, ancient artifacts, creatures of the deep not yet discovered by man. The thrill of such a find of course draws in the masses the same way gold drew Americans to California during the Gold Rush.\\n\r\n This story focuses about a young girl named Riko, who strives to be like her mother, who is known as one of the most formidable divers to ever live, who has been deeper than anyone else into the abyss. So far in fact, she\u2019s been gone for as many years as Riko has been alive. After receiving a letter from her mother stating she will be waiting for her in the Abyss, Riko sets off determined to find her, along with her is her recently befriended companion, Reg, a small robotic boy, who is believed to have come from the depths of the Abyss. What awaits them as they descend deeper in search of the things they desire most?\\n\\n\r\nStory 10\\n\r\nOk, look. I\u2019ve spent a long time searching for another great anime to truly draw me in using its story concept alone. This show has so much merit in the world concept it makes me wish I lived in such a place. From the vast and unique array of creatures found in the Abyss, to the nature surrounding the 2 kids as they descend. It\u2019s beautiful and terrifying all in one. That feeling of fear for these kids as they go further down. The ever looming thought of how the \u201cCurse of the Abyss\u201d(which is a clever concept taken from Spelunking in real life) will plague them if they ascend. It\u2019s daunting. It\u2019s clever. It draws you in and doesn\u2019t let you go. I loved it so much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNot an animator, nor am I an artist, but I\u2019ll say this; the animation choice used to contrast with the overall darker feel of the show? WORKS. Splendidly.. It\u2019s definitely fun to look at and I didn\u2019t find it off putting whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 9\\n\r\nToo much of a casual I judge in depth so:\\n\r\nVoice Acting: awesome.\\n\r\nOP/ED: honestly? I was in too much of of a hurry to keep going with the next episode to listen apart from the first time. So...goooood?\\n\r\nMusic in Show: Loved it. It blended very well with what was going on in the story. And never distracted me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nEvery one of them are characters you honestly enjoy watching. You want the best for them, you know? And each of them draw you in.\\n\r\nRikos intellectual yet simpleminded straightforwardness\\n\r\nReg\u2019s constant worrying for Riko, and everything in general.\\n\r\nOzens brutal and uncaring (yet also caring?) way of helping Riko and Reg be stronger cave divers.\\n\r\nNanachi...I won\u2019t explain why. But I love her. You\u2019ll love her. You want her to be happy.\\n\r\nAnd THAT\u2019S IT right there. You want happiness for them. These fictional characters. You feel for them. In their joy, and their suffering.\\n\r\nThe fact that this was written well enough for these characters to draw me in like that in only 13 episodes speaks volumes to me. And I believe it will for you as well.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts:\\n\r\nSometimes in life, ones\u2019 destination is not as important as the road taken to reach it.\\n\r\nThe stories synopsis sells itself. The desire for the unknown. The need to keep going at all costs. The looming fear of never being able to return home. The haunting beauty of it all. It\u2019s daunting. It\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s engaging. And most importantly? It is truly interesting and fun.\\n\\n\r\nI give this show one of the highest recommendations I can. Watch it, and Enjoy!",

            "content": "Due to hearing literally nothing about this anime, it almost completely slipped past me, and would have, if not for the handful of people that highly recommended that I watch it. I originally thought that this series would be yet another generic fantasy anime about adventurers exploring a dungeon or something of the sort (you know the ones I mean). While that premise may be similar, with this one, there\u2019s much more to it than meets the eye.\r\nThe abyss goes by a few different names: The great pit, the netherworld, etc. What it is, is a great chasm that burrows deep beneath the earth. It\u2019sa source of mystery and wonder. Filled with dangerous beasts, deadly curses, and relics of eras long gone. In this world, there are groups of people known as \u201ccave raiders\u201d, who make it their life\u2019s duty to reach the bottom of the abyss in pursuit of adventure and riches, all the while braving the abyss\u2019 debilitating curses and fending off the denizens that dwell below the earth\u2019s surface.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nThe story takes place in Orth, a town that was built around the great chasm. In the town, cave raiders are revered as heroes, who bring back relics for the government to benefit the town. There\u2019s also an orphanage, where young children whose parents were lost to the abyss study and train to become cave raiders, themselves. It\u2019s in this orphanage that we first meet Riko, a young girl with a passion for exploration who aspires to be the grandest of cave raiders: A white whistle, just like her mother. One day, while Riko is exploring one of the Abyss\u2019 shallower depths with a classmate, she stumbles upon an extremely rare relic known as an aubade (who she later names Reg), who will become her partner and greatest ally in what is soon to be the greatest adventure of her life.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs I said before, fantasy/adventure anime are a dime a dozen. What truly sets this anime apart from the rest is the mature way in which it handles it\u2019s themes of adventure, exploration, and overcoming seemingly impossible odds. It clearly depicts that the life of cave raiders is anything but glamorous, and that many pay the ultimate price in their quest to explore the unknown. This anime makes it brutally clear that the abyss is a harsh and unforgiving place, where a single mistake can cost someone their life. Due to this, there\u2019s a constant sense of tension as we watch our two main characters traverse the depths of the abyss. Also, neither Reg nor Riko are particularly overpowered. While Reg has powers of his own, he also has weaknesses that come with those powers. When faced with an obstacle, Riko and Reg must use their heads and work as a team to cover for each others\u2019 weaknesses to overcome said obstacle.\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding in this anime is also phenomenal. From the first episode, it introduces us to the world in which the story takes place, and with each subsequent episode, we learn more and more about the inner-workings of the world. From finer details such as funeral rites, religion, and even the concept of death, they all play a part in setting up the world that the story takes place in. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve noticed, I haven\u2019t actually mentioned anything about the story\u2019s conclusion, and that\u2019s because, there isn\u2019t one (yet). The story is still unfinished, so the anime ends partway through the story. I can only hope that there will be a second season, since the story thus far has been a joy to watch. It\u2019s complex, dark, mysterious, emotional, and suspenseful. For me, at least, it has everything that makes for a compelling and thought-provoking story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t much character development present in this anime. But, in this case, that\u2019s not really a con. The main cast of characters are all unique, and complement each other quite well to begin with. Riko\u2019s character is pretty much static, while Reg sees the main development in terms of character. He starts off as a blank slate, but comes into his own as a person (er, robot) close to the end of the series. \\n\r\nSound and Art:\\n\r\nThe music in this anime was pretty good. It never struck me as being amazing, but it complemented the mood during certain scenes exceptionally well. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs look a bit childish, which, while not a bad thing by itself, is kind of misleading, since this anime is certainly not aimed at children. With that being said, I don\u2019t mind the character designs. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, the background art is the most impressive. It\u2019s detailed and has a style that seems almost nostalgic. Scenery and landscapes are detailed and colorful, while not being too vibrant or bright in their intensity. It\u2019s just very pleasing to to the eye, and it doesn\u2019t distract from events that are occurring on screen with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nI really didn\u2019t have any expectations going into this anime, but was blown away by the detail and creativity that went into crafting the story and the world that it takes place in. It was definitely an experience that I won\u2019t soon forget, and I look forward to seeing a continuation of the story. With that being said, I give Made In Abyss a 10/10, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a well-written and refreshing take on the fantasy/adventure genre.\\n",

            "content": "Half Decays when most of us just sitting here and have our own tea to relax not once a single bit can even more surprising when this series got aired.\r\nMade in Abyss is a new coming-age story that focuses different conniving executed plot and derives within to deep inner aspects and lots of tremendous exposition in their broad view, but the beauty of it is that the storytelling is so good that it isn\u2019t necessary. \r\nSimply put, the class shows.  Made in Abyss is an astoundingly stylish production \u2013 and that includes the music by English composer Kevin Penkin.  It looks and soundsabsolutely fantastic, and the strange world it conjures up is both beautiful and sinister. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ghibli connection is interesting and gives the series an even more fairy tale look than Tsukushi Akihito\u2019s manga \u2013 and that\u2019s important, because one of the most important elements in this series is the contrast between the look and the content.  Manga readers will tell you that this is going to be a dark ride, and that gives me pause \u2013 because I\u2019m already emotionally invested in the story and the kawaii children at the center of it.\\n\\n\r\nAs with many Ghibli works, there\u2019s a very European feel to Made in Abyss (and as we know, European fairy tales can get very dark).  The first two children we meet are the brash Riko (Tomita Miyu), and the mild-mannered Nat (Tamura Mutsumi), on their way into a the pit for a day\u2019s digging.  Riko is desperate to be assigned to deeper digs, apparently chasing after her long-lost mother \u2013 Nat is more concerned with keeping her out of trouble and staying alive.  The pit is full of dangerous Togashi-esque beasts, one of whom wounds Nat and is about to eat him before Riko blows her whistle and saves him. \\n\\n\r\nIt turns its attention to her, but she\u2019s saved in the nick of time (probably) by a mysterious robot (Ise Mariya).  When Riko finds him unconscious, she drags him back to the orphanage with Nat\u2019s help. The explosion of imagination, the cute and funny children at the heart of darkness, at the center of a story which feels dangerous and unpredictable.",

I've seen a lot of good ones like Ajin, Hero Academia, One Punch Man, etc... But, very few GREAT ones, lately.  This is the kind of anime that you suggest to people who don't really understand what anime is and how good and amazingit can really be.

            "content": "Well, this is a review of Made In Abyss and I haven\u2019t written review in a long time and this is a show that I am really excited to give a review. Here it goes\u2026\r\nPlot: Riko, daughter of the missing White Whistle Lyza the Annihilator, aspires to become like her mother and explore the furthest reaches of the Abyss. At an adventure, Riko meet a boy name Reg who came from the abyss with no memory of his time in abyss. At some point of time Riko got to know her mother is alive and sent a letter to her where she is waiting forher (Riko) in abyss. So, Riko decided to go down in the abyss along with Reg. The plot looks simple RIGHT! Yes, the plot does look simple but as the series progresses the plot becomes thicker. So about the story, I think there are no special attribute to it but one thing that stands out about the plot is the plot setup which is very uncommon in the animes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I certainly didn\u2019t find any character likable to be honest but one thing definitely stands out is the character development though they only focus on two major characters only (Riko and Reg with Nanachi being third who came to the story at a latter stage). I will say the character section is probably the weakest part of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOST: Probably one of the strongest sections of the series. In one sentence, the OST\u2019s are spot on which made the series a lot more attractive and set up the vibe perfectly. A 10/10 on this section. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: Absolutely superb. This series is very unique art-wise (reminds me of the Ghibli Art) and also the animation studio did a fantastic job with the animation. I would say the first few episodes animation is beyond perfect!\\n\\n\r\nPheww !! Now with the section-wise analysis is done, now it\u2019s time to do the overall thought of the series which is my favorite part. You might have look at the poster and die wondering how this anime could be good. Well, if you watch anime like \u201cGakkou Gurashi\u201d, you know this was not the first time that an anime has deceived the viewers with its poster. Now, you can\u2019t measure anime like Made In Abyss in categorically and critically because it\u2019s not that kind of series. I have mainly like an anime series based on what can it give me, does it drive me more into it? And frankly speaking, Made In Abyss has positively answered my questions. It gave me happiness, sorrow, hope, despair, regret at the same time. The series blended the emotion perfectly. There are two types of anime series, there are some series that can be analyzed with everything and then there are some series like \u201cMade In Abyss\u201d (felt like a ride) which you just have enjoy and admire its beautiful work. One thing the series will be always great for its emotional expressions of the characters and how it doesn\u2019t hold back at anything. The series just wants to do what it wants to do which is very rare in today\u2019s animes. \\n\\n\r\nMade In Abyss has made a long way. From the moment when I saw the first episode, I felt like this series will going to be exceptional and it was an exceptional series. If you think this series is just kids having some kind of adventure then you are utterly wrong. This series proved me beyond wrong. It\u2019s a gem and a masterpiece of 2017. \\n",

            "content": "Let me guess, you are probably deceived by its appearance. At first glance, this actually looks like an adventure show for kids and yet you wonder, how did it managed to skyrocket to the top so fast? But don't worry, we all have been deceived. Let me tell you then, why is so good.\r\nIf you've read the synopsis, you know that it all revolves around the Abyss. As you are introduced with main characters, the show already gives you a few hints about its true dark nature, but its slow pacing hides it perfectly. Until you go deeper in the Abyss, Riko and Reg arebasicly just messing around. You are getting more familiar with their characteristics and watch their friendship improve as they are descending. The further they get the more it is necessary for them to know their roles. Riko is a cook and the knowledgeable one while Reg becomes the defender.\\n\\n\r\nSo far so good, right? Well, it escalates faster than you will expect even after reading many reviews. Because the second half of the anime will reveal what it actually is about. Unexpected events or breathtaking past. That's all to come, but you should probably check yourself unless you want to get spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strong aspects of the show are the main characters. They behave as actual children would like, with a little spice of anime-fantasy characteristics. As Reg is bashful with his young male body, Riko doesn't really care about it. As she goes deeper, thinking about it as a simple task, Reg is forced be ready for anything that might come and it will come. Riko as an inexperienced adventurer is something that is entertaining to watch while they are getting attacked by stronger and stronger monsters.\\n\\n\r\nSpectacular views of Abyss are a must if we are talking about adventure anime, but the round art style of characters' faces is something that keeps the show refreshing. With cheerful but a bit pale colors throughout the series, and vivid, but dark colors with serious scenes, it makes a great contrast. Also well made animation, with hardly noticeable mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, the opening \"Deep in Abyss\" is something really hard to skip, it has a really catchy start, then it continues with cheerful voices of Riko and Reg, but still hides a bit of dark tone in background. But that's not all this anime offers, it has great soundtracks throughout the anime that accompanies scenes really well, especially Hanezeve Caradhina will definitely leave something in you after the episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like slower starts, I'm telling you to survive that, as I didn't really mind and actually enjoyed even the beginning, waiting for it to build up as it did perfectly. As I almost missed this piece, this hidden gem in Summer 2017, it has become not only my favorite of the season, but one of my all time favorites. Even if it's not that popular yet, the only I can do is highly recommend you to watch this one, as this is one of the best anime I've seen so far. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for your time reading this ;)",

            "content": "This review is for anyone doubting wether to watch this anime or not and for anyone who just wants to read the opinion of  someone who enjoyed this show as much as she or he did. \r\nOK... this is a good one so bear with me\r\nMade in Abyss managed to sneak out of my sight up until midseason when it already had 6 episodes out so i almost ended up not watching it. Im sure many people might have skipped this anime since it wasn't the most eye-catching show but oh boy now i can say  with all my heart that this animetakes first place this season and up until now it is this year's best. \\n\\n\r\nDONT JUDGE THIS ANIME BECUASE OF THE ART: Now that scores are up it might be easier to grasp the quality of this anime but at the start of the season many decided not to watch Made in Abyss because of the art being so different. Beleive me, its amazing and it will grow on you as episodes go.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (10): Maybe the main aspect of the story is the setting of this world The big fucking hole in the middle of the island. Many other shows would have had to depend entirely of EXPOSITION  to explain the setting of Made in Abyss but just with the first episode you can already grasp the concept of everything and end up wanting to know more. Across the 13 episodes you will experience comic, dramatic, grousome, beautiful and painfull moments all together. What many people would call the \"good episodes\" may be the ones near its end because from my POV  the show does takes its time to settle the mood and i really aprecciate that they didn't rush anything because the final product was just perfect. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (10): Of course Riko and Reg are the centre of it all since they have most of the screen time and character development across the show, however, even the side characters who just had a couple episodes manage to leave a mark on the story and not just dissapear as another disposable bunch. The way Riko and Reg work together makes the show pleasant to watch (gotta give it to the seiyus too) and also other ones like Ozen and Nanachi end up molding the story around our main couple of cavedivers in a way that you can really connect with the whole cast and feel how they are still present along the story.\\n\\n\r\nART AND MUSIC (10): Made in Abyss looks and sounds outstandinglly well with well placed tracks and eviroment desing that will remind you of the best ghibli movies. The show feels really immersive and you wont find a single moment of \"lazy animators\" across the show. (I might buy the OST)\\n\\n\r\nDO NOT RUSH THIS, Made in Abyss is a show to enjoy calmly so i wouldn\u00b4t reccomend watching it for the sake of it; if you feel like watching it then go on and enjoy but if you just want to get over with it stop right there and come back when you are worthy beacuse you will waste an amazing show my friend.\\n\\n\r\nIm sure this anime will take everyone by surprise becuase its one hell of a journey that im sure you will never forget.\\n\r\nHope i was able to help you!  Enjoy the show people \\n\\n",

The Abyss is not only an unexplored world where inhuman monsters inhabit, but it is also a place where one can lose one's own humanity, becoming, as it were, part of the abyss or literally a monster.\r\nI believe [on my part] that there is nothing more to say other than that this show was literally a work of art. Despite what they talk about Masayuki Kojima, so far, I have not seen anything in his series direction that made me hate him, orsay that he lost his talent. Quite the opposite: from Black Bullet to this series I fully believe he's only got it right. Although some play the blame for a certain work he has adapted under his series direction, I believe that in the directional part he is exemplary, even for works that people say [Black Bullet] are not good.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, they adapted to the chapter that I had hoped for, thus giving an excellent closure to the work.",

            "content": "[No spoilers]   \r\n    Made in Abyss did not change the way I approach life like Clannad: AS did.\r\n    It did not resonate with me on a personal level like Koe no Katachi.\r\n    It did not redefine the limits of anime like Cowboy Bebop.\r\nWhat Made in Abyss did, though, was tell an amazing story. I laughed, teared up a couple of times, and enjoyed the absolute **** out of every moment in the five hours I spent binging it.\r\nBefore my review, I must say this any parents out there:\r\n    Made in Abyssis NOT a kid's show. Despite its innocent characters and beginning to the story, this is 100% designed for an older community. This anime has gore and deals with some deep subjects.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is directed and backed by a staff that is 100% invested in making it a killer anime.  The staff review and perfect each and every episode while making sure to stay true to the manga. Made in Abyss has been given an extraordinary amount of TLC by its makers, and it shows. Every part of this anime is polished to a point. The story is captivating and never ceases to amaze.  The music is beautiful and moving.  The animation, although not top-notch, provides a consistently smooth viewing experience.  The characters are genuine, and they are not cliche nor Mary Jane's. The world that Made in Abyss is set in has world-building more intricate than One Piece yet has very few plot holes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: do I even need to say it? 10/10\\n\r\nThe only thing I ask you to do is to watch the first episode of the anime. In my opinion, this is the most beautiful, best written introduction to an anime ever.  It makes you ask so many questions, and draws you into the anime through pure curiosity and wonder.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 10/10\\n\r\nThe storyline is killer. Although it's not Code Geass season two (prob one of my favorite anime) where the story is a rollercoaster, twisting and turning every single episode, the storyline is deep, coherent, and contains little plot-holes (I can't even think of any off of the top of my head right now).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nAlthough the character design looks a bit funny at first, it isn't ugly.  One area where I really feel that the art shines is through its lighting and shadowing.  By the way, a background artist used to work for Studio Ghibli, so you can already tell why the anime looks so beautiful.  I guess I can say this here, but a BIG BONUS (at least for me, even though I'm a guy), was that there was NO FANSERVICE (even though the main characters are like 12 lel).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe characters are original and memorable. With Riko as the shameless, motivated, Abyss-nerd and Reg, a humanoid robot who has lost his memory, the duo share an organic relationship that grows as the season goes by. Character relations are not forced, and all characters are introduced for a reason.\\n\\n\r\nWorld/setting: 12/10\\n\r\nIt's unique and original. It's beautiful. It's understandable. It's like Dark Souls and Spelunkers had a baby, and then a Japanese man came along, kidnapped it, and turned it into an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe world-building behind Made in Abyss is on par with Attack on Titan and HxH in every aspect possible. Every part about its setting makes you to want to learn more about how Riko's world works.  I gobbled up every intricacy and specific detail from the anime, and I will never get enough of it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely no complaints here. The music is beautiful, and perhaps leads viewers into what is (in my opinion) the most beautiful first episode ever. (I cannot stop watching the sunrise scene of the first episode)\\n\\n\r\nPS. This is my personal review. Everyone who viewed this anime got something different out of it and enjoyed or disliked it for different reasons.  Therefore, opinions are bound to disagree, so I suggest you go see for yourself... Take a dive into the Abyss.",

            "content": "I RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS SHOW BEFORE READING PAST THE FIRST PARAGRAPH. THIS SHOW IS BEST EXPERIENCED BLIND. If you're continuing after the first paragraph, then hopefully you find my review competent enough. Thank you for your time.\r\n   This show has really gotten me back into the anime scene, almost singlehandedly. Ya see, I had been watching shows for the past year that are like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni and Boku no Hero Academia, the former being morbidly awful and the latter being a show of a genre that's been beaten to oblivion by how much its been done.Don't get me wrong, either. Boku no Hero is a perfectly splendid show, and is definitely one of the best I've seen this year. However, in Made in Abyss I saw something truly special. Something I had never seen done before, or at least done in such a proficient, effective, and graceful manner. The last time I felt this way about a show was Koe no Katachi, which isn't even a show, as it is a film. Made in Abyss made me feel emotions in ways I never thought an anime could pull off. I felt as if I was in this adventure Riko and Reg were in as well, and I felt like I could feel what they were feeling firsthand... redundant I know, but hear me out. Truly the best thing this anime has is its overwhelming atmosphere, which is masterfully created. This atmosphere is the key to success on every front. The progression of events(story), the character development and emotions, the art, animation, ost, everything in this show that is good has a symbiotic relationship with this atmosphere. And I'll explain why I think this way.\\n\\n\r\n   The progression of events of this show follows the two main characters; Riko and Reg. You follow them and hear their story as they climb down this huge chasm, called the Abyss, in the middle of the city of Orth, their starting place. You see these two characters grow and mature from the plenitude of obstacles they come across during the duration of this show. The obstacles themselves are organically woven into the story, and none of them felt superficial at all, at any point. The reason I think this is, is because of the fact that none of the obstacles in this show exemplify one thing. They all represent multiple benefits and tools this show uses quite effectively to progress the plot forward, and build up the show's atmosphere. At first glance the Abyss seems desolate and dark, especially after the characters reach a certain threshold. However, the obstacles Riko and Reg face all make the Abyss a fascinating and lively place, brimming with wonders, dangers, and mysteries. This is part of what I mean when all aspects of this show work in tandem with the atmosphere to be elevated to the next level, above great. The progression of events in this show is smooth, organic, and realistic(at least how realistic a fantasy show can be). But when coupled with the atmosphere, we get tense and thrilling scenes, moments of cathartic joy, and pure horror as we look at our screens, unable to help when one of these precious characters fall ill or get injured. One final thing to note; this anime also uses it's false sense of security, in the form of it's artstyle, to catch viewers off guard and surprise them with surprisingly grim sequences that make your spine tingle with fear or anxiety. This, along with the atmosphere, creates this moment of shock as we viewers see this show for what it actually is; a truly perilous trek down a dangerous hole with no sense of closure in sight anywhere to be found. And I absolutely loved it.\\n\\n\r\n   The main characters of this show are Riko and Reg. Seeing these characters grow and mature in the duration of this show was a splendid experience. The way the show handled character development was great. These characters are really well written in general as well. They seemed like they could be real people in this world, at least in my opinion. They both have their character quirks, but they also have this childlike innocence and naivete that makes them seem like real children in this horrifying story of exploration. The feel real, tangible. The side characters are also very complex in a way, and the encounters with allies or obstacles feels organic and smooth. Most of them didn't feel lifeless and uninteresting. Most of them had neat and engaging backstories and motives. I think a big reason for that is the amount of creative room the mangaka and studio has to make these characters seem as interesting as possible. I really liked the variety of motivations seen in this snippet of this world exposed by this show. The atmosphere of this show also helps with character development and making interesting quirks for each of these characters. The oppressing nature of the Abyss has formed some of these character personalities. And the way these characters function in this Abyssal world creates a sort of tension within the show as well, which further adds to the atmosphere.  As I have stated before, the main characters feel near and dear to me, and I felt for them whenever they fell under some kind of hardship. I think this cannot be overlooked, at least in my review, as this is a very commendable feat in my eyes. I loved these characters so damn much. \\n\\n\r\n   This show has great art. Correction; this show has absolutely amazing, stunning art that left me speechless on every turn as I watched this show. It's absolutely breathtaking setpieces made me want to come back to this anime most of all. They elevated the atmosphere even more, as these stunning locales also marked all the places the main characters can visit, really improving the expansiveness of this Abyss they're in. The character designs as well look really unique and one of a kind, not afraid to ditch a previous artstyle to make a new, entirely different looking character design. This also makes the uniqueness of this world more apparent as well. The animation really isn't something to truly write home about however. It's above average, and is very smooth in many places. The animation also has very cool and dynamic movement from time to time. But even if the animation had personality and a few moments of proficiency, it still didn't manage to pull off this dynamic animation all too well in many cases, and the general animation also had many missteps and choppy moments all throughout. I still found the animation as good however, and It's not a fault of the show, only a minor misstep in this show that had many other great aspects.\\n\\n\r\n   The sound design was also a factor that made this show one I always wanted to come back to. Specifically the ost. This ost is one of the best I have ever heard, and when one of these ost songs ever came up, I always felt something, whether that be joy, tension, or horror as I saw the events unfold with the music over the scene, like a soft blanket that made the scene much more effective at what it was trying to achieve. The OP was decent, but nothing spectacular, and the ED sounded pretty nice. The animation and visual for the OP was stunning, and encapsulated how an OP should operate as- a one off short giving a visual intro to the characters this show will focus on. The ED is a cute little animatic of Riko and Reg, and soon after a furry creature, on a cute, simplified version of their dangerous trek down. The voice acting in this anime is spectacular from what I felt. Riko especially, her voice actor was great at conveying Riko's emotions at the current moment. Reg's voice actor was also proficient at making the robot seem truly alive. The other side characters also had good, cool voices that fit them well in my opinion. Both of these factors fit in with making the atmosphere more rich, as the ost makes the world around Riko and Reg seem wondrous and dangerous, and the voice acting makes the viewer feel unsettled and anxious, or filled to the brim with a feeling of joy.\\n\\n\r\n   Those are the bulk of my thoughts for this masterpiece. I do have some nitpicks, like how this anime has several minor timeskips that really don't alter the flow of the show much, which I find is a good thing. Another is the fact that Reg, even though he has a ~40m range on his robot extendable arm, seems to be able to hang down much more than 40m with them. Again, these are really small nitpicks, but I felt like they were worth mentioning, as the former lowered my singular rating for story by one point. But truly, I enjoyed my time with this anime a hell of a lot. I got, felt, and experienced more unique things this anime threw at me than any other anime i have seen in the past year. I truly, truly love this anime to bits, and it blew my every expectation coming into this show out of the goddamn water. It genuinely surprised me, but I love the show all the more for it.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: About the blatant child nudity that has been infamous among this community... I find it to be okay. While I think the idea that Riko is completely fine with nudity could've been conveyed orally instead of visually, I have a small sense of understanding on why the half nudity is present in such a blatant way. However, I do wish it was really toned down a little, and sometimes I didn't welcome the scenes that child nudity were portrayed in.\\n\\n\r\n(Out of 9 points)\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nOST: 9\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 10. A great experience I recommend to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Sorry for the lack of structure in this review. I was very redundant in getting my point across. I'll try to do better next time... ^-^'",

The premise of the anime is a breath of fresh air drawing you in as a very innocent story of children exploring a big hole and looking for treasures (almost slice of life-like). As you dive deeper you see that it is much much more with themes that would move almost any viewer.\r\nThe characters and artwork at first seems very geared towards children as the main characters themselves are still children. At times the artwork gets a bit blurry, but for the most part the world shown and the details in thebackgrounds, objects, and creatures are rich and leave the viewer wanting to discover more about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound particularly drew me in. The first time 'Hanezeve Caradhina' played in the background there were chills sent down my back at how beautiful and fitting it was for the scene.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being children, and despite living in a world almost alien to our own, there were themes and situations in this series that forces even an adult viewer to relate to. \\n\\n\r\nI was brought close to tears by the final episode and I can't wait for the next season.",

            "content": "This anime is absolutely amazing. From the very first episode it captured me with it's plot, world building, animation and soundtrack. I have not read the manga, but since season 2 is not yet confirmed I will start it to see where this outstanding journey goes from here.\r\nStory: 9\r\nBefore talking about the plot in general I have to mention the two things that stood out from the first moment I began watching this series. That is first the Abyss itself and second the society of cave raiders surrounding it. \r\nThe Abyss is simply breathtaking in it's uniqueness and originality. It's a fully realized world unlikeanything I've seen in anime. Every Layer of the abyss differs from the other. In many animes people will do everything to explore strange and advanturous places, but often I found myself not really buying it. Many of these worlds just don't seem that exciting and different that I would dedicate my life travelling through it. The Abyss on the other hand is something I would totally understand people risking their lives for. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why I can understand the cave raiders. The Abyss is everything for them. They treat it like God. Only that they took it a little bit too far. The society of orth, the city around the abyss, is twisted to it's core. From the youngest age kids are raised to be cave raiders, they value the discovery of the abyss over their own lives and they will do everything in their power to do it. The consequences of this dedication are shown in the cours of the show, but what's realy great is how it's presented. It's not in your face: This is wrong - this is right!!!! These things are shown like the most normal things in the world. Which makes sense, since for the characters it is normal. They don't question it. It's up tp the viewer to decide, if you think it's  wrong. I personally like this ambigous tone. \\n\\n\r\nIf you read a summary of the basic plot it sounds very simple. A girl and a boy exploring the abyss, but it's the how they do it that sets it apart form the rest. The pacing may be slow for some, but for me, apart from two middle episodes, it was perfect. Maybe the most brilliant idea of the author is the curse of the abyss, because it gives the story an urgent and determinist feel. This is a journey to hell, a suicide trip. One where there will be no return from. Our main characters have to abandon the world they know to make this trip.\\n\\n\r\nThis scenario demands that the show gets dark at some point. And dark it certainly gets. But there are different ways how a show gets dark. Often it comes out of nowhere. A suden tone shift that no one expected. \\n\r\nBut that's not the case here. Sure, the first half of the show is relatively light in it's atmosphere. This changes in the latter half and especially in the last four episodes. However, even from the very first episode on there's a lingering dark and disturbing undertone to all procedings. You know bad things will happen at some point in this show. And when they come no one can be really suprised. Cause they don't come out of nowhere. Everything dark happening in this show is foreshadowed or blatently told form the start. Just like Madoka Magica they just followed their own rules and didn't cop out. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are underrated. Many will probably say that you should watch for the world and animation, but that's selling the characters extremely short. \\n\\n\r\nRiko may seem naive and unprepared for this journey and may annoy some, but for me her enthusiastic approach is essential for the plot to work. She actually acts like a child. She makes mistakes and would die on the first layer without Reg. But she is also aware of that. She knows the danger she's in and is still prepared to risk her life for her goal.\\n\\n\r\nReg on the other hand is the opposite of Riko. With his abilities he should be prepared for the abyss, but is actually the most insecure and doubtful of them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character in this anime is by far Nanachi. Even though she only appears for 4 episodes she stelas every scene she's in. She is both knowledgeable and unsure and is extremely funny. Her interactions with reg are absolute gold.\\n\\n\r\nNewt to these three the supporting cast is also stellar. There are not that many characters in the anime, but those that appear leave an impression, alright.\\n\\n\r\nOzen is a perfect combination of cruel and insane, but also helpful and supporting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Bondrewd........well...................\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and animation is quite easily the best I've seen in years. The first episode alone is a wonder to behold and even though the animation quality dips a little from then it still remains greah throughout. The background art and the colours in this series remind me of ghibli and great adventure games. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's always difficult to evaluate how new stuff fits into all-time rankings.\\n\r\nYou can easily get carried away by hype and overestimate aspects of a show.\\n\\n\r\n But it is not hard for this soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the best OST's of all time. It enhances everything that happens in this anime, but alslo stands on its own feet.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many different styles of music combined into one great thing. I would advice to hear this OST when reading the manga. It'll be beyond epic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show form the first second to the last. It's a unique rollercoaster ride of emotions. Happiness and Sadness, Hope and Despair, it has it all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nA clear 10/10 anime for me. If you like adventure stories with a great plot and interesting characters and you're not afraid of dark and twisted stuff, you'll love this anime. It's one of the best I\u00b4ve seen.\\n",

If you never had the chance to watch it, do it now. It's one of the best animes of this generation. Maybe even all-time. I loved how disturbing it gets just a couple of episodes in. I really loved how the characters are full of life and that there's a lot of character development.\r\nOverall, this is one of those animes that you need to watch before you die.",

            "content": "Story (27/30):\r\nThe first thing that sets Made in Abyss apart from the rest, is its story and world building. It is a rare true adventure story, where the plot advances through individual interactions between the characters and the environment, instead of some overarching ambition or goal. This makes the plot very unpredictable -- unlike, say, a tournament arc commonly seen in shonen type stories, where it\u2019s more about how rather than if the protagonist will win, surprises lurk around every corner in Made in Abyss, and things could turn ugly at the whim of the author. \r\nThe general story is in three arcs, with acouple of standalone episodes in between. The first arc is an exemplary introduction into a fictional world, and the third arc has an impactful and emotional story. Comparatively, the second arc falls rather flat -- it\u2019s still above average, but with the bar set so high by the first and the third, it\u2019s hard not to feel that the second arc is somewhat weak in storytelling and slow in pace. That said, the third arc, especially the 47 minute long final episode, was so amazing for me that I\u2019m willing to overlook the shortcomings of the middle section. \\n\\n\r\nBut the real problem lies in the fact that with only 13 (technically 14) episodes, the story is nowhere near complete. From a broader perspective, it feels like just the prologue to a grand story. If we get stories as amazing as the third arc in the upcoming seasons (and there\u2019s every indication that\u2019s the case), this anime could very well achieve legendary status. But as it is, the journey has just began, and there are more questions about the world and the characters than answers. For that, I must deduct some score from the story.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss managed to build some very memorable characters despite not giving them a lot of screen time, but due to the nature of the plot device (the Abyss), our protagonists are required to leave everyone behind as they travel forward. This leaves very little room for other characters to develop, and often feel like they only exist in service of moving the plot forward. The departure scenes do carry more weight as a result of the inability to backtrack, but it also comes with the knowledge that we\u2019re very likely never going to meet any of the characters again. The end credits managed to remedy this to a small degree (which is no small feat), but you can\u2019t help but hope they could be developed further.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals (18/20):\\n\\n\r\nThe visual aspects of Made in Abyss are simply gorgeous. From the picturesque backgrounds, to the smoke and fog effects, to the smooth animation of fight scenes, everything is wondrously drawn. If I were to nitpick, however, the main characters (Reg in particular) isn\u2019t drawn particularly consistent throughout the series, with his head shape morphing many times, often quite visibly. I personally have no problem with the chibi artstyle, but it does somewhat amplify these small discrepancies.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I can\u2019t get over with, is how some of the monsters in the abyss are being represented. From what I understand later, the blurry, low definition design of certain monsters appear to be a deliberate design choice, but compared to the clear lines of other monsters and the anime as a whole, they look out of place and cheap. A minor score deduction from an otherwise beautiful anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (20/20)\\n\\n\r\nEven above the great visuals, is an absolutely amazing OST, and one I did not hesitate to purchase. Kevin Penkins did a stellar job composing a highly varied collection of tracks that are at the same time fantastical yet foreign, and it\u2019s apparent that there had been a very close relationship between him and the production team to produce a soundtrack that fits some scenes extraordinarily well. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also does not hesitate in bringing the music to the foreground when necessary, and let the music drive the scenes and emotions. It is an integral part of why the first, tenth and final episode were as amazing as they were, rather than just an icing on the cake. The show also boasts some amazing sound effects and VA that further presents the care put into the effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED, while being catching tunes in their own right, pale in comparison to the OST. I\u2019d even consider them detrimental to the overall soundscape established by the show itself. This is one of the rare cases where I skip the OP not because it\u2019s uninspired, but in fear of ruining the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (30/30)\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s rare to come by an anime that delivers on all fronts, and it\u2019s all the more welcoming in a comparatively boring season. This is one anime that probably works better binge watching, as the slower pace of the middle episodes become less of a problem. \\n\\n\r\nSome have commented on the sexualize representation of children, but I personally see none of it in the anime, save for one gag in episode 2 that might have gone a tad too far. Otherwise penis jokes don\u2019t bother me, and I find no other scene that is disturbing, or can be considered \u201csexual\u201d in nature. The reactions of the children are in line with prepubescents who have just begun to explore what sex is, and there are no sexual/love interest relations with any adults.\\n\\n\r\nIt is one rollercoaster ride of emotions that will be remembered for a long time. Certainly the highest enjoyment to be had in years. Now if only we had a season 2...\\n\\n\r\nRaw score (95/100) | Overall (10/10) \\n",

            "content": "There are Shows that take over the top spot of the season, there are others that take the first place during their year of release and then, there are animes that transience even that, animes like Full metal alchemist Brotherhood , Code Geass, Death note or Tenguen toppa Guren lagan. we see those animes  once every five or so years. Made in abyss is here to stay in our memory, right next to those ground breaking titles, I'm confident to say that Made in abyss is going to amused you and surprise you in many different ways \r\nFrom the moment we see Riko (our main protagonist ) exploring a labyrinth of caves and trees, you can feel you are in for something special, then the music hits you and from that point you can't look away your screen. The breath taking landscapes and backgrounds immerse you in this mysterious world, making you want to know what is ahead.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's desing will make some people errouneusly take this as a friendly kid's show and yes, it looks cute and inocent, but beneath the cute looks and adorable character desings there is a rather dark and sometimes hard to watch story of sacrifice and lost.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the most memorable moments, however, are when we are in company of our main protagonist, a child named Riko and her newly found friend a robot named Reg. the chemistry and friendship between the two grows on the you the more you watch the show. \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that is worth mentioning is the magnificent music, melancholic and beautiful ambiance songs plays during our decent to the abyss, it gives the Anime another layer of polish and reminds you that this is a passion project from the sound team. Especial mention to the song \\n\r\n\"Hanezeve Caradhina\" that plays during two important moments of the series, notably during the 8th episode which I can assure you, it will break your very soul. \\n\\n\r\nAnother important aspect that needs to be mentioned and that some people may find a little offputting, is the cruelty and sometimes sexualisation of characters which are mere children of no more than 12 years old. Some people may find that aspect distracting or down right wrong,but, there isn't any explicit scenes during the series run in regards to sexuality it's more or less just hinted, however, the other aspect in question  ( blood and gore towards children) it's very present but treated as a plot progression devise not as gratuitous violence for the sake of the shock factor. \\n\\n\r\nfinally be aware that this is not a complete story. The anime finished on a cliff hanger and at least for now there is no official confirmation in regards to a second season, hence, you may be ready to catch up with the manga once you finish the anime if you want to know what happens with these lovable characters in their quest to go down the abyss. \\n\\n\r\nMade in abyss surprised the community when it arrived, and for very good reasons, its unique take on the adventure genre is both fresh and captivating at the same time, it's amazing animation, sound and creature design, the intriguing lore around the abyss, the amazing plot and character's progression, it all combines in one hell of a ride that you will not forget for a very long time.",

            "content": "There are just a select few anime that come to mind when I think of masterpieces. For a long time, I relegated these works of art to an era where motion pictures were in greater abundance. Things have certainly changed since that time and I would argue that it has not been for the better but with this latest watch Made In Abyss, I am reminded that some times, change is good.\r\nAt first glance of the anime\u2019s poster art, I immediately wrote this title off. This would have been a grave mistake had there not been a positive rating sitting right beside it\u2026 I chalkit up to having a great viewing community. From the onset, I was blown away by the amazing environments, on point animation, and pristine art design. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime definitely got the full makeover and it was very apparent that time and care was taken in its presentation. By the first episode, I was instantly in love with the art style which includes the chibi like children that inhabit this immersive world. It\u2019s the quality that you expect to see in a full motion picture anime not an anime series and it sets the stage for what makes this such a compelling piece of work. \\n\\n\r\nA large pit with a diameter of 1,000 meters sits upon an island discovered 1,900 years ago. Its depths are unknown, its dangers are apparent but this does not stop many who are enchanted by its mystery and relics of fortune especially one little girl in particular. Rico, daughter of a legendary explorer, comes in contact with a mysterious young boy who turns out to be more than meets the eye. His presence and a message thought to be sent from Rico\u2019s mother leads her to take her chances with her new found friend to the chasms deepest level a place from which they may never return. \\n\\n\r\nThe great art and animation direction of this series would not mean much if the gravity of this tale was not as captivating. Though the main character Riko\u2019s journey seems to be the focal point of the story at the begging, it\u2019s the mysterious boy Reg that inevitably steals the show in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters that surround both Regu and Riko encapsulate the obvious magnetism that ultimately pulls you in so much to the point that you get emotionally caught off guard. Not every episode may vibrate as strongly as the last but its cohesive plot line makes it so you cannot help but wonder what is coming next. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is certainly not to be left out of the conservation. The music of Made In Abyss adds a great ambiance and an overall effect to this amazing story, and wonderful animation and I do not think you could have called this a stand out title without it. \\n\\n\r\nMade In Abyss is far from over as its season is now complete but for just 13 episodes, it is definitely a worth it watch. Its emotion is as literal as the depths in which the journey pertains to and if something does not get in your eye at some point during this telling then it honestly will not resonate with you as well as it did with me.    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nMade in Abyss has to be the surprise gem of not just the summer season, but the surprise gem of 2017 as a whole, because it's been a while since I have seen something that really went to my core.\r\nStory (10/10)\r\nThe story begins with Riko, a girl who finds a robot boy she calls Regu and together they set off on a journey into the Abyss to find Riko's mother.\r\nDespite the short summery, the story is split into a bunch of sections, it begins with Riko and Regu meeting each other by pure chance and they immediately become such a fun duo together,until Riko finds a message she thinks is from her mother.\\n\r\nThe story builds upon the home she lives in and her friends very nicely in such a short time, while also giving us some backstory on why people go into the abyss.\\n\r\nOnce Riko and Regu start their adventure into the abyss, the real story begins and the intensity of the adventure along with the bond between Riko and Regu just keeps on building at such an amazing rate.\\n\r\nThen we arrive at the halfway point, where Riko and Regu meet Ouzen, Lyza's mentor and her assistant Maruruk, here Riko and Regu learn more about their origins and are given harsh lessons on the reality of their situation. This was where the intensity of the story starts to really build up as Riko learns more about herself and both her and Regu learn to trust one another even more, so they can face the incredible dangers they have yet to face.\\n\r\nAfter that Riko and Regu continue on their journey, this is where the true dark side of the adventure starts to sink in, as Riko and Regu encounter ever more dangerous creatures and even fight against the abyss itself with the curse it holds, this eventually leads to an incredibly suspenseful and gut wrenching scene where Regu has to help Riko fight for her life after being exposed to deadly poison.\\n\r\nDuring the final episodes, Regu encounters Nanachi who helps him heal Riko from the deadly poison, while she healed we learn a lot about Nanachi and her story in the abyss along with her friend Mitty, their backstory and goodbye scene has got to be one of the most saddening moments I have seen in any anime, it had me balling my eyes out.\\n\r\nThe series ends with Nanachi tagging along with Riko (who has finally healed from her wound) and Regu, who set out to continue their adventure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite most of the anime focusing on Riko and Regu, their relationship along with other characters who were introduced were amazing to watch.\\n\r\nMight I say, the relationship between Riko and Regu has been one of the best things I've seen in anime all year, with Riko's clumsy, bombastic and intelligent personality along with Regu strength and protective nature made such an epic combo, plus with their chibi style they were so cute together and just made me want to route for them all the time. You also learn that without each other they would never have gotten as far as they did, which shows they needed each other more than anything.\\n\r\nNanachi is a person, who survived against the effects of the abyss's curse and is known as a Hollow, now despite showing up quite late into the series Nanachi made such an amazing impact with her witty personality and incredibly saddening backstory that just made her an instant likeable character.\\n\r\nOuzen was another character who also surprised me, she was around for the middle section of the show and was Lyza's former teacher, you might hate her because of what she did to Riko and Regu plus she isn't really the nicest of people either, but the harsh lesson she teaches Riko and Regu was something they would need in the future, hence why I think Ouzen is a wise person despite her methods.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is one thing for sure, beautiful, it is a world that looks amazing while being deadly at the same time. I was a little concerned when the characters were going to be in a chibi format, but it actually works really well here and makes the relationship between Riko and Regu so much better.\\n\r\nI loved how different each level was to the abyss, each level had it's own different fauna of plants and creatures that could either help Riko and Regu or it could end up killing them.\\n\r\nThere was something weird with some of the creatures when they moved, but it didn't look like CGI and this fascinated me in a way that the animators took a lot of care to detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime did have a good op, it had that nice mysterious tone the show offered and had me looking forward to the adventure that our main characters would be going on. I also liked the ed too which is usually quite rare, but I just loved the catchy music showing the different stages of Riko and Regu's journey down the abyss, which if you notice does go alongside the episodes.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also something wonderful too, it hit the right moments, like for example when it was showing the sun raising over Riko's hometown it was something that hit me right in the heart. It's not just there though, the suspenseful music when Regu was helping Riko fight against the poison just made the situation even more frightening while Nanachi's goodbye to Mitty had some of the saddest music ever which made the scene even more tear jerking.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this anime, is that it feels like a proper adventure, usually whenever an anime has the adventure genre in there, it just doesn't feel like an adventure sometimes yet with Made in Abyss it feels like a pure adventure with something to find and discover while also avoiding the dangers with it.\\n\r\nIt also does well with it's mystery, like the curse of the abyss, which affects the Divers in different and gruesome ways which make you fear the abyss itself and for the characters too, who get exposed to the curse as well. Another thing about it's mystery is the origins of Riko and Regu which were quite surprising (well for Riko at least) and it makes sense why Riko has this sense of adventure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an amazing anime and it has already been given a go for a season 2 which I can't wait for, this is the gem I was waiting for in 2017 and it didn't disappoint me whatsoever.",

Every scene is sprawling with life, with characters giving off changes in emotion through nuances in animation and amazing voice acting. Never did i feel like even onemember of the production staff skimped out on quality and it really shows.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that ED theme, oh that ED theme. One of the best ED's i have ever heard, up there with Kekkai Sensen and Tokyo Ghoul RE's ED themes and is the best character sung ED i have ever heard. It even evolves with the story, which is incredibly rare for an ED, with the main characters Reg and Riko singing it for most of the journey but later adding in the singing of Nanachi (The most adorable rabbit hillbilly to have ever lived.) to the ending as they are introduced to the story.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss will have you changing emotions like train tracks as you ride this roller-coaster of an anime but throughout the ride it will never change the sheer feeling of amazement that comes from watching such beauty.",

            "content": "\"When a white whistle descends to the sixth layer people call it their \"last dive.\"~\r\n*No Spoiler Concise Review*\r\nTL;DR: Lord of the Rings meets Shinsekai Yori crossed with Madoka Magica. Riko and Reg gets curious and now will dive deep into the abyss to unearth its secrets while looking for Riko's mom because they received a letter. \r\n[Story: 6/10 , Characters: 7/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\nDon't overhype this anime as anime of the season. Overhyping the anime might disappoint you but undervaluing it might actually reward you. Made in Abyss is an adult anime disguised as a kids' show that starts off innocent butrapidly twists into this terrifying reality that viewers experience through the eyes of the main characters Riko and Reg. This anime in essence is a world building adventure anime. As each episode pass, the terror and horror the MCs see and learn about the abyss as they dive deep in search of Riko's mom, Lyza, strips away any child like innocence viewers might perceive to have about this show. That's what makes this show so addicting and such a guilty pleasure to keep on watching, just to find out more. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with young orphaned kids working in the abyss as cave raiders hunting for relics for their orphanage so they can make money by selling it. Right away you start to wonder how can such young kids be forced into this harsh labour. However, you realize that these kids are not ordinary kids. They are able to puncture through solid rocks with heavy pickaxes, lift heavy blocks of stone, carry almost twice their volume on their backpacks. Out of nowhere, a 2 ton flying stingray attacks them and they make it out without a scratch. The fact that the children aren't even phased by this makes you realize how dangerous this world is. Regardless, it is through this incident Riko meets Reg, her half human-half android saviour. Later, the orphanage receives a letter from Lyza, a legendary white whistle, who descended all the way down to the 7th layer of the abyss, and for some apparent reason, despite knowing how horrific and dangerous the abyss is, tells her young daughter, Riko, that she will be waiting for her there. Even Riko knows how dangerous it is because they have documents detailing the terrible dangers that lie in the abyss and physiological dangers one will experience as they come back up the abyss. But the show must go on. So Riko and Reg sneaks out at night with their cave raiding gears with a few help of their friends and sets on a journey to meet Lyza. Though the premise is a bit absurd but it's the journey that makes it rewarding to watch since viewers are equally curious as Riko in finding out the truth with their very own eyes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters really makes this show unique. Riko is an eccentric ambitious cave raider who was born in the depths of the abyss but was lifted back up the abyss without suffering any physiological problems. She is the living embodiment  of the idiom curiosity kills the cat. Reg is equally special, since he is half human and half robot with extendable hands, robotic body but a working penis with a normal butthole that do not feel anything physiologically. How do we know this? Riko experimented on him as soon as she found him of course.  From stuffing a ruler up his butt to electrocuting him to bring him back to life, she has done it all. The human characters in this show are all so twisted that the only normal characters that viewers can connect with is the robot Reg himself. There is also a whistle rank system for cave raiders. Starting from Red and Blue to all the way to Black and lastly White. The white whistle cave raiders are said to be this amazing cave raiders that are able to descend through all the gruesome layers and some even make their way back up. Are they still sane that's left up for viewers to decide. Beside Riko and Reg, we get to meet a cave raider from each rank, Maruruk (blue), Gilo (purple), Hablog (black) and Ouzen (white). We see first hand how adept each of them are in their physiological abilities & intuitions for their surrounding juxtaposed with how far their sanity has deviated from the norm as their whistle rank rose due to how far down they descended into the abyss. There is another character that viewers will be introduced to later but I will keep their surprise a secret. It's subtle attributes as such that captivates the audience to watch more to know whether the Red whistlers, Riko and Reg will face same predestined harshness. Needless to say, all of the characters are just batshit zany with a little bondage fetish because their primary form of punishment for anyone is tying them up naked and whipping them to their heart's content.   \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the interesting premise and unique characters, the sound, the voice acting, the art and the animation are really the highlight of the show. The animation is mostly hand-drawn with slightly blended CGI that allows small details subtle expressions and background motion to be captured better. The art and cinematography makes you feel like you are in a high budget Ghibli show. You feel immersed with the reality around you. The video editing and directing just throws you inside the abyss and leaves you gripping on your chair waiting for the terror to pass. If that wasn't all, the background score by composer Kevin Penkin is beautiful. His use of the vocals accompanied with orchestra makes it so emotional and leaves you in awe. Not to mention, the OP and ED songs are so moe that it's a direct contrast to how the show is everything but moe. It's such a nice play on the whole metaphor that the abyss may seem full of wonder and awe but in reality it's anything but that. The seiyuus for Riko and Reg did a great job in capturing their emotions. Especially the seiyuu for Ouzen. Just the voice acting alone showed us how far her mental conditions have deviated. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Made in Abyss is a world building survival adventure anime with great premise that has executed itself well so far. In the beginning, the robot's ability makes him a broken cave raider because he is able to descend with such ease however, by later episodes they finally start showing robotic ability will only help get you past so far before they are faced with the harshest reality and unknown terrors of the abyss. If they didn't do that then this show would have fell flat. The characters despite being childlike are constantly in messed up adult situations where they must make harsh decisions to survive. There is room for improvement but with how successful the first season is and even reaching MAL top 100, hopefully fans do not overhype it to the point of ruining the experience for others. Anyways, if you are still curious and hopefully people have not overhyped this anime too much, then definitely check it out let me know later how you like it. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",

            "content": "Made in Abyss is a kind of anime that looks like a children's anime. However, I can reassure you that the truth is, it's an anime for adults. It follows the story of Reg and Riko as they adventure into the abyss. Becoming slowly more and more impossible to get to the bottom.\r\nMade in Abyss contains graphic and horrific scenes that no one should witness. But the problem is, we MUST see these scenes to understand the characters and how they react in these scenarios. We can understand how they feel witnessing these atrocious scenes. As Reg and Riko travel to the bottom they encountermany creatures and other cave raiders. They are only young children, Riko being 12, and have no experience in the much lower depths of the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nWhat stood out to me as I saw this, was the soundtrack. I nearly listen to it everyday as I do household jobs, playing games and drawing. I can listen to it when I feel sad to cheer me up, and I listen to it when I'm happy, to preserve those memories. In fact, i'm listening to the soundtrack as I write this now.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysteries in this show appealed to me. Questions that the characters ask, and only a few get answered. Questions I asked myself were: What's at the bottom of the abyss? Why is the curse of the abyss stronger on the lower levels? Why are there strange creatures that can't be found anywhere else of the planet? This is what a show should do. Keep the viewer at the edge of their seats as you answer their questions and carry on surprising them.\\n\\n\r\nI give the art an 8. Why? Because you can tell what's going on, as well as what the characters are feeling. It also has some beautifully well animated scenes. You also can get a feel of how big the abyss is. When illustrations are being shown. The city surrounding it is also being compared to show how vast the abyss is.\\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this show and it will be an all time favourite, purely for how different the concept is.",

            "content": "Over the last years fans of the adventure genre didn't get a lot of great pieces to watch, so 'Made in Abyss' comes just at the right time to impress people all over the globe. At last an adventure anime sees the light of day, which can life up to the legacy of genre-masterpieces like 'Spice and Wolf' or 'Mushishi'!!\r\nMade in Abyss is a fantasy adventure anime which consists of 13 episodes. \r\nThe story revolves around Riko, a 12 years old girl who lives in a city, which is build around a giant underground cave, called the 'Abyss'. Like many people who life in there,Riko works as a treasure hunter on the most upper layer of the Abyss. One day, after being attacked by a creature from the Abyss, Riko is saved by a mysterious boy named Regu, who lost his memories. With Regus mysterious powers and Rikos intelligence and enthusiasm, the two protagonists set out on a journey to the bottom of the Abyss, to find Rikos missing mother and to discover answers about Regus past.\\n\r\nThe general pacing of the show is rather slow and the creators take their time to show a lot of the beauty of the Abyss and its fanciful inhabitants. \\n\r\nThe show comes with stunning visuals and flawless animations. The bright green colors and superb light effects, combined with the minimalistic background music create a fantastical atmosphere. \\n\r\nAnd don't be fooled by the rather childish looks of the main protagonists, 'Made in Abyss' is far from a childrens anime. Despite the slow pacing and the rather calm atmosphere, there are some scenes that are very hard to watch (you will know what i mean when you get there!).\\n\r\nThe Sound effects and OSTs round up the atmosphere very well and make you feel like you are right there with Regu and Riko, exploring the vast depth of the Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Made in Abyss for me is the best anime of 2017 and one of the best adventure anime of all time. Would i recommend it to anyone though? No! As mentioned above, the pacing is pretty slow and action junkies might get a little bored or frustrated with this one. BUT if you like a very dense atmosphere that will make you forget your surroundings and if you like Spectacular visuals combined with very atmospheric music, there is no way around watching this masterpiece.",

            "content": "Anyone who says they had an easy time giving this show a rating is either lying or didn't watch it close enough, Made in Abyss has some of the best moments in recent anime, but it's also got a lot of really big flaws, and sorting through all of them to find out my cumulative thoughts on the show was a legitimately difficult task.\r\nLet's start with the good things though, and the first one is the entire first 3 episodes. They are everything you could want from the introduction to an adventure anime, the monster attack is thrilling, the setting is fascinating, the characters arefun, there's that one scene with the great animation and music that makes everyone melt, they're just great.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the first 3 episodes, the conclusion is great. They make episode 13 twice as long, introduce a totally new storyline, put the characters in an impossible situation that rips my heart to shreds, then sends us off with another gorgeous cinematic display.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, for how good the beginning and end are, the middle of this show is a spectacle, just not in a good way. Starting in episode 4, it's almost offensively boring at times, the plot never feels like it's going anywhere at all, and when it does, they retroactively invalid all the progression, the sense of danger the Abyss had is crushed through multiple red herrings that don't actually matter, the great music and animation all but disappear, and I started to realize I just might hate the characters, particularly the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a girl named Riko who fits the standard \"optimistic protagonist\" mold we often see in adventure stories to keep things moving, the problem is she is one of the worst examples of this character I have ever seen. She's not so much optimistic as just stupid, she is perfectly fine with the idea the Abyss is just going to kill her in a way no mentally healthy child possibly could be, at no point in the series does she ever display any pre-emptive fear at what she will most likely be facing, and it makes no sense whatsoever. It's made even worse because she's played off to be extremely knowledgeable about the Abyss, most likely so the author has an easy way to dump setting exposition, but in that way, the writer's need to flesh out this admittedly fascinating world directly compromises the plot and characters that inhabit the world. Lastly, the author of this manga is very obviously a huge pervert into no shortage of fetishes that left me personally completely disgusted. There are multiple scenes with the 12 year old main character needlessly naked. There are scenes of her pissing herself. There is a scene that is not called \"torture porn\" for nothing (to be fair, that scene did have actual impact and brought made Abyss feel threatening again). There's a scene where Riko wets the bed while sleeping with Reg. There's a scene where she gets trapped in a giant carnivorous plant's stomach. And there's a scene she makes Reg take her clothes off then makes fun of him for getting an erection before the show makes the innocent act of Reg performing mouth to mouth to save her life creepy by choosing then to tell her he'd kissed her. When you stop and think about it, this show is disgusting with its sexualization of minors, and it does not apologize for it in the slightest, the only redeeming quality is that at no point does it present any of the said minors being taken advantage of, but that's hardly an accomplishment unless the author wants to oust himself as a pedophile.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the flaws of the show don't take away from its great moments, but the great moments don't justify the flaws either. This is a hard anime to pin a number to because of that, but I kind of have to, and since at the end of the day I liked the good slightly more than I hated the bad, it gets a 6",

God, I was blown away.\r\nTo start off, there is some sort of magical; old style sort of vibe coming from this anime as if it was going back to the traditional roots, there is a strong sense of nostalgia which as a result made me feel so attached to the anime. \r\n*Story*-9\r\nContinuingfrom my previous point, the story is as of the ones in the 90's, it might be that original, but it does try to stay away from the cliches as much as possible with lots of heartwarming moments. I won't go into detail.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*-10\\n\r\nUnique art style which easily distinguishes and varies this from other anime's which makes this one stand out.

            "content": "Made in Abyss\u00a0is an anime from last year brought to us by Kinema Citrus (because poor literacy makes for good studio names). Now, I only know this studio because they worked with White Fox on the second series of Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka. I've also heard of this anime because MAL is enamoured with it and my highly intelligent sister hates it. But she also didn't care for Akuma no Riddle\u00a0or Angel Beats so I may well disagree with her on this too. Of course her big complaint was that it went into super twelve year old edgelord writing during the last part ofthe series and if that is an apt description, I don't think we'll be disagreeing.\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open with young Riko exploring the early part of the Abyss, a great and mysterious area where explorers can find treasures but also encounter deadly perils and suffer from a \"curse\" when they ascend that can wreak havoc on them. After an encounter with a monster that's strangely high up, she finds a mysterious robot boy. She decides to keep\u00a0 him rather than turning him in and they soon find themselves setting out on an adventure into the depths of the abyss.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest narrative issue with the series is that the tone is wildly inconsistent. Now, I don't agree with my sister about it going really badly edgelord but it does go from more light-hearted adventure to some pretty dark and gruesome stuff involving unethical medical experiments and bleeding eyes. And that does cause some tonal issues. It's like when Gintama went from joking about anuses to a serious story arc about children being raised as prostitutes or when Galaxy Angel went from zany comedy to a serious episode for some reason. These things don't work well together.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nNow, to its credit, there's clearly an effort put into separating the content to minimise the potential problems from the darker content clashing with the lighter with some work at shifting between them properly instead of just going from one to the other out of nowhere.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the curse of the abyss. When I first heard it described, I thought it was going to be like a diver ascending or descending too rapidly, but the series gets a bit stupid with it. There's a point where we see our plucky heroine ascend a slight incline and get hit by the curse. Which doesn't even make sense with the actual explanation they give for how the curse is supposed to work, by the way. The series also has a strange obsession with child nudity. To the point where I have to question whether or not the original writer just has a fetish for it. Seriously, they bring up Regu's penis at least five times and the idea of stringing up children naked is brought up and actually shown in action at one point.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWith those issues out of the way, there are some good ideas present in this series. The whole set up with the abyss could make for a pretty fantastic dungeon crawler. The concept behind the curse is interesting, even if its not always executed well. When the series is sticking to its normal aesthetic, it has some strong moments. This is a series that could be really good, but a lot of its ideas aren't out of the build up stage by the end of the first series. So, its potential ends up being largely unrealised.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAt this juncture, most of the characters are pretty under-developed. Riko is adventurous and knowledgeable but she doesn't have the skills to pull off a lot of what needs done. She probably should've stuck to the earlier layers grinding up her level for a while. Regu is just bland. He's determined to protect Riko but he easily gets his jimmies rustled. Oh, and he has amnesia so his past is mysterious. Yeah, he's one of those rather generic protagonists. Undoubtedly, he'll learn to harness his power and reign in his emotions to emerge as\u00a0 \"the greatest hero\" because that's what usually happens with that variety of protagonist. Then we have Nanachi. The androgynous character with the dark past.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair to both Regu & Nanachi, there's enough room in their back stories for something different and interesting to be put in there. If I review the next series, I'll tell you if that happens. It definitely doesn't in this one.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the various secondary characters. I'll be honest, I don't foresee any of them moving past their rather trite archetype forms. Clearly, the story is going to follow Riko, Regu & Nanachi. The rest might show up briefly but I doubt they'll get enough focus to become three dimensional. But maybe they'll pull a Lower Decks on us.\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue is the copious levels of child nudity. Seriously, is Tsukushi on some kind of watch list? He probably should be. Not only is Riko, the child we see starkers most often, all of twelve but the art style makes her look even younger. So, that's uncomfortable for everybody. And the action sequences are a bit weak since they largely involve Regu getting kicked around and then firing his laser or something else happening to just end it abruptly. I will give the series credit on the abyss itself. The environments look great. The creatures are interesting looking as well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters are voiced by Ise Mariya, Tomita Miyu & Izawa Shiori. The three of them are pretty good in their roles. Kevin Penkin's soundtrack is quite nice. Really, the sound as a whole is the only element I don't have any major issues with.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThis series is like Soul Eater\u00a0in regards to ho-yay. Whether or not it has a good amount depends on whether or not the androgynous character (Nanachi) is female or male. If they're a girl, there's a fair amount once they show up. Both because of the stuff with Mitty and because of their response to Riko once she starts interacting with them. If they're a male, there's not really any at this juncture.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I can't agree with the hype surrounding this series. It has a foundation that could be built upon for a great series, but it also has some major flaws. That being said, I also don't agree with my sister. With all due respect for her, the dark moments aren't all that bad and they do at least try to transition to and way from them properly. I would be interested in checking out the second series once it airs to see if it fleshes out the characters and takes full advantage of all the potentially strong elements that have just been built up at this juncture or if it wastes them. But, for the first series, I have to call it average. The flaws and strengths balance each other out pretty thoroughly and it winds up neither good nor bad but with the foundation in place to go either way. Yeah, I'm definitely going to review the second series when it's finished.\u00a0",

Everything is going so fast. The author doesn't waste time, we're going straight down the abyss, revealing beautiful environements or dreadful obstacles.\r\nThe characters are absolutely adorable. They all have great personnalities, strenght and flaws. It is absolutely ravaging when anything horrible happens to one of them.\r\nI just want to know what's at the end of the abyss, and I'm not even certain if they will make it there! Probably, they will, I really hope,but what about comming back? That is impossible to tell. This is what Made in Abyss succeded to do. An intense feeling of danger. One of the kids can die at any time and you KNOW it's a posibility by how the story is told.\\n\\n\r\nIf they keep up the good work for the second season, and strictly follow the manga, this anime might just be my favorite of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I want to say, the voice actors are amazing.",

The beginning may be slow for your taste and without clear incentive for you to watch. The characters also won't provide any attraction to the plot at first. While the female protagonist is driven by her goals, you won't get any sufficient reasoning for a long time. Don't be discouraged. You will geteverything you want from this anime.

            "content": "I'm trying to not to give this an undeservedly low score just to contrast the praise this anime has received. I'll stick mostly to criticisms since everyone else has focused on the merits of this anime.\r\nFirstly, the premise of Made of Abyss is quite an interesting one which lends itself well to developing plot and characters. The idea of a global economy based on useless trinkets from the abyss is the first insult to the viewer's intelligence, but it's such a minor part that it can be ignored.\r\nWhat cannot be ignored is the completely unbelievable characters.\r\nLet's start with the 12 year old girl who wantsto be a cave explorer. So, what are her special anime abilities? She doesn't have any. She's weak, of average intelligence, and doesn't possess any special knowledge about the abyss.  And yet, she manages to come away unscathed from this place which is supposed to be so dangerous. It's impossible to take the abyss seriously as a dangerous place when you have tiny children managing to survive within it with little issue.\\n\\n\r\nNext, there's the indestructible robot with a particle cannon for an arm. His physical abilities are probably meant to contrast Riko's frailty, but you still never feel that Riko is in any real danger anyhow.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is bad. The first few episodes do very little to set up the story, and serve only to waste time. Once the main characters enter the abyss, they rapidly progress through this allegedly dangerous place, meeting little resistance. The second problem with them going so quickly is the fact that you don't ever get a sense for the unique aspects of each layer. With a setting filled with such diverse places, you'd expect to get to experience those places with the characters. You don't.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, but there's too much dialogue and not enough animation. The background music, sounds, and voice acting are good. I'm personally not a fan of the OP. The ED serves as a perfect metaphor for the show as a whole- it's supposed to be dark behind a light and airy facade. Unfortunately, that darkness doesn't manifest itself well enough to feel ever-present. Towards the end, you catch a few glimpses of it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't regret having watched this, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. 6/10",

            "content": "[8.5/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nWhat do you get out of world-building? A sense of creating a universe that is so fantastical yet dealt with pragmatically. The experience of wonder, of awe, of wide-open eyes and dropped mouths with a string of saliva rolling down the side of your cheek. The figurative light-bulb lighting itself above your head as a new piece of crucial information is revealed. The feeling of descent, thematically and literally, as every step you take with these characters feels harder, slower, more exhausting. Beads of sweat drip off your temple. The ecosystem suffocates you. The monsters lurk at the edges of an oasis. \r\nMade in Abyss,above all else, supports creativity. It supports the feeling you get when the seed of creation sprouts in your mind and you are left with a blooming flower of concept that you can't help but expand upon. The sustained creation, the never-ending magnitude, the all-encompassing awe. This is what is provided in what I can only call the most jaw-dropping world I have yet seen in anime. Something that explodes and never lets up. Every environment whispers in your ear, shrieks in agony, and curls up unease. \\n\\n\r\nFor all the faults that this series' harbors, one shining example of unrelenting vision and creative strength carries it through the occasional tedium and narrative missteps. Through the thick shrubbery of clunky exposition and thorny veins of confounding character decisions into the open meadow of inspiring and seat-gripping thematic resolutions. A passion project through and through, we are left with one of the most unique anime on television. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation and Sound]\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss may be the prettiest show out. Not just the background art, or the character design, or the animation in and of itself. Which is lead by names like Kazuchika Kise, the key animator of Ghost in the Shell, Osamu Masayuma, the background artist of Spirited Away, and Kou Yoshinari, the key animator for Steamboy and Kizumonogatari. The talent is palpable. But the prettiness comes from the combination of these elements. The ability to blend everything that works so well into a package that is as astounding as it is subtle with presentation. \\n\\n\r\nWe go from sweeping shots of different biomes and ecosystems to confined rooms that ooze personality from every pore. A soundtrack that not only utilizes fully written music with consistent reprisals to wondrous backing tracks that act like blankets on some of the shows biggest revelations. Plucking strings to extensive violin. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation here is also quite solid. While at its peak in the magnificent first three episodes, it remains fairly consistent throughout the series' run-time, with very few dips in noticeable quality. You get a product here that excels in its art, and it needs to, because the art here is almost the forefront to this whole adventure. Without exceptional art we would've been thoroughly underwhelmed by the magnitude of concept being shown here. \\n\\n\r\nThe presentation, in this case, doesn't just cover the visuals but the way the narrative presents us with the world. Detailed maps that cover the journey that we have yet to forge our path within. Named and unnamed beasts that roam the lands, concepts of physiology that is alien to us but explained in intriguing bouts of exposition. These are all elements which consistently impress in Made in Abyss. When the characters talk about the world, I am never bored, because I am at the edge of my seat wanting to learn more about a place that is as alien as it is familiar, in the sense of human conflict. The world, not just the abyss itself, is so well realized that even the most miniature detail is not left behind or without visual explanation.\\n\\n\r\nThe city of Osu doesn't just feel lived in, it feels realistically inhabited. The way civilization works, the way the abundance of orphans correlates with the deaths in abyss. How kids are raised looking to die within the chasm that heaves below them. It is so compelling, the morality of it all, that it could've inhabited an entire series on its own without even stepping foot in the titular abyss. Yet this is only a spring board for a series which writhes in its potential. \\n\\n\r\nThe presentation here is perfect. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters] \\n\\n\r\nWe follow Riko and her robot companion Regu as they leap into the darkness and begin a vast journey to find Riko's mother, Lyza. Riko, our plucky, eccentric girl is surprisingly one of the best elements of the series. She's excitable and energetic and curious, but never really dumb enough to truly become frustrating to deal with. Which is a fine line to skirt with a character that is essentially a curious twelve year old girl journeying into what has to be the most dangerous place in the entire universe. With that in mind, the viewers could easily become frustrated with her actions as a curious kid. However, the writers here smartly maintain a grip on how her actions lead to effects without losing grip on her as a character. \\n\\n\r\nRegu, on the other hand, is a bit more reserved. As a boy could be. He serves as her guardian, as he isn't prone to the aspect of this Abyss that is perhaps most curious and frightening, its curse. Which gets heavier and heavier the further you go down, and each layer you enter poses a bigger threat to you, not only in experience but in your chances of being able to come back up, as the curse only effects you if you attempt to go up. Regu plays as somewhat of a young boy straight-man, and the relationship he develops with Riko is fairly endearing. He is quite powerful, but they thankfully put a hard limit to his power as a character, which surprisingly leads to character conflict that feels natural rather than completely unbelievable. \\n\\n\r\nOn their journey they meet plenty of characters which range from exposition-dumps to engaging personalities. My personal favorite is Ozen the Immoveable, a friend of Riko's mother. Ozen is a towering, immensely powerful women that bares the scars of the abyss in more ways than one. With a suitably cartoony voice by Sayaka Ohara, we get a joyfully appealing character. Other characters aren't as strong, for example, Ozen's servant, Mararuk, who never quite forges a believable bond with Riko and Regu, making for a \"goodbye\" scene that doesn't really hit its mark at all. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps Made in Abyss' most hit-or-miss element. Thankfully, the story here is more hit than miss, but regardless, there are some notable narrative missteps that I feel impact the show's story overall. Most importantly, the stagnating pacing that effected episodes five through nine that lost a lot of this series' momentum that was developed within the first four episodes. The first three, in particular, being some of the most exceptional episodes in anime this year. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative here gets suitably dark, too, which I really found myself fearing at first. I heard rumblings of this series getting \"dark\", and I wasn't quite excited for that specifically because television anime has the track record of being painfully weak when it comes to frightening and gory material. It feels very censored and limp. This fear ended up being a very good thing in the long run, since when this series does end up getting dark... well, lets just say I wasn't expecting it to get that dark. It is faithful to the manga in just about every way, not shying away from some of the most gruesome material and that put an endlessly long smile on my face. \\n\\n\r\nI love dark material. I'm a fan of gore and bodily horror. It all is very appealing in the most human sense. The idea that something so fake can really affect you in a cathartic way is a interesting aspect of television and film that is shockingly not utilized in anime often, which is strange since Japan is at the forefront of some of the more gruesome and horrific live-action films and manga. \\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss definitely, thankfully, gets dark. The gut-punches here are so enjoyable because you get to see the grisly results. I loved every second of this. What I loved less, however, are the narrative beats that led up to some of these macabre scenes, as they often relied on some convenience or rushed storytelling. This is the series' biggest fault. It often rings as corny when it really shouldn't, which is understandable because anime as medium is pulpy and over-the-top. However, Made in Abyss has moments where it isn't those things, and also has moments where it is. It goes from an action sequence that is reminiscent of a shounen to this heart-wrenchingly brutal destruction of a character we ended up feeling attached to. This is tonal whiplash through and through it causes for a disjointed viewing experience on occasion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, I was pleased with the way the story went. It didn't rush through the most important moments and that is really what matters most. If a second season isn't announced soon, I doubt i'd be able to wait for long before I pick up the manga and read through that. What also helps the story is its lack of anime cliches that permeate through so much of this medium's storytelling. Whether that be fanservice or otherwise boring comedic relief that doesn't provide anything. There is comedy here, which helps make this journey more believable, and thankfully, for the most part, it is generally okay, if a little forced at times. \\n\\n\r\nI hate even having to talk about fanservice because this show mostly follows characters in the twelve year old range. But this is anime after all and perversion is one thing that can infect even the most appealing series'. Made in Abyss doesn't have any abrasive fanservice, thank fucking god. I can point out some more fetishistic elements, however, I feel like they are decently well-placed within the world here that they don't become something that rips you out of the series. The show's least interesting moments often come with some comedic delivery that doesn't work too well. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss doesn't rest on the laurels of its art. While the world undoubtedly carries this series in more ways than one. Providing what I can only call as one of the most intriguing and awe-inspiring creations I've ever seen in anime. There are other elements to enjoy here as well, albeit not as much. A great, love-able protagonist in Riko. A progressively darker story that ends up catching you by surprise. Outstanding creature design and animation. The narrative suffers from some pacing issues as well as occasional bumps in believability, but overall provides a positive experience as well. \\n\\n\r\nI look forward to watching this show again and seeing if I can get even more out of a second viewing. I think it may very well benefit from that, and if it does, I won't hesitate to raise the score. It is undoubtedly a unique anime that I can't help but promote enough. It is so different than just about anything else being created in the medium that that alone is enough reason to support it. Watch this series. Tell people you want more of this. Even if it isn't perfect, it is so inspiring to see this medium, which I often call the last bastion of 2D animation, being used to its fullest. \\n\\n\r\nTake a step into something new. A world that hides behind every unturned rock and unexplored crevice. Every skeleton dug up and analyzed. Every monster that patrols within the far reaches of a terrifying world. Travel into the Abyss.",

            "content": "Story: 10/10\r\n The story is the strongest point of this anime. Although the main characters are children the story is very mature oriented. It has a lot of drama, a few \"hard to look at\" scenes, even some funny moments. The  mistery of the Abyss is guaranteed to hook you up while the development and dramas of the main characters is really enjoyable. Also remember that the anime is not ranked 17+ for no reason: You won't see many gory scenes but when you see them, be prepared. Anyway the story is for mature people, having a lot of feels mostly.\r\nI also point outthat the anime doesn't lack originality while having only 2 or 3 anime cliches here and there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n The art is not bad at all but it could use a little more polishing. Some creatures might be a little weird animated and some scenes have a little low frames but other than that : It's great.\\n\r\nStill you will love the beautiful landscapes and the cute characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nI don't have much to add in the sound review. The soundtracks are beautifull and usually match the scenes. Also the opening is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 Every single character here is great. Some of them are really to see through and others keep a lot of mystery around them. You will notice some beautiful character development on the MCs and you will definetly enjoy to discover the misteries behind the secondary characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n   This anime is a whole journey. Not only for the main characters but for you too. It will take you to discover the misteries of the abyss (or just some of them), you will see the beautiful evolution of the MCs and experience all the drama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 Maybe my review is not really objective or neutral because I enjoyed this anime so much but I strongly recommend you to give it a try. I almost guarantee you that it will hook you up since the first episode. P.S: I hope you're mature enough to watch it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[NO SPOILERS]: in this review I give my opinion on this anime updating it every week. I won't explain the plot, I'll focus on my view. I hope you enjoy!\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nOkay guys, so I started the series giving it a 9/10. It has one of the best world-building in all the animes (in my opinion), that kinda reminds me the joy of Studio Ghibli movies. Indeed, they share the same type of artwork and I personally love it.\r\nIt submerges you into a fantasy world which brings you back to your childhood. However, even rated as \"+13\" I noticed that in the first episode there were somethings that were off the \"normal\" plane. For example, the protagonist, a girl named Riko, lives in an orphanage... which has a f*cking torture chamber! And there's where she lives!!! And you may think \"Oh! Maybe it was an old building that served another purpose on the past\". Well, that's not true: it was an orphanage since the start. But the most awesome thing is how they make it seem normal: it may even pass unnoticed by many. So, it got me really hooked up to the point that I read the whole manga in a week or so. And it was one of the best decisions ever made: it's the BEST manga out there. Are you a Madoka Magica fan? Don't even hesitate, READ IT NOW!!\\n\\n\r\nAfter 4 or 5 episodes of the anime series, I was completely pissed off. The most intriguing and dark parts of the manga were softened in the anime to match the +13 requirements. The problem was the sound and music, which killed the mood given in the manga. I was rating the anime as 4/10. I couldn't believe they did this to such an amazing manga. But then, episode 10 came to exist to reverse the situation! A tremendous moment in the manga (won't spoil, don't worry) came into action. It was one of the crutial moments which darkens the story a bit more. And the animators did an amazing job with the music and the voice acting. It submerged me into the scene without softening any parts (I even wonder how can they still say it's just +13 and not +17, as the manga). In my opinion it's one of the best single episodes in all anime history in its wholesome.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't like the idea that they will make just 13 episodes because it will end just before the best part of the manga. Even so, I hope they will come more episodes as good as the 10th.\\n\\n\r\n(I'm kinda harsh with the anime because I've got great expectations from the manga, but if you haven't read it you MUST watch the anime or read the manga. You won't regret it!)",

            "content": "\"The process of delving into the black abyss is to me the keenest form of fascination.\" \r\n-H. P. Lovecraft\r\nAt this point, if you don't have any idea of what this show is about, I would recommend you stop reading this review and just watch it, because I think you will get the most out of its setting and characters by going in blind. If, however, you have some basic knowledge of this anime's general tone and storyline, you may read on.\r\n[INTRODUCTION]\r\nWatching Made In Abyss is like watching a deformed child get vivisected (in fact, that's sometimes exactly what's happening). It's brutal, it's depraved, and youimagine there's probably some sicko out there who gets off to it. You heard about how awful it would be, but you ignored those rumors - it can't possibly be that bad, right? - and, sure enough, here you are, watching not because you like it, so to speak, but because it's the grossest, most morbidly fascinating thing you've ever seen and, try as you might, you simply cannot look away.\\n\\n\r\nMade In Abyss is a story about limits. In the titular Abyss, explorers journey into a hellish wonderland, their hopes of surviving the return trip growing dimmer and dimmer with each layer of descent. Not content to just show the reader how the heroes suffer through their quest, Made In Abyss takes the watcher on a journey of their own with the heroes, challenging them not to look away from its twisted fantasy tale. What started out as a Ghibli-inspired adventure comedy quickly evolves into a nightmarish whirlwind of hallucinations, obsession, child abuse, and self-harm. Do you want to keep watching? Perhaps not. But do you have any choice at this point? Absolutely not. You're past the point of no return. This is one of the best, darkest, most faithful anime adaptations out there, and there's absolutely no turning back now.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nIn my mind, the ideal adaptation of a manga fixes all of the manga's glaring flaws without ever straying from the author's original intent. Nothing should be cut, and nothing too noticeable should be added. And in my mind, Made In Abyss is exemplary of how adaptations should be done. Allow me to elaborate.\\n\\n\r\nMade In Abyss perfected the art of the first episode. Right off the bat, it hooked us with its awesome production values and interesting premise, and the mysteries only continued to grow throughout that spectacular opener. And, as the viewers were treated to their first full-on view of the Abyss, the episode ended, leaving everyone hungry for more.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show delivered. Manga readers will notice that the pacing of the source material can be a bit... off at times. Considering the raw depth of the fantasy world Tsukushi Akihito has created, the speed at which the manga flies through its storyline could create problems for some viewers. The anime remedies this by taking a much slower route that really focuses on showing off the Abyss in all of its hellish glory. For example, a single manga chapter was devoted to the entirety of layer three, and the anime staff decided to give it its own full episode so that they could focus more on the ecosystems present in the Abyss. Ladies and gentlemen, THIS is how a studio should do filler. No unnecessary, non-canon material was added - the setting was simply expanded on and made even more immersive and realistic. These little, anime-original montages are what make the show so captivating and the characters so endearing, and I'm glad that they exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing manga fans will notice is that nothing is cut from the anime adaptation. All of the dialogue, all of the scenery, and all of the gore is present. Even the extra chapters from the tankobon volumes are here. At this point, it's worth noting that Masayuki Kojima, known for his panel-for-panel adaptation of Naoki Urasawa's Monster, directed this project.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why only a 9/10, then? Well, there's just one little flaw, and that's the pacing. It can be a bit TOO slow at times. Because of this, I'd recommend binging this show in three or four sittings.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's not like you'll be able to stop yourself from watching it that quickly, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhat really sets apart Made In Abyss from other dark-themed anime is its characters. Riko, Reg, Ozen, Nanachi, Mitty, Bondrewd, Lyza, and more... each of them has their own little backstory and their own little connection the the Abyss. It's heartbreaking to see how each of them had their dreams crushed by the cruelness of reality, and it's even more heartbreaking to see their unique reactions to Riko and Reg's unwavering confidence and optimism. As a watcher, you really get the feeling that previous expeditions into the Abyss not only have shaped the world, but have shaped its characters, too. And some of these characters, like the artifacts and the white whistles they carry, are nothing short of legendary. Some of the strongest moments in the show come from flashbacks detailing how the pasts of two seemingly unstoppable forces clashed, affecting both their futures and their perception of the world. Like I said before, what really makes the characters special is how each one of them experiences a unique form of despair based on what they dreamed of before they entered the Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nI can't talk about the characters without giving a little shout-out to Ozen. GodDAMN, she's so cool.\\n\\n\r\nART [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nProbably the weakest aspect of this show, the artwork is nonetheless breathtaking at times. The background artists have their roots in Studio Ghibli productions, and it really shines through in Made In Abyss. For a fantasy show, one of the most important elements is the world in which it takes place, and the world of Made In Abyss can be absolutely gorgeous at times. The way light shines through the trees, the way fog slowly bubbles out of giant plants, and the way that the sun rises over the town of Orth are all spectacular on their own, but are nothing compared to the artistic triumph that is the Abyss itself; a gaping maw of a pit that is as imposing as it is captivating.\\n\\n\r\nThe same, unfortunately, cannot be said for the character art. Many of the characters have very simply drawn facial features, and there are times when their color palettes don't seem to live up to the standards set by the background art. The characters in the manga are very heavily stylized, with shadows drawn in painstaking detail on every object. Obviously, there are some things that TV anime simply can't emulate. The character designs themselves are very appealing, especially those of Nanachi and Brondrewd. Lots of the female characters are very cute, and the children seem vulnerable and sympathetic, looking like people you'd want to protect. I commend the anime for doing the best it possibly could have without using ugly CG.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, this show has something else going for it, something to make up for the mesmerizing nature of the manga that didn't carry over to the anime's artwork. And oh, boy. It's time for me to gush.\\n\\n\r\nI would give the soundtrack an 11/10 if I could. Hell, I'd give it a 20/10. This is hands-down the best soundtrack I've ever heard. Not just in anime, mind you. EVER. Even if you've decided that this show isn't for you, I implore you to give the OST a listen, because Kevin Penkin did an AMAZING job. Less than thirty seconds into episode one I was already experiencing chills from \"To The Abyss!\". Seven minutes later, my breath was literally swept from my lungs with the soothing yet alien \"Underground River.\" By the time \"Hanezeve Caradhina\" was playing at the end of episode 8, I was literally being picked up and dissected by invisible hands which then proceeded to feed me my own feel glands so that I could experience all of my manly emotions twofold. I likely won't ever forget it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP isn't quite as creative as some of the background music, but it's still a banger. The ED is alright, nothing special but it emphasizes the \"trust me, this isn't dark\" atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT [8/10] -- FINAL SCORE [8.8/10]\\n\\n\r\nSo maybe you're just a causal anime fan who is tired of the endless legions of Isekai and Idol shows, and you want something different. Or maybe you're a gamer like me who has always wanted to see an anime adaptation of hardcore-mode Terraria. Or maybe you're just an fan of interesting fantasy who was intrigued by one of the most original settings in all of anime and manga: that giant, gaping pit in the middle of an unknown sea, home to countless exotic and dangerous creatures and even more powerful artifacts just waiting to be found. Either way, you're going to end up in the Abyss. And that Abyss. Oh boy, does that Abyss suck you in. No matter what it is that initially appeals to you about this series, you'll be locked in a chokehold by the constant plot twists and the amazing atmosphere. You, just like Riko and Reg, are never going to come back. So go on, watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI dare you.",

            "content": "I understand this is very long, but all of it is just my genuine thoughts.\r\nThe entire anime was focused around the two main characters going through the abyss in search of an actual good plot, with tons of side characters who were bland, and added very little to the overall story. The main two characters them self were bland, and it seemed the writer just wanted lewd the 12 year old the entire time. The show was boring to watch up until episode 11 (out of 13), when they introduced two more side characters, which were actually rather fun to have in the show, andit was a nice change of pace. The final 3 episodes were not that bad. But having to struggle through the first 10 episodes of boring, uninteresting characters, and story really made me want to give up on it. Once the main characters come back into play, I instantly wanted to stop watching the show again. I found myself leaning back into my chair multiple times and almost falling asleep.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first saw this show, the first thing I saw that it was ranked at position 19 overall. This of course is a fantastic score, so I was expecting a lot from the show, and wanted to come in and have a wonderful time with it, only to be very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\nThe beginning was slow to begin, and as you go through it, it just gets slower, and slower, with nothing that would make you think they had an original idea of their own. There were one or two moments that make you think, \"hey this part might be kind of good.\" Only for it to last seven minutes, then go back into boring, non needed talking. They wanted to get story across at the beginning, but it took so long for them to even get them into any sort of action, or interesting plot points that I wanted to give up. We've seen the same dungeon crawling / moving up floors so many times it's nothing special, with almost nothing happening on some floors, and it still some how makes it feel like it took 3 episodes to get something done.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nThe visuals were alright in some parts, they had a couple wallpaper worthy scenes, but the majority of the animals, or monsters, seemed to looked pixel-ated, almost as if they did it in MS Paint, and then stuck it into 5 frames as it went across the screen. Overall the animation wasn't bad however. The art style is completely opinionated so I'll leave that out of the equation.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nThe sound was overall good, and the effects of the animals, and wilderness really did make you feel immersed into the environment. The opening wasn't bad, and the music changes flowed really well with the overall theme well, and it altered when it needed to. If I had to pick what the most redeeming quality of this show was, it's the sound. Until you get into more of the voice acting which I'll leave to character specifics.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nThe characters were almost all very obnoxious to listen to when their constant whining, or non stop high pitched squeals for the first half of the anime. We've seen all these types of characters before, the rebellious, and obnoxious kids, with overseers who are a complete non factor. There's almost nothing to say about the characters in the beginning because they all had the same personality, nothing. They had different roles to fill and after the first couple episodes didn't exist. When it comes to some of the more important side characters that they run into after go into the abyss, the first is Ouzen. A typical harsh teacher, who shows up only to add some more cliche plot points, and has probably the most painful voice to listen to throughout the whole series, it genuinely made me upset to have to listen to her speak, and then have screen time. And the voice actor is someone who has done good things, so I can't imagine it was entirely their fault. The only other time I was more upset to have to hear a voice, was  when you had to hear the main character talk after you see the only good characters of the show. The only good characters, who had any real personality was at the very end, the bunny. She was the most fun I had while watching the entire anime. Only to be ruined by the main character, and probably the only reason I'll be willing to give the second season a shot.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment/Overall-\\n\r\nI've never been more bored from watching such a highly rated anime. The entire time I was almost falling asleep. And it is no easy task to fall asleep in a dark room with a brightly lit monitor. I was begging for something interesting to happen the entire time and it never did. It had its moments of shine, where I could see potential in parts, only for it to be ruined by something you couldn't give less of a shit about. I was eager for each episode to finish so I could move closer to the end, and each one seemed to get longer and longer up until the very end, when it finally had some fun things introduced. But it is not worth watching, and enduring so much pain for a couple good scenes at the end. I could not consider this show good, or even close to a masterpiece. Thank you for spending the time to read this, hope I could save you.",

I just can't get past that part and it was too hard for me to suspend my disbelief constantly as required to go along with this plot. Multiple adults could and should have stopped them because, you know, they are 12 and still view the world through disney lenses. Riko is a moron.

She'll smell something or see a pretty color and go charging off straight at it without a care inthe world despite the numerous times she almost got herself killed doing just that. Meanwhile Reg seems fine letting her wander off on her whimsical flights of fancy while he stays motionless getting lost in his own thoughts. This formula manufactures all of the peril. While it does wind up going how you might think it would eventually, they get lucky far too many times. Nevermind that whole purpose for it is because stupid Riko has convinced herself she has to go save her badass mom ASAP immediately for some reason even though the note clearly says she can wait. Headaches and facepalms abound.\\n\\n\r\nIt's too bad because I was fascinated by the world they built and I wanted to learn more about it but they just give you a general idea of how things work before getting to the task at hand.

            "content": "Despair and hope. Both of these terms may seem opposite from one another, but they do come in contact when dealing with nearly impossible odds. Stories that involve coming back home from Homer\u2019s The Odyssey or go through a journey to accomplish an impossible task from J.R.R Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings have similar tones and themes. Despair involves the daunting odds of the protagonist(s) defeating the conflicts that arise that give us, the audience, a sense of dread and makes us care for our characters to succeed. Hope is the audience\u2019s reaction that they feel out of the despair that we see from thecharacters\u2019 perspective.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss fits this notion quite accurately. Although it may not seem that way in the first half at first, it slowly begins to bring in the dreaded atmosphere like a shotgun blast by the halfway point. Unlike many anime shows that have attempted to do this, Made in Abyss does it in a way that does not seem superficial. When an anime tries to do anything that is disturbing or serious and fails, it will either comes across as forceful get a cheap feeling of anxiety from the audience or sometimes it comes off so ridiculous that it becomes a comedy. Instead, Made in Abyss does this emotional reaction in a way that feels authentic. It is the perfect balance that still elicits a response that makes you care for the characters more and the struggles that they are facing.\\n\\n\r\nAs many people have pointed out previously about how this anime has a lot of throwbacks to Studio Ghibli films, most predominantly Miyazaki directed ones. You do not get that feeling from the character designs. They are chibi-ish \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 almost as if they are chibi characters with long limbs. However, I thought the Ghibli influence was very apparent with the world designs and backgrounds. They remind me of Castle in the Sky with the design of the city and the forested areas Regu and Riko travel in the Abyss. They are both beautifully drawn and renders very well with the animation despite being in an anime television budget.\\n\\n\r\nI think the one particular exceptional thing in the animation and design department is the designs of the actual monsters in the Abyss and the locality of Abyss itself. One obvious Ghibli influence that came to me when seeing the monsters were the creatures in Princess Mononoke. How they move and all of their unique body parts give them a distinct look that makes them both terrifying and fascinating to look at. What struck me about the Abyss itself was how it seemed. When you think the word \u201cabyss\u201d you usually think of a putrid dark place where not even light can escape from. In this, it seems like the complete opposite. It doesn\u2019t look like it yet it feels like an abyss with all of the creatures that inhabit. From looking at it from this angle, it gives us something to grasp about in how we should interpret what Hell is; not from a visual perspective but something within it. That in of itself makes the setting very creative and imaginative.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, what I can say about how Made in Abyss is from a story perspective, the 2nd half is where it starts to become something extraordinary from any anime in recent years. Now that is not to say the first half is bad by any measure. It just pales in comparison to the other that it might. I think what pushes it back from the other is how it drags from episode to episode. It does give us a great introduction to our two main heroes, Riko and Regu. We get a great glimpse on how they fit into the world and keeps us guessing how these two will pursue their journey. The other characters, however, do not garner the same sentiment. It\u2019s not that they are terrible characters, it just seems like they are not given enough leg work for us to remember them by the time our primary focus is Regu and Riko traversing the Abyss. Plus there are a bunch of side stories from episodes 1-3 involving these supporting characters that do not go anywhere and are brushed aside quickly after that. Again, not bad, it\u2019s just not great.\\n\\n\r\nNow the most significant story beat that I think is one of the most effective I\u2019ve ever seen involves a character way later in the show named Nanachi. His story arc involving his friend Mitty is masterful in the lightest way to put it. If his story were to be put on as its full spin-off and expand it, it would be one that I would whole-heartedly watch the moment it started airing. Needless to say it is tragic to see but that in turn gave Nanachi a level of sympathy to his character and we see him a completely different light than what his initial debut would\u2019ve implied.\\n\\n\r\nRegu and Riko both contribute the story through drama and comedy in a relatively nice pace. Along with Nanachi, we get to see them contemplate what the end goal of finding Riko\u2019s mother in the deepest level of the Abyss. It provides a deep layer of mystery that keeps you guessing on what they will find. The first arc they come across involving Ozen the Immovable is pretty good. Adds a horror element to it that is eerie when we are left with our heroes figuring out what to do with the circumstances they are faced. Regu and Riko\u2019s relationship as friends is heartwarming, and you genuinely care for both of them. Whenever either one is in danger, and the other is trying their best to help them, the show does a great job in creating a sense of urgency that keeps you glued to the screen on what is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss was an exceptional watch as someone who has watched anime regularly since 2007. Do I think this might be the best anime to have come out in recent memory? Well, we are just going to have to see how it plays out as the manga continues and how the next seasons will treat the source material for years to come. While some faults keep it from being perfect, especially in the first half, the things that are great about it are incredibly memorable that will make me continue to think about them for a while. Useful in its tragedy, outstanding in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-",

            "content": "Truth be told, I stopped watching the anime after the 6th episode and continued the rest by reading the manga because the anime had terrible pacing. The first few episodes had some glimmers of interesting things and ideas, but were obviously and painfully stretched out. After reading the manga it was pretty apparent why: the animators had to get at least 2 minutes per panel since the chapters were so short. Even so, any criticisms I have with the manga are identically with the anime since my gripes are mainly with the story, characters, and setting whereas I found the art and sound to bethe best parts of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nLet me preface this review by warning you of minor SPOILERS. \\n\\n\r\nThe most glaring and pressing issue that really took me out of this anime/manga was how readily Riko's friends allowed her and Reg to disappear into a LITERAL deathtrap. Riko had made her intentions explicitly clear that she wanted to go to the deepest parts of the Abyss in order to find her mother, which no person had EVER survived climbing out of. Not only do her teacher and Uncle both know about this... they actually allow and encourage it. Two very experienced divers who are extremely knowledgeable about the dangers of the Abyss and very acutely aware that Riko is a FUCKING 12-year-old girl with no special abilities along with a barely understood robot/cyborg thing that's supposed to act as a guardian. What the fuck is wrong with these people? They are sending off a child to a place of eldritch horror in which being torn limb from limb and eaten is one of the better deaths you could hope for. The only sensible friend that Riko has who opposes this is peer pressured into making up with Riko because he said that her mother is most likely dead. Which is almost certainly true and a sentiment that any person with a brain could agree with. \\n\\n\r\nThe second issue I have with the series is the world-building. And I'm not talking about the specifics of the Abyss, although there are plenty of problems there. The series takes no effort in implicitly establishing and reinforcing the idea that the people of Orth are Abyss diving experts and the fact that their daily lives revolves around this deadly Abyss. Most of the divers are dressed like they're going to the safari rather than diving into the literal pits of hells. I would have thought that the series would have incorporated some mountaineering and caving terms and concepts like bivouacking or belaying. This would make sense since they are literally climbing into a hole and climbing back out. But nope, I'd seen only one scene where a person climbs down with a rope and that was like a 10 foot drop. Why does nobody have any climbing equipment or even any rope on them? Riko gets carried down like the child she is by Reg's mechanical arms... so what about the rest of the cave divers? Riko and Reg also seem to have no equipment on them whatsoever. Reg carries the only backpack they thought to bring with them and in it has some cooking utensils and some change of clothes. Are these kids going to a fucking summer camp? In some scenes they are sleeping in the open. Why didn't they bring a tent with them? Wouldn't that make more sense than sleeping in the open with monsters all around? And why doesn't anyone seem to have any weapons? In the very first episode a giant flying shark shows up in an usually safe area almost kills Riko and her friend. Her teacher literally gave no fucks about that and told them to be more careful. None of the cave divers, apart from the elite White Whistles, carry any form of self-defense or seem to be strong enough to take on even the weakest of enemies. This just breaks my immersion far too much. This is like trying to explore the Marina Trench with some kiddie floats. \\n\\n\r\nThese are the main problems I had with the anime before I broke off of watching it. It's not a matter of wanting to see more action or guns, it's a matter of tonal consistency. If the kids were going to a summer camp, this anime would fit it perfectly. The people of this world (with the exception of White Whistles) do not look, feel, or talk like they live next to a gaping Abyss of horror and madness. They let Riko go off as though she's just going to the playground by herself for the very first time. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on with the issues I found with the story and characters, but you could find those with other reviews. This show and manga are both highly overrated and complete trash in my objective opinion.        \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: this review is for my own personal use only. i've noticed after a while, i forget why i rated a show highly or poorly, so i'm going to write reviews after completing each series so i can reference them in the future.\r\nFUUUUUUUUCK. I'M SO FUCKING MAD RIGHT NOW. I SPENT AN HOUR FORMULATING MY THOUGHTS AND WRITING IT ALL DOWN HERE JUST TO CTRL+W THE WRONG TAB AND DELETE EVERYTHING. FUUUUUCK.\r\nso I\u2019m going to attempt to rewrite everything from memory. I had it all laid out and everything. this is going to be worse than what I wrote earlier (because I just don\u2019t havethe drive anymore) and I\u2019m invariably going to forget some things, so bare with me future me.\\n\\n\r\nI had high expectations coming into made in abyss (it is #20 on MAL afterall) and for the first 3/4s of the show, it felt really underwhelming. it felt like your typical light-hearted adventure shounen, and I thought to myself, \u201cif this is all this show has to offer, then it\u2019s a 7 at best\u201d. but as the first major thing happened at episode 10 of 13, I began to realize why it was so highly rated. but even so, the show had many glaring faults that I almost rated this an 8. but this show does some things exceedingly well that I think it just barely deserves a 9.\\n\\n\r\n~~~\\n\\n\r\nbut before I get in to all of that, let me first talk about all the little things.\\n\\n\r\nfor starters, the world-building was fantastic. the world felt imaginative and wonderful and wholly unique \u2013 something we just don\u2019t see nowadays. I honestly felt like I was watching lord of the rings for the first time again. but the world didn\u2019t really feel real to me. I know that sounds weird but, it just doesn\u2019t feel lived in. I don\u2019t know how to explain this too well, but I\u2019ll try my best. the things in this world feel like they exist just for the story and nothing else. it lacks the details that are there solely to expand the world. for example, the desks in the classroom of the orphanage are arranged vertically against the wall. the creators could\u2019ve set it up traditionally (like in our world) and no one would\u2019ve batted an eye. but instead they chose to do it in this unique way for seemingly no reason. it just adds a bit more depth to the world (and as a bonus, reflects the verticality of the abyss). but we don\u2019t see this happen again. a lot of the creatures have purpose in the story whether it be attacking the main characters or helping them out. none of them exist just to expand the world. the creators even miss some great opportunities to shove more depth creating choices in. like when nanachi fishes, she uses a regular fishing rod we\u2019re accustomed to seeing. they could\u2019ve replaced that with an artifact or some home-made tool created from scavenged parts. that would\u2019ve made it feel more real, but instead they chose to use a regular ol\u2019 fishing rod.\\n\\n\r\nI really disliked the amnesia clich\u00e9. it\u2019s not that I hated the use of it, but more like I hate how they used it. it\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen a dozen times and this show doesn\u2019t attempt to stand out at all. it\u2019s the same old thing. have your character forget everything that happened before x event, then every once in a while drop a whisper that seemingly comes from nowhere or a flashback in the middle of a conversation or an illusion that appears at a crucial moment and have your character respond with \u201cwhat was that?\u201d or \u201cthis feels familiar\u201d or \u201cI remember something\u201d. this is really lazy writing. it means the author can just slow or excel the plot just by having the character experience a flashback. they can also just introduce whatever information they need or have their character gain life-saving knowledge out of nowhere just by writing in an amnesia episode. to be fair though, it did draw me in and get me to wonder exactly what the relationship is with regu and riko\u2019s mother, but it\u2019s a cheap way of getting your audience interested. \\n\\n\r\nthe show also delivered all of its information through exposition which felt a bit tired. every time something needed to be explained, it had to be one character explaining it to another. like when nanachi was explaining how the curses work. I would\u2019ve been fine with \u201cit gets weaker the farther you are from the center\u201d, but instead they felt the need to overly explain this topic and present it to us in exposition. these moments also feel really out of place. it just feels so abrupt like, \u201chey kids, are you ready? cause it\u2019s explaining time!\u201d. it just doesn\u2019t flow at all. honestly, leaving the mechanics of this world a mystery gives it its charm. \\n\\n\r\nspeaking of mechanics, I hate how it only works when it\u2019s convenient to the plot. the one rule the world sets up is \u201cif you ascend, then you\u2019ll suffer the curse of your level\u201d. but it\u2019s really vague about it. for instance riko walks up a pretty mild incline (it\u2019s honestly not any worse than a ramp for wheelchairs) and suffers from nausea and delusions. but when regu grabs riko and jumps, an act that requires you to gain height, riko is seemingly unaffected. or when riko goes from lying down to standing up, shouldn\u2019t she feel the effects? because that small hill couldn\u2019t have been any taller than 5 feet. also, when she reaches the top of that hill, she recovers from her symptons nearly instantly. but when she\u2019s being pulled upward by regu after retreating from the spike monster, she doesn\u2019t feel anything during the ascension (like earlier), but instead feels it only AFTER they\u2019ve stopped ascending. it really doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. regu also later gets worried that riko will feel the affects when they come across what looks to be such a tiny incline that I can\u2019t be any bigger than 2 feet. it\u2019s very confusing. I know this is just a minor quip, but it really breaks my immersion.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m also very annoyed at the show\u2019s sexual tendencies. I really don\u2019t want to think about this little boy popping a boner and I definitely don\u2019t want to constantly be shown this 12 year old girl\u2019s naked body. and I could really do without regu constantly blushing over riko\u2019s nakedness. it doesn\u2019t really add anything to our story or the relationships between our characters. it feels really awkward. also what\u2019s with this show\u2019s obsession with pee? riko pisses herself like 5 times for no reason.\\n\\n\r\n~~~\\n\\n\r\nwith that out of the way, I want to move on to the bigger portions of the show.\\n\\n\r\nlet\u2019s start with the main characters. I appreciate that the two really compliment each other. with riko having great mental fortitude (her drive to always strive forward toward her mother), but being physically weak while regu has great power, but is mentally inadequate. and for the most part, the characters are alright. they don\u2019t really change all that much though, but that\u2019s forgiveable since it\u2019s not a complete story yet. the one thing that bugged me was when regu broke character. regu was set up as a character who didn\u2019t have the guts to do what needed to be done and instead chose to cry. he couldn\u2019t steel himself to amputate riko and without her, he\u2019s really quite hopeless. but when he was ordered to kill mitty, he did it almost without hesitation. yes, it did take a while to warm up to the idea, but I feel like it would\u2019ve been more in-line with his character if he just couldn\u2019t muster up the strength to actually do it. if he had aimed his arm, gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and then\u2026 just couldn\u2019t do it. and then if nanachi had to come up and yell at him and push him before he finally did it. that would\u2019ve fit his character more.\\n\\n\r\nthe thing that really sells this show, though, is its atmosphere and how it uses it. it looks and feels like your run of the mill light-hearted adventure shounen. it shows you the end goal right at the start, it shows you a bunch of \u201cbosses\u201d in the form of white whistles, and even has the OP power with severe drawback. but this upbeat tone hides a really melancholy tale. the story follows an orphan living in a world where it\u2019s normal to be an orphan. she decides at the age of 12 to essentially commit suicide to find her mother. she embarks on a journey from which she knows she can never return, because doing so could mean a fate worse than death. and the farther and farther she goes, the worse and worse it gets. and yet, it still manages to keep that happy atmosphere. and it brilliantly uses that to contrast those gruesome moments to further accentuate the pain. I\u2019m of course talking about riko\u2019s near amputation and mitty\u2019s mercy-killing.\\n\\n\r\nwhen riko was lifted up by regu to escape the porcupine beast, I began to lose it. having to watch this kid bleed relentlessly was hard to stomach. and then regu had to break her arm and try to cut off her hand. god. that slow, gnawing, dull motion of the knife shook me to my core. it wasn\u2019t just a clean chop with a cut to black. no. it was one slice after another. it really made me feel like I was going to throw up. I couldn\u2019t even watch it properly. I ended up watching through my fingers like a little kid watching a scary movie.\\n\\n\r\nbut mitty\u2019s death was different. it didn\u2019t hit us instantly like with riko, we were given time to mull it over ourselves. we\u2019re pretty much told she\u2019s going to die and then spends a healthy amount of time getting us to become attached to her. then when it became time, I couldn\u2019t help but shed tears. but it wasn\u2019t her death that really hit me. it was her transformation. the distorting of the body and her pleas to die. god those pleas. that will haunt me. even after that, mitty\u2019s suspended state of living was just so sorrowful. I mean she responds to her name and acts of her own volition, but they\u2019re merely reflex. it\u2019s not actually her. and yet, you know she\u2019s trapped in there somewhere. god. can you imagine the pain of having your most dear treasure, but not actually having it? the pain I felt from this was dull compared to riko\u2019s near amputation. if I had to compare them, I\u2019d say riko\u2019s event was akin to a blade, it was fast and hurt physically. but mitty\u2019s was like cancer: it\u2019s slow and you know it\u2019s coming, but it hurts you spiritually.\\n\\n\r\nthese two moments alone are what made me think this show just barely deserves a 9. I haven\u2019t seen such good contrast between light-hearted and dark despair since madoka magica. it hits you like a bus and they left such a strong impression on me. I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t forget this for as long as I watch anime.\\n\\n\r\nto switch gears here, I\u2019m disappointed that the show didn\u2019t have the guts to permanently damage their characters. I would\u2019ve loved to see riko get her arm amputated. not because I\u2019m a sick fuck like that, but because it could serve as a character defining point. it would strengthen her resolve and determination, showing that she\u2019s willing to make the big sacrifices to reach her goal. now I know you\u2019d say \u201cbut she has a scar, that\u2019s permanent damage\u201d, but it just doesn\u2019t leave as strong an impact and they didn\u2019t really play with it. it didn\u2019t do anything for her character. and now the writers have more laziness they\u2019ve worked in. I can guarantee that whether or not this hand will work or when it hurts is going to be purely up to plot convenience. do we need riko to hold on to something and create suspense? have her hand lose strength because she\u2019s not fully healed. and when it becomes too bothersome to work with a gimped arm, all they have to do is write in a small time skip and have her say \u201cmy arm\u2019s feeling a lot better now\u201d. it bothers me that I see this.\\n\\n\r\n~~~\\n\\n\r\nhonestly, I\u2019m still debating whether this show deserves an 8 or 9. it does what it does very well, but it has some very glaring flaws. and the unfinished story doesn\u2019t help either. I can\u2019t really judge the story because of it. but if I\u2019m going to be honest, I don\u2019t think this show is going to get better, in fact, I think it\u2019s going to get worse. if the show relies on its shock factor, it\u2019s going to get really old really quick. soon I\u2019ll just roll my eyes as another tragedy unfolds. and the current adventure style story they\u2019ve set up doesn\u2019t seem all that special either. it\u2019s just so cookie-cutter. and I\u2019m willing to bet the ending of the story hasn\u2019t yet been thought up so the writer will end up rushing it at the end and we\u2019ll be left with an unsatisfying conclusion. who knows.\\n",

            "content": "Made in Abyss at first glance seems like your typical kids show because of its cute, super deformed, cheerful characters. However, under its front Made in Abyss is a much more dark and serious anime. \r\nStory (10/10)\r\nThe story is excellent. It first starts off with your regular young orphan mc who is excited to get out and explore the world. She and her companion decide to travel together. These two innocent kids are put into a dangerous new world where they try to survive their encounters with vicious monsters and spooky dawn papas as they come closer to achieving their goal. It's very exciting.\r\nArt (9/10)\r\nOverallthe art looks amazing to me. The backgrounds are beautiful and breathtaking, the character designs are charming and cute, the creatures are designed very creatively, and the whole abyss' layout is made with interesting and unique landscapes that still make sense with the story. The only bad thing is that  animation quality tends to drop a bit in some episodes, but this is a problem almost every anime has.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music of this anime is fantastic. It matches and enhances the mood with every scene. The voice acting is also great. The main characters voices suit their age, and aren't annoyingly high pitch like some characters' voices are.\\n\r\nOp and ed sound very nice too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nThe main characters act their age and aren't that dumb.   :v\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this show. The only thing i don't really like is how slow paced it is. Certain scenes from like 2 episodes so far seemed a bit boring since they showed one frame for a bit too long, but it's nothing really bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.5/10)\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is definitely this season's best anime (... wait does owari 2 count as this season), and I love it so much since it is so unique. The story is engaging and emotional, the artwork and music are breathtaking, and you get some lolis. What more could you ask for\\n\\n\r\nToo bad they didn't show \"certain scenes\" from the manga in the anime tho   :^)",

            "content": "-----Personal Opinion------- (spoilers)\r\nI went to this show completely blind, I did not know anything about it beside it's title. At first glance I already knew that this wasn't going to be a heartwarming children adventure anime, it was a mere hunch that told me so. I was correct but I did not expect it to be this dark and twisted, and because of that Made In Abyss became my favorite anime of all time.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nA story involving children adventuring through the mysterious and cruel abyss, the story honestly couldn't get any better. When the episode showed the full picture of the abyss, I just couldn'tsay anything but \"wow\". That single view alone told me so much about the story just by looking at it and it's honestly an experience I wish to experience again for the first time. \\n\\n\r\nOur two protagonists, Riko and Reg began meeting the first time on an accidental encounter inside the first layer of the abyss, they became the best of friends after some time and decided to venture into abyss with each of them looking to accomplish their separate goals while protecting each other along the way. Already, this anime displays the dire need of survival brilliantly, as the abyss is the most merciless entity in the anime, large creatures dominating every layer, while humanity remain next to powerless once they're inside, this creates a visible stake, a stake that is inevitable for our protagonists to avoid. Riko getting poisoned and barely hanging by a thread was a very powerful event in the anime, it shows how weak and powerless our protagonists are in the grand scheme of things, Reg despite doing everything that he can still could not do a thing to save Riko, and that's where Nanachi, a great fucking character came in to save the day, nanachi opened another path to the story, a very dark path if I do say so myself. Mitty and Bondrewd were characters introduced upon opening that path, with each serving a different purpose than the other. Bondrewd being a cruel and a psycho (not sure how to accurately describe his traits), who won't stop until he gets what he wants is an amazing addition to the story, showcases that it's not just the abyss thats the challenge for our MC's. Finally Mitty's backstory and death just broke my heart to pieces, it's the first scene to make me cry on a 13 episodes Anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nNot much to say, just the first episode alone was enough to convince me that everyone on the production company was very passionate about the project. Everything about the art style was just pleasing to watch, it fits the Anime on every aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nGlorious, the music accompanying each scenes were perfect, with my favorite being the scene where the sun rises and shines upon Orth, the music selection could not be more perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are great but they lack signatures, I can't say it's 10/10 because, after a while, the characters in this anime probably won't stick around in your mind like for example Edward Elric from FMAB and Killua from HxH do.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nFinished the entire thing within 6 hours, that's probably a good way to potray my enjoyment towards it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10, I wish that this anime would get a sequel in the form of a TV series rather than a movie, because I don't think a 2 hours movie would fit the next upcoming arc of the manga completely, still though, id be watching it as I'm a big fan of this series.\\n",

            "content": "It's all my stupid opinion no more and there are no spoilers. Well... Imperfectly perfect, these words describe \"Made in Abyss\". I can surely recommend to watch, anyway it's better than last titles. \r\nAdvantages:\r\n1) Indirect and interesting plot. Story 7/10\r\nThere are a little moments, which I know exactly, what gonna happened next, but the biggest part of plot, that I couldn't predict and it a big point to \"Made in Abyss\".\r\n2)  Art 8/10\r\nI think, a such drawing style perfectly suited to composition of anime, If don't count a \"cruel moments\" \r\n3) Characters 5/10\r\nRiko and Rego. About Riko, on the one hand, she is ajust immature a kid, who have a dream become the White Whistles, as well as her mother was/is, but on the other hand, she a clever and some way mature girl, and I think it a contradiction. I'm do not like this character. Conversely situation, with Rego a lot a mysteries around him, simply, we don't know what is it, and it's a interesting character I like him and he makes a plot more interested and amazing. His skills, his appearance  \u2014 it's so cool. I'm like a kid.\\n\r\n4) Music 10/10\\n\r\nWith a art and amazing fantasy world these music make me feel something unusual inside, like women/girls feels butterflies in stomach. Amazing, I expect with impatience a music pack. \\n\\n\r\nDisadvantages: \\n\\n\r\n1) Stupid and unserious different moves and moments which inappropriate. No comments, because a spoiler \\n\r\n2) A attempt to combine a fairy tale and cruelty, serious world\\n\r\nNo more comments, because a spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nMy assessment 6/10",

From the looks of it, people will assume that this is a kid show because of the art style (Me included). But, so far into the series and I gotta admit, I was wrong. What makes this show great is not the character style but the story. The story is different from the rest of fantasy anime where they throw you an overpowered Main Character and Fairytale-ish world, here they gave you two children (well, one of them is overpoweredbut he's the Megumin of Made in Abyss) traversing an unknown and mysterious realm by themselves. The art is great (The landscape is absolutely stunning) and the sound.... man, even the background music that only goes on for 30 seconds could get stuck in your brain. That's how the great the soundtrack for this anime. The character is not some overpowered character instead they are flawed and this what makes it even more interesting. They overcome their flaw every time somehow. The set of the anime, The Abyss, will leave you wondering every time you saw it. \"What is it?\" or \"What lies in the deepest reach of it?\". Question like that will appear when you watch it\\n\\n\r\nThis show is great and managed to not follow the usual tropes for a fantasy anime. Overall, it's great",

            "content": "So I dont fucking know why this anime is praised so much when it honestly doesnt deserve it, not only was it boring and just didnt make sense, I was also greeted with a pleasant view of 5 yr old tits. Oh did I say pleasant, I meant UN-pleasant.\r\nBefore getting into the core of this review and the reason why this show is so overrated, ill go over the story, concept etc. and if you should watch it. Also this review is just my opinion and will hopefully give you a different perspective on this overrated piece of .. Ill get to that later.\r\nIf yourejust here for the question \"Should I watch it?\" Heres your answer : Yeah I guess, even though I talk alot of shit it does have its strong points but be prepared to see 5yr old fanservice... and retarded story, dw tho you wont notice it because of the brainwashing this show does. Okay ill cover some of its strong points first then.\\n\r\n1. Art - The show does have some beautiful shots here and there and paired with a good soundtrack and concept alot of people are blinded by these things and will overlook any flaw this series has which brings me to my next 2 points \\n\r\n2. Sound - As I said, its good and fits with the art and concept.\\n\r\n3. Concept - The concept is damn good .. at manipulating the viewer (more about it later)\\n\r\n4. Story - Its boring and does not make any sense (again more about the negative things later, this is just to give a quick review.)\\n\r\n5. Characters - They are really young which is fine, but in this case this is just used to manipulate the viewer even more and its just pedo heaven really, like who asked for naked scenes, even ecchi shows dont do that.\\n\\n\r\nWell you might have wondered why I started this review with \"I dont understand why its praised\" and then bring out several points as to why i think its shit, but well actually I do, its what this review mostly covers, that sentence served as more of a point that it isnt good. So lets start with really the heart of this review.\\n\r\nFirstly this anime uses the failure of harem fantasy shows like the smartphone one from not too long ago to manipulate you. Let me explain - people are so tired of shitty harems in a fantasy setting that theyll praise anything that ISNT a harem in a fucking fantasy setting, people will also watch anything that doesnt have some plain looking dude with a bunch of girls in the thumbnail and the because of this its massively overrated. It doesnt actually have to be good, it just needs to not be a harem in a fantasy world. Now you could argue that this is just basics of a really good anime and it isnt using the fantasy shows to boost its ratings, it just does things right. It doesnt work like that, there is no \"fantasy with no harem > fantasy with harem\" rule and while there are certain guidelines to making a good anime, its not uncommon to see a good show that doesnt follow those guidelines at all, but I havent actually talked about what makes this show actually shit, I mean overrated-ness doesnt make it bad so heres what does, the story.\\n\r\nNow firstly I know that every question can be answered with \"kids\" Why send toddlers to the abyss where its filled with monsters? Kids, kids like that and I understand that im not here to critizise the kids for watching this anime as its meant for them with the whole exploration element and whatnot, but the insanely high rating doesnt come from kids who dont really care if the story is flawed, so why do people like Gigguk praise it like its the second coming of christ and make these cringy clips trying to get you to watch it? Well our standards for a good fantasy show have fallen so low that even this shit is now \"one of the best picks of the year.\" Its like a good story isnt needed for a non-harem fantasy and it gets a pass in everything as long as children are involved, but actually its alot worse than even those harems ive been talking about, because not only is there nudity in this anime, it is also of a 5yr old girl GREAT VALUE FANSERVICE RIGHT THERE BTW which shatteres the whole image of it being \"not like a fantasy harem show.\" I  can make an anime about anything really and itll be praised to shit as long as it has good art, music, a good concept, young extremely young characters to get the pedos and a fantasy concept with no harem. Oh and the exploration element and cant forget the great absolute fantastic value fanservice which definetly sets it apart from any ecchi shows since none of those are of realky really young girls. I mean thats what this anime basically is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall our standards for good fantasy anime are rock bottom caused by the waves and waves of light novel adaptasions and you dont need a good story or anything really as long as you got good art, concept, music and the benefit of not being a fantasy harem.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe disappearance of Lyza, Riko's mother, what starts the real story, feels poor and an excuse for a mystery, as it's simply vague. We already expected the Abyss to hide something important at the bottom and knew that Riko \"wanted\" to go there, it'd be more original if she had just gone with flow, especially after Reg came up. Even for her, \"searching for my mother\" seems to be a convenient reason for rushing into the Abyss, since she's not once shown anxious about Lyza's situation after getting in there. Either she is in complete denial or is a shallow character.\r\nPrior to Nanachi's appearance, nearthe end, the show isn't really telling us anything, it's just the author taking us into a tour through the world he's created and making Riko narrate how fascinating it is.\\n\r\nThe Abyss does hold some interesting concepts, however, even if they are only zoomed in by the end of the anime. \\n\r\nI thoroughly believe that the planet in which the anime takes place isn't Earth, but we're given almost zero information about the world apart from the Abyss and the orphanage; not even Riko's hometown is well-explored (at least the area around the orphanage seems poor, but how come?).\\n\r\nMade in Abyss would work better as an open world game, that doesn't need a strong campaign because the exploration makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacters are eccentric and have got an eccentric culture that allows children's mentors to tie them up naked to the ceiling and leave them hanging. That arguably makes sense, given the society they live in, made up of people that engage in the Abyss (keeping in mind that it has a curse that can mess with people's head) or are religiously terrified/fascinated by it. Still, that trait creates distance between them and the audience, including me; personally, their reasons feel hard to understand. Also, I believe the author resorts too much to the Abyss for making sense of things, including the characters; it's basically the only thing that matters in that world and that strikes me as pretentious. \\n\r\nRiko is childish enough, what makes sense (although sometimes I feel she's only depicted that way to attract lolicons, for example, when she pees herself out of fear). On the other hand, she's basically an encyclopedia (though she's shown fast asleep during classes at the very beginning of the series) and cooks very well. Those traits are supposed to balance the duo's skills, with Reg's focused on acrobatics and offensive and hers on subsistence and tactics (?), but that's exactly why they feel artificial. Besides, she's done no preparation before jumping foolishly in the Abyss, so I'm not convinced she could have acquired all that knowledge.\\n\r\nSomething that is unconceivable to me despite every explanation is that, after a very traumatizing experience, Riko bounces back to her normal high spirits in the blink of an eye, only after a single round of crying. That's made me wonder if the girl is seriously bipolar or broken. Nothing got to her core, if so, only for a fraction of a second (it's seriously creepy). A time-skip seemed to follow every acclaimed awful circumstance she faced, because, after those, it was like nothing had even happened. \\n\r\nReg is more cautious and cogitative but also seems to leave his suspicions aside easily. For whatever it's worth, though, he's adorable.\\n\r\nTheir relationship is cute, but the author forces that, by making Riko appear naked in front of him and Reg's genitals being made a conversation topic more than once. Besides, I understand Reg's attachment to Riko, for her being the first human he came in contact with after losing his memory, but Riko's overly fond of him for such short time, while barely gets homesick or mentions her friends back at the orphanage.\\n\r\nOuzen's tonic eccentricity, although a little too out there, would've made her authentic if it weren't for the clich\u00e9 backstory aligned to it.\\n\r\nTo sum it up, before Nanachi, I don't see much character growth, except for Reg being more attentive into how to protect Riko, but that's a shallow resolution by itself.\\n\r\nNanachi, on the other hand, has a little more build-up, with internal conflicts and notably human feelings. She may be seen as part of the tsundere troupe and her (again fully-connected to the Abyss) tragic past may turn easier to simulate depth, but I found her character a plus on the story.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment:\\n\r\nThe author inserts immensely adverse situations and makes their progress natural. Thinking back, though, some things may have been solely for shock value.\\n\r\nThe pace is slow and a great deal of screen time is wasted on trivial interactions with characters that aren't going to be treated as relevant for long and don't really help with the main characters' personal development (at least noticeably), especially since important raised topics are easily left aside by the last ones.\\n\\n\r\nSound and animation:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is remarkable and fitting, making fights thrilling and emphasizing the drama, as well as the voice acting, that in several occasions made me shiver as I felt the characters' despair. \\n\r\nAnimation made character's movements smooth, I enjoyed it. Also, the color pallete is really nice. The backgrounds were beautiful as well.\\n\\n\r\nFinal comments:\\n\r\nI'd give this a 4, but I considered that the sexualization, which I dislike, being a problem is a matter of audience, so I figure it was just not aimed at me.\\n\r\nIn spite of everything, I enjoyed the last double episode, that told us a little more about the society and added to the plot that so far could've been summarized in \"must go down\", \"mean Abyss beautiful\" and \"'what am I?', says Reg\". Therefore, it could be that some major issues I had were fault of the anime, for taking too long on meaningless parts and delaying the real story. After all, the ending was satisfying, leaving room for a villain to show up. Therefore, I'm willing to give the second season a shot.",

All the ambiance is so well made, the immersion that anime cause is such a wonderful pleasant thing. The story is extremely creative and very well thought out, instigates every feeling from you... curiosity, anxiety, excitement, tension... It's a fantastically creative and extremely well-written story.\r\nThe soundtrack is also amazing and works perfectly for every moment. At first I found the design of the characters a littleweird, the proportion of the hands in relation to the body were very different and this is a bit strange. You can ignore it without problems, but , it bothered me a little in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing in the story that bother me a little is I guess the story might have explored a bit more at every \"level\" of the abyss. It is not that it was short or too fast, it could just have explored it a little bit more.

            "content": "\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30d3\u30b9 - Made in Abyss is a tale that walks on the traces of outstanding stories based on the novels of the French author Jules-Gabriel Verne.  I started writing the review, and then it almost went by itself. I suggest you to catch a glimpse of the anime, you'll discover a beautiful and breathtaking story - a truly inspiring mix of fantasy, mystery and steam punk elements with some really touching dramas.\r\nThere are many similarities with the novel \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\", but above all, what makes this story so exciting and unique? The major dynamics of the awakened feelings inthe viewer, such as the desire to simply stand up and walk with them, paired with a pure urge to adventure, an emotionality that captures you when you look at the anime. The plot has the same quality when it comes to creating an extraordinary journey, filled with fantasy creatures and twists, but also with ups and downs, like reading Jules Verne's novel \"Around the World in Eighty Days\".  The story progresses smoothly and explains itself successfully, so it is not necessary to go into too much detail and spoil the fun of discovering it yourself. So much I can say: The abyss is a huge hole and around its edge Rico's hometown of Orth spreads out. The cave raiders, who have already explored the abyss a little, have drawn a preliminary map of the caves. The riders have certain ranks (red, blue, black and white) which are indicated by a coloured whistle. The colour is a regulation of how deep the hunter can penetrate into the cave, otherwise it could cause serious damage to health through the so-called \"Curse of the Abyss\".\\n\r\nThe cast is well portrayed, even though the screen time is mostly allocated to the two main characters.  But through thought and conversation, reading between the lines, you can learn a lot about the mind and emotional background of all characters.\\n\\n\r\n*The description of the characters does may contain spoilers, so it might be better to watch the anime first.*\\n\\n\r\nRiko:\\n\r\nWhat a lovely, cheeky little orphan girl full of heart, adventurous, brave, but on the other hand a real girl who is also afraid of some things. Refreshingly, she is not so girlish that she screams \"don't look at me\" just because she is occasionally without clothes.\\n\r\nReg:\\n\r\nA mysterious but really lovable companion, a little naive and affectionate to Riko, obviously because of her very charming, engaging and captivating nature. His robot skills will be very useful for the upcoming adventure. An amnesia covers his memories and feelings, but there is kindling a fire deep in his soul, but it needs Riko to generate sparks that cause an ignition. A beautifully told story about the mutual friendship that grows during the adventure.\\n\r\nJiruo:\\n\r\nThe young assistant teacher in Belchero, the orphanage where Riko and the other orphans live. He is commonly called Leader and appears strict to conceal his kindness and compassionate manner he watches over the little orphans.\\n\r\nOzen:\\n\r\nWow, what a lady! The immovable, which is to be understood literally. Give her a chance and try to overcome your first impression.\\n\r\nMarulk:\\n\r\nThe cutie of the cave and (IMHO) she offers one of the most touching scenarios of the show.\\n\r\nNanachi:\\n\r\nInhumanly exposed to the curse, Nanachi became partly inhuman and a little mysterious. These three meet at a dramatic and critical turning point where you will be curious as to how this adventure continues.\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler alert end*\\n\\n\r\nThe Art by Kinema Citrus is stunning, even though the character sketches are a bit simple, but I like the design because it is appropriate and has the nostalgic touch of being drawn by hand. On the other hand, the backgrounds, the city and the surrounding area are a pleasure. The flora and fauna in the anime is impressive, with many details, different species and nature varies greatly the deeper our two cavern riders descend into the huge hole.The animation is quite well done, I can't remember seeing any movement that was out of place. The adaptation of Tsukushi Akihito Original Manga is (IMHO) faithful, close to the production standard for a film, the visuals as a whole are strikingly appealing and appear as eye candy.\\n\r\nThe BGM leaves me breathless, the composer Kevin Penkin has done an excellent job to accentuate the show. The soundtrack merges with the beautiful artwork to create a magnificent audiovisual aesthetic.\\n\r\nThe OP \"Deep in Abyss\" was performed by Tomita Miyu (Seiy\u016b: Riko) and Ise Mariya (Seiy\u016b: Reg), and when Nanachi entered the stage (Ep. 10-12) her Seiy\u016b: Izawa Shiori joined the singing of the OP. \\n\r\nThe opening is not bad, but not outstanding either. It's cute, it does its job, but in terms of the gorgeous soundtrack it appears more like business as usual.\\n\r\nThe ED \"Tabi no Hidarite, Saihate no Migite\" composed by Hashimoto Yukari and performed by the Seiy\u016b, a little too childlike to please me. It's beautiful, but made for children to sing along.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the synchronization leaves no room for further desires, it brought the characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Made in Abyss as almost an masterpiece, and definitely be well worth your time. It's nice to see that besides Studio Ghibli there are other companies whose products can influence me so much. I'm looking forward to the next season.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun watching!\\n\\n",

            "content": "The following review contains a few spoilers.\r\nI would like as many people that love this anime to read this review as possible, because this is not a favourable review, at all. Crazily enough, this review has nothing to do with the sexualisation of children, considering that seems to be the main gripe I find when trying to find other reviews that share my views on the show. Personally, I think it is ignorant to dismiss a show just because it might show a naked kid or something along those lines.\r\nThe following review will be based on my initial reactions that I typed to my friendon Discord who rated it very highly (10/10, like most). Despite that, I tried my hardest not to let my friend's recommendation or the fact that this show (at the time) was nominated for so many awards affect my opinion or get my hopes up. I'll try to keep some sort of structure but I'm not gonna separate this into \"Story\", \"Art\", etc.\\n\\n\r\nBefore episode 12-13, I'd describe Made in Abyss (Abyss) as 'interesting, yet boring'. I watched all of Clannad, for example, because I just couldn't tear my eyes away from it, despite the incredibly cheesy beginning. Same goes for literally any other drama/slice-of-life/whatever-isn't-shonen anime that I've watched. I sat through the boring ordeal that was Made in Abyss because I heard good things from my friend and it was nominated for loads of awards. If I just stumbled across it and decided to watch it, I wouldn't have gotten past the trial period (3 episodes). As I was watching, and the main duo were doing their thing, I was wondering what the fuck the adventuring had to do with the plot. I didn't know if the adventure was meant to be a bit of fun that doesn't directly tie in to the main plot but when you've got very pressing issues, and you know how long the trek is, watching the anime take its time down the abyss is excruciatingly painful. My friend said that episodes 1-3 could have been done better, and I agree, but that doesn't matter because I don't think it really got better until the very end, anyway. It's not like a slow build-up of character development, it's just boring. By the time they got into the abyss, and during the time in which they were actually in the abyss, I couldn't give two fucking shits what was it in. I was more interested in the characters that they'd, potentially, meet in there. There were so many 'Whistles' that could have crossed their path but they just didn't. So episodes 1-3 didn't even work for me, in the hype regard, because they hyped the wrong thing (dangerous White Whistles) that didn't appear as often as the other things (monsters).\\n\\n\r\nNow, to preface the following qualm, I have literally no clue about how objectively good the art/animation is in this anime (or any anime). I usually just assume that art and animation choice is a case of design over budget, most the time, so I don't pay attention. With that in-mind, it could have definitely been way worse, but I hate the character design. Their faces look like humans fused with a bit of of the Dango family. I don't doubt the quality but the actual design really isn't for me and I don't understand how others can stand this kind of character design, either. Very popular anime that I have watched before like Bleach is not noted for its amazing animation but I think the characters and art of Bleach is better Abyss's, only because Bleach's character and animation design looks cool and sharp. Looking at the Dango blobs which are the faces of our protagonists isn't very appealing to me, nor does it suck me in to the world it's trying to create. That's just the subjective opinion of one guy, tho. The art isn't my main gripe.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about it was how tacked on the Mitty storyline was/felt. Such a dramatic story that I'm sure I would have cried about if they spent an entire episode making us connect more with Mitty and the one I can't remember the name of and all their motivation, rather than spending 1 entire episode (I think it was episode 9), which is completely skippable considering it's just the main duo fucking around with monsters, doing stuff with no real affect on the plot. I do understand that the Mitty moment was actually only there to introduce us to two main characters, rabbit girl and the mad scientist. I just feel like the transition could have been dealt with much better, especially considering that this storyline was another thing which distracted from the main goal/aim of the protagonists, saving the girl's mother. In the first arc of Bleach, Ichigo is constantly reminding himself and the viewer that he is trying to save Rukia and literally everything he does is to that end. In Abyss, I can't help but think the \"trying to save mom\" storyline is just a reason to go in the Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nI did think to myself, halfway through, how good the Abyss idea would have been in the hands of the original Dragon Ball, considering that was a show based on exploration, making stuff you met on the way seem interesting. In Dragon Ball, the journey is, clearly, the main aspect, so trawling through the different levels of the Abyss could seem exciting, with excitement and trepidation galore for every level you went down. With Made in Abyss, it felt like the destination and mystery behind the destination was way more important than the journey, so I just found myself saying \"get the fuck down there, already\". As I said, watching the anime take its time with that was painful.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big issue I have with this anime was the symbolism, or lack thereof. There seemed to be seeds being planted everywhere that implied things going on in the bigger picture. For example, you had that artifact the MC had which was pointing to the bottom of the abyss. You had the whole strict orphanage set-up, even going so far as to show you what happens to the MC when she gets in trouble. However, none of these things come to a front. I imagine they will be addressed in future series and may already be explained in the manga but, for now, in a 13-episode series, the symbolism was another thing which just made this show drag on and made me think I was wasting my time.\\n\\n\r\nThe emotional parts felt too forced or cookie cutter for me to care. The characters are not interesting at all, with the only exceptions being the Immovable White Whistle that the MCs first meet (the one that saved the MC as a baby, you know who I mean) and the mad scientist White Whistle. However, speaking of the Immovable White Whistle, I absolutely hate either her script/direction or her voice actress. When she was talking for extending periods of time (monologuing), I noticed that every other sentence/word ended with the syllables \"eeehhhhh\" or \"neeeehhhh\". I get that, especially with some of the random and unexpected jumpcuts to her face being all scary, she is meant to be a representation of how one can lose their sanity going down the Abyss, but that infliction in her speech patterns made me want to just stop reading her subtitles because her voice kept distracting me, making it a chore, and just wait until she stopped talking before tuning back into the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to get across is, this anime, all too often, made me say \"why?\" and \"what's the point?\" way too often. It felt like this anime was having an identity crisis. Did it want to be an adventure anime? If so, then why the fuck was the main plot something so urgent? You can't take your time with that. There's probably so much more I'm omitting from this review but these were the points that came to my mind and I thought were prominent. If someone could just put my mind to rest on this issue and tell me exactly why people love this anime so much, I'd be deeply appreciative. I'm not going to lie and say I desperately want to enjoy this anime, because I don't, but it would be nice to be proven wrong because I cannot find a proper substantial reason as to why this anime should be the best anime of 2017.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that being said, I do not hate this anime (I gave it 5/10, after all) nor do I hate anyone that loves this anime. I do not want to get anyone riled up with this review/novel. Thanks a lot for reading this entire review and hopefully other like-minded people will find this helpful, knowing that they aren't the only ones with these qualms.",

            "content": "Is it possible for anything to be as heart-rendingly sweet yet unsettling as Made in Abyss is? I didn't think so, but this series is just that. \r\nTo preface, I'll say that it's a show with mature themes, and frighting things to contemplate. But there's no edge. In fact it's the exact opposite of that. It wraps up it's unsettling ideas, and dark consequence in warmth and wonder and presents them for you to digest. \r\nWe're brought alongside Riko and Reg, the chibi-adventuring pair that explores the world of the Abyss, and this world really is the main star of the show. It's simultaneously wonderfuland terrifying. So much of the Abyss feels mysterious, and there's a great many things that we never will learn about, yet at the same time the consequences feel ironclad. \\n\\n\r\nThe rules for exploring are easy to understand and set out at the very beginning: The deeper you go, the harder it is to come back. Every step that we take with Riko and Reg brings us closer to our goal but also farther from humanity. But Made in Abyss makes us want to do just that. We'll crave the next step, push to descend deeper and explore more even as we discard the safety and sanity of the world above like useless trinkets because what we uncover is just so compelling.\\n\\n\r\nI know I haven't talked about things like art and sound, but they're all great and it's something you really have to watch to see, as the sum of their parts is greater than any individual song or scene.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that if you finish what is out now, the manga is great to pick up as it really is beautiful and has every bit the same impact as the show.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThis past month, I have sunk a ton of time (perhaps too much time) into a video game that fans and critics alike hailed as GOTY last year: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\r\nIts sprawling map. Its sense of freedom. Its myriad of opportunities. Having now experienced (pretty much) the entirety of the game myself, it\u2019s now easy to see why it captured the attention and the hearts of gamers from across the globe. And, while I do not consider this iteration the best in the franchise (my vote goes to either Link\u2019sAwakening or Majora\u2019s Mask), I likewise give the game the praise it undoubtedly earned.\\n\\n\r\nAlso last year, an anime by the title of Made in Abyss became the talk of the town, receiving those coveted AOTY awards from relevant outlets. It also strikes many other similarities with Breath of the Wild. Focus on a huge world, perilous obstacles, getting to the girl at the very end. Minus shield surfing and Great Fairies, the two pieces of media are practically the same.\\n\\n\r\nAll right, not quite. But at least this following statement is true: Made in Abyss also earned its praise without a shadow of a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nFor most anime enthusiasts, they have heard the words \u201cmade\u201d, \u201cin\u201d, and \u201cabyss\u201d lined up and linked together many times over in everyday discussions and conversations by this point in time. For others still, this triplet has become synonymous with several different words as well: lauded, amazing, stellar, incredible, perfection. Whatever it may be called, Made in Abyss certainly strives for nothing short of a hole-in-one.\\n\\n\r\nBefore it commits to its first swing, the show sets its sights on a wonderful setup within its starting three episodes. In the first episode, most of the character introductions and an initial glimpse at this bizarre place take place. In the second episode, the show gives the audience a better understanding of what is and will be going on. And in the third episode, a goal is established, providing the (only) necessary direction for the journey to head towards.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, somewhat paradoxically, it only goes up from there.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the remaining ten episodes, Made in Abyss creates a thrilling fantasy adventure worthy of the copious praise it has received. The fantastic world-building within stands chief among its successes. From the interesting flora and fauna to the unstated details that flesh out the gaps in-between, the anime has a clear command of how to build a lush, vibrant world. In doing so, the framework for the story takes shape, forming an extremely sturdy platform for it to stand upon.\\n\\n\r\nJumping off this point, the show likewise takes advantage of the premise and the ideas at play when it follows its rules and opts for craziness. A fair but deadly combo that grants the anime a set of stunning moments during its run. They leave the audience either wishing for the characters\u2019 victory or picking their jaw up from off the floor after a ruthless happening. Such intense scenes not only define the strength of the story but also keep those who watch these events transpire in a state of captivation the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nMore importantly, by sticking with such (contextual) fairness, these developments also aid the narrative on a thematic and more general writing front.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, worthwhile themes act as guideposts. Origins and the desire of the self to know where it comes from. Inversion and the necessity of diving down to ascend above. Perseverance and living with tenacity while struggling against death. Drive and the sense of longing, will, passion, and curiosity people contend with on a regular basis. Be it certain narrated monologues or an in-the-face demonstration of a concept, these themes lace the story every which way, fueling more to think about outside of the action and the dramatic sequences.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the general level of writing, it remains consistent and strong no matter the layer in question. In fact, Made in Abyss leverages many common yet meaningful techniques that in turn layer the writing itself. Foreshadowing from both the straightforward and the clever sides map out the plot. Multiple puzzle pieces based on messages, disappearances, and memories slowly connect the bigger picture together while keeping the audience guessing. Repercussions for character actions. Callbacks to other in-universe items and offhand mentions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the storytelling does not reach legendary status, these inclusions benefit Made in Abyss regardless. Indeed, the setting alone provides the anime so much to work with. Each new layer presents a new biome that in turn contain new challenges, new people, and new occurrences, leading to a genuine feeling of inherent narrative progress as they slowly accomplish their goal.\\n\\n\r\nSo, do the three words that make up this title deserve the other words that have become so regularly attached to them over this past year? Well, the setup, the world-building, the intensity, the themes, and the writing would argue that it has scored no less than an albatross.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss continues its excellence in its visual presentation.\\n\\n\r\nThe high-rise shots of the cobbled city of Orth deserve recognition. However (and understandably), the anime sets most of its time aside to showcase the beauty and the chaos of the Abyss. Ruins and greenery near the first layer. Rockier outcrops pop up afterwards. A strange, windy forest, and a harsh, cloudy fault soon follow. Giant \u201cgoblets\u201d filled with hot water fill up the next location.\\n\\n\r\nThese areas (and more) contrast in their weather, their terrain, and their atmosphere, but they find similarity with a scrumptious amount of finer details and the true sense that these areas teem with life all their own.\\n\\n\r\nTo this end, Made in Abyss also goes out of its way to give its various creatures a range of designs from the reminiscent to the weird. Neritantans and inbyos remind one of bunnies and monkeys (respectively) but crimson-splitjaws and amakagames invoke that fantasy feel which the show champions.\\n\\n\r\nBetter yet, creepier or scarier moments sometimes lead to painted versions of these monsters. The off-kilter style contrasts harshly with the regular direction of the visuals, but such a dichotomy improves the otherworldly vibes these encounters emanate, thereby bolstering the fantastical element to this story.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the anime\u2019s flair likewise proves fruitful, too. While lighting tends to don a green hue due to the oft grassy fields and shrubbery, certain scenes go beyond the norm: striking sunrises, colorful glows, shadowy skies. It also does not shy away from its more brutal sequences, depicting for the audience (whether they want it or not) a front-and-center view of the reality this unforgiving netherworld throws their way. And the actual animation remains in high spirits as Riko traverses caverns, Reg rappels down cliffs, and the two push ever onward (and downward) into the Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nTheir character designs cap off the visuals with even more strength. The simultaneously simple and involved looks capture their personalities and quirks while also harboring a lot of symbolism. Riko\u2019s exploration gear and glasses coincide with her fierce curiosity. Reg\u2019s metal helmet and red cape give him the superhero vibe to match his superhero actions. Nanachi\u2019s nomadic garb and bunny appearance turn her into a lady of the land and a wise seer.\\n\\n\r\nOzen is also worthy of a shout-out. Her tall demeanor, creepy expressions, and black coloring paint her as quite the intimidating being. Yet her hunched posture when sitting and her contrasting white coloring form the moral ambiguity which drives her.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the visuals for Made in Abyss speak for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\n\u201cA human, a robot, and a bunny tumble into a crevasse\u2026\u201d reads like the setup to a lame standup routine that someone wrote down on a whim at the back of a bar on a lazy afternoon. It also describes the major players of this tale: Riko, Reg, and Nanachi. Thankfully, these characters are anything but the butt end (or relevantly bottom end) of a joke.\\n\\n\r\nRiko is the brains of the operation, the purveyor of the strange and the unknown. Her large sense of leadership stems from the bravery she exudes despite her physical limitations. Curiosity fuels her, and she desires to learn about both the world around her and what became of her mother. As such, she pushes towards the end of the Abyss. All while cooking up some tasty grub when and where possible.\\n\\n\r\nReg is the brawn, the bodyguard who protects Riko with all his might. She found him by chance near the top of the Abyss, and, having no recollection of his former self, followed Riko and her friends at the orphanage. He lacks the same sense of determination as his glasses-wearing friend, but he remains unaffected by the Curse of the Abyss no matter the layer. Wishing to understand who he really is, he embarks with Riko on their quest to reach where no man, woman, or sentient being has gone (in the downward direction at any rate).\\n\\n\r\nRiko and Reg clearly form the classic wit-and-power duo, the two complementing each other to make up for their respective weaknesses. A tried-and-true approach which creates for them a simple yet effective dynamic. Riko gives Reg courage and reason during their tumultuous trek, and Reg gives Riko the means to fight forward with grapple arms and incendiary attacks aplenty.\\n\\n\r\nThey need each other to progress, but they also need each other to survive. Not just in the wild but also on a psychological basis. The Abyss is unrelenting, and the only true entities within it that they can rely on are each other. Thus, their equivalent presences soothe their souls with safety in numbers and a priceless friend to rely on.\\n\\n\r\nIf Riko is the brains and Reg is the brawn, then Nanachi is the book, the guide who watches over them with a gentle (albeit furry) hand. Nanachi isn\u2019t too fond of closeness, a byproduct of the loneliness she has experienced for much of her life. More importantly, she understands the lay of the land: describing monster behavior, creating medicines to heal wounds, revealing how the Curse of the Abyss actually works. As a denizen of these darker depths, she rounds out the cast with knowledge and expertise that the original two wish they had at their disposal.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, Nanachi is arguably the most interesting of the group. Her backstory drips with tragedy, and her empathetic connection with Reg introduces some character writing that Made in Abyss had mostly shied away from until her arrival. It\u2019s unfortunate, then, that her inclusion occurs so late into the season, for she represents a strong addition to the cast. Not a third-wheel but rather another spoke for the frame to keep the original wheel turning that much smoother.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more general level, Riko, Reg, and Nanachi share many parallels. For starters, they\u2019re not adults or teenagers but kids. An important distinction since choosing this route not only magnifies the dangers the Abyss spawns around every corner and upon every layer but also elevates the sense of wonderment and adventure that each next step carries with it.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters also revolve around two totally separate yet intricately linked ideas: life and death. They were each born in the Abyss, made within it. Riko literally by her mother; Reg by construction from the ground up; Nanachi by ditching her old life in hopes of a newer favorable one. They all \u201cdied\u201d there, too, when considering the anatomical, philosophical trifecta of mind, body, and soul. Riko lost her soul for a brief period; Reg lost his mind to amnesia; Nanachi lost her body after transforming into a Hollow. Such wonderful parallels between the three main characters make for an intriguing setup that gives Made in Abyss yet another edge to admire.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterizations and meanings of this kind are no doubt neat, for they serve the anime well. Plus, the cast members themselves are a likable trio for sure. However, Riko, Reg, and Nanachi miss out on the lasting greatness that defines much of the rest of the show. Their personalities aren\u2019t the most engaging. Their interpersonal connections hold back slightly on dimensionality. Their presence in this story doesn\u2019t feel that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nTo clarify, Riko, Reg, and Nanachi are vital to Made in Abyss, so the show wouldn\u2019t be the same without them. And the narrative (and all it entails) takes precedence over their involvement, so they received less attention than they would have otherwise. Still, without that necessary spark, it\u2019s tough to claim that they exist at a top-tier level.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss continues with its incredible run by channeling an awesome musical repertoire.\\n\\n\r\nAbove anything else, the original soundtrack can only be described as fantastic. Lively instrumentation. Uplifting arrangements. Crushing tunes. Tribal influences. Emotional vocals. The Abyss is a rewarding, indigenous, and scary place, and the OST that backs this anime captures these feelings and more with its impressive pieces.\\n\\n\r\nWhile these musical tracks fly above the rest of the sound-related production, the signposts at the start and finish of every episode do not go unheard themselves. The opening track, titled \u201cDeep in Abyss\u201d, sees Riko and Reg trading off on the vocals, giving this singular song a duo and dual direction that keeps their camaraderie in mind. The piano melodies and varied pacing aid the flow of the song, too. It\u2019s a bit more fantastical in feel with a twinge of dread mixed in for added flavor and relevant vibes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending track, \u201cTabi no Hidarite, Saihate no Migite\u201d takes on a much more whimsical and hopeful tone. Its playfulness contributes much to this feeling: dinky instrumentation, clapping hands, floatier vocals. Almost optimistic, the ED has a charm that contrasts well with the severity of the Abyss, thereby elevating the effectiveness of the piece.\\n\\n\r\nGuttural monster noises notwithstanding, a handful of solid voice-acting performances likewise appear within Made in Abyss. Relative newcomer Miyu Tomia as Riko fills the air with excitement and emotion as she encounters each new layer. Mariya Ise as Reg, while having the least powerful performance of the three, pushes past fear with belief. And Shiori Izawa as Nanachi sounds oddly cute despite her nonchalant attitude and somewhat raspy delivery.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the audio aspect of this anime almost never falters in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhat an awesome show.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s one of those stories where I increasingly found myself wanting to see what would happen next. I would finish an episode and say to myself, \u201cAll right, just one more\u2026\u201d. It was enthralling and crazy and dramatic; I just couldn\u2019t look away.\\n\\n\r\nI was impressed with the anime to the point that I actually got tricked by Ozen. I thought for sure that they were settling on the mediocre route of setting her up as an obvious villain. Tooting my own horn here, but I am pretty spot-on when it comes to predicting how events will usually progress. So, when such a rare turn of events does happen, throwing me for a loop, I take it as a sign of a job well done on the show\u2019s part.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main trio of characters, I found myself liking them well-enough. Riko\u2019s dive into the unknown is a trait that I could learn from, for I am surprisingly stubborn when it comes to change, and her fierce courage had me rooting for her success in her fearsome trek. Reg is a cool dude if only because he instantly befriended Riko and the others, helping with willingness and sincerity. Nanachi is my favorite of the bunch, though. She has several worthwhile moments tied to her introduction, behavior, and mini-arc over the course of just a few episodes that I found her to be the most intriguing within the crew.\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, I wasn\u2019t a big fan of Maruruk. His sappy personality treaded close to annoying territory, but his tearful farewell made him tough to dislike. And I feel as if the anime missed a huge chance in its finale montage by not showcasing what Riko, Reg, and Nanachi sent back in their balloon. Ending the season on a drawing (by Nanachi) of the three of them would have been so powerful as that lovely music fades out.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. Tons of other elements still added up to a very entertaining time for me. Building up the reveal of Lyza. Piecing together the mysterious bits at hand. Researching more about world-building as part of my supplemental essay. All told, even if I do not personally give it the honor of receiving AOTY (for 2017), this anime is excellent in my eyes, and I cannot wait to see the inevitable continuation in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss delivers a phenomenal experience. Its intriguing storytelling and likable cast of characters are supported by fantastic artistry and wonderful music. With a very high level of execution throughout, the project can breathe easy knowing that it rises up within this wild medium.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, a thrilling fantasy tale rich in world-building techniques, thematic ideas, and writing chops, creating a narrative filled to the brim with intensity and intrigue from top to bottom and everywhere in-between\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, from the scenic shots to the interesting character designs, the visuals capture the beauty and the chaos of the Abyss and more without compromise\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Riko, Reg, and Nanachi are the brains, the brawn, and the book whose soul, mind, and body are tested throughout the first leg of this journey that they share together\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, a stellar OST, a strong OP-ED combo, and solid VA performances allow the audio design to shine in their own way\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, smaller gripes aside, the enthralling moments and other elements joined forces to bring about an entertaining time that refused to let go for thirteen episodes straight\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "I would be fully content with giving this show a 9 out of 10 were it not for the constant pedophile humor. I'm starting off the bat with this because it's an issue so common in anime that not enough people seem to care about, despite the fact that it's incredibly fucking disgusting and shouldn't exist to begin with. This show is tainted by unnecessary jokes about a child's penis and stringing up children naked as a form of punishment and the bastard who made this series should probably be strung up and beaten himself for ruining an otherwise golden work with his creepy anddistasteful fetish.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I can safely say Made in Abyss is something else. This show has some of the most beautifully crafted environments I've seen as well as some of the absolute best character designs, and the story, while simple, has enough twists and turns to satisfy and leave viewers always having questions and wanting answers.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is set in a fantasy world with an aesthetic highly reminiscent of some classic RPGs, and the eponymous abyss is filled with breathtaking and awe inspiring landscapes that almost feel real.  It chronicles the dangerous descent of two children, Reg and Riko, looking to reach the bottom of this Abyss, each for their own personal reasons. This is a journey that they cannot return from due to the fact that the Abyss is actually cursed and due to this the effects of ascension on one's health become increasingly devastating based on how deep a person goes. While traveling in the abyss, they come across some oddballs that live within it who impart knowledge of how the Abyss and some of its relics work, as well as extremely dangerous and grotesque monsters that inhabit the depths. And as for how dangerous it gets, I'll just say it's not a show for the faint of heart. Prepare to get creeped out and saddened even if works of fiction don't tend to emotionally sway you.\\n\\n\r\nMy appreciation for the story, aesthetics and character design is all I can really talk about, so I'll just say that this is definitely worth seeing. I think anyone can enjoy the ride that is Made in Abyss as long as they just grin and bear the sick and out of place humor. I know I took something from it and I'm grateful to have seen it despite this, and I'll look forward to a second season in the future.\\n",

            "content": "I heard murmurs in the beginning that Made in Abyss would be an anime to keep my eye on. From the very first episode I understood why that was being said. It set the tone perfectly for what I could expect from the rest of the series. I thought the anime was very well produced and had a captivating story. It would be easy to assume that the show is more on the lighthearted end of the spectrum. Even with all the trouble Riko and Regu got into earlier on, there was still the sense that they were safe. However the deeper they got intothe abyss, it became apparent the dangers the characters would be constantly facing on their journey. A tiny gripe I have with the story is that I thought the pacing of the story felt a little off at times.\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous in particular, the work on the background was some of the best I've seen for a TV series. The animation was surprisingly well done as well.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is beautiful,unique and fits the atmosphere of the series perfectly. The characters were interesting, quirky and slightly mysterious. There is still a lot of room for character development especially with the main cast as by the end of the anime it feels like the group is only now beginning their adventure as opposed to the season just ending. \\n\r\nI'll conclude by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this show and that Made in Abyss is a definite must-watch anime.",

            "content": "The genre of adventure is quite common throughout the medium. Naturally, it goes hand in hand with fantasy, the most common being the one with a medieval style, to make it more attractive. As normal as it may seem, a story with a different management is always welcome. What brings us now is an anime that uses a different kind of fantasy to which we are accustomed and that is why its popularity was so great. Let's see if Made in Abyss took advantage of this factor or wasted the only thing that would give identity.\r\nWhat is Made in Abyss about?\r\nThe Abyss is a placewhere explorers called Cave Raider enter to look for relics, which would become the treasures of the place, on the other hand, it is also home to huge and lethal creatures, without forgetting that when you climb you suffer the curse of the abyss, which It can be deadly These adventurers are divided into ranges determined by the color of their whistle, with whites the highest and red beginners. We will follow the life of Riko a girl who dreams of being a white whistle like her mother. During an exploration she suffers the attack of a monster and is saved by a strange robot child whom she will take with her and will name him Reg. From that moment the fate of both of them comes together to explore the great mysteries that the Abyss hides.\\n\\n\r\nA rhythm in accordance with the narrative\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe plot that will handle will be calm and slow. From the beginning you can see that it is taking its time, the presentation of the context together with the structure of the place is presented in an entertaining way because it does not use long explanations. Many things can be observed and will be constant throughout the story (like the curse). It maintains a calm rhythm, even in tense moments, you will never feel that it hurries the events to reach a conclusion, which is good because it does not break with the narrative that arises from the beginning, it has consistency from the beginning to the end. This, unfortunately, carries a problem at the end of the series, it does not close anything, ending with a brutal cliffhanger for all who followed the anime. It is true that leaves several things on the air to be explained in a second season, it is appreciated because they prevented it from contrasting with the beginning, but that must has been a kick to all those who waited each week for a chapter. The final decision is questionable and acceptable at the same time, on the one hand it leaves the anime as it started and, on the other hand, it keeps a constant narrative, this decision will be in a test of fire when the second season comes out, for now it will only remain as something negative with good points.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a good addition to the plot because they maintain a nice charisma. Riko is a protagonist with a playful, energetic and impulsive personality, she will be constantly moving the plot so that events happen. Her development focuses on her ambitions to want to be like her mother, this desire is because she wants to see her at the bottom of the underworld (the bottom of the Abyss). Her motivations are concrete and, although a little weak in some situations, they create a sympathy with her to follow the story. The other protagonist is Reg, a robot without memory, despite his state, it maintains a minimum pleasant characterization. It may not be as expressive or developed as Riko, but neither is it a hindrance, it has relevance and its amnesia, for now, has not caused conveniences in the plot. The third relevant character is Nanachi, who, despite arriving in the last chapters, monopolizes attention. It may sound positive if not because it is the type of character whose main characteristic revolves around suffering. This is not a bad thing on its own, however, if it is the only thing that is presented of its development, it is when the inconveniences come. It can show other things, but everything will always come out of suffering. The characters are entertaining to follow, everyone has a good chemistry that makes them entertaining to see every time they interact, some may be more worked than others, although this does not take away how pleasant they are.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we talk about the world in which events take place we take a big factor of anime. The bases are well raised to expose you the range of possibilities that can develop as the plot progresses. These will be presented little by little using few explanations or in such case they are not so complicated to follow and they do not take so much time. This is a point in favor because being a series of adventure it would be a sin if they show a long talk instead of how the world works. Besides, there are several factors that imply a deeper story that will be gradually unveiled (hopefully). The world you have is colorful and fascinating to see, it is a pleasure to see it, especially when changing ecosystems because the differences are remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a quite outstanding detail that caused many to talk about anime and that is what they showed in two chapters. There are two situations that attracted much attention and I am going to talk about them without giving spoilers. The first one (happened in chapter 10), is understandable because throughout the anime there is mention of the consequences and dangers that one can face in the Abyss. I could go into consideration that the scene score more points in shock factor, but it really complements all the constant danger that the protagonists go through. Besides, the series never limited itself to show vomit, urine, skulls, excrement, light nudity or talk openly about their chances of dying, so the blood is not out of place. Then we have the second event in the last chapter, in this case I can not say that it has reason to exist or to be so crude. It is true that it happens to develop and deepen Nanachi, however, the victim is a character who is never told anything, she has so little time on screen that it is impossible to have any kind of sympathy making her scene be used to continue victimizing Nanachi . Only the first event works with the context of the series, however, the second was unnecessary and even morbid because of the crude way of showing it. They do not reach the degree to consider the anime gore, but it will raise several eyebrows to the people who see it.\\n\\n\r\nComplementing the setting\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the technical section we can find an excellent job. In the first place, the scenarios and landscapes are incredible. The details in each place support immersion because each zone has its own identity. Each layer is unique avoiding falling into repetition, at the same time it has its own spectacularity. On the other hand, it is positive to see that children's designs deviate from the standard that anime normally has. They may not be completely unique and some are generic, but the main ones are different from the others.\\n\\n\r\nWith the music we find an excellent work of setting. Each tune is consistent with the landscape and situations. It serves as a connection to the viewer to accentuate each scene, transmitting the correct emotions. Unfortunately, the opening and ending are not of the other world, they go according to the presented in each episode, however, really one would easily forget them. Music is only good on the soundtrack, you can even listen to it separately, while the rest is generic at best.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime that manages to excel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is a complicated anime to recommend. Its story is interesting because it poses an interesting scenario where the plot of a search maintains a quite unique fantasy tone. On the other hand, its end is a complete cliffhanger of which we do not know how many years it is going to take to see the continuation. Seeing it is a good idea if you do not have problems with an open end, it is true that the important thing is the way, but this they left it halfway. But I can say that you can see it with no fear, as it has a confirmed new season (with no date confirmed as today, March, 2nd). For me this anime would be a 8.5/10.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019ve found it again. That feeling. I\u2019ve been searching for so long\u2026 watching 84 different shows and I\u2019ve finally re-grasped that ineffable sensation of pure awe that I felt when first getting into anime. Or at least, the closest imitation to it. Where did I rediscover this joy?\r\nMade in Abyss. The tears still have not solidified on my face, runnels made after witnessing a certain event. What began as a seemingly playful anime centered around a simply drawn girl and a robot boy accelerated into something deeper, darker, more grim. Or should I say realistic? The farther down you go in the Abyss, the moredifficult your tribulations become. Made in Abyss (MiA) does not withhold the pain, sorrow, and other full vista of emotions incidental to overcoming emotional and physical challenges endemic to that realm. MiA reminds me somewhat of the book series Tunnels, which also concerns going deeper into the earth and encountering the wonders and dangers within. While that was certainly a pleasure to read, MiA was without a doubt a journey to watch -- albeit a struggle to go through at times, while also being comedic, delightful, wondrous, informative, visually and aurally riveting. MiA is, simply, amazing. I am at a loss for words. I don\u2019t even know where to begin.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t cried this much since watching Lion (live-action film by Garth Davis), since learning the truth about Itachi, since watching One Piece episode 405. What happened to certain characters in MiA was just\u2026 horrific, inhumane, I can\u2019t even begin to describe it. Unfortunately my roommate was sleeping so I couldn\u2019t openly bawl, but I did cry. A lot.\\n\r\n~~~~~~\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of an anime is background music. Just that. In most shows it provides mere support, serving to back certain emotions or match characters or what have you\u2026 In some shows it\u2019s particularly good, so good that you listen to it on its own, that it doesn\u2019t just support but heighten the feels and in other words amplify everything good. And in a select few shows you have melodies of the divine. Listening to Kevin Penkin\u2019s glorious OST for MiA is akin to, well, nothing really on Earth. Not many other anime, or any other visual mediums, have touched me on so many different heartstrings. The OST is light, ominous, inspiring, apt, everything. It matches MiA perfectly. It has the innovative variety of Yuki Hayashi combined with the solidity of Akira Senju. It\u2019s something else entirely. I mean like one of the insert songs was written in completely fabricated lyrics with words not in any language. And it sounds so beautiful. I\u2019m even listening to the OST while writing this review. Thank you, God, for giving me ears.\\n\r\n~~~~~\\n\r\nKinema Citrus did a stunning job with MiA. The clarity doesn\u2019t quite reach ufotable level, but the art is still very solid and meaningful. The firestorms of Reg\u2019s blasts are vividly realistic within the two-dimensional frame. The characters are drawn with a smooth touch that isn\u2019t contradicted by the backgrounds. The backgrounds themselves are done well -- but their lustrous quality isn\u2019t the gem so much as what they are of. The world of MiA is breathtaking. Akihito Tsukushi\u2019s imagination is only matched by the depths of his Abyss. The sheer quantity of unique creatures, settings, mystical features to the Abyss is water and food to me, a lover of worlds. I was enraptured by Hellsalem\u2019s Lot. I am enamored of the Abyss. Thank you, God, for giving me eyes.\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\r\nI guess you could call MiA a dark parody of the cute girls anime. The contrast (as exemplified by the ED) between the cuteness of the characters and the unforgiving darkness of the Abyss is\u2026 unsettling. If the characters weren\u2019t drawn so cutely, the horrors wouldn\u2019t be as striking (but still striking). Another anime that does this would be Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. As with that one, which suddenly turned dark after a certain event, MiA abruptly took a dark twist at a certain episode. But thankfully that episode also brought a certain new plot element that makes me all the more stoked for Season 2.\\n\r\n~~~\\n\r\nAnime, by very nature, is limited. Being two-dimensional, you would think that it can\u2019t be as realistically telling as live action. But after seeing a certain painful event and hearing voice acting that sounded incredibly real, making the ordeal an actual struggle to watch, even more painful than certain scenes in Game of Thrones -- I am engrossed. MiA does not hold back. MiA by all rights is NOT a show for kids. I\u2019ve seen my fair share of gore, death and dying, and few works come close to MiA in terms of uninhibited realism (e.g. Oyasumi Punpun). Does realism make a story good? If a narrative\u2019s job is to reflect our world, then yes, it does, or at least it makes it better. MiA is as astonishingly realistic as an otherworldly adventure can be with simply drawn characters.\\n\r\n~~\\n\r\nIt does take a while for the show to get really good. I hope that the first season, being but a part of the ongoing manga, is but an opening segment, like how Naruto was for Naruto: Shippuuden. It can only get darker, more terrifying, more mysterious and awe-inspiring, and better from here. Made in Abyss is so good that I want to see it again and I just finished it. It gave me a new favorite character, new favorite OST, new favorite premise/setting, new favorite anime. Thank you, Kinema Citrus, for bringing this to the screen.\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nFor anything made in the abyss is wrought from the joy of discovery.",

            "content": ">> SPOILER WARNINGsecond season seems to be on the way so this is subject to change. Anyway, I enjoyed the following 7 episodes a lot more, though there are multiple reasons for that other than pace.\\n\\n\r\n2) Riko. Now before you all despise me let me say I don't hate Riko completely. I actually like her enthusiasm, bravery and clumsiness... I like a lot of her traits but why did they make her a fan service character? \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode I thought her punishment scene was just a way to show us how the orphanage is a dark place and Riko is just so used to this behavior that they are portraying it as a normal thing. Turns out I was wrong, the *strung naked* thing was just a popular discipline technique? Okay I guess. Not an episode passes and Riko starts talking about Regu's genitals? Alright, I mean she does live in a TORTURE CHAMBER so I guess she has a weird side.. whatever.\\n\\n\r\nUm... now she is just leaving the shower naked for no reason. Oh now Regu is looking at her boobs. Skinny dipping, more genital jokes, great. No matter how you look at it, you can't deny that this rather dark show chose to use its 12-year old main character for fan service. This becomes especially apparent when Riko is unconscious during episodes 10-12. Honestly I thought these episodes were the strongest of the series because she was missing. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the negatives, the show has some strong side characters and a very good 2nd main character. Regu the \"Robot\" is more human than anyone in the show starting from Episode 1. He's curious, passionate, dependable, sometimes clueless, sometimes flawed, sometimes a pushover. I just love him, easily the best character on MiA. Then comes two side characters who saved the series starting from episode 7: Ouzen and Nanachi. I won't go into detail, but I found them both interesting and the story did a nice job developing them. I'm hoping to see more of them in the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say anything about the art that hasn't been said before, everything is just gorgeous. Visually it's the most impressive anime I've ever seen. The soundtrack however didn't do it for me. Especially some of the solo piano songs. These background tracks shouldn't dominate the scene and distract me from what's going on, yet it happened quite a few times. But this might just be a me-thing. My favorite song by far was the opening credits song from Episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would have given MiA a 7 if I wasn't so bothered by the fan service and maybe even a 9 if some episodes weren't dragged out. Decent, and I'm curious to see how Season 2 will play out.",

            "content": "I am writing this review to talk about the flaws in Made in Abyss. This show is amazing, and is a must watch, but it has a few flaws that stood out to me, and it's a shame that they exist in an otherwise amazing show. \r\nThe art, animation, and sound direction is stunning, and is a huge highlight of this show. My main flaw in this area lies in the art direction of monsters around the beginning of the show. The painterly styled creatures look disgusting in a world that is going for the totally opposite look. Thankfully these creatures were only shown insuch a disgusting manner during the start of the series. Now I am fully aware that this could of been a design choice, but it shouldn't be a reason to back it up, Ping Pong the Animation gets flack for its art direction, and yet this show gets a free pass just because people choose to look past these 'minor' flaws. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are great for the most part, problem is, is that most characters are merely there to just fill up the screen, and add a few explanation lines. Before anyone gets annoyed that I stated this despite this being the case for most Anime, I'm more talking about the importance of a character. If a character is gonna be a background character, it's fine for them to be unimportant, and just fill up the screen, but when you have characters that are more leaning towards side characters, you expect them to get some more fleshed out reasons for them to exist. Problem is, because of the rapid speed of the show, with an enormous amount of time-lapses to skip past unimportant scenes, you will have a character spit out a few lines of dialogue, to have them just turn into a background character that will soon disappear. Now you could also say this is used a lot, but when you're saying \"This character is a black whistle, and works for blah blah, and is really skilled\", you expect them to be more fleshed out past saying little to no lines. The side characters that do get a lot of dialogue when introduced seem to be the most boring characters, and it's really sad that they exist, there is of course exceptions, Mitty is a good example of a side character that holds a lot of weight as a side character, and she doesn't even speak words for the most part. A good example of a characters like this, is all of Riko's friends, they talk for a lot of time at the start of the series, and then that's it, I know that there's a reason for that, but even then, it just seems characters add barely anything to the story. The main cast is interesting for the most part, but Riko is a bitch of a protagonist. Regu is constantly having to help her, and in the one episode where he is past out, and she goes off to get food and gets in a lot of trouble, making the moment really good for character building, they end up building her up into realizing that she is useless without Regu's power... This is fucking annoying, and made the whole episode useless, with her barely surviving, and having seen all her love ones as hallucinations, making it really emotionally gripping, just for her to just about fight off a difficult creature, and then have Regu wake up to save the day, it's fucking retarded, and I can't stand it. This section was a bit nit picky, but I did feel like this first season built up Regu mainly, and then just had Riko come along for the ride, despite her being the protagonist. The other main characters are cool, mainly Ouzen and her sidekick Maruruk, and Nanachi and Mitty, but other than that, most characters lack substance, and end up just disappearing from the show anyway. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the main criticism I can give this show: The writers weird need for child characters to be naked, or sexually harassed. Now some of the scenes where the show, shows a character being naked, make sense. Riko strung up and whipped naked is controversial, but it's happened a lot of times in history, and is mainly a form of punishment, It's not used as a bondage fetishist scene. The character peeing/vomiting on themselves while in immense pain, or in a comma, that makes sense to strip and clean them. The characters going for a swim. Now this may sound weird that I've listed this many different examples, and some of these even repeated themselves, and this is where I see the main problem. Along with all the sexual jokes about Regu having a real penis despite being a robot, the talk of whipping Maruruk, and the fact that despite being a boy he is dressed as a girl, the talk of anal probing by Riko when conducting test on Regu, the writer seems to find it amusing, or maybe even satisfying to try and include this many forms of low key sexualization of children. It's wrong, and I don't want any of you Loli elitist to defend this. I do think for the most part that he did a good job of writing it in a way that disguises it as not a problem, for they are merely getting naked for the sake of the situation, but tied in with all the fucked up perversions that are talked about in the show, even talking about Regu's dick getting erect while in a pool with Riko, while this makes sense, it's again, just too much, and not needed. If it was kept down a notch, and not imported so much into the show, I might have given the show a 10 tbh. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the lack of character importance/development, and the ignorance of the main characters need to develop, tied in with some off putting animation/art problems in the start, wrapped up with pedophilic tendencies, you end up losing a point from the rating scale from me. Now this does not mean it's bad, but I feel as all these reviews praise this show, and don't address the flaws, a review like this is needed. A single point lost from this is not much despite all that I talked about, reasons being is that the writer is just too clever in his development of the story, that it's hard to use these points against the show. It's a great show, and it shouldn't be condemned for its flaws, but shouldn't be blindly forgiven for them as well.",

Of the many shows that gets aired every season in our modern anime world, it is hard to find something so short and breathtaking as Made in Abyss.\r\nMany have already said a lot so I'm just going to give my own personal opinion on this subject matter. The story they set up is very mysterious and want you craving more. As the episodes go on you start wondering about the characters and you get suckedin just from the first episode. As there are a lot of unanswered questions that you really want to know the answer of. Questions that you will care about. Like \"What's with that hole\" \"Who or who can't be trusted\" \"Who is that 8 foot tall grandma?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art and especially the soundtrack is pretty unique compared to the vast majority out there and are fantastic at drawing you in along with the story. The pacing also helps that it isn't that fast and it isn't too slow. At times in can be slow but it just makes it seem more real that way. Finally the characters, the characters are simple and complex at the same time. It is best to watch the show to find out more about the characters and the show itself. Trust me, it will be worth the watch.  This is the only way to truly appreciate the visual art style, story and especially the soundtrack. It gives me nostalgia to things I've done in the past. Even though this was only last year!",

Heck skip going to do anything important. just watch the anime. This is a anime where you have to think as well. So if you want mindless entertainment. ho back to watching SAO. Now, back to what I have to say, its art is the absolute best I've seen. the water color backgrounds and creatures mixed with the classic foreground character style seen in many anime is really appealing. AND the amount of symbolismwould make it worth studying for a essay. in the first episodes they have little hints and secrets I've probably haven't noticed that go with the overall plot. To date its the first Masterpiece of an anime I've seen. It also isn't to bogged down with anime tropes other than \"Amnesiac Robot Boy With Super Abilities.\" while it starts to get a bit less amazing, It still keeps its masterpiece badge all the way through.",

            "content": "I watched Made in Abyss having not really heard much of the hype. I watched the first three episodes and found them to be thoroughly enjoyable, with the beginnings of some intriguing world-building and well fleshed-out characters. Shortly after watching these first three episodes I headed off on a trip to Tasmania and was soon enough distracted by travel and didn't think a great deal more of it. However, courtesy of the chap sitting next to me on the flight down I soon found-myself bed-ridden and staying in Tasmania a little longer than planned. With nothing much to do, my thoughts turned back to Madein Abyss and before I knew it I'd binged the remaining ten episodes and was left being still very much sick and now also bereft that there wasn't more. I had this palpable, intense urge to watch more, to explore the deeper layers, just as the characters in the show do. It's been a long time since any story in any medium left me quite so profoundly impacted. I promptly devoured the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe show constructs the Abyss and its lore with incredible attention to detail. It builds ecosystems, history, layered mystery and the geography of the place. And whilst the Abyss is clearly said to be dangerous, it doesn't take long before you start seeing just how very, truly, painfully true that is. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the finest points of this world is the White Whistles. They are not your standard generic hero-adventurers. Without revealing too much, as we meet them we realise just what the Abyss does to people who spend their lives in it and just what sort of person devotes themselves so totally to this realm of beautiful nightmares. It is through what we see of them that we get a sense of the deep mystery and deep horror of the Abyss. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is a descent in every sense of the world. The bright, if not exactly utopian city of Orth, is populated by moe red whistle children and those first three episodes build the foundations of a fun and exciting adventure. From there all illusions we may have had about what sort of story this will be a stripped away, layer by layer, with ruthless care. For all my praise of this show, parts of it are genuinely painful to watch. There are certainly more graphically violent anime out there, but none make you suffer with the characters, make you experience their pain and deprivation, quite like Made in Abyss. \\n\\n\r\nFor a show with adventure at its core to truly succeed there needs to be mystery, a sense of journeying into the unknown and few works I've experience build that sense more effectively than Made in Abyss. The names of places, relics and people give you some sense of this: the Sea of Corpses, the Capital of the Unreturned, the Final Maelstrom are three of the layers of the Abyss mentioned early on, but left mostly unexplained, giving our imaginations space to run wild. We have the Unheard Bell and the Curse-Repelling Vessel... then there's the White Whistles and their epithets - Ozen the Immovable, Bondrewd the Novel, Lord of Dawn... it is evocative stuff. And that's how this show builds mystery - it gives you tantalising glimpses and lets you construct the rest. \\n\\n\r\nI'd be remiss in reviewing this series and not mentioning its soundtrack. Kevin Penkin has provided a true masterpiece here. From the enigmatic, intriguing 'The First Layer' which plays at numerous times early in the series and effectively invokes the sense of mystery and adventure mentioned above, to the stirring 'Tomorrow' and the truly mind-blowing 'Hanezeve Caradhina', this soundtrack is quite unlike anything I've ever experienced and perfectly accompanies this wonderful series' Ghibli-esque visuals. \\n\\n\r\nYou will want to join Reg and Riko on this journey. It is unique. It is at times cruel, at times beautiful, at times uplifting and at times devastatingly depressing.  It is one of those series that sticks with you, almost haunting you after you're done.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, when I first started watching this show I was not instantly drawn in, I thought it was a bit weird, a bit slow, I got a little bored, however it ended up being my favourite anime of all time.\r\nThe animation is great with some breathtaking visuals and awesome voice work and a truly outstanding OST. The story is extremely intriguing and has so many directions it can go in that you cant help but be excited for what will happen next.\r\nThe concept of the show, the mysterious abyss and the consequences of the curse, pull you in and make you want toexplore it alongside the main characters and see what the abyss has to offer too. There are a lot of funny sweet moments and it pulls you in with a child's curiosity, slowly turning into a dark corner. There are many moments that are beautiful and make you want to cry and a lot of moments that give you goosebumps and makes your jaw drop.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a range of characters with all kinds of quirky personalities but id say most of them are very charming and likeable in their own ways, as everyone is working individually and together to discover the mysteries hidden with-in the abyss. As scary and weird as some of the characters can be, you can come to understand it somewhat due to the concept of their world.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the manga, there is not much to be missed from this segment of the show apart from some fighting visualisation and more blunt nudity and such. However the anime has some extra parts in it that the manga does not that give the story a bit of an extra kick and shows off more of the amazing features of the story. The colour and amazing OST also does the manga a great service.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a breathtaking experience and leaves you wanting more, makes you emotional and has a lot of chilling moments. If you are into plot twists, dark themes, emotional stories and a world full of mystery, you will love this show! If you are looking for a cute and innocent story about children exploring the unique world, you might be in for a shock though, so be wary of that.\\n\\n\r\nA lovely show and a breath of fresh air for me, I highly recommend it!",

This series has received some of the highest critical acclaim, plus it has been getting a lot of momentum since than and i do not fault it. \r\nIt really is a unique series with an interesting story and has a distinct signature feel to it. This is something that is not easily obtainable these days, especially in such a over-saturated industry.\r\nThe studio behind it, Kinema Citrus, Which until now has had a somewhat iffy record in adapting content in animehave done an excellent job in adapting it. I give my applause to the animation crew for making the world of Made in Abyss looking so real and alive, the art style really captures the moment like you are seeing this wonderful world in all it's glory. \\n\\n\r\nLike many others have said, the only real downside to this, is that it is left unfinished. However that is to say the adaptation was not good. They did a solid job in adapting it and as far were it could have been chosen to end it, they left in a pretty solid end zone, easy to pick up from where it was left by reading the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI just hope than when enough content is out, they can continue to animate it and with the same team again as they did a good job with it.",

            "content": "I'm not very used to writing reviews yet, so I'll probably be hesitant and undecided, but I had to make one on Made in Abyss. And what a way to start!\r\nStory :  10/10\r\nI could only give 10, because Made in Abyss touches a sore spot at home by playing the card of discovery, adventure and mystery. Indeed, I have always loved discovering new things, especially totally different worlds, which I find extremely attractive.\r\nAnd there, at once, I am offered a beautiful but deadly place, a mysterious and unknown fauna and flora, a sensation of attraction for the unknown, a dangerous but exquisite perfume oftemptation...\\n\r\nI do not really have words to describe everything, but I know that I have the impression to discover the world of Made in Abyss at the same time as Riko and Regu, I am amazed at each new discovery, with each new advance . I am fascinated by the Abyss, as much as Riko could be!\\n\r\nI have only one hurry : a second season to quench my thirst for exploration!\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\r\nMy eyes ! It's so beautiful !\\n\r\nLet's start with the \"less impressive\": the chibi aspect of the characters can be confusing at the beginning, but we get used to it very quickly and, finally, it sticks strangely with the general universe of the anime\\n\r\nThe animation of the characters is impeccable and the monsters animation is really interesting, in a quite different style but not a displeasing one.\\n\r\nBut the strong point of the DA is the sets : they are simply sumptuous. It's like being in a Ghibli! The universe of the Abyss is incredibly detailed and magnified (which contrasts with its true nature). The different levels are diversified and we really feel like there's different ecosystems\\n\r\nIt's impressive to see how much this anime can score in just so few episodes!\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10\\n\r\nMade in Abyss was a surprise and my favorite 2017 anime, thanks to its rich and detailed universe, its artistic direction but also its soundtrack!\\n\r\nMusic plays a vital role in a work. It accompanies the characters, rhythm an episode and occupies an essential place in the construction of the atmosphere.\\n\r\nAs much to say it immediately: it reaches perfection in Made in Abyss.\\n\r\nThe OST is beautiful, splendid, sublime. Sometimes we have majestic orchestral pieces (usually accompanied by breathtaking panoramas), sometimes they are rather discrete music, sticking perfectly to the atmosphere of the Abyss.\\n\r\nHanezeve Caradhina, played from the first episode, plunges us into this wonderful universe\\n\r\nThe First Layer plunges us at the same time as the characters in the discovery of the Abyss. We begin an enigmatic, initiatic, journey, which we know we will not come back unscathed\\n\r\nIn the Blind translates the dark, oppressive side of the Abyss. The danger, omnipresent, invisible, awaits us, and despite the beauty and majesty of the place, the slightest misstep can be fatal\\n\r\nFinally, Tomorrow concludes with unparalleled strength our first part of the journey, alongside Riko, Regu and Nanachi\\n\\n\r\nOf all the anime OSTs that I have heard, Made in Abyss is by far the one that struck me the most\\n\r\nI would also like to share a theory, or rather a personal interpretation, which for me has also played a great role: in a number of tracks of the OST, a particular kind of instrument comes up quite frequently. A low-pitched, resonant, vibrating instrument.\\n\r\nFor me, this instrument is the representation of the Abyss. Mysterious, haunting, scary, it is a deep emptiness, omnipresent, that attracts us constantly throughout the anime. This omnipresence, this fascination is so powerful that we even feel it through music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\n\"Oh, chibi characters, this anime is going to be adorable\" - Me, before episode 10\\n\r\nOnce we get used to the particular chara design (which sticks surprisingly well with the world of Made in Abyss), we can only appreciate the characters of this anime\\n\r\nComplex, surrounded by mystery, trailing behind them a past, the characters are directly influenced by the Abyss.\\n\r\nIf we can notice some characters are a little too manichean (Bondrewd I see you coming), we can only be amazed at the complexity of the characters.\\n\r\nThe children of the orphanage are adorable, but are at the same time aware of the dangers of life since they already rub shoulders with exploring the Abyss, even if this is only the first layer. Inchou perfectly plays the role of an orphanage director as we learned in storytelling, which makes her a surprisingly pleasant character.\\n\r\nWhistles are people who saw things,  they're even tortured. They saw the Abyss, its dark side. They escaped, but as soon as they set foot there, if only once, the Abyss took a part of their soul, pushing them to always want to return.\\n\r\nSo what about Ouzen, the unshakable giant, a fascinating and really well written character! Mentor, she differs very much from the classical scheme instituted by the animes, but is nevertheless an unequaled teacher.\\n\r\nAnd what about Nanachi and Mitty! A tragic story, heartbreaking and deeply human, which results in a magnificent but terribly painful act.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, let's not forget Riko and Regu, our two protagonists!\\n\r\nRegu, half-human half-robot boy, who goes back to the bottom of the Abyss to understand who he is, what his origins are but also to accompany Riko on her journey\\n\r\nAnd Riko, ah Riko! What a great character!\\n\r\nIf her enthusiasm, her little face and her desire to find her mother are touching, it is especially her maturity and knowledge that have struck me.\\n\r\nIt is difficult to find in an anime a character who really thinks and uses his knowledge with accuracy. Yet here is a 12-year-old girl doing it.\\n\r\nAnd if, of course, she makes mistakes and encounters \"setbacks\", it is extremely pleasant to see how well she has prepared herself and knows how to deal with the world outside (doesn't it, Priestess of Goblin Slayer? )\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nI did not get bored for a minute. I enjoyed every shot, every line of dialogue, every character. The really unique atmosphere of the anime really struck me, I was captivated with each episode (that's why I finished the anime really fast!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\r\nI think that today, I still do not have words strong enough to describe what I went through with Made in Abyss. It was really ... wonderful. Every detail of this anime hit me, touched me in the heart and fascinated me\\n\r\nI have always had an attraction for discovery, exploration, as much as saying that this anime delight me completely!\\n\r\nDespite its length, Made in Abyss has directly managed to be among my favorite anime, a top 10 well deserved in my opinion\\n\r\nAlthough it is recent, I think it has already become a classic to see absolutely once in our life\\n\\n\r\nNow, we only have wait impatiently for the second season!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrench version :\\n\r\nJe ne suis pas encore tr\u00e8s habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire des critiques, donc je serai s\u00fbrement h\u00e9sitant et ind\u00e9cis, mais je me devais d'en faire une sur Made in Abyss. Et quelle fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9marrer !\\n\\n\r\nHistoire : 10/10\\n\r\nJe ne pouvais que donner 10, car Made in Abyss touche un point sensible chez moi en jouant la carte de la d\u00e9couverte, de l'aventure et du myst\u00e8re. En effet j'ai toujours ador\u00e9 d\u00e9couvrir de nouvelles choses, et plus particuli\u00e8rement des univers totalement diff\u00e9rents, que je trouve extr\u00eamement attirants.\\n\r\nEt l\u00e0, d'un seul coup, on me propose un lieu magnifique mais mortel, une faune et flore myst\u00e9rieuses et inconnues, une sensation d'attirance pour l'inconnu, un parfum dangereux mais exquis et tentateur...\\n\r\nJe n'ai pas vraiment de mots pour tout d\u00e9crire, mais je sais que j'ai la totale impression de d\u00e9couvrir le monde de Made in Abyss en m\u00eame temps que Riko et Regu, je suis \u00e9merveill\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque nouvelle d\u00e9couverte, \u00e0 chaque nouvelle avanc\u00e9e. Je suis fascin\u00e9 par l'Abysse, autant que Riko peut \u00eatre !\\n\r\nJe n'ai qu'une seule h\u00e2te : une deuxi\u00e8me saison afin d'assouvir ma soif d'exploration !\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\r\nMes yeux ! C'est tellement beau !\\n\r\nCommen\u00e7ons par le \"moins impressionnant\" : l'aspect chibi des personnages peut d\u00e9router au d\u00e9but, mais on s'y habitude tr\u00e8s vite et, finalement, cela colle \u00e9trangement avec l'univers g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'anime\\n\r\nL'animation des personnages est impeccable et celle des plus gros monstres est vraiment int\u00e9ressante, dans un style tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rent mais qui n'est pas d\u00e9plaisant.\\n\r\nMais le point fort de la DA, ce sont les d\u00e9cors : ils sont tout simplement somptueux. On se croirait dans un Ghibli ! L'univers de l'Abysse est incroyablement d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et magnifi\u00e9 (ce qui contraste avec sa vraie nature). Les diff\u00e9rents niveaux sont diversifi\u00e9s et on a vraiment l'impression de changer compl\u00e8tement d'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me\\n\r\nC'est impressionnant de voir \u00e0 quel point cet anime peut marquer en seulement si peu d'\u00e9pisodes !\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack : 10/10\\n\r\nMade in Abyss a \u00e9t\u00e9 une surprise et mon coup de c\u0153ur 2017, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 son univers riche et d\u00e9taill\u00e9, sa direction artistique mais \u00e9galement sa bande-son !\\n\r\nLa musique joue un r\u00f4le essentiel dans une \u0153uvre. Elle accompagne les personnages, rythme un \u00e9pisode et occupe une place essentielle dans la construction de l'ambiance. \\n\r\nAutant le dire tout de suite : c'est la perfection dans  Made in Abyss. \\n\r\nL'OST est magnifique, splendide, sublime. Tant\u00f4t on a des pi\u00e8ces orchestrales majestueuses (accompagnant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des panoramas \u00e0 couper le souffle), tant\u00f4t ce sont plut\u00f4t des musiques discr\u00e8tes, collant parfaitement \u00e0 l'ambiance de l'abysse.\\n\r\nHanezeve Caradhina, jou\u00e9 d\u00e8s le premier \u00e9pisode, nous plonge dans cet univers merveilleux\\n\r\nThe First Layer nous plonge en m\u00eame temps que les personnages dans la d\u00e9couverte de l'Abysse. On d\u00e9bute un voyage \u00e9nigmatique, initiatique dont on sait qu'on ne reviendra pas indemne\\n\r\nIn the Blind traduit le c\u00f4t\u00e9 sombre, oppressant de l'Abysse. Le danger, omnipr\u00e9sent, invisible, nous guette, et malgr\u00e9 la beaut\u00e9 et la majest\u00e9 des lieux, le moindre faux pas peut \u00eatre fatal\\n\r\nEnfin, Tomorrow conclut avec une force sans pareille notre premi\u00e8re partie du voyage, aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de Riko, Regu et Nanachi\\n\\n\r\nDe toutes les OST d'animes que j'ai entendu, celle de Made in Abyss est de loin l'une qui m'a le plus marqu\u00e9\\n\r\nJe voudrais aussi faire part d'une th\u00e9orie, ou plut\u00f4t d'une interpr\u00e9tation personnelle, qui pour moi a \u00e9galement jou\u00e9 un grand r\u00f4le : dans un bon nombre de pistes de l'OST, un genre d'instrument bien particulier revient assez fr\u00e9quemment. Un instrument grave, r\u00e9sonnant, vibrant. \\n\r\nPour moi, cet instrument, c'est la repr\u00e9sentation de l'Abysse. Myst\u00e9rieux, envo\u00fbtant, effrayant, il est un vide profond, omnipr\u00e9sent qui nous attire constamment, tout au long de l'anime. Cette omnipr\u00e9sence, cette fascination est telle qu'on la ressent m\u00eame \u00e0 travers la musique. \\n\\n\r\nPersonnages : 10/10\\n\r\n\"Oh, des personnages chibi, cet anime va \u00eatre adorable\" - Moi, avant l'\u00e9pisode 10\\n\r\nUne fois qu'on s'est habitu\u00e9s au chara design particulier (qui colle \u00e9tonnamment bien avec l'univers de Made in Abyss), on ne peut qu'appr\u00e9cier les personnages de cet anime\\n\r\nComplexes, entour\u00e9s de myst\u00e8re, trainant derri\u00e8re eux un pass\u00e9, les personnages sont directement influenc\u00e9s par l'Abysse.\\n\r\nSi on peut remarquer certains personnages un peu trop manich\u00e9ens (Bondrewd je te vois venir), on ne peut que rester bouche b\u00e9e devant la complexit\u00e9 des personnages.\\n\r\nLes enfants de l'orphelinat sont adorables, mais sont en m\u00eame temps conscients des dangers de la vie puisqu'ils les c\u00f4toient d\u00e9j\u00e0 en allant explorer l'Abysse, m\u00eame si ce n'est que le premier pallier. Inchou joue parfaitement le r\u00f4le d'une directrice d'orphelinat comme on nous l'a appris dans les contes, ce qui en fait un personnage \u00e9tonnamment agr\u00e9able.\\n\r\nLes Sifflets sont des personnes travaill\u00e9es, voire tortur\u00e9es. Elles ont vu l'Abysse, son c\u00f4t\u00e9 sombre. Elles y ont r\u00e9chapp\u00e9, mais d\u00e8s qu'ils y ont mis les pieds, ne serait-ce qu'une fois, l'Abysse a pris une partie de leur \u00e2me, les poussant \u00e0 toujours vouloir y retourner. \\n\r\nAlors que dire d'Ouzen, le g\u00e9ant in\u00e9branlable, un personnage fascinant et vraiment bien \u00e9crit ! Mentor, elle diff\u00e8re tr\u00e8s largement du sch\u00e9ma classique instaur\u00e9 par les animes, mais est pourtant un professeur in\u00e9galable.\\n\r\nQue dire \u00e9galement de Nanachi et Mitty ! Une histoire tragique, d\u00e9chirante et profond\u00e9ment humaine, qui aboutit \u00e0 un acte magnifique mais terriblement douloureux. \\n\\n\r\nEt bien s\u00fbr, n'oublions pas Riko et Regu, nos deux protagonistes !\\n\r\nRegu, gar\u00e7on mi-humain mi-robot, qui repart au fond de l'Abysse afin de comprendre qui il est, quelles sont ses origines mais \u00e9galement afin d'accompagner Riko dans son voyage\\n\r\nEt Riko, ah Riko ! Quel personnage formidable ! \\n\r\nSi son enthousiasme, sa petite bouille et son d\u00e9sir de retrouver sa m\u00e8re sont touchants, c'est surtout sa maturit\u00e9 et ses connaissances qui m'ont marqu\u00e9. \\n\r\nIl est difficile de trouver dans un anime un personnage qui r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit r\u00e9ellement, et use de ses connaissances avec justesse. Pourtant ici, c'est une fillette de 12 ans qui le fait.\\n\r\nEt si, bien s\u00fbr, elle se trompe et rencontre des \"d\u00e9boires\", c'est extr\u00eamement plaisant de voir \u00e0 quel point elle s'est pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et s'y connait (n'est-ce pas, la Pr\u00eatresse de Goblin Slayer ?)\\n\\n\r\nAppr\u00e9ciation : 10/10\\n\r\nJe ne me suis pas ennuy\u00e9 une seule minute. J'ai appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 chaque plan, chaque ligne de dialogue, chaque personnage. L'ambiance vraiment unique de l'anime m'a vraiment frapp\u00e9, j'\u00e9tais captiv\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque \u00e9pisode (c'est pour \u00e7a que j'ai fini l'anime vraiment vite !)\\n\\n\r\nG\u00e9n\u00e9ral : 10/10\\n\r\nJe pense qu'aujourd'hui, je n'ai toujours pas de mots assez forts pour d\u00e9crire ce que j'ai v\u00e9cu avec Made in Abyss. C'\u00e9tait vraiment...formidable. Chaque d\u00e9tail de cet anime m'a frapp\u00e9, m'a touch\u00e9 en plein c\u0153ur et m'a fascin\u00e9\\n\r\nJ'ai toujours eu une attirance pour la d\u00e9couverte, l'exploration, autant dire que cet anime me ravit compl\u00e8tement !\\n\r\nMalgr\u00e9 sa longueur, Made in Abyss a directement r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se placer parmi mes animes favoris, un top 10 amplement m\u00e9rit\u00e9 selon moi\\n\r\nM\u00eame s'il est r\u00e9cent, je pense qu'il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 devenu un classique \u00e0 voir absolument une fois dans sa vie\\n\\n\r\nMaintenant, il ne reste plus qu'\u00e0 attendre avec impatience la deuxi\u00e8me saison !\\n",

            "content": "Made in Abyss is an anime beautifully crafted by studio Kinema Citrus. It features characters with their own little unique twists, art in which every frame can be used as a background for your computer, soundtracks that you'd carry with you just to listen, and memorable characters.\r\nKinema Citrus isn't very popular, understandably - after all, they made some mediocre anime that normally features a 7/10; examples being: \r\n- Black Bullet (2014)\r\n- Yuyushiki (2013)\r\n- Gochiusa (2015)\r\nThey don't typically do a lot of action anime, and more inclined to and successful with the slice of life genre, and to anyone who bears witness to Kinema Citrus, prepareto be shocked: they delivered a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): The story is revolved around Riko, a young girl who is a Red Whistle, an apprentice Cave Raider - the most inexperienced of Cave Raiders - and Riko wishes to and aspires to be a White Whistle just like her legendary, famous mother, Lyza. The Cave Raiders constantly go in and out of the Abyss, a huge pit that dwells far into the Earth, holding relics and unique, and simultaneously deadly creatures.\\n\r\nThis concept expresses that of a huge imagination and I felt that the studio did everything right in their power in expressing the story as beautifully as they can. You can understand most concepts, and you might get lost a few times, but you'll have painted the general picture and perhaps hold an attachment to the creative ideas given to you.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): You can tell that most of it appears to be frame-by-frame instead of CG. Generally-speaking, frame-by-frame hand-drawn is better, but there are definitely a few moments where there is CG - and Kinema Citrus managed to make it blend well with the traditional art style. There's barely anything that looks out of place, and the animators sure deserve a commendation for the hard work they put into every detail. There are so many moments that you could just screencap and use as a background for your computer.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): An amazing, exhilarating soundtrack. There are two soundtracks that you'll fall in love with, those being:\\n\r\nHanezeve Caradhina (ft.Takeshi Saito)\\n\r\nUnderground River (ft.Raj Ramayya)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is incredibly unique and definitely fits the fantasy feel that you get from watching this anime. Whoever was in charge of sound effects was definitely trying to put as many sounds appropriate to try and attach the viewers to what they were viewing, and it worked generally well. Every single clink, every single tap, every single footstep and contact, you could hear and feel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The two main characters, Reg and Riko have their own quirks about them, and even then, the characters that surround them and are of less importance have their own special quirks about them. You'll come to appreciate each character you come across, even if they don't have quite a lot of screentime. Unique, every single one of them. However, it is due to this uniqueness that sometimes, there is too much emphasis on a character and you'll be expecting so much more from them, but they are definitely in-depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): The episodes just engage you, and with each episode, you just yearn for the next. There are short clips of the last moments of previous episodes at the start of each, so you'll be able to get the gist of what happened last time, and keep pushing on. It's so engaging, and all of the elements presented tie into that. You could feel as if you were there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 10/10. Congrats, Kinema Orange - I just hope you can keep up this much quality into what you cover.",

            "content": "I began watching this anime based on other films in the recommendation list which I have truly loved including Madoka and Shinsekai Yori. The general adorable and cute shows that slowly transition over to dark always get me. \r\nIn terms of the story I think it is overall very interesting, there are some basic troupes such as a memory loss which are a bit played out. But overall the story of adventurer and exploration seem to take front and center. Some of the initial character motivations are a bit weak, but they strengthen it with supporting lore over time. \r\nThe art and animation style arequite lovely making a sort of chibi meets fantasy element. Some of the creatures  movements are a bit strange, and some of the facial expressions are a bit generic, but other than that it is really nice. Along with it the music is great, but some of the sound effects seem to lack some of the weight of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are great and anyone down from Orth is great. Some of the initial supporting characters are a bit dry and unlikable, but those losers get left behind and only appear in small amounts. \\n\\n\r\nOverall a really great anime, and I look forward to second season.",

            "content": "- - Possible Minor Spoilers - - \r\n(Tried my best to avoid anything major, and phrased things to be less direct, stop reading after the first paragraph if you want to play it real safe)\r\nAlright, some basic things out of the way, first thing, this will by no means be a unbiased review, hell, no review should be, all opinion and so on. Second thing, this won\u2019t be very structured, additionally it\u2019ll very casually written, and mostly a lot of gushing, simply so I can explain why I enjoyed this show so much. I\u2019m not going to recap the story, but I\u2019ll also avoid directspoilers as much as possible, you don\u2019t need to have watched the show, but some things in this review won\u2019t make sense. One last thing, I won't be doing that stupid Art / Sound / Story / Entertainment / Overall Format, it boils everything down to the technical aspects,and poorly at that. Alright, let\u2019s dive in.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, before anything, I think it's safe to assume this we can agree show excels in all technical aspects. Those sweet Ghibli backgrounds, the music and sound design, fight choreography is on point, and hits feel impactful. The world building is fantastic, but everyone has already praised that, and if you've seen the show you know all this already. The stuff that really got me into the show, on top of the just well done execution, is everything else. First of all, I'm a character guy through and through, I love getting invested in multi-faceted characters that grow over the course of the narrative. Made in Abyss has me covered in spades on this front, as a large part of the show is focused on the interactions with each other, and the world, not to mention the growth or our two main characters, Riko and Regu. Riko and Regu are able to perfectly play off of each, Regu has the physical capabilities, while Riko has the intuition and resolve Regu lacks. Moreover, Riko is more passionate, while Regu is more sensical, and both are able to bring these traits to each other. While most of the season is focused on Riko, and her growth as a character, following Nanachi\u2019s introduction Regu is given plenty more room to grow. The character design is also top notch, with every major character being unique with a distinct silhouette. Characters aside, I love the setting of Made in Abyss, the entire aesthetic, which is hard to put a label on, and the Abyss itself. Given the very nature of the Abyss it lends itself to a variety of different environments which are both visually appealing, and provides new adversities for the characters to face. The soundtrack of the show also perfectly encapsulates the adventurous nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe second topic I\u2019d like to cover is the themes behind the show, which is to saying the meaning or message. This part is going to be really unorganized, as it's hard to explain what I mean by any of this without rambling. The central theme of Made in Abyss, is simply the strength of passion and commitment, even if is foolish and entirely illogical. Their longing for the bottom of the abyss it foolish, they aren\u2019t prepared, and any reason should persuade them otherwise, but it's human, the journey is driven by nothing but pure emotion. Ozen is the first major roadblock where this is brought into question. Everything she says during the brawl is logical and reasonable, they shouldn\u2019t continue their journey, everything is vien, but this stance lacks any humanity or emotion, and this is revealed following the fight as Ozen doesn\u2019t really believe in anything she said. Nanachi on the other hand, had her driving force unjustly ripped from her and resigned to like of passivity, Regu, is both able to physically, and emotionally deal with the weights holding Nanachi down. I\u2019ve already mentioned how the soundtrack works perfectly, but more specifically the OP. The lyrics alone cover everything I\u2019ve already mentioned, and how any challenges they face only furthers that drive. There's one part in particular I\u2019d like to focus on, around 2:15 - 2:55. At the end of the verse Miyu\u2019s (Riko\u2019s) voice drops off and the entire song slows down and becomes more somber, both lyrically and instrumental wise. Additionally, there are larger gaps of time between the two different vocalists.Nearing the end of this section, Riko\u2019s voice becomes more uplifting before both voices join back in unison with beat picking back and the lyrics also become more positive, if not more mature and aware now.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I\u2019m don\u2019t expect anyone to agree with everything, if anything, I said here. I simply put this down on paper as a way of explaining why I enjoyed this series so much, fingers crossed for a season two, and if I\u2019m reading the manga. Thanks for taking time to read this absolute mess of a review.\\n",

It is a masterpiece which overshadows all. \r\nThe artwork is phenomenal. The colors are mellow and not ridiculously bright, as is common in the majority of current anime. It is reminiscent of a watercolor painting that portrays calm ocean on an overcast day (that's what popped into my head lol). \r\nThe soundtrack compliments the story with pianos and orchestras alike fading in and out often. pulling on heartstring in sad scenes. yet making the blood boil during action sequences.\r\nThe plot is fantastic. it seamlessly  morphsfrom what seems to be a innocent story, to an simple adventure, to survival of the fittest quest, to a drama...then a dark drama-mystery.  Forget story arcs with filler episodes this series is one straight plot that feels as though it came from a very well written book. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to anyone children teens and adults.

The anime creates a very unique experience through an amazing soundtrack, amazing animation and a mysterious adventure through a giant chasm known as the Abyss, where many strange creatures live in all kinds of mysterious landscapes like forests which are upside down.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story of Made in Abyss starts in a town called \u2018Orth\u2019 which is built around the giant chasm known as the Abyss. Many explorers live in this town, trying to discover the mysteries of the Abyss and find the many treasures known as relics.

Thus far only 6 floors have been discovered, with the bottom of the Abyss still not being found. Because of the dangers of the Abyss explorers need to prove their skills, which is marked by whistles with a red whistle being the lowest level, only allowed to go to the first floor and the white whistles being the highest level, being allowed to explore as far as they want. The world building of Made in Abyss sets up for a great adventure with many new places being discovered and mysteries being solved. Questions like how the Abyss was created, why it is the way it is, how far down the Abyss goes or why the curse of the Abyss exists are recurring throughout the series. For example, human skeletons who are praying towards the middle of the Abyss seem to be found in several different places, which could have to do with an event causing the creation of the Abyss. The anime also deals with themes like existentialism with the robot-like boy Regu who does not know where he came from or what he really is. Unfortunately, the story leaves many questions open in the first season and many events are still left unknown because of that. However, the story is very good overall. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 9/10\\n\r\nMade in Abyss has a very unique art style, using a chibi like art style for the characters. Its character designs are overall very unique and fit the many different characters well. The anime also makes use of beautiful animation, animating the many unique landscapes of the Abyss in a very detailed manner, with its beautiful animation also seen in scenes like in the first episode, when the sun rises and shines over the city of Orth. The only real downside to the animation is the somewhat bad CGI used for some of the monsters in the fight scenes. However, the show looks very beautiful overall and is definitely worth watching if you want to see many beautifully animated landscapes. \\n\\n\r\nSound:  10/10\\n\r\nTo really create a very fitting atmosphere for the many different places in the world of Made in Abyss, the anime uses a variety of different soundtracks to really set the mood for the anime. These songs can give a real sense of a mysterious adventure through an unknown world. Even standing above the rest of the amazing soundtrack is the main theme \u2018Hanezeve Caradhina\u2019 used in several episodes of the anime. The voice actors also do an amazing job performing the voices for all the different characters. Through the voice actors, the different emotions the characters have during different moments really get conveyed well. Though the quality of music can differ from person to person, I would definitely recommend listening to some of the music of Made in Abyss, because of its outstanding soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters can be an interesting point to argue about in Made in Abyss. I would say that some of the side characters are even more interesting and better developed than the main characters. This is because the main characters, at the beginning of the anime, have a simple personality with a few different character traits, but many things unknown about their origins. Riko is the daughter of the white whistle Lyza and has apparently been born on the fourth floor of the Abyss, with many mysteries surrounding her birth. Regu is a robot-like boy who has unconsciously saved Riko from a monster on the first floor. He does not remember anything about himself, but it seems as he has been created or born somewhere in the Abyss. Riko is very energetic and pretty stubborn, being able to think pretty rationally during fights against monsters. Regu is a pretty strong fighter, although he is pretty shy and often unable to make quick decisions in fights. Through their different personalities the two main characters do make a good team. There are also some very interesting side characters, like Ouzen and Nanachi. Ouzen is a white flute who seems to have a very sinister character, who seems to have had a bit of a character change through living on the second floor of the Abyss for a long time. However, she also seems to have a good side to her character, willing to help the protagonists in their journey. Her backstory explains the way she acts to the characters for the most part, which is also true for Nanachi. Overall the characters are very good but leave a lot of room for improvement. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable anime for me. The anime has got pretty interesting characters, world building which makes you curious to learn more about the Abyss and it uses great animation and an amazing soundtrack to really get you involved in the atmosphere of the show and take you on the adventure the main characters are having. Some episodes did feel a bit slower though and it probably would add to my enjoyment if the characters would be developed somewhat better throughout the anime. However, it is a very enjoyable anime to see unfold overall. \\n\\n\r\nBonus Categories: 9/10\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nAdventure: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, Made in Abyss has created a very good atmosphere for the adventure it is having. There are a variety of unique landscapes being able to be explored with the animation and soundtrack really helping for the sense of adventure the anime gives off. You do not really know what to expect of the next landscapes to come on lower floors, with the floors beneath the sixth floor being totally unknown. There are also many relics to be found and there are a variety of different explorer classes, adding to the sense of adventure.\\n\\n\r\nMystery: 9/10\\n\r\nMany things in the anime are not (very well) known. The backgrounds of the main characters, the origin of the Abyss together with its depth and physics as well as the whereabouts of the mother of Riko. Only a few clues are given for some of the mysteries in this season, leaving a lot up to speculation. In the last few episodes of the anime even more mystery gets introduced, with the introduction of some new characters as well.\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (8,83/10)\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is an amazing anime and one of the best ones which came out in 2017. Its combination of adventure, mystery, great sound and animation, as well as a good story and some interesting characters make for a great anime. It will be interesting to see where the anime goes in its sequel, as many questions are still unsolved and the main characters still have a lot of room for improvement.\\n",

            "content": "Small child and astro boy go spelunking in a hazardous chasm of death While making casual pre pubescent advances on their sexuality while playing fiddle sticks with a cute bunny rabbit ramlethal from guilty gear.\r\n      Made in abyss is what every avid anime fan that wanted a break from the seasonal monotony wanted and more. The the art style immediately catches your eye with it's hand painted vibrant backgrounds with hardly any CG-i, which makes for a very refreshing viewing experience. The best thing for mewas the monsters, which if this were any other show as of late, they would be the first to be a computer generated flying fish monster plastered onto a 2d plane, but surprisingly they're all hand drawn and animated perfectly blending the monsters into the world they reside in, making the abyss feel very alive.\\n\\n\r\n      Cave diving is cool man. And seeing it get the anime makes everything more badass treatment, among other things really piqued my interest for this show. We follow the story of riko a 12 year old girl who loves cooking cave diving and concerning herself with her friends special places. She is accompanied by a tantalizing tin boy named reg who can extend his awesome robot arms and shoot lasers from his hand like iron man, and together they embark on a journey to the bottem of the abyss because riko feels like she is \"drawn\" to it. \\n\\n\r\n      Now keep in mind, nobody has ever reached the bottom of this chasm, not even full grown adults with years of cave diving and superhuman strength. But that's okay because luckily her half metal companion reg can safely help her descend the abyss with his grapply arms. but aside from the laser beam that puts him in a sleep for 2 hours. He has a hard time fighting off the abyss creatures on the 2nd layer. How will they handle the dangers of the next few layers? Well monsters.... don't really show up afterward.... shit\\n\r\n       They even pull out a big ol' map at the start of the show and how each layer has stronger monsters than the last and given' how much they hyped up up each area I feel like they haven't had as much conflict as you would expect after hearing how dangerous the abyss gets. I feel as how big of a world the creators made that they would flesh out each area much more and give more opportunity for the protagonists to adapt and get stronger with each descent, but instead they conquered layer after layer with little to no problem at all whereas with the most black whistle explorers it would be close to suicide.\\n\r\n         Going into the first episode I couldn't help but feel excited yet scared for riko to go on this journey. This show does a great job from the get go to get invested into the main characters and their friends at the orphanage to which riko grew up with and that emotional moment where riko leaves her friends( probably for the last time) left me in tears and actually care for the fates of these two main characters. Then there is suffering. You love suffering right? course you do! You've seen shingeki no kyojin! Now very edgy messed up scenes are hard to pull of without being forced and this show was no exception. The scene where riko get's poisoned by the orby creature and reg is forced to saw off her arm while she's brutally bleeding out of her eyeballs really only felt like a forced shock value scene more than anything given the drawn out nature of the whole thing. Like \"Look!!! she's dying. now she's dying even harder!!! man reg is taking a LONG time to saw her arm off O SHIT YOU'RE ALREADY HALFWAY THROUGH FINISH THE JOB. oh... well now she's just bleeding and crying in pain and hallucinating. Well ain't that some shit. \\n\r\n          This show's also got these weird undertones of sexuality towards kids. Riko likes to talk about reg's human chin chin despite them all being twelve year olds. One of the white whistles has a maid that... is a young trap character that riko and reg become intimate friends with... uhhh.. reg blushing because he has to wash the urine off the rico's clothing because well... she was dying and all..man this twelve year old girl took nearly exploding her entrails from the inside real well without having a mental breakdown or anything like that. The story with the bunny girl and mitty during their time with daddy daft punk was pretty sad... also reg popped an erection, and riko enjoyed it. the bunny is a pervert. and well, I guess that's my experience with this.\\n\\n\r\n    The music was really good.",

            "content": "This review  contains** SPOILERS**\r\nShinsekai Yori being my favorite anime of all time because of the unique dystopia setting , characters and godly worldbuilding I found the world in Made in Abyss fascinating and the whole reason that it caught my attention to watch this anime and  write a review for it. \r\nSince the first episode this anime managed to attract and introduce  its audience  to the characters , story and world. And things get better with each episode , it becomes an adventure told from the experiences and actions of our two main characters Riko&Reg.  Having a reason and purposeour two main characters venture into the Abyss to an unfamiliar world to them filled with dangerous beasts and consequences. It\u2019s a journey to find more about  themselves for Riko&Reg who venture deeper and deeper into the unknown Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nI like how the anime uses the journey of our two main characters for the worldbuilding revealing in each episode a bit of the mystery from the Abyss. Everything is done right  starting with the waterfall shot at the end of episode 1  which has done its job to build up your interest for the next episode and the steady revealing of the mystery surrounding the Abyss done in each episode until the end leaving its audience amazed and with a thirst for more. Being an adventure a lot of dangers and obstacles await for our two main characters in each layer of the Abyss as they go deeper they discover the fascinating world and his inhabitants :The cave raiders, the legendary white whistles, the society created there , the dangerous beasts, the vegetation etc. \\n\\n\r\nEach layer of the Abyss is like a challenge or step you must take in life to move on with your journey involving a lot of risks and sacrifices. Each encounter Reg&Riko  have with the many inhabitants from the Abyss help them discover more about the mysteries surrounding the Abyss and about themselves. They grow stronger with each encounter and help each other to become stronger and fulfill their initial goal. FANTASTIC! .The title \u201cMade in Abyss\u201d is very suggestive for our two main characters and for their journey because it\u2019s not about exploring the Abyss itself but to discover your own true self you must venture down into the dark abyss. A very poetic title worth praising the author for its innovative thought of choosing the name.\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters , they act natural in each situation they are curious and brave  have a mysterious past revolving on each of them and fit perfect in this adventure genre. Riko is a vivid and cute person who loves cave raiding, has an ambitious character to become a white whistle just like her mother Lyza and her energetic nature is contagious. Reg is a robot who met and saved Riko and lost his past memories having no idea how he ended up there in the first place.He is shy and not very confident in his own abilities. What is impressive about these two characters is how they act good as a duo and  how they remain faithful to their characters traits until the end. Ozen is one of my favorites and the best character from Made in Abyss because she is the type that does everything with a purpose taking on the role of the villain. Nananchi is a cute character who gave a lot of color to Made in Abyss  and the one who reads Reg like a book. Her strong point is that despite her appearance and the fact that it seems she fools around she knows very well what she does and remains calm in each situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is damn great exactly what an adventure anime needs , the animation and lyrics take you on a journey into the unknown and dangerous Abyss: \u201dLet\u2019s go together on a adventure into the Abyss!\u201d. The ending song is soothing and relaxing  and it seems that it whispers to you:\u201dLet\u2019s  take a break and rest because tomorrow is another day filled with adventure and excitement\u2026\u201d. The visuals and animation overall are godly. \\n\r\nThe beautiful colors fill the scenery and captivates your soul and mind , combined with the  soothing ost it gives you a peace of a mind it takes you into a world full of fun and adventure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Made in Abyss is a great anime with gorgeous scenery, vivid and bright characters, with a fantastic worldbuilding , great ost , a story filled with adventure and a lot of morals  to learn from it that I enjoyed watching it.\\n",

            "content": "Made in Abyss is a show that looks rather... typical on the surface. Cute child characters exploring various fantasy landscapes. But much like the abyss itself, there is far, far more to this show than meets the eye.\r\nOne of Made in Abyss' greatest strengths is certainly its visual direction. The world looks absolutely outstanding, with all kinds of locations that I've never seen anything even remotely similar to. This extends to the creatures that inhabit the abyss, too. Every episode is a delight when it comes to showing you new and interesting things. However, I did think during several points that the show was movingtoo fast for what it wanted us to see. There is indeed a second season on the horizon, but one or two more episodes in this season to slow down and let the world sink in would have been appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also a particular strong point. The premise, like those of most great stories, is simple; Riko and her companion Reg want to travel to the bottom of \"The Abyss\". But as the plot advances, more layers of detail and intrigue are added on that make what initially seemed like a simple adventure into much more. Each of the characters in the show is a joy to watch and they share fantastic chemistry, which is due in no small part to the voice acting. Every member of the cast is giving it their all and it shows.\\n\\n\r\nI'll cut to the chase. Should you watch Made in Abyss? Absolutely. You'll be enthralled by the gorgeous world and its inhabitants, and the story will pull you in hook, line and sinker, particularly in the latter half. I do wish it took its time more often, and there were some areas of the show that felt like they had far too much to show for the time that was allocated to them, but that's only a small gripe. Overall, this is truly a special show, and one you won't regret watching.",

            "content": "Watched Dubbed On HIDIVE\r\nThis review is short, but meant to be get to the point. Should you watch this show? Can you handle the juxtaposition of cutesy characters and gore? (This show is rated M for a reason.)  Any time I watch more than three episodes of a show in a row without pausing, I almost always automatically give it at least an 8. From the onset, this fantastical setting sucks you in, immediately culminating in one of the most beautiful money shots I have ever seen in anime  at the end of the first episode. The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous to listento from the opening notes. The actual drawings of the animation aren't super impressive opting for a cutesy moe-y style, but the lighting is so top-notch a viewer can't help but notice and praise it. The narrative naturally builds off each other and the character dynamics between Riko and Reg are endearingly straightforward. They truly are best friends, Riko as the excitable girl and Reg as the calm boy. It slowly adds to the world, and the deeper into the abyss the characters go, the more development they receive.",

            "content": "so made in abyss is another anime with a plot which is pure fantasy :D i felt like i was watching someone's imaginary world that him(or her) is making in his(or her) mind...i can't describe the feeling that well but the times that i've spent watching this anime were like being in the jungle which rains all the time and you have to wait so long for the sun to comes up :D\r\nP.N:i like pure fantasy to be honest...you can imagine what ever you want and make a world of your own with it...if i had the power of doing something like that...*sigh*\r\nStory 8/10: iliked the story,it was very good indeed but it lacks some important things...the story is a little slow at first and you have to pay attention to all of the characters talking because its a fantasy so you basically don't know any rules or any single thing about the characters and the environment which they exist in ...so this anime is about a little girl who was living in an orphanage,she is a Cave Raiders whose mother is a hero...Cave Raiders have something like levels(i guess?)red Whistle are the lowest and white Whistle are the highest..her mother is a white Whistle  and she lives her life to become like her mother,the strongest so when she finds her mother's message asking her to come down to the bottom of the abyss she makes a plan with a robot(another mc) who saved her life once to go there from the top :D...all people are living in the different lawyers of the abyss and people are not allowed to go where ever they want...apparently there is s curse that will make people sick :D the robot name is reg...so reg goes to this trip with her because he can't remember anything from his past life :D\\n\r\nas for the things that bothered me...the story is literally boring at first...you can see cute kids running around,messing around and thats it...for more than 3 episodes i was bored enough to tell myself that if the story goes on like this i will drop it and give it a 4 or 5 :D i know each story needs some grounds and basics but we have only 13 episodes in total so for basics 1 or 2 eps is more than enough...i started to liking this anime after episode 5 or 6 i think :D\\n\r\nand the characters...a good story needs interesting characters...both MCs are really good but not perfect to give them 10/10...they are interesting...funny...sweet...you know..kids :D *spoiler*the new characters which is traveling with them now seems interesting enough tho...i think season 2 is going to be better than this season for sure :D\\n\\n\r\nart 9/10: i loved the art...the animation was great really...cute+pretty characters all over the place :D \\n\\n\r\nsound 8/10: i liked the sounds...op and ed were really good i loved it...also the soundtracks were great *~*\\n\\n\r\ncharacter 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nRIKO: a girl who admires her mother and wants to be like her,she receives a message from her mother that says\"come and see me in the bottom of abyss\" so she decides to go there and the journey begins\\n\r\nshe is kinda good for A MC...funny,sweet,cheerful,full of life and energy....but she lacks some important things too...perfect mcs are hard to find :D\\n\r\ni think that they should have shown us the strong side of her in a noticeable way...i know she is strong,she never complains about anything because she chose this dangerous path herself :)\\n\\n\r\nREG(regu):he is robot with no memory...he was brought to the orphanage by riko because he saved her life,he wants to remember what happened to him so he decided to go on this journey with riko. he is a robot so he can't die because he doesn't have a heart apparently but he feels everything.,fear,sadness,...weird :D\\n\r\ni guess we get to know what he is eventually :D \\n\r\nhe is a good MC too...better than riko in my opinion :) he is strong,kind,caring and willing to do everything for riko :D \\n\\n\r\nNanachi:my favorite character here...so we don't know Nanachi's gender :) i think its a he lol :D at least it was a he i guess before all the experiments they've done to him :| \\n\r\nso he is a survivor of ascension from the sixth level of the Abyss,he becomes riko and reg's friend later on..the last 3 episodes were my favorite ones which he was there doing this and that lol :D\\n\r\nhe becomes one of the MCs next season hopefully :D\\n\\n\r\nso basically characters were really good but not perfect as i said before...if they were perfect the story and the anime would have been so much better than now :)\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 8/10: i was bored at first but you should give the story the chance of development...never drop an anime after at least you watch half of it :D\\n\r\nP.N: i learned that with stains gate lol :D\\n\r\nafter episode 4 or 5 the real story begins and

Everything from the art to the music is amazing, especially the art. I love the art style of this anime. On top of everything, this is one of the only anime I've seen that has almost made me cry. There is just so much character development and moments of caring between them that I haven't found in a lot of places except here. I wish I could go back all over again and watchthe anime without knowing anything about it. Now I need to read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

            "content": "Made in Abyss grabbed my attention way back when it was first announced with it\u2019s unique art on the teaser poster. However I didn\u2019t get around to watch it for quite a while, I finished it about 30 minutes before writing this review actually.\r\nSo what are my thoughts on it? Let\u2019s start the review.\r\n- S T O R Y -\r\nDespite the extremely thrilling premise that just yells ''GRANDIOSE ADVENTURE'', you really don't get any of that.\r\nThe characters barely go through anything yet progress so much due to the extremely fast pacing. The series is extremely telegraphed in that aspect, as you always know when Regand Riko face a big danger and manage to overcome it, they're practically at the end of the layer and will dive even further only for the same ''Explore a bit, get into a hopeless situation, prevail'' cycle to repeat.\\n\r\n Practically the whole series' plot can be summed up to the same length of the previous paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does introduce a villain by the end of the season as a set up towards the announced sequel but he is nothing but a textbook bad guy, since nothing screams evil more than ''Booo gruesome experiments on children''.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, the series have a lot of emotion in them alongside an extremely well constructed world with a lot of potential for further development.\\n\\n\r\n- C H A R A C T E R S -\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is full of visually distinct and memorable characters but a lot of them are extremely simple as personalities.\\n\r\nThey have no depth or any inner conflicts, what you see is what you get. What the characters say, that's what they think, what they say, they feel, there's never a moment of subtlety or expressiveness without mentioning what they're expressing with words outside of a major moment in the final episode.\\n\r\nAll of them have valid motives for what they're doing, be it sense of exploration accompanied with wanting to meet your mother who's waiting at the bottom of the Abyss or wanting to find out who you are. The motives don't feel weak but sometimes the conviction of the characters' does and unintentionally so.\\n\\n\r\n- A R T  &  A N I M A T I O N -\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely gorgeous, no other way around it. It's extremely detailed and atmospheric. The world couldn't have been portrayed better. The animation is good enough, although the quality jumps a lot.\\n\r\nIt's usually above average with plenty of double framing and that works, but out of nowhere it can get real smooth and dynamic when an action scene comes. Which wouldn't have been so haphazard... if... the smooth animation didn't occasionally show up out of nowhere on some completely arbitrary moments. It's kind of evident whenever a better key animator's turn comes around to animate a portion of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThat's a minor nitpick though. The smooth animation is welcome.\\n\r\nIt compliments the show's world as a whole and could be really expressive given it's quality if the characters just let it do it's own work instead of yelling out their emotions constantly.\\n\\n\r\n- S O U N D T R A C K -\\n\r\nThe OST is fantastic, it's extremely memorable and almost always played at the right moment to play with your feelings. The whole track list has that sense of mystery, beauty, sadness and adventure at the same time so almost every piece of the score can be used at any given moment and it'd fit perfectly.\\n\r\nThe compositions are mostly made of orchestral arrangements and medleys with touching vocals.\\n\r\nI do feel like the track ''Hanazeve Caradhina'' was played a bit too much (4 times in total) for what it was.\\n\r\nIt's the most special track in the whole OST so it should've been handled with a bit more care as it's amazing.\\n\\n\r\n- O V E R A L L -\\n\r\nI think Made in Abyss is a really good show overall with plenty of positives but is stopped from being the grandiose adventure it's supposed to be due to it's extremely quick pacing and lack of exploration. The characters sometimes feel like they literally fly past the Abyss' layers.\\n\r\nIt's definitely worth a watch though. When Season 2 comes around I'll definitely watch it.\\n",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free Review*\r\nMade in Abyss is an above average show, but by no means perfect.\r\nWhy is everyone giving it 9/10 or 10/10?\r\nBecause (A) This season had very few good shows and (B) It has an interesting premise and world, and an ending that makes you want more.\r\nBut Ookami, doesn't that make this a great anime, if it leaves you wanting more?\r\nUnfortunately not. MIA is slow, sluggish and drawn out, only getting interesting in 2-3 episodes. \r\nOverall: 7\r\nIt is an anime with a very interesting premise and world. It has a lot of potential, and I think later seasons could be great (after spending 80% ofthis season setting up future plot/characters/mysteries, they had better be).\\n\\n\r\nBut damn, Like seriously GOD DAMN, you can't just neglect and fail to develop an entire season in order to set up future seasons. It's just lazy, and screams poor writing/directing.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is that this whole season is a set up for later seasons. So by itself, it is quite boring. We get introduced to so many characters and subplots, none of which go anywhere that it just makes MIA feel boring. You shouldn't have to ''push through'' 70% of an anime to enjoy it. If the last episode hadn't made me tear up, I'd be giving this anime a 5/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nBoy and girl go on an adventure into dangerous place. Dangerous place is dangerous *gasp*. For those that will cry about the subplots; Yes the subplots are interesting, but they are left undeveloped in preparation for future seasons. A story that's left undeveloped isn't much of a story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIt doesn't have the beauty of Kimi no namae wa, but the art is still good.\\n\r\nThough I have to say Akihito Tsukushi's loli fetish and having young children get naked all the time is pretty fucked up.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nVoice acting is great. Soundtrack is good, but it's just not memorable. Unlike other anime, I don't find myself humming or singing the song randomly. I literally watched the last episode an hour ago and don't even remember a single song or melody.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nAside from Nanachi, characters don't really have any significant development, which for me is core in any anime trying to tell a compelling story about love/ loss/ death/ or suffering.\\n\r\nYeah, you can have main characters be optimistic and always positive, but there has to be a limit, you have to show they have more than one side to their personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nI did enjoy this. Though for a lot of it, I had to fight the urge to just skip large parts of it, simply because nothing happens. No character development, no action, maybe a reference that might become relevant in 2 or 3 seasons. Out of the 13 episodes, I really enjoyed maybe 3 or 4 of them, the rest were just something you had to get through to get to the good stuff.\\n\\n",

Go watch it now, you don't need to read the full review, it's so much better than 99% of anime. The staff that worked of it did a masterful job, everything is treated with such care that it's almost impossible to not be charmed by it.\r\nThis is my score\r\nStory: 9\r\nArt: 10\r\nSound: 10\r\nCharacter: 9\r\nEnjoyment: 10\r\nOverall: 6\r\nYou may notice something weird. Why the hell is the overall only 6 when the mean of the other scores is 9.5? The answer is simple, it's becauseI am a piece of shit, I like to point out everything that doesn't sit well with me about this anime, and I'm gonna do that now.\\n\r\nThe negative sides of Made in Abyss are pretty obvious as soon as you start watching it, the kids are written in an inappropriate way, with sexual innuendos surrounding them that reflects japan's inappropriate interest in pedophilic themes. I found myself being disgusted by that so I can't ignore it. The second reason why my score is only 6 is because this anime is about a journey into the abyss, which only just started, so basically we end the season at its start point. I have to rate the season as a whole, i think they should've done 24 episodes at least to go a bit forward into the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the positive sides. The story was crafted with care, love and passion. The world of Made in Abyss is complex, fascinating and beautiful. The characters feel genuine, they have natural bonds and act in a coherent way with their characterization. This anime is without a doubt a superior product compared to other anime, if I had to rate it without taking in consideration the negatives it'd be a 8, and I tend to keep my scores low, so trust me when I say you will enjoy this without a doubt.",

            "content": "\"Appearances can be deceiving\" is the phrase That comes to mind when I think of Made in Abyss. Despite the characters chibi appearances there is a very mature story running through it. \r\nThere is a giant hole aptly called the abyss that no one has ever seen the bottom of, and there is a community of cave raiders who have formed around it who delve its depth hoping to reach the base while also harvesting the treasures that lie in its bowels. The Abyss is no cakewalk though there are dangerous creatures that live in it and the landscape changes drastically the further one descends.Not to mention once one ascends they are stricken with the \"curse of the abyss\" which symptoms worsen the deeper one dives.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to try and drop the mortality rate, the community at the top of the abyss has developed a series of ranks denoted by whistles that tell you how far a person is allowed to descend with the status of the white whistle being the highest and having carte blanche on how far they can descend.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the upper layers near the surface is where we meet Riko, a red whistle which is basically a trainee cave delver.  While exploring Riko is saved by a mysterious robotic boy after being nearly killed by one of the abysses more dangerous creatures.  Riko takes the boy back to the orphanage she lives at as her mother one of the legendary white whistles has not been seen for years and is presumed dead. The robot boys name is Reg, and he has no memory of who he is but knows he comes from some of the lowest layers of the abyss. A letter from Riko mother arrives at the surface pretty much beckoning her to come to find her at the bottom of the abyss, and Riko heads off in search of her with Reg assisting Riko's descent with his capabilities. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the later episodes are rough emotionally, episode 10, in particular, I had trouble getting through a section because of the graphic nature, but I can't deny that it was handled well.\\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is very well done, the people who made it clearly put the time and effort into making and adapting it that I could sing its praises all day. For me, it's, not something I absolutely love so that holds it from a 10 for me but, I can not deny that this is a fantastic show and have no issue recommending it.\\n",

It's not that I against u guys that gave this anime such a highscore like 8-9 but I just can't find the enjoyment of this anime I think. I will just write some few things about this anime, so I will just go straight to the main problem.\r\nNothing was bad from the art or the sound. For me the problem is from the character and the story. I've no problem with other character but I just kinda hate this one main character Riko. I mean,they tried to dive into such a dangerous place (very very dangerous place I should say?) and she just walking around the place carelessly but relying on Reg to protect her every single time. I bet she can't even reach the second layer if Reg didnt join her party. Glad that she good at cooking and her knowledge about the abyss kinda help Reg. I knew that Reg can't go down without her and Riko cant go down without him, but still Reg do most of the things.\\n\\n\r\nThen the story. I don't know if I've a bad taste or what, but I can't find any enjoyment for the whole show. It finally got a little bit intense on eps 10-11 but then back to normal again. I've no problem with slow pacing story but I think the length didnt suit very well for a slow pacing anime. I know that all those long intro was necessary and we can't skip it but I think it will be better if they try to make at least 24eps instead of 13. Even if they're going to make a second season (bcuz the ending still hanging), still I prefer to finish it all into a single anime rather than making it into a 2nd season, bcuz this first season isnt very enjoyable FOR ME. Dont get me wrong. Its not a bad anime, but I kinda disagree with the hype \"it was a very good anime\" and gave it 9-10 score except u scored it high just bcuz everyone do it so u just wanna follow the hype lol. I didnt read the manga, maybe perhaps the manga was better than the anime, but this is my review about the anime not the manga.",

This show did it. \r\nGranted, I have a propensity for dark fantasy so take that as your basis for deciding whether to listen to what I say. What I CAN say with conviction is that if you liked Full Metal Alchemist:Brotherhood, this show has a similar feel: tech/fantasy mix, fascinating and unique world mechanics, beautiful art, but some harsh moments that can be hard to watch.\r\nTo some degree, my scores are a reflection of my immense relief to find something newfor a change, but I really think Made in Abyss stands up objectively. If I had to point to any single issue, it would be that the characters look 6 years old rather than 12, but it's an art style that I can overlook.\\n\\n\r\nThere's gratifyingly little fan service, enough that it doesn't seem like fan service at all (thank god... I'm so sick of crotches in my face). It has incredible powers, skill, capability, new worlds, new laws, new problems, and a wide and interesting cast. I don't know what else you could ask for. The only thing I'm left debating is whether to rate this as a solid 10 or not (sticking with 9 for now).",

            "content": "This show is astounding. It's about a girl named Riko who lives in an orphanage in a town beside a giant hole several hundred miles deep, full of mysterious artefacts of an ancient advanced civilisation, as well as giant monsters. One day she finds a robot boy whom she names Reg, and is given a message from her missing mother, saying that she is waiting for her at the bottom of the Abyss, prompting Riko and Reg to go on a quest to find her. However there's a curse on the Abyss that means the deeper you go, the greater the toll of traversing upwards,and it's made clear that the trip will only be one-way, as Riko will die if she tries to go back up from the seventh layer or below.\\n\r\nThe series begins as a cute and fun drama, but the mounting dread and ever-present knowledge that the trip will be one-way for our young heroine makes every episode progressively more heartbreaking to watch, especially when Riko is as well written as she is (though she frustratingly never really develops as a character given the things she goes through).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is astounding, far outclassing most KinemaCitrus anime, and the soundtrack, by Australian composer Kevin Penkin, contains some of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard. The beauty and the horror of the situation are harmonised perfectly without any kind of tone-clash, and the story is so gripping that it's impossible not to want to keep wathcin. The rabbit girl Nanachi is also a remarkable character in terms of her motivation, backstory, and development. The tragedy is however that her introduction, appearing exactly when she needed to to save Riko after a horribly infected and poisoned arm almost kills her, makes her initially feel more like a plot-device than a character. Reg however embodies this totally. He initially has no motivation at all for helping Riko (only later developing a crush on her), and seems to only exist to keep saving her every time she should have died... if not for his elongated arms or death rays and whatever other powers he might have that are just what is needed at the time.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Reg being walking plot-armour, the show frequently goes out of its way to torture Riko horribly, both physically and mentally, with the episode of her arm being poisoned and her bleeding out of her eyes, and ears while her hand swells to the width of her waist being extremely disturbing to watch, and the episode in which Ozen The Unmovable beats her and Reg up for no real reason, feeling like nothing more than torture porn. I get that the writer wanted it to be made clear how dangerous the situation is, but those incidents just felt like an excuse to torture Riko (and the audience) rather than progress the plot, which is really very slow in terms of describing what actually happens in the series. They are even more redundant when you consider that the giant monsters already show a sense of danger, and the sense of plot-armour that this would have involved could easily have been removed by including a character like Nat in their journey, then having that character killed by a monster part-way through. That way we would have understood the stakes of the situation without having to be put through what feels like hours of horrifying to watch brutal injuries.\\n\\n\r\nIt also feels like a huge shame that the archaeological aspect of the series's setting is never investigated; even the explorers of the Abyss are solely motivated by selling relics, rather than investigating them, and nothing is known about the Abyss's mythology or history. This seems both unrealistic (you'd have thought that the site would have been made a UNESCO World Heritage Site immediately after it was discovered) and feels like a waste of a good setting, since a lot of the mysteryies look unlikely to be solved in the near future. It also seems quite unrealistic that the orphanage Riko lives in forces children to go down exploring into the upper levels of the Abyss (where there are still monsters that occasionally show up to eat them). Surely this place should be shut down?...\\n\\n\r\nThere are also lots of awkward unfunny penis jokes in the series that ruin a lot of otherwise powerful scenes and are completely unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem with the series though is that it is almost entirely set-up for what is clearly a bugger story coming out in future seasons, but the good news is that Season 1 introduced so many mysteries and got me invested so much in the characters that I'm now absurdly excited for those seasons, at least one of which has been confirmed. Despite its faults the show is definitely an 8/10 and highly recommended.",

            "content": "Just thought I'd put in my two cents.\r\n(v minor and deliberately vague spoilers)\r\nStory: 6-7\r\nI think it started off fairly strong, introducing a vibrant set of characters and interesting world building. The concept of the abyss is very interesting. But then it sets up the highly unrealistic idea of Riko, a 12-year-old red whistle who's at the bottom of the rung when it comes to skill and experience, going to the bottom of the abyss. Only the toughest adults armed with powerful weapons can head down to the lower levels and survive, so why will Riko be able to? She also wanted to go in solo,with no weapons. Even on the first level, Riko is helpless against the red beast. How is she expecting to fight the more dangerous beasts singlehandedly? I couldn't believe the notion that she was that dumb.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the reasoning behind a centrepiece action which ultimately carries the series doesn't convince me, it really keeps nagging at me and makes it difficult to overlook. I'm not sure why I haven't seen anyone else point this out.\\n\\n\r\nEven with Reg coming along, I found it very hard to believe this as realistic, even if this is a fantasy series. There's a clear system established for determining who has enough skill to delve deeper into the Abyss. Riko isn't exactly indicated to be some sort of prodigy so when this entire system is ignored, I'm not going to be persuaded that her survival is feasible. Their sole defence is his blaster, something that knocks his ass out for two hours. Yes, two solid hours with a handicap and no weapon. Even then, they sped through several whole levels without too many dangerous incidents. And in all of them, Reg is the one who manages to get them out safely. \\n\\n\r\nI think the Nanachi arc saved the story for me and pulled the score up from 4-5 to 7. It's packed with emotion and is solidly done, allowing the story to end off on a high note. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I had an issue with the unrealistic storyline, but the Nanachi arc allowed it to redeem itself to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nGreat visuals in general, with lots of detail. The animation was also fairly smooth. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved the unique OSTs, which set the atmosphere of the story very effectively. The OP and ED were also fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nFor some reason, the story likes to introduce characters and focus on them for one or two episodes before forgetting about them completely. \\n\\n\r\nAs aforementioned, I had issues with Riko's character. I know she isn't intended to be stupid, but she comes off as such. Reg is cool, I enjoyed his character. Nanachi is my personal favourite, being highly interesting and well-written. Would've liked to see more episodes on her.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6-7/10\\n\r\nDespite the flaws in the series, there were also aspects that I enjoyed. Wouldn't have put it as anime of the year for me, but definitely had the material and potential to be if the issues I had were addressed. Would definitely check out the manga\\n",

            "content": "I'm writing this right after finishing the show and really I only finished the show because of it's high rating and the MyAnimeList and r/anime groups thinking that this anime is the saviour of this season. But if not for these two communities upping the anime, I definetely wouldn't have finished it and after watching it through now, I don't think I would've missed out on much.\r\nFirst off, lets start out with the parts of the show that I thought were good. The final episodes, though not perfect were better than the excurciatingly slow beginning/middle of the anime. The final episodes, starting realistically from somewherearound episode 10 is where the real shocking part of this show surfaces. It starts to become incredibly disturbing. Now while, yes, the things shown were disturbing, I ultimately felt there wasn't much point to them by the conclusion of the story or atleast the conclusion of this season. But, nonetheless these moments were exciting in a sort of horror movie jump scare type of way. But, the show could've focused more on stuff like this than what they were showing in the beggining of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the bad parts of this for me can be summed up in it's bad/mediocre animation, boring/muddy artstyle, and the character dynamics between RIko and Reg (the main characters). The animation for one thing is incredibly inexpressive. Shows that I would consider expressive would be shows like Death Note, Hyouka, Zetsubo-sensei, Konsuba, and many many more. The things that these shows have is differing animation for different moments. Sometimes the characters might become chibi or they might get more detail for some effect or maybe there would be a close-up with increased animation for a movement or some stretch in the body for comedic effects or whatever. But Made In Abyss, this isn't the case. It felt the same whether they were fighting, hugging or whatever for a majority of the show. One example would be when they have this big haggard looking guy that comes looking for them and when he hugs them goodbye, I didn't really feel any emotional impact because I don't think it was expressed through animation in any meaninful way. Anime like Wolf Children, Garden of Sinners, and even World God Only Knows has better emotional hugging from the animation. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the artstyle too is just boring. It's pretty much just this dirt color with character designs that are extremely simple, even all the adult characters. When I first saw Riko's mother, I was frankly dissapointed. The simply artstyle is used well in other places like Madoka Magicka where there are scenes where it becomes much more abstract and the character designs then are in comparison fine (still not a huge fan though of the character art in Madoka)\\n\\n\r\n The characters are also a big problem. Riko is just unlikeable to me and her personality and her drive to go to the abyss seems artifical, like the writers needed her as a conduit to move the story forward and thus any scene with her felt kind of weird, cause I don't really see any chemistry between the heroine and the other characters. Now, disliking Riko is something that might just be personal to me. I don't know why but I don't like her positive attitude and the weird ass motif of her wetting her pants (I get it, this show is realistic and abrasive and all that but you don't have to keep showing it if there's no real point to it) and her obsession with the abyss. I found one character, Nanacci to be pretty decent (though not her design) and probably would've been better for the story if more of the focus was on her, atleast for more episodes. Another character that felt like bait to the viewers to sympathize/like was Ozen. I bet some people liked her and all that but like every other minor character, she just felt like filler to try to move the characters/story smoothly to lower levels of the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nI find there's so much just small things about the show that I had issue with while watching it and after finishing it, i'm incredibly compelled to write my opinion, regardless of how unpolished or unpopular it is simply because I don't think this is a special anime by any means. There are shows that are more philosophical (Kino no Tabi, Serial Experiments Lain, paranoia agent), there are shows that are more disturbing (Kaiji, Madoka Magica, Kakegurui,berserk) and there are many many more shows with better pacing and plot. \\n\\n",

But it's something people worth finding out the truth. The curse of the abyss. Lyza lost. \"What's down there?\" The story about Riko going deep to the abyss to find out her mom condition. Simplicity is all about. But it ALL fits PERFECTLY. Even the story is not that good but the author did an amazing job fitting those little pieces together and it fits so well.\r\nYou know what I'm talking if you already watched :3\r\nCharacter: 9\r\nNanachi my favourite<3 . The character is marvelous! The bonding Riko and Reg together working as a team . Relying each other. At first Riko is just a childish little girl can't do anything herself. But HEY GUESS WHAT? She did something ALONE when Reg fires his incienerator. Protecting Reg along the journey. No ecchi, cringy and weird moments. (Riko have the courage to ask Reg to break her hand ._.you have my respect Riko )\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nWhat I say fits perfectly! The sound OST of this anime is Masterpiece. It's just awesome. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThis kind of anime visual art is my favourite. I'm a fan of Hayao Miyazaki movies. And this anime art looks exactly the same. The background, village, trees, greenish grass\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAww man It's sad to see that there won't be a season2 but hopefully this anime gets popular in Japan so they can make a season2 for it. #GOMADEINABYSS\\n\r\nI love this anime to the down of the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating: 10",

Beautifully detailed art and animation, a soundtrack that sounds like something out of a Ghibli movie, and on top of it all a deeply compelling story hinting at something greater. I could write an entire book about my own speculations to the plot and attempts to detail the lore of the universe that Tsukushi has created.\r\nFair warning though, don't be fooled by the outwardly cheery nature the art style and sense of adventure bring. The rating is R+ for a very good reason. While it makes sense contextually and is censored toa degree, there is an uncomfortable amount of underage nudity, a shocking amount of blood and gore, and of course the psychological traumatizing of children. At times, it really seems like some old guy's sick pedo torture porn fantasy (I personally have no doubt of this actually).\\n\\n\r\nAnd though, while I do severely doubt the moral integrity of its creator, that's really the only criticism I have of Made in Abyss. Looking strictly at it from a creative point of view, it really hits all the sweet spots of a scifi adventure. Robots, strange creatures living in a strange undocumented world, lost parents and tragic backstories, extremely driven main characters who will use any means possible to reach their goals, and most importantly, a cute bunny girl.",

I find this to be a complete masterpiece i was hesistant towatch it because of the art style it seemed too childlike for me but never judge a book by its cover the most cliche of things to say but you should always live by that rule. Everything about the anime is amazing and it gets better as it keeps on going it doesnt lose the lustre it has from the first episode to the last. The characters from riko the main female mc to reg to ozen to nanachi(She is adorable) it just gets better and better and it ends with adding a new person. This anime is unique it brings something new to the table if not that then it reinvents the old and makes it completely fresh if there is one anime this season you need to watch its this i cannot stress it enough. Episode 9 onwards the anime was just a masterpiece   i hope it gets greenlit for another season because the journey is too good to leave the viewers hanging i really would be genuinly interested in purchasing this on whatever i can its really that enjoyable of a series. I dont want to only be positive but theres hardly any negatives in the entire 13 episodes and if i could think of one it's probably that riko is a little to eager to do things and sometimes it ends up leaving her in a fucked up position but thats not really even an issue because the way they handle it and tie shit down together. \\n\\n\r\nYou better watch this Damn series.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "(No Spoilers) (Holistic review)\r\nMade in Abyss is a anime that talks about a city next a big hole called \u201cThe Abyss\u201d. The \u201cAbyss\u201d is a unknow underground place divided on 6 layers (that the human know), everyone with different aspects, with different creatures, plants. \r\nThe Abyss has a powerfull curse, he creates effect on the human body depending on how deep you rises from him. The affects on the firsts layers are nausea, after hallucinations, after blood from the ears /eyes /mouth and deeper he have death /destruction /madness. In some point is considering \u201cImpossible\u201d for a normal human being to return from the deepestof the Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nInside the Abyss we can find multiple types of relics, like \u201cmagic objects\u201d, and we have people that goes deep in this Abyss to bring this relic to surface achieving famous and money, this \u201cfamous and money\u201d are so important the that hierarch on this city turns around the people that can reach the deeps of the Abyss, the most respescted people of the city are the \u201cWhite whistles\u201d: people who could reach the deepest of the Abyss and return alive to tell the secret.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first coating of our plot, all this information is showed in the first two episodes with a good pace of narrative, I said this is the first coating, because we the plot revolves around the interaction of the Abyss with our character (our second coating on the plot).\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are Riko (13 years old), the daughter of the white whistle Liza (the mom, that Riko wants to find, but we truly do not know how deep Liza is on the Abyss ), a Red Whistle (the lower rank on the society of the adventures, that can only go on the first layer of the Abyss) who on her Abyss exploration finds I humanoid robot called Reg (apparently 13 years old too), a robot with a good amount of power, resistance and intelligent, but with no memory of the pass, in orther words, we do not know the origin of Reg (but is kind of obvious that he comes from the abyss).\\n\\n\r\nThe set is clear, with Reg power and desire to know about himself, Riko together with Reg go down the Abyss to find her mother.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot and character dynamics on Made in Abyss is the fusion of this heavy atmosphere that The Abyss create and the desires of our characters. It\u2019s a kind of obvious, but in Made in Abyss The Abyss itself is a element so strong in the creating of our characters development, and on the creation of the atmosphere (and the responsible for the immersion of the anime), that a I can only associate this strong cosmologic aspect on the anime Mushishi (2005, of the Director Nagahama Hiroshi). The Abyss creates his onw rules and creatures in a such strong way, that I can only argue that The Abyss is a cosmologic entity like the Mushi\u2019s on Mushishi world.\\n\\n\r\nThe way that The Abyss decides which scene is for drama, or for the struggle, or for the appreciation, is so powerful, that we can not imagine our characters outside of this ambient. The Abyss on the anime is always portrayed as the most important thing of the humans beings (especialy for the explorers), and for us (wachters) The Abyss becomes the most important thing for our artistic appreciation. I can only sum up The Abyss in a \u201cbeautiful mystery\u201d (almost like life ka ka).\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the characters are two kids inside this Abyss, their dreams are embedded with The Abyss rules and creatures, Riko has a burn spirit, the true spirit for a Explorer of The Abyss and Reg is as mysterious as The Abyss, but someway the characters sounds less like a \u201cbeautiful mystery\u201d, and more like normal happy characters we are used to. Sometimes you feel some dissonance with the childishness of the characters and the Abyss multivalent atmosphere, I do not know if this is purposeful, but I can say two things about this dissonance:\\n\\n\r\n1- In the beginning, this childishness is kind of cute, but sometimes you do not feel this aspect fits on the atmosphere of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n2- After some episodes (specifically, after ep 7-8) you can feel that the \\n\\n\r\nAbyss shapes our kids, the connection between then turns more clear and mature, and even the roles and the initial motivation grown up. And this is slow narrative aspect, and this maturing is the mark of the Director (Kojima Masayuki), Monster and Gunslinger Girl (especially this one) are two anime that we can feel that slow paced and we see some this slow characters maturing themselves (again, Gunslinger Girl is all about that I would say). \\n\\n\r\nI would say that characters development is too slow, but thanks to the Abyss we have one final break of this childishness on the second half of the anime (As I said beginning in the 7-8, and the perfect break point on the ep 10).\\n\\n\r\nEverything I said could only be possible, because the art and sound of the Made in Abyss is stunning, the easiness to immerse on The Abyss atmosphere is the product of the art, never too dark, never too bright (you can see a good use of the shadows and lights, the insertion of this elements are very accurate) , we can see that the scenarios is not static, we can see the movement of the plants, little animals, water, the scenes transpired life. We have a scene on the ep 2, when Rico shows the city next to the Abyss to Reg, and like Reg, we can feel how this world is stunning and vivid.\\n\\n\r\nSome things I could say about the soundtrack, Yamada You (the sound director), the same of \"Kimi no na Wa\" and \"Garden of the Words\", hits the target on Made in Abyss. In this kind of immersive anime, I prepare myself for something more chill, traditional and slow paced song (without complex arrangement, just simples and clear sounds, like on Mushishi soundtrack), but in Made in Abyss, the Mystery of the Abyss fits perfect on this contemplative soundtrack, the soundtrack is more emotional, like every scene on the Abyss is a new discovery, the creation of something new every time the characters interact with the Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nThe lyrics and rhythm of the opening fits perfect on the spirit of a adventure of kids (Riko and Reg) on a hard world like the Abyss, but on the first episode we are introduced to the Abyss and introduced to the song called \u201cUnderground River\u201d . The same goes on a specific flashback on the ep 8 (soundtrack named \u201cHanazeke Caradhina\u201d) where we see the a perfect harmony between a good song, a good art and even a good dubbing.\\n\\n\r\nThe dubbing is kind of different, our main, Riko, is dubbed by a young seyiuu (Tomita Miyu), the same of Gabriel (of Gabriel Dropout), Otako (Oshiete! Galko-chan) and Kuina (Hinako Note). She feets Riko young and energetic side, her voice while crying is very good. \\n\\n\r\nWith Reg we have Mariya Ise, again another seyiuu that knows how to give life to a young character, but with some mature aspect (considering that Reg is in some way more realistic and cold than Riko), she was Misaki of Hyouka and she was Eureka of Pokemon YX .\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see good voice, prepare yourself, in this show in have Lelouch Lamperouge, Onzen is Lelouch Lamperouge, the best voice of the anime, deep, strong and sharp, I can say that the voice Sayaka Ohara fits perfect on the atmosphere of The Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the only problem with Made in Abyss is the slow paced narrative and character development, Kojima always create this on me, sometimes I do not know if we have some evolution the plot or in the characters, because the narrative is so slow, detailed and holistic. But I can say that the Made in Abyss is the young brother of Mushishi, so is a anime that have a foundation on immersion, good art, good soundtrack and I perfect cosmologic aspect.",

Do not skip over this anime because of the art style - Made in Abyss does tell a very serious story which it quickly makes apparent. \r\nWe get to see the world of Made in Abyss with childlike wonder through the eyes of our main characters.  It brings us back to a time when we believed we could do anything with just our hearts and a dream.  We root for our main characters as they encounter test after test, form emotional bonds with others, and struggle to achieve their dream.\r\nIt'sheartwarming and heartbreaking.  Thrilling action is punctuated by emotional crashes and buildups based on hope and care.  It's the kind of thing where you sometimes just want to hug a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music are both splendid and probably key to Made in Abyss's amazing emotional content.  Character and relationship development are also very good.  Altogether, Made in Abyss is great experience.  There are lighthearted scenes, great world-building, and pretty deep emotional impact packed into just 13 episodes.  Highly recommended to watch, because you will definitely enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough... when you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back.  Just what lurks in that darkness, and what becomes of those who venture into it?\\n",

            "content": "Made in Abyss, The dark horse of the season, and probably of the year. There was something about this anime that made me look forward to it, before the season even started. And surely, it did not disappoint. It became one of the most memorable anime of the year, probably one of the best fantasy anime I've come across and easily the anime of the summer. \r\nMade in Abyss is a breathtaking adventure that paints the explosion of a creation's imagination with a story that is dark, depressing, interesting, unpredictable and EXTREMELY creative. The fear of the unknown, not many shows I can say havepulled it off as good. The setting of the abyss, it's layers, the concepts such as the curse of the abyss, whistles of cave raiders, and the different creatures and the way those creatures work from a fantasy standpoint to a biological standpoint are so well thought out and structured, hats off the creator Tsukushi Akihito, who did outdid himself creating such a detailed environment that is unpredictable, grand, scary, confusing (in a good way) and claustrophobic. I love the pacing of the story, it progresses significantly better with each episode but it's never too much that you can't digest or too less to not fill you up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make the show a lot more fun, they are cute and provide comedic relief, especially two of the main three, Reg and Riko who get most of the screentime. But although they look cute I must say some of things they do and their experiences, their background are quite mature, almost quite depressing. I don't want to spoil and I'm not going to but There is one scene in the second half that really fucked me up. I knew I was in for something dark but that was beyond anything I had expected. The side characters and the ones they meet in their journey are pretty interesting as well, they all have something unique which makes it notable that they are part of that environment, they are diverse and what they offer to the story is quite interesting, I gotta say about all their dresses, it's kind of like a mix of modern and historic design.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is fantastic as well, Probably the best work of Kinema Citrus. Beautiful landscapes, great usage of color, they've done justice to the microscopic detail of the abyss, The action scenes really show the effort they put into each frame, it's just smooth as fuck. Don't even get me started on the musical score and insert songs, they had this english song playing in the first episode, it automatically tells you shit is going to be epic! some of the sound effects like when reg is blasting his hand ray or whatever it's called and that extra bass sound that they give when they're trouble, it adds so much to the overall experience. The voice acting is too cartoony though, especially notable in Ouzen's character, but it kinda works, almost like it is perfectly blending a kid show with something that a kid shouldn't be anywhere near of.\\n\\n\r\nMy only problem with this anime is that I was left wanting for more, I would've preferred this to be 20+ episodes and with the momentum and popularity that it has been buiding throughout the course of the season, I'm sure it would have helped the studio that is yet to make a commercial super hit, This might be the one for Kinema citrus. And each episode has like a four minute outro and the two minute ED which took away 6 minutes of the entire episode, gladly it didn't mess with the overall pacing of the show. \\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss does a great job balancing it's light and dark elements and providing content that is both grand and heavy, executing it almost flawlessly that resulted in a show that is simply pure value for entertainment. Do yourself a favor and go watch this stunner.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating - 9.25/10",

            "content": "This is a good show and certainly worth watching, though I definitely have some qualms with it.\r\nThe absolute best thing about this show is the world, Akihito Tsukushi has created a unique, memorable, vibrant world within and around The Abyss and I want to learn more about every small detail that gets introduced fleetingly or otherwise. What brings down the overall story in my eyes is that the characters who are the focus don't interest me terribly. I do want to know more about Reg but I'm not compelled by Riko's story. In fact one of my larger problems with the show is Riko's defenselessness.She is clearly not suited to travel the Abyss (to be fair that is kind of the plot) but to a point where it's almost comical how easily she is able to navigate downward despite constantly being told \"oh you'll die in like 10 seconds in the third layer!\" only to have Reg robo their way through it while she sits idly by. If you want to show her growth as a character then do more to show her trying, failing, learning, and succeeding rather than immediately yell for Reg and have him sort out literally everything except cooking. I'm glad she has a defined personality but her recklessness only got her in serious trouble once from what I can remember and while she doesn't escape the season free from harm she does seem to have some serious plot armor. I'm not saying that I need to see characters maimed and punished for their actions, but when you stress how dangerous the creatures of the Abyss are I expect that a reckless character diving deeper into the Abyss will learn and grow more cautious as the episodes go by, something that Riko does not do in the slightest in this season.\\n\\n\r\nOne character who tried to have her exercise more caution, the white whistle Ozen, was one of my favorite characters despite that fact that I kind of hate her. In fact Ozen succeeds because I hate her character as she denies typical mentor tropes. In general the few white whistles we've seen have captivated me because of how much they break the mold of typical role models for main characters, the two that we learned the most about were pretty despicable which makes me curious as to how Lyza will be portrayed when we finally begin to learn more about her outside of the brief flashbacks we have received. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest drawback is the show's weird fixation on children's genitals. I'm not going to mince words they focus far far too much attention on Reg's penis. And Riko's urinary habits. In fact if they were to just utterly remove those scenes from the show I would likely rate this an 8/10 rather than a 7/10. The scenes are just too prominent, occur more than a single time, and are frankly uncomfortable in a way that doesn't feel intentional the way certain other scenes do in the back half of the season. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless I will happily watch a second season and just have to do my best to ignore the inevitable scenes where an adult meets a robot child and immediately stares down his pants. Or the inevitable scenes where the three prepubescent main characters get naked and prod each other and ask the same genital related questions for the 4th 5th 6th times. If you think I'm stressing this too much then just wait until the show beats you over the head with it episode after episode. I don't blame anyone for dropping Made in Abyss for these reasons. \\n\\n\r\nI can also understand the people who, despite my feelings, believe this show is outstanding, it has a lot of good things to mention. The individual layers of the Abyss are like something out of a Monolith Soft world and are all unique from each other and from other media. The creatures in the Abyss and their ecosystem are fascinating and we only get little glances at them. Nanachi has a tragic and compelling story and I want to see it play out even if it doesn't end happily (as I suspect it won't because this show took a Gen Urobuchi-esque turn that I was kind of expecting but was still welcome). Nanachi's arc, which was introduced late, was easily the most compelling thing that I felt the show had to offer aside from the world building. The orphanage above the Abyss isn't terribly interesting but I do want to see where they're going with the birthday disease. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before Made In Abyss is worth your time but it is not without fault. It is a good show that is set up to have a second season better than the first and could easily make the step into being a series that I believe is great.",

            "content": "Made In Abyss...Was It Good?It is but I wouldn't say It's influential and I think the studio behind it abuse or overworked too much of the character design to bring its potential and to make the character look innocent and really pop your eye but rather say It ended just appropriate, acceptable with tons of cute overdose.\r\nStory (Rating 7.25)\r\nCon:\r\nI would say the story pacing was well done after the first four episodes but for the first four...honestly It felt too quick for me even so the series spoke about what could the viewer expect to see in the series, for example, ambitious goal from themain character in a very fantasy like dangerous setting filled with flesh-eating predators,rather gore-like moments,short but clear nudity scenes and a potentially important supportive character who would do anything to protect the main character. But it felt a bit rushed and gives away a lot of immersion of what the viewer would expect of the series.I would say the story was quite simple to understand and wasn't hard to digest consider it made clear that the main character would suffer greatly from the adventure she's experiencing due to obvious protection, her robot partner that clearly states he would do anything to protect her and visual clue's the series gave that crippled my expected immersion of what I'm about to experience.\\n\r\nPro:\\n\r\nHowever, the Pro is that the show had barely any filler and much more focus on the supportive event that heavily lead to the main goal of the main character.The individual, key story and elements of the show carried out greatly as each event from the show take the time to explain how this would lead to the seemingly never-ending path to the main character goal.The anime also lives up to the genre the fans expected to have like mystery, adventure and a slight comedy.\\n\r\nArt(Rating 9.0)\\n\r\nCon:\\n\r\nThe art style especially the background was absolutely beautiful and aesthetic giving much depth and really show us the environment and surrounding the main character experience until we, ourselves as the viewer can imagine the wonder and terror she sees in her eyes,but it was rather quite bland and so far I could say the greens lack proper bright level as some are too dark and some are too bright and it also lacks variety of colours to really pop my eyes.To say the show really captured me,It really did,but to leave me speechless was not quite true,the only thing which I ever found to be a different colour in the greeneries was the odd flowers but it rather sticks out like a sore thumb rather than part of nature which clearly disturb my immersion.\\n\r\nThe art also doesn't really pop my eyes as the depth of the certain object that we're to be interact with characters was confusing and doesn't really look like eye-candy material.Also, the character design rather looks immature and awkward to pair well with the background.I get the character design was to identify them as innocent children so much so make them embarks on a dangerous adventure really makes its an interesting setting.But I would say keep their thin bodies, tone down on the innocent and put a decent semiotic shape and the character looks much more dazzling and likeable.Also adding a rain setting to the show that could feature on a certain episode, especially if they're on the move or running away from the predator would add very much immersion.Even so, the overall the rating I gave was an astounding 9.No more, No less\\n\r\nPro:\\n\r\nTHE ART LOOKS LIKE GHIBLI'S.That is the short answer.\\n\r\nThe building and the construction of naturally formed trails, the blue skies, The unfurnished and realistic texture to the walls to a cover of A book.This is hard work and detail bursting out of the series in motion.The studio really cared and they know the charm of this series is visual.Watching any Anime with low resolution can really take away the enjoyment.But Made In Abyss... It's almost like a taboo.In another word, you just crippled the major impact this show about to shove at your face.Not sure what to say more but Detail, Detail,Detail and Detail.(And Hard work)I also find the art was really smooth towards the changes of themes and the CGI uses is fine and appropriate.The design of Each character really do represent their emotion but I personally would like more detail.The scene is quite memorable if you like greeneries and some scenes leave you breathtaking.In another world Detailed, Fluid, Appropriate And Fitting.\\n\r\nSound(Rating 7.4)\\n\r\nPros: Can't really say anything due to the fact I never were interested to listen carefully if the actors really gave their all or not.But at least for me, all character especially the main and the supportive sounded just fine.Although some voice's really spot on with the setting of their character.\\n\r\nCon:\\n\r\nThe OST and the soundtrack played sound amazing and really give you a  bliss sense of adventure.Although I would say some sound or soundtrack of the key introduction of visual find it lacking, ruining expected atmosphere that you speculated.And the OP and ED wasn't memorable at all but rather likeable due to what you have experience watching the show.\\n\r\nCharacter(Rating 9.0)\\n\r\nCon:\\n\r\nThere's nothing much to say about the flaws in the setting of the character even the main and the following supportive.However I do find that some character lacks depth especially the friends who aid the main character, I also find that the main character is quite reckless and immature due to her excessive optimistic trait followed by her trusty robot partner who also had the similar trait.Both of them simply survive due to their experience and conventional knowledge.However when it comes to a situation like a predator attacking and events that they never saw or coming, illustrated them that they have no proper plan to counter with it.Often time..the robot uses his secret weapon that can easily backfire in the future if not careful.Also, lead to a certain horrific event in episode 10 and much less dire but similar outcome to the event in the previous episodes.\\n\r\nPro:\\n\r\nThe character clearly show's flaws and strength that they had in themselves in the first few episode making it easy to anticipate the problem they would face but rather hard to predict the outcome.The main character spunky, optimistic, know it all trait helps lighten up the mood from the constant threat posed by the environment they exploring.Her trusty robot shows a clear sign of solid and robust duty he had to protect the main character at all cost, at the same time show clear human personality, emotion and feeling with very human-like thinking.Even so, they barely know each other, they trust and never turn their back on each other making every situation looks like a common miracle.It also appears that there is no clear character to properly fill the role of villain or antagonist adding more depth and relatable character to the show.The side characters do not appear to occupy so much of the show, and the supportive character really fill their role to help the protagonist to pursue their goal.Every character also doesn't feel like a hunk of feeling and personality trait.\\n\r\nEnjoyment.(Rating 8.5)\\n\r\nI absolutely agree you should watch this anime.Even the people who are not interested in the Japanese animation medium will likely to enjoy this show anyway.I myself would most likely to re-watch this anime again.Even though this anime would not most likely be influential, I would say the character design and the Art style will flourish in the viewer's heart for A very long time.It is unique and enjoyable.",

            "content": "~~~~~ENGLISH & ESPA\u00d1OL REVIEW~~~~~ [9,4/10]\r\nI started to see Made In Abyss because it had gained in its first episodes a certain popularity in the most critical world of the anime for its interesting history and world, and in relation to this its world-build.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nGoing by part, the story of Made In Abyss is extremely creative, versatile and respectable with the rules that the series establishes, but despite this it maintains throughout the series its atmosphere of mystery and that magical air despite the different twists of nuts and moments of 'shock' that it has. Everything starts in 'Orth' a city that was built next toa huge hole in which the background is not known and is intensely researched by subjects called 'Cave Raiders' who are researchers / warriors / survivors of the dangers of the abyss, these Cave Raiders are divided into 5 classes which are called 'Whistle' plus a color forward (red-blue-lunar-black-white). Throughout the series, the plot changes a lot, starting as something very magical, to advance in a science fiction environment and end up in a very dark environment. But what I value is that 'Made In Abyss' does not force this at any time and everything flows at a perfect pace in the narrative and every situation that passes has a cause previously warned and with an enormous respect for its own rules without falling into conveniences, such as the Deus Ex Machina, a mysterious help from nothing, something unimportant that has happened before without clarifying that it leads to a senseless help in some aspect, among others ... All the ideas that make up 'Made In Abyss 'as the idea of \u200b\u200bthe abyss in layers, with a well-armed magical realism, and the' Cave Raiders' system is extremely creative and interesting, in turn all this is used in a precise way to properly exploit your world, layer by layer without staying so long there to result in something overloaded, or without being unnecessarily fast, and most of the operation of each layer had been previously explained, without passing a detail. This shows that the writing and direction are sublime, in addition to being creative and interesting that engage the one who sees immediately regardless of the story arc. There are people who complain that the world of Made In Abyss is an exit trap like a mysterious box, but I do not see it that way, because the good world-build that it possesses makes it irrelevant, in addition to the fact that the abyss itself is the main plot of the story, that argument would work if something irrelevant to the plot kept you hooked, but it is not so for what argument, also the mystery is something that adds to make everything more interesting. On the other hand, Made In Abyss adds many points in its history for its originality, it has a world that has never been seen, it mixes genres, the concept of Cave Raiders and its system is very creative, the idea of \u200b\u200bthe abyss with influences of literature Classic and magical realism of Ghibli are also very original. And the concept of adventure unfolds very well, as they exploit every part of the world and as I said above, the regulation system of the series is very remarkable and it hooks you to the plot without you feeling empty at some point because they know how to give you information at a good pace, perhaps the third layer if it is more empty but taking into account that the rules and operation of each layer have been explained and still give you information, I do not think it is negative to give more importance to what would be to the arc of Nanachi.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is possibly the strongest section of Made In Abyss in a complete way, visually the direction is splendid and it mixes painting techniques and a beautiful drawing that makes everything very attractive visually, as well as the environmental art of each layer in the which, the use of lights / shadows or the use of colors make the immersion even better compared to the construction of the world.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound / soundtrack / ost of Made In Abyss is amazing, the sounds used work very well, but the soundtrack is impeccable that would work not only as a soundtrack, but as an individual music album, being varied in genres mixing neo-classical, folk, touches of electronics and Japanese folklore very well crafted, plus the arrangements are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the weakest section of the series, but it does not mean they are bad, they are very good, but they fall short sometimes. Although each character does contribute to the plot to elaborate it and have several facets to acquire a good empathy towards them, sometimes they tend to waste all their potential, besides that Reg could have given more, it is not something that criticizes much. the importance of Reg in the story that is elaborated later, but other than that is fine. In addition both protagonists complement each other very well, learn from their mistakes, and make good decisions despite how hard they could be. Another problem of the characters, is that most are not three-dimensional characters, although if there are 2 that are (Nanachi and Bondrewd), the majority remains in two-dimensional, it is a fact that they are not flat and that they contribute to the plot, but potential is often wasted, as with adults. I agree that the lack of adults or rather, their lack of presence seems strange, although the world states that the Cave Raiders have a rigorous training to survive, I feel that the potential of adults as a guide in difficult situations such as Ozen It could be better used. Although Reg and Riko are children, it does not seem like a bad concept, because it is precisely used well as even criticism and message. In addition to that the co-protagonists do not lose the balance of an innocence of someone of their age as Reg to be somewhat fragile personality or curiosity of their world, but in turn have those aspects of preparation of cave raiders that allow you to take good decisions.\\n\\n\r\nOthers:\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the Reg's Joke, is a joke that is irrelevant to the plot for good and bad, on the one hand does not hurt the plot, but on the other it takes seriousness to certain situations when the context don't need it. And for obvious reasons is an awful joke.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion is that Made In Abyss is an excellent series, that although it has its faults, it has a lot to contribute to the modern anime, since it has the artistic sense, courage and originality to be able to develop a good and interesting plot, but at the same time without losing his excellent art that is something that constantly strikes us.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4/10 = 9/10\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEmpec\u00e9 a ver Made In Abyss porque hab\u00eda ganado en sus primeros episodios cierta popularidad en el mundo m\u00e1s cr\u00edtico del anime por su interesante historia y mundo, y en relaci\u00f3n con este su mundo de construcci\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYendo por partes, la historia de Made In Abyss es extremadamente creativa, vers\u00e1til y respetable con las reglas que establece la serie, pero a pesar de esto mantiene a trav\u00e9s de la serie su atm\u00f3sfera de misterio y ese aire m\u00e1gico a pesar de los diferentes giros de frutos secos y momentos de 'shock' que tiene. Todo comienza en 'Orth', una ciudad que fue construida al lado de un gran agujero en el que el fondo no es conocido y es intensamente investigado por sujetos llamados 'Cave Raiders' que son investigadores / guerreros / sobrevivientes de los peligros del abismo, estos Cave Los incursores se dividen en 5 clases que se llaman 'silbido' m\u00e1s un color hacia adelante (rojo-azul-lunar-negro-blanco). A lo largo de la serie, la trama cambia mucho, comenzando como algo muy m\u00e1gico, para avanzar en un entorno de ciencia ficci\u00f3n y terminar en un entorno muy oscuro. Pero lo que valoro es que 'Made In Abyss' no lo fuerza en ning\u00fan momento y todo fluye a un ritmo perfecto en la narraci\u00f3n y cada situaci\u00f3n que pasa tiene una causa previamente advertida y con un enorme respeto por sus propias reglas sin caer en conveniencias, como el Deus Ex Machina, una misteriosa ayuda de la nada, algo sin importancia que ha sucedido antes sin aclarar que conduce a una ayuda sin sentido en alg\u00fan aspecto, entre otros... Todas las ideas que componen 'Made In Abyss' como la idea del abismo en capas, con un realismo m\u00e1gico bien armado, y el sistema de 'Cave Raiders' es extremadamente creativo e interesante, a su vez todo esto se usa de una manera precisa para explotar adecuadamente su mundo. capa sin permanecer tanto tiempo all\u00ed como para dar lugar a algo sobrecargado, o sin ser innecesariamente r\u00e1pido, y la mayor parte del funcionamiento de cada capa se hab\u00eda explicado previamente, sin pasar ning\u00fan detalle. Esto muestra que la escritura y la direcci\u00f3n son sublimes, adem\u00e1s de ser creativas e interesantes que comprometen a quien ve de inmediato independientemente del arco de la historia. Hay personas que se quejan de que el mundo de Made In Abyss es una trampa de salida como una caja misteriosa, pero no lo veo as\u00ed, porque la buena construcci\u00f3n del mundo que posee la hace irrelevante, adem\u00e1s del hecho de que el El abismo mismo es la trama principal de la historia, ese argumento funcionar\u00eda si algo irrelevante para la trama te mantiene enganchado, pero no es as\u00ed para qu\u00e9 argumento, tambi\u00e9n el misterio es algo que se agrega para hacer que todo sea m\u00e1s interesante. Por otro lado, Made In Abyss agrega muchos puntos en su historia por su originalidad, tiene un mundo que nunca se ha visto, mezcla g\u00e9neros, el concepto de Cave Raiders y su sistema es muy creativo, la idea del abismo con influencias de la literatura El realismo cl\u00e1sico y m\u00e1gico de Ghibli tambi\u00e9n es muy original. Y el concepto de aventura se desarrolla muy bien, ya que explotan cada parte del mundo y como dije antes, el sistema de regulaci\u00f3n de la serie es muy notable y te engancha a la trama sin que te sientas vac\u00edo en alg\u00fan momento porque saben c\u00f3mo para darle informaci\u00f3n a un buen ritmo, tal vez la tercera capa si est\u00e1 m\u00e1s vac\u00eda pero teniendo en cuenta que las reglas y el funcionamiento de cada capa se han explicado y todav\u00eda le dan informaci\u00f3n, no creo que sea negativo darle m\u00e1s importancia a lo que ser\u00eda para el arco de Nanachi.\\n\\n\r\nArte: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEl arte es posiblemente la secci\u00f3n m\u00e1s fuerte de Made In Abyss de una manera completa, visualmente la direcci\u00f3n es espl\u00e9ndida y mezcla t\u00e9cnicas de pintura y un hermoso dibujo que hace que todo sea muy atractivo visualmente, as\u00ed como el arte ambiental de cada capa en la que, el uso de luces / sombras o el uso de colores hacen que la inmersi\u00f3n sea a\u00fan mejor en comparaci\u00f3n con la construcci\u00f3n del mundo.\\n\\n\r\nSonido: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEl sonido/banda sonora/ost de Made In Abyss es incre\u00edble, los sonidos usados \u200b\u200bfuncionan muy bien, pero la banda sonora es impecable y funcionar\u00eda no solo como banda sonora, sino como \u00e1lbum de m\u00fasica individual, variando en g\u00e9neros mezclando neocl\u00e1sico, folk, toques de electr\u00f3nica y folklore japon\u00e9s muy bien elaborados, adem\u00e1s los arreglos son hermosos.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLos personajes son probablemente la secci\u00f3n m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil de la serie, pero no significa que sean malos, son muy buenos, pero a veces se quedan cortos. Aunque cada personaje contribuye a la trama para elaborarlo y tiene varias facetas para adquirir una buena empat\u00eda hacia ellos, a veces tienden a perder todo su potencial, adem\u00e1s de que Reg podr\u00eda haber dado m\u00e1s, no es algo que critique demasiado. la importancia de Reg en la historia que se elabora m\u00e1s adelante, pero aparte de eso est\u00e1 bien. Adem\u00e1s, ambos protagonistas se complementan muy bien, aprenden de sus errores y toman buenas decisiones a pesar de lo dif\u00edcil que pueden ser. Otro problema de los personajes, es que la mayor\u00eda no son personajes tridimensionales, aunque si hay 2 que son (Nanachi y Bondrewd), la mayor\u00eda permanece en dos dimensiones, es un hecho que no son planos y que contribuyen a la trama, pero el potencial a menudo se pierde, como con los adultos. Estoy de acuerdo en que la falta de adultos o m\u00e1s bien, su falta de presencia parece extra\u00f1a, aunque el mundo afirma que los Cave Raiders tienen un entrenamiento riguroso para sobrevivir, siento que el potencial de los adultos como gu\u00eda en situaciones dif\u00edciles como Ozen podr\u00eda ser mejor utilizado. Aunque Reg y Riko son ni\u00f1os, no parece un concepto malo, porque se usa con precisi\u00f3n, incluso como cr\u00edtica y mensaje. Adem\u00e1s de eso, los coprotagonistas no pierden el equilibrio de la inocencia de alguien de su edad como Reg por ser algo fr\u00e1gil, la personalidad o la curiosidad de su mundo, pero a su vez tienen esos aspectos de la preparaci\u00f3n de los asaltantes de cuevas que le permiten tomar buenas decisiones\\n\\n\r\nOtros:\\n\\n\r\nOtro problema es la broma de Reg, es una broma que es irrelevante para la trama para bien y para mal, por un lado no da\u00f1a la trama, pero por otro toma seriedad para ciertas situaciones y da\u00f1a el contexto. Y por obvias razones es molesto.\\n\\n\r\nMi conclusi\u00f3n es que Made In Abyss es una serie excelente, que aunque tiene sus fallas, tiene mucho que aportar al anime moderno, ya que tiene el sentido art\u00edstico, el coraje y la originalidad para poder desarrollar un argumento bueno e interesante, pero al mismo tiempo sin perder su excelente arte que es algo que constantemente nos golpea.\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 9,4/10 = 9/10",

            "content": "Every year or so, there come titles which seem to push the anime industry further and further to being more than what many perceive it to be. \r\n2017's Made In Abyss (MIA as I will be abbreviating it through this review) seems to fit that mold and then some. With beautiful and expressive animation, gorgeous art, wonderful music, all within a world of characters and narrative which make it a true stand out among it's contemporaries. And the best part... There's only one season out at the time of this review with a second on the way. And if this first entry into the seriesis any indicator, it will continue to be great.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way I could fastball pitch MIA's to anyone is this: If HP Lovecraft, Don Bluth and Hayo Miyazaki were to given the task to craft a narrative production together, this would be the end result. And through it's 13 episode run, we get that just as you'd imagine it to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story is built around the mystery of the eponymous setting of the Abyss and how our two main characters, Riko and Reg, discover it's many secrets and mysteries on the path to find Riko's mother said to be down in the Abyss. What the two face are wild dangers and many revelations that reveal much about the Abyss and the lives they grew up in. That's as much as I can go into without diving into spoiler territory. But through the narrative, there's a great utilization of show don't tell when it comes to the setting. A wondrous bit of mystery overtakes each scene. It always leaves you wanting to research and learn more. And every step it takes is so convicting.\\n\r\nThe characters are all also wonderful. While some do remain a bit on the under-developed side (hopefully Season 2 will rectify that), you still feel their impact and remember their name and face. And the characters we do see develop and grow are some of the best written in anime or any form of fiction. The more we see them go through and learn, the more intriguing and likable they become. And boy do these characters go through ALLOT!\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in the series is also gorgeous. Nothing seems processed and instead painted on and pops. Lots of great lighting, color, and vibrant style to it all to help bring a sense of beauty and often times horror to the world. The animation is also nice with great, expressive characters, non-stotic animation and movement and a design choice that really helps to contrast to the tone of the series overall giving it that extra bit of uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of the best soundtracks in anime. Kevin Pelkin (who previously did work for Under The Dog), really gets to shine here. Great choir work and wonderful instrumental all throughout. All with a great OP and ED. All his songs give me goosebumps and should prove to the same effect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Made In Abyss may have some shortcomings due to it's 13 episode act, leaving some characters and plots left to dangle, but with the announcement of season 2, it should prove to expand upon those elements and the other narrative elements even more. I really enjoyed this series all in all and 100% recommend anyone check it out. (Warning: The series can get pitch-black dark and depressing much of it. So if you're not into that, either give it a pass or be warned)",

            "content": "When I watch a fantasy anime or read a fantasy story, I want to learn about the world that is being introduced to me. I want to explore the inner depths of everything that is present in this world, I want to know how people survive there, what the rules and guidelines are, but most importantly, I want to see how this world functions in the first place. Made in Abyss does all of this and more. \r\nFrom the very beginning, the show had me completely immersed in the world and characters. The way we are first introduced to the Abyss (and the world ingeneral) is not by a narrator explicitly telling us what it is and how it functions, but by observing by ourselves how the Abyss functions on a day-to-day basis, and how normal humans interact with it. This immediately adds an exciting, yet slightly intimidating, layer of the unknown to the world. The way the show set it up had me craving more instantly, and wanting to understand how exactly everything functioned. \\n\r\nThis is what I want to see with fantasy worlds, something that is special in its own way and not just a generic universe with magic and some goblins. The animals and plants that are inside the Abyss are all unique in their own way and seem to actually function and corporate together like a real, proper ecosystem, and each individual layer of the Abyss is exclusive to its universe and always kept me excited for what was happening next. Throughout the entire show, I was constantly rooting for Reg and Riko, anxious for their survival, and apprehensive as to how they would deal with new challenges. The writer was truly a genius and made sure that each part of the Abyss had events that were natural set up and different for each layer. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that almost all the characters (and both of the main characters) were all children definitely helped set the overall tone for the series. Children are generally curious, and it does make a lot of sense to put them into a world that is filled to the brim with mysteries for them to figure out on their own. Reg and Riko were very compatible with each other, and they were designed in such a way that made them balance one another out. Both of them had very fleshed out and well-defined personalities. The supporting cast was, in general, fairly forgettable, but I enjoyed watching Reg and Riko interact with them, anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was amazing and really fit with each scene. I was constantly listening to the OST weeks after I had finished the show, it was just that good. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was breathtaking and complemented the nature of the Abyss. On the surface, the art style was cute and bubbly with characters that had chibi like proportions and faces, however, it could just as quickly turn dark and gruesome. The backgrounds were amazing, and the characters were very expressive and lively. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the only thing that I was dissatisfied within Made in Abyss was the fact that the ending was open-ended, and cuts off halfway through the manga. Other than that, though, the show was amazing. It was able to deliver a very emotional impact on me and exceeded my expectations. It had great strengths in almost every catogory, and very few, minor weaknesses. It serves as a great example that all fantasy anime should follow, I would absolutely reccomend the show.",

            "content": "Out of 100 Nobles watching...\r\n97 were impressed!\r\n3 have some child safety grievances.\r\nMade in Abyss is a 13 episode anime adaptation of a manga of the same name with it's rampant success thankfully green-lighting more to come. The story tells something close to about half of what the manga has covered so far and has done so extremely faithfully ,and at some points it did so in more detail than the respective scenes in the manga did. There were some minor story elements and side plot that seemed to be added as I didn't come across it in the manga however it was wonderfully done, enrichedthe world, and I'm sure the manga's author Tsukuchi Akihito gave the additions and changes a go ahead or suggested them himself to promote a more cohesive story.\\n\\n\r\nI will address a few aspects that may have stalled my enjoyment of MiA as the story seems to either receive harsh criticism or overwhelming praise. There is very little I have to complain about with this show. First, the plot is very straight forward and that isn't a bad thing. While it is simple and seemingly a linear goal for our protagonists it still manages to get muddy as to just WHAT Riko and Reg are seeking to achieve on their journey though. My only real complaint with this world is that every adult in the story seems to just be totally cool with this 11-13 year old girls perilous death journey, but in a way every persons fervor and acceptance of the harsh world they live in could be explained by the pseudo-eldritch aura the setting gives off.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, let us address all the child nudity and dialogue. I think the only grievance to be had with this work is that Tsukuchi's depiction of the sexuality of budding adolescence is done well enough that it would make anyone feel a little uncomfortable. To me it just reminds me how sexually weird and awkward I was at 12 which is uncomfortable at worst and goofy at best. Still, if nude kids or dated child abuse tier punishment of children seriously bothers you then this one probably isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow all the just strictly good things:\\n\r\nThe best i can describe the setting is a Tribal-tech society with something close to the beginning of the industrial age levels of development. The art is in a style I have coined for a lot of things like Gargantia or Granblue in that I call it \"Square Enix Concept Art\" style. It's that watercolor/ink-like soft coloration. The highly detailed outfits, characters, and backgrounds, and the overall cozy feeling in every part of these settings that make them perfect for me. If you're like me and Tribal-tech and Squeenix Concept Art style coming together is a one-hit K.O. than you will likely enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nI could write more, but I don't want to make this any longer than it is. There is a books worth to write on this one and it honestly deserves it. \\n\\n\r\nI laughed. I cried. I was literally curled into a ball gripping a blanket so hard my knuckles were white. I felt physically ill at some points...\\n\\n\r\nPretty good. Watch it.\\n",

            "content": "When I first heard this anime, it is a strange thing to see from what I saw. A chibi looking characters having a bizarre journey to the some kind of hole. What kind a hole is it? This kind of hole reminds me Kola Superdeep Borehole. One of the most deepest artificial points on earth. Although it is unknown what inside on it. Perhaps its empty. People sometimes call it 'The Well to Hell' although it is hoax. However people still believing it this urban legend from years to years. Since many people still unable to reach deep in the surface. Due it is verydeep, and the temperature reaches 180\u00b0C. Sometimes geological anomalies were found.\\n\\n\nThis makes people having an open suggestion. Open interpretation. What is this? Is this a gateway to hell? Or what we call it Abyss? When I first heard this anime once again, I was kind like, \"An anime about hell? Wow so cool!\" But my thoughts were wrong. Abyss wasn't a place where we heard it from bible, Quran, or something about our religion tells what it looks like. Abyss, it was a mysterious hole that connect to the underworld. In underworld, many strange phenomena were found. From creatures, plants, all other strange living things, relics, and of course, a treasure. Since Abyss is the hole that contains source of life, people can go deep into Abyss. Those people call it Divers. The more deeper, the more impossible to get out. The best and bravest of the Divers, the White Whistles, are hailed as legends by those who remain on the surface. \\n\\n\nHere we know Riko. The most annoying character that I see, having a dream that one day, she could swim to Abyss in order to search her mom who already known for the missing White Whistle, The Annihilator and wishes to become like her mother and explore the furthest reaches of the Abyss. Since she is a Red Whistle. It is impossible to reach deep into the Abyss. However, she then discovers a strange humanoid robot. She then called it Reg. Reg reminds me HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. However its feeling more human nature that sometimes I'm always thinking is it a boy? It even have *cough* pen*s *cough*. It is very emotional robot. It even cry that make me shed to tears. It has the most emotional impact of the story. So lets change it from 'it' to 'he'. Yes, he is a boy. The only thing that artificial is his hands, his helmet, and maybe his eyes. It remains a mystery. Where is he come from? My speculation leads to the Abyss. Considering his hand could be multifunctional. From shooting to lengthening the hand. He is the most useful tool for Riko to explore the Abyss. And so the adventure begins. There will be many events and tragedies during the journey. Journey to the center of the Earth. Explores the mythical creatures, artifacts, and other. And of course it is an amazing anime. \\n\\n\nThis anime almost reaching my true score of masterpieces. 10/10!! But since the journey unfinished, I can't rate it higher. Currently waiting for season 2. I'm hoping it will not being a disappointment. And one thing for sure, the soundtrack is AMAZING!!! 10/10!! It makes the story soo touching, thrilling, and feel the sense of adventure. An unexpected journey and others. A truly must watch for you if you love adventures.  The journey is about to begin...",

The story is so simple, yet compelling, what lies at the bottom of the Abyss? The fantasy world created here is one for the ages, every scene is filled with such a breathtaking mystique that it cannot be adequately described, only witnessed.\r\nStory:\r\nThe temptation of the unknown is strong, and Made in Abyss strikes that yearning hidden in all of us with an expert hand, weaving an enchanting backstory entwined with memorable, human, characters. Like the Abyss itself, the plot begins with lighthearted themes andtypical anime earnestness, and slowly peels away at that facade to reveal the full breadth of its message.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nMade in Abyss looks wonderful throughout, with a style and flair that reminds me of Studio Ghibli films like Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke. I especially appreciate the water color form some of the creatures take in movement, which was a brilliant and tasteful way to efficiently create animation without resorting to CG that can often ruin immersion.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music that flowed along with the pacing of the story was beautiful, enhancing rather than distracting from what was occurring on screen. Props to whoever put those pieces together.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nRiko and Regu are two of the most adorable, yet equally rich, characters I have encountered in fiction. The bonds they form with everyone around them feel genuine and believable, and the audience is given little choice but to become deeply invested in their well being.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the supporting cast are brilliant in their own way, from the mysterious Ouzen to the dulcet tones of Habo, many of them would be deserving of more screen time if not for Riko and Regu.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nCertainly a contender for strongest anime of 2017, Made in Abyss hides its blinding greatness behind a chibi mask that may ward off some, PLEASE GIVE IT A CHANCE to show you itself!",

            "content": "This review won't contain any spoilers. Also, I will make it as clear and concise as possible.\r\nI'll admit I wasn't sure about this anime at first, and yes, it was because of the looks. The premise was appealing to me, but the characters felt somewhat childish. I thought, \"This may be boring to me.\" Thankfully, I didn't allow myself to be fooled by appearances. I'm sure many people could feel the same when considering if they should give this show a chance.\r\nI will not say this anime is a masterpiece, because I think that would be exaggerating (although the next chapter of the story couldround things up). In fact, I think this show may be a little overrated. However, what an adult like me can expect from Made in Abyss (and let me clarify, this is not a children's show), I think it provides. What I mean, plainly, is this:\\n\r\n- A journey of discovery about the mystery of the Abyss: its nature, its unique wildlife, the enigmatic relics buried in its depths, the relentless \"Curse of the Abyss\"...\\n\r\n- Innocent main characters (they are children, after all), nothing too special about their personalities, that the show complements with darker backgrounds in some other characters. \\n\r\n- The show and the nature of the Abyss appear simpler at the start, like the children we follow, but things get more complex and interesting as we go deeper into the show, and into the Abyss.\\n\r\n- A variety of emotion-packed moments and scenes: warm, funny, thrilling, chilling, sad...  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed this anime plenty. It promised adventure and mystery, fantasy and realism, drama and warmth... and I think it delivered. Whether it could have done better or not, I'll leave for you to decide. My personal opinion is that some things would have been more appealing to me if they had been a little bit different, but I don't want to delve into possibly irrelevant details (and spoilers). After all, that's a matter of taste. Ultimately, I enjoyed the journey I experienced, and the last episode left me wanting to watch more, to know more. I hope we will receive a second, exciting season as soon as the source material allows. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, appearances can be deceiving. The show itself reminds us this more than once. So think twice about rejecting this show if you like the genre. As we descend and discover more about the story, the Abyss and all the characters, the show reveals itself as a piece of entertainment that is more full than it looks.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is the second review I have ever written (first being on Toradora).\r\nMade in Abyss is a \"seinen\" anime meaning that the anime is for adults. Personally this is my favorite anime of 2017. It is produced by Kinema Citrus the same studio that brought us Black Bullet (2014).\r\nMade in Abyss at a glance seems like a cute adventure anime but as the anime progresses it starts to reveal its underlying dark and perilous journey. The anime starts with two young orphans exploring caves while searching for relics to give to their orphanage so they can keep for display or use for profit. \r\nThe animeis centered cave raiding and exploring for relics or treasures. There is a giant pit in the center of the city that is broken down into 7 layers, the further down you traverse the more dangerous and life threatening the environment and beasts become. MIA gives you subtle hints of what lies underneath each layer which is where it's mystery comes in but you don't quite know exactly what lies down there until you get there.\\n\\n\r\nRiko and Reg decide to go on a quest searching for Riko's mother a prestigious cave raider whose existence is unknown. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that makes this anime interesting that separates from others is the fact that the conflict is actually the dangerous of the Abyss itself rather than there being an main antagonist.  There is also a lot of love and care about each other between Riko and Reg which keeps the viewer emotionally invested as the anime explores themes of friendship, trust, sadness, and death.\\n\\n\r\nI found the story to be very intriguing making me want to binge watch each episode right after the previous one had ended. A downside to this series is it's still on going meaning the anime ends on episode 13 with an incomplete story that is presumably going to continue with a following season.\\n\\n\r\nA large portion of humor used in this anime is sexual situations among children, which in all honesty seems fitting given how children can be immature (a reoccurring example of this being how Reg is a robot but he has a realistic penis, as he also has human features). The issue with the humor used in this anime is it sometimes conflicts with it's serious tone breaking the tension of danger.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value of this anime is really good. It's not the best I have seen (in my opinion No Game No Life looks better) but I was surprised after the first episode how good the series looks and blends well with it's sounds and sound track. The style this anime uses looks like high quality chibi animation with vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the top of my head this the 2nd great adventure anime I have seen the 1st being No Game No Life and I would say in terms of enjoyment and production value it goes head-to-head with NGNL, the one area where I feel MIA excels at is keeping you intrigued in its mystery wondering what's going to happen next. I feel like pacing of MIA is perfect, it's neither too fast nor too slow.\\n\\n\r\nOne disclaimer I do give people interested in this series is prepare themselves for blood and gore and intense scenes. Instead of happening right away it instead tries tries to ease you into it making each episode more life threatening than the previous one. It does reach levels of disturbing and for me personally it made one scene unwatchable making me fast forward the scene. The blood and gore, however, never feels unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate this anime as a 9 out of 10. Making it just as good or better than No Game No Life and also marking this as my favorite anime of 2017.",

            "content": "Check Review video: https://youtu.be/SZwovZLsPsE\r\nThere are many aspects that contribute to the mysterious beauty that is Made In Abyss. One of which is the first thing you'll experience going into the introductory episode. The incredibly detailed and beautiful environment, influenced by the original creator of the story Tshukushi Akihito which embraces or should i say swallows up the viewer.  But personally one of the better aspects had to be the scripting and writing, for one the narration that was done my Maaya Sakamoto, is one of the best I've heard in a extremely long time. It not only did a magnificent job reinforcing the mysteryand drama through out the story but it wasn't overbearing either. \\n\\n\r\nNow when if comes to the conversations and interactions  between our two main characters Riko and reg. You could not of  found or made a better partnership. The amount of friendship and trust between these two is unparalleled.  Which is why when the drama starts it hits us with incredible impact.  Because when we see strong characters like these two suffer, it makes us think. \"How can this happen?! Come on you have to make it through this.\"  \\n\\n\r\nThere are also some really wonderful supporting characters that get introduced, who play an incredible role in adding elements to the story. This is where I need to get credit to the voicing cast because the voice is what makes the character. Ohara Sayaka who voiced the roll of Ozen did a magnificent job, keeping the audience on edge with her very menacing yet straight forward demeanor and tone. But if you were to ask me which two characters I feel had the most impact, they would have to be Riko and Nanachi.  Tomita Miyu confident and cheerful tone mad Riko a very lovable character that we would want to empathize with and support. While Shiori Izawa's role as the sarcastic nanachi, not only surprised us with a very compassionate and selfless side to the character but introduced us to one of the most dramatic and heartfelt backs stories in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, which were handled by Kise Kazuchika, did an excelent job making us fall inlove with the characters. Even for some of the more minor supporting ones like Kiyui who is one of my personal favorites.  A huge factor that plays into this  is how some of the orphanage children look younger then what they really are. For example, becoming a red whistle starts at the age of twelve. But just by looking at the children you would assume their 7-9 years old at the oldest. This is why there is a strong since of discomfort though out the story and why the drama in it is so powerful.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the the same disturbing thought of taking small defenseless children and  placing them in an very unsettling and unpredictable environment to fend for themselves, that makes us feel weary and nervous through out riko and regs journey. \\n\\n\r\nNow the creature design are a work of art of all their own. Each living thing from the abyss, was designs by Kou Yoshinari and added it's very own since of discovery and unknown danger to the story.  Now the Animation for the series, was handled by Studio Kinema Citrus and aided by the incredible direction of  Kise Kuzuchika who is known for his excellent work in series like  Escaflowne and Evangelion. \\n\\n\r\nBut nothings compares to the incredibly beautiful sound track that was composed by Kevin Penkin. His music really did a magnificent job, bringing out the magic in each scene and the emotional investment we have in the story. And from my own personal experience, no matter how many times I listen to it while watching, it never seized to move and captivate me. \\n\\n\r\nMade in Abyss is  incredibly captivating watch,  filled with wonderful characters, and a story that is so profoundly moving and beautiful that you have to experience it for yourself. So I urge you, if you haven't done so already take the challenge and journey into the Abyss. \\n\\n",

This show has everything: adventure, mystery, tragedy, drama, etc. It really makes you think of JRPGs where characters are exploring mysterious lands, except the only place that's a mystery is the abyss. The main character is an energetic girl who isn't afraid to take leaps of faith, which makes this show so entertaining. The mystery of the abyss is unraveled in every episode and it just makes you want to watch it more. Along with this, the relationships created between the characters sustains the drama and emotion evoked in later episodes when much more is revealed about the abyss. Despite thechibi art style that might put some people off, the story is well-developed and makes you wish the second season was out already.",

            "content": "When I started this anime, I was not instantly hooked. I liked the concept and the setting. But I had little familiarity with the characters. The art was not Madhouse caliber even though the whole fantasy world provided a lot of scope for it. And so I consumed the first few episodes at slow pace not really sure if I should keep at it. But a character driven fiction like Made in Abyss requires some investment of time and patience to comprehend the fullness of its glory.\r\nBut then this show started to grow on me, slowly but surely. Miko's tenacious optimism, Reg's overwhelming compassion, theirindestructible camaraderie along with the finely sculpted supporting characters transformed this what initially seemed like a children's fantasy drama into a gem that shed's light on the nature of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe Abyss is an epitome of everything in Nature that challenges humanity in mankind. In face of such monumental challenges, how do we hold on to our body, mind and soul? I believe this is the question that pervades the entire show as it seeks to find an answer to this ever-looming question, as the protagonists journey down the abyss seeking their answers to their own questions.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this show to any seasoned anime lover. If you are a fan of \"Now and Then, Here and There\", \"Shinsekai Yori\" or \"Planetes\" then you'll not regret picking this one up.",

What the show drops a bit in technical storytelling quality it makes up for with this insane and crazy premise that draws you into the abyss and makes you wonder whats down inside and why it's there. The world is why you get invested in this show. For a while in anime (to me at least) fantasy has lost that fantastical feel to it. Most contemporary fantasy anime are set in more of a Tolkein style of world with the label of fantasy.While yeah, its got mythical and magical creatures and magic and whatever else that's not really fantasy in the way that fantasy once captured me. This is a world that has existed for a long time but there are still elements of this world that are still unknown and that just draws you in because of those elements. Couple the world with top tier gore and action scenes that have insane consequences for our characters and a world that needs to be experienced just dive in and enjoy the ride.",

I needed to trudge (and it honestly felt like a struggle) through two thirds of the show before I could actually look forward to the next episode. \r\nIf I had to point outwhat was the problem, I'd say it was the two main characters we were left with after the first episode eclipsed. They're not bad at all, but they need to carry most of the episodes and I felt that there needed to be more substance. Some extra characters are introduced along the way  and yeah, it helps, but they didn't stick around for too long. \\n\\n\r\nWhen we begin to get into more interesting parts of the abyss and our next big character is introduced the anime picks up fast. Stories become intertwined, questions arise and character interactions become more emotional. \\n\\n\r\nSo even though I appreciate what the show tried (and succeeded by the looks of what most people think) to bring to the table, I'm afraid I wasn't able to partake in it as fully as I would have wanted to.",

Also by no means expect a light-hearted fun filled adventure anime here, if so then you have been completely deceived as well as I was. There are strong adult themes present which just skyrockets towards the end. \r\nNow talking about deceived, to be completely honest I found the first to mid parts of the anime (speaking specifically  about episodes 1-8) literally quite boring to an extent that makes me question why do I even bother. Yeah it has an interesting plot as well assolid motive for the female protagonist Riko to pursue her descend down the Abyss which is nice to follow but it became a bit of a struggle to watch them navigate down each layer. Parts do end up becoming like a rise-and-repeat a fair which is understandable for the type of coming of age story that this anime is. We have a child literally risking her life in ascending the Abyss yet blatantly knowing all the life threatening dangers that lurk on her journey. Which is quite silly and very irredeem... wait I mean irresponsible, to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nStill the characters and the mystery that is the Abyss was captivating, you have the giant hole on an island like a dormant volcano which ended up attracting people all over the world to move here and settle down. Apparently there wasn't anything else to discover in the world anymore. The Abyss literally becomes a goldmine for the settlers in general and soon enough a booming enormous town is established with the Abyss as its core. Yes, as you can imagine it gets pretty interesting from there onwards.\\n\\n\r\nFor me the reason why this show got so much praise was to how unique is was, which to most avid anime consumer its damn refreshing. 2017 gave us plenty of the same trash we love, however Made in Abyss was quite different, to that which is clear as day evident in its amazing artstyle accompanying with very tone down fantasy style soundtracks unlike most fantasy genre anime we got his year. I don\u2019t want to drop spoilers here but towards the last episodes the overall nature of this anime completely changing and i can honestly swear that tiny parts for soul were pulled out of me watching some of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all it is a completely worth watching anime. If you ever do find yourself in an situation of dropping it, then don\u2019t. The ending was set on a high yet light note perfect for the build up to the second season which I feel is going to remind you that this is definitely not a light-hearted fun filled adventure anime for everyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Naturally, I'm talking about ANIMU as a whole, the media that only survives as a relatively quality content thanks to shows like these that actually bless and justify the entirety of their existence about once, up to three times a year with something actually watchable and even likable to the point where you actually remember what the fuck were you watching in the first place.\r\nIn case you were still wondering at this point, since I know all this soundsas bitter as I feel on this site, Made in Abyss is one of the few genuinely enjoyable things that came out of Japan ( or from planet Earth in general, really). It has a memorable story, really cool characters, amazing animation and design and is actually really nice to simply listen to besides having little to do with nothing with music as a genre.

From start to finish it presents us with great ideas, backed up by wonderful artwork and fantastic musical choices. Every new layer in the depths of the abyss brings with it, fresh scenery, monsters, and obstacles. This constant influx of new things will keep you coming back for more and luckily for us, there's a season 2 onthe way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not entirely without fault however.\\n\\n\r\n-The start may be a little slow for some people\\n\r\n-Certain decisions made by the main characters can be a little infuriating\\n\r\n-Sometimes the switch from dark & serious to cheerful & childish is a bit rough\\n\\n\r\nI personally found the premise to be interesting enough to keep me around despite the slow start. In defense of the dumb decisions, the characters are children...curious, positive, cheerful, children. It is not out of the realm of possibilities for a 12 year old to make dumb decisions. The switches from serious to playful are in my opinion a little rushed from time to time. I would rather they let us sit in despair and agony for a bit longer before bringing back the youthful positivity our characters give us.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day though, this show is a strong 9/10 for me. Beautiful artwork, good music, strong characters, and an engaging story, all set in a beautifully crafted world. Not much more you could ask for in a fantasy anime, I'll be eagerly awaiting the second season.\\n\\n\r\nPS: If you want more context for my scores out of 10, please visit my profile.",

I liked it a metric shit ton and if you think the beginning is boring and not serious enough for your taste then wait till the fourth layer of the abyss. K I have to go finish an actual essay now but ye. Watch this if you want a revolutionary anime that will most likely redefine anime again. It may not have as big of an impact as Evangelion did but this anime is so good and different from anything I have ever seen, I doubt any studio is going to take upthe chance to follow some trail Made In Abyss made.",

The art was phenomenal and thanks to the directing, there's a lot of quiet, slow moments which help me dig deep into that world. pace can be improved a little, but there's so much that they've done in the 30min episodesthat really it won't bother you too much. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is by far one of the best I've ever heard in an anime and incorporates that feature into the mood, and blends in with the story elements beautifully. I enjoyed the map and the mysteries the abyss which has me wanting the story more. \\n\\n\r\nThe only main issue I have and I hate this from animes, is how they show some pedophilia (I've heard they really cut that down from the webcomic), I wish they completely removed that, I understand they're kids but really it's unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nI long for S2, and this is a must watch. Really underappreciated anime, has a little HxH vibe to it.",

The time Nanachi looked back at her house, it actually look likes Mitty. It just shows the strong feelings Nanachi shows for Mitty. While this show is rather dark, it shows how amazing the plot and obstacles they face while to \\n\r\nthe journey to the netherworlds.

            "content": "I am writing this review as I, so far, have only seen one other review that mentions the huge elephant in the room when it comes to MiA. This reviewer also did not like the show at all and rated it poorly.\r\nOn the contrary I loved MiA and scored it thereafter which is why I wish to share my view. This show simply left me with such a strange aftertaste that the mindless praise of this show here at MAL felt a bit.. well, mindless.\r\nThe positives have been mentioned a few times already (skip this part if you have read other reviews);\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory - Great init's simplicity. MiA has a very minimalistic plot and is rather about the concept of the longing for the unknown. The reason the minimalism works for MiA is because it makes everything it actually does stand out so much more. The sceneries and concepts, that would have just been part of the background and world building in another anime, becomes the main focal point and draw of the series in MiA. This is why the lack of a complex story makes it good. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - Decent pastel-colored cutesy loli art. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound - Quality varies but the good scores are really good! The bad ones are average. On the whole the OST suits the series perfectly and manages to build atmosphere and tension. I suspect it was heavily influence by Hans Zimmers work for Interstellar, but this is just a theory of mine. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Nothing special; two decent bland anime protagonists and a third slightly less cliche protagonist thrown in later in the show. It has some interesting side-characters with equally interesting design (and delightfully a good portion interesting female characters with other purposes than fanservice and tragic anime deaths). 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I thoroughly enjoyed this show for the creative setting and adventurous feel, and I did not find the irregular pacing annoying. There was just the right amount of curiosity and excitement for what is to come, mixed with a slow and deliberate building of the setting for me to stay entertained throughout these 13 episodes. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where I again have to mention the elephant in the room, namely Tsukushi Akihito himself. \\n\\n\r\nThis author of MiA is a loli/shota fetishist (or in layman's terms; a pedophile). This is not disputable. Any argument about the \"innocent\" sexual references in this show being \"realism\" is purely subjective, as the author does in fact fetishize and sexualize children. The anime is ever-so-subtle about this and disguises the sexualization in the scene with important plot happening at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nIf it is not clear enough the female main character pees her pants three times in this 13 episode anime for no reason at all. She is stripped naked several times more than that, and weird out-of-place sexual references happen just so often that it becomes uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nAkihito favs hentai and retweets nsfw fanarts of his own loli/shota characters (on his twitter /tukushiA) and this has already become somewhat of a meme going around. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are STILL unsure wether Made in Abyss is actually heavily sexualized/a disguised excuse to draw loli/shota fetish content you can look up the manga (OBVIOUS SPOILERS though) on any site; chapter 31 page 1-2, chapter 1 page 30, chapter 43 page 1 (and the rest of the chapter honestly), chapter 16.5 page 3... and much more.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, these are just very few examples and the whole series is riddled with stuff like this. Specifically the authors urophilia and general toilet fetish becomes very apparent. \\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThis being said... Even if Made in Abyss is just an excuse to draw both explicit and heavily implied sexual loli/shota content, it is an incredibly well made excuse! It is such a shame, truly, that he spoils a potential and actual work of art with his own disgusting sexual inclinations. The fetish part is fine, whatever, but the pedophilia is really unsettling. Especially together with the knowledge of Japans rampant problem with pedophilia and underaged sex industry.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has unfortunately escaped the most obvious reminders of this (so far) and I would even hesitantly recommend it to friends (with an explanation of the problematic content of course). \\n\\n\r\nIt is like listening to Wagner. ...You know he was a nazi but the music is damn good and you still rate it a solid 8/10. \\n\\n\\n",
