            "content": "After an endless wasteland of filler, Naruto returns! Joy! Happiness! Frowns turned upside down! I couldn't believe it when the fillers ended. I was ecstatic. \r\nNow I'm ready with a pillow whenever I tune in every friday. Question mark? I'll tell you why I'm prone to falling asleep while watching Naruto:Shippuuden - it just isn't Naruto anymore. It just isn't the same series.\r\nStory: Don't get me wrong, Naruto didn't just magically start stabbing me with disappointment because the story started to totally go downhill. In fact, the first episode's preview with Naruto's future encounter with Sasuke had me on the edge of my seat. Icouldn't believe it: Naruto was back! No, the story continues and follows through adequately as a continuation of the original Naruto. The great elements of the original story are still here: the theme of an everlasting friendship, the importance of maintaining hope, the need to endure and persevere .. these themes are all still there! Naruto is still a great guy and he still strives to protect his friends and 'save' Sasuke while taking on Akatsuki at the same time. So what happened to Naruto? Well, story-wise, nothing. I still love the story. I love the world of Naruto, the ninjas, the techniques, the weapons, the themes, the plot. Although the story doesn't present the viewers with anything deep or complicated, I still like it. But the story isn't the problem. The story as it is and as it continues, gets a 7.5/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It was great to see how much the characters changed from the original Naruto. Character development in this aspect, was great. Pretty much everbody had a new design and they all looked great. In terms of personality, well, they were the same loveable characters, unique in their own way. In terms of Naruto and Sakura, they really developed. Although he still acts like it, Naruto isn't the same happy loudmouth he used to be. He's been deeply scarred from Sasuke's betrayal, and despite all thats happened, he's still obsessed with saving him. Of course, Sasuke's betrayal affected Sakura too and she's really toughened up. She isn't the useless twist she used to be, and shes really grown to respect and care for Naruto. Character development is great, the characters are great, old and new. Sai for example, is an interesting add on, he brought the funnies and kept the comedic aspects of the show alive. The characters aren't the problem either: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation: Here is where Shippuuden starts going downhill. In terms of the new characters and their new character designs, I love em. But Naruto just isn't animated as well as it used to be. There is a lot of repeated animation in Shippuuden. This ranges from terribly animated tree jumping scenes (it actually looks more like they're flying instead of jumping half the time, lazy much?) to staring faces and overused flashbacks. I can understand the need to repeat the frames from things like the tree jumping scenes that are filled with dialog, or the occasional flashback to remind us of what happened in the original Naruto or something a couple of episodes ago. But the extent of it is teetering on the cliff side. The quality is just going downhill. Kakashi's new Sharingan attack for example, was terribly done in my opinion. I could have done that effect in photoshop. To make it worst, they drew it out for minutes on end ... completely destroying the 'cool factor'. There are also several still scenes that consist of pure eye to eye combat with wind blowing in the background. Cool? I think not, not when pointless staring takes up about 15% of the episode's air time. Asides from this, the coloring and detail of the characters in terms of shading and such also seem to be lacking in contrast to the original Naruto. Looking at the two, they just aren't on the same level anymore. Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to the series, or because I've watched so many more series since the original Naruto, but the quality has definitely deteriorated. Of course, some of the big fights are still animated quite nicely: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Things just get worst from here. While I loved the new opening and closing songs, the episode bgm just isn't the same. The upbeat action music heard in the original Naruto has been replaced by lame 'lets make this fight seem really tense and epic' music that fails horribly. I want the old soundtracks back! Granted, the series is alot more serious now, but the background soundtracks really can't shake the excitement meter up to where it used to be: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, so it's the same story, continued. The same characters, with some cool new additions are there. The animatiors are getting a bit lazy, and the soundtracks aren't making me chew my fingernails anymore. Does this really warrant a 6? \\n\\n\r\nPacing: This is what has killed Naruto. Not Akatasuki, Not Orochimaru, not Sasuke, not Sakura's poundings - the pacing has killed our beloved hero, Naruto. This is the sole reason that the plot development seems slow and nonexistent, this is why character development is hard to note unless you really love the series, this is why animation is being reused, repeated, or not done at all, this is why I can no longer enjoy Naruto like I used to. So much time is deliberately wasted on mundane scenes such as staring, or camera panning that there are often many awkward pauses that make you wonder, 'did my computer freeze?'. This should NOT be happening in an anime! The amount of still scenes and overused camera panning should not be in surplus and evident enough to deteriorate the quality of a show! There are so many episodes that had amazing potential to be jaw-droppers, but they weren't. Intense battles like episodes 41-43 are completely ruined due to horribly SLOW SLOW pacing!\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the animators want to avoid killing its viewers with a plauge of fillers, but is it really worth it to completely destroy such a potentially satisfying anime? In my opinion, they're ruining the series. We waited and endured just as our hero taught us to - only to be attacked by this monstrosity. The pacing effectively destroyed my love for this show. You may argue that fillers are worse and thats debatable. What isn't however, is that there is enough manga material for at least another 50 FAST paced Naruto episodes. Thats a year! Probably more when you consider that by the time 50 episodes are released, there could be enough material for another 20 or so potential episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Same enjoyable story with great potential. But the pacing needs to change. That pillow I mentioned at the beginning of this long, terrible review? It wasn't for sleeping. It was to stop me from killing myself from bashing my head against the desk as I watched a potentially good series slaughtered before my eyes. 6/10",

            "content": "-------------------------------------\r\n Naruto Shippuden : Review |\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nNaruto. The series that sold over 220 million manga copies, winning handful of awards along the way. An anime that ranked as one of the most watched series in Japan that got tarnished by a greedy studio and has received tons of internet backlash throughout the years. \r\nLet me start off by saying Naruto is by no means a flawless anime. It's the exact opposite. The series had too many fillers. Sometimes the animation quality was below par and pacing can be painfully slow at times.\r\nBut please bear with me here. I'm going to tell you why it has beenthe best experience an anime gave me in my entire life and dig into what made the series popular and also its flaws.\\n\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\n-----------\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Naruto has been a mixed bag. While it's not bad, it's certainly no Berserk. But what it is, is beautiful (probably not the word that can be often used to describe a shounen anime), but it really is. It's unpredictable, it's thrilling, it plays with your emotions, it's funny, it's tragic, it's sometimes downright frustrating but it is, more than anything, wondrous and fun. This is series gets more mature themes and darker tones as the series progresses. There are multiple issues I have with the series\u2019 story, but main flaws comes down to the filler and pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the filler. The amount of filler in this show is staggering. It counts as 219 total filler episodes which make up 44% of the series as a whole.\\n\r\nThe issues that lies within the filler episodes is that they are not allowed to make any significant changes to the story or specifically its characters. This being a mainly character driven plot, this becomes a huge issue because any significant event in fillers could affect the characters so they can't move ahead the plotline at all. So mostly what we get is poorly written mini-arcs and episodes that don\u2019t affect any of the characters or the world in any significant way. This is worsened by the below par writing for these filler episode as they are not written by the original author Masashi Kishimoto himself. \\n\r\nHowever, there are exceptions for this. Some of the filler episodes can be genuinely enjoyable but those are few and far between. The fact that filler can't move the plot along fuels the second big flaw. Which is:\\n\\n\r\nPacing Issues. Aside from what I've said above, even some of the non-filler episodes are very slow paced. This is mainly only an issue at the start of the series. If you're into characters chilling down and wasting a lot of time, this may sit well with you. But even then some of these episodes might be below par for your taste. Once the series kicks it into high gear around 70th episode, it mostly manages to keep that pace up.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we got the flaws out of the way, let's talk positives.\\n\r\nThe main strength of the series is its characters, who drive the plot (which we will discuss in detail later). After the first 70 episodes, things begin to get lot more interesting really fast. The world of shinobi gets expanded exponentially, and if you're a fan of deep lore in stories, this will fit right in your wheel house because it begins to explore the roots of the world and its history very deeply. \\n\r\nOne thing that this series does very well is explaining its concepts to the viewer. The techniques that characters use and how the things in shinobi world works are explained in detail. Also, the concept of Chakra and what a versatile power system it is compared to other shounen series really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of themes explored in the series are vast. It explores all the basic themes of a typical shounen and as it goes on it delves into themes such as the nature of humans, self sacrifice, discrimination, manipulation, roots of war and peace, difference of perceptions, the line between good and evil, and alienation. It manages to deal with all these themes without abandoning the shounen type feel or becoming it pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that the author, Kishimoto, really excels at is setting up events. For example, during the early episodes of Naruto (the prequel to this show), he started setting up major events that happened in the last of Shippuden. In the beginning, we look over these little details and minor events and have no idea that they are going to have such an impact later in the series, and when it all comes together in the end, you feel so satisfied. Most of the times these events and twists will take you by surprise and maybe you'll have fun trying to figure out them before they happen as Kishimoto drops clues for you to pick up throughout the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThe last arc of the series has been very controversial as the constant change of antagonists has irritated some of the viewers. But in all honesty, all of the antagonists that were presented had different motives that drove them to do what they do and distinctively different from each other which made them very enjoyable. That being said, the final part of the war arc was really disappointing as the final villain of the series is the worst character that the series had to offer. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a battle shounen ,of course there are going to be battles, and this is one area that the series really shines.\\n\r\nAs I see it , battles can be broken down into three different segments in this anime , The battle of wits , The battle of ideologies , The physical battle. All three come in union to make some memorable and truly great moments. Each characters ideologies and philosophies gets tested time and time again by their opponents and we can see even the main character himself doubt his ideologies towards the end. When we see someone gets broken inside as well as the outside it's devastating to watch. To put it blatantly, Naruto has the best combat scenes I've ever witnessed in an anime. I have to mention that this style of combat is heavily inspired by Hunter x Hunter. Kishimoto does a fantastic job putting emotions into its battle scenes which are backed up by gorgeous animations (at times, we'll get to that later) and a mesmerizing soundtrack, and with these combined it really sets up fantastic visual storytelling through combat. Kishimoto does an excellent job at setting up the events leading up to the fight to make it feel all the more personal and these battles often comes down to which character outwits the other rather than who can punch harder. This makes characters like Shikamaru Nara who have very little ability make a huge impact in the series. \\n\r\nVariety of the fighting styles is massive, ranging from intimate hand to hand style combats, tactical combats, long range jutsu battles, and most often a mix of all of these!\\n\\n\r\nYou will see friends become foes, foes become friends, unlikely alliances formed and broken, that precious character you loved die, revenge plots, plot twists, character growth, politics, romance, and the world itself change. There are some flaws but it's a full package and Kishimoto always seemed to have the ending and everything planned out from the very beginning.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the core of the franchise. \\n\r\nEach character in Naruto is very distinctive from each other. Each has a core motive that drives them, a unique personality, and a specialty in different skill sets. And hats-off to Kishimoto for his brilliant character design as he used a very bright color pallet and made each one very distinctive to make each of them stand out.\\n\r\nNo matter which kind of characters you prefer, you're sure to find someone here that you can relate to. What the series really does well is making sure that you'll be attached to the characters emotionally. And you will cheer them on as they try to achieve their goals , watch their philosophies and ideologies gets tested , watch them break or prevail and break down crying at their deaths. \\n\r\nYou will get to see how what's happening around the characters change them , mold them. Witnessing how tragedies that's happening around them having an effect on their psyche is one of the strongest points of Naruto Shippuden. It's fun seeing small character interactions from early episodes grow into full blown relationships.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to the \"Villains\" \\n\r\nThis series checks all the boxes when it comes to antagonist character archetypes.\\n\r\n*Self-Righteous Villain with a God Complex* [checked] , *Money Hungry Villains* [checked] , *Religious Psychopaths* [checked] , *Villain who is after Revenge* [checked]. I think I've made my point there. But what makes this villains so enjoyable is that no one is a villain just for the sake for being a villain. The best kind of villains are the ones you can empathize with, the ones that you feel for and understand them and make you question your own morality, this is something that this series excels at. As same as the main characters, the villains too have core motivation driving them. They have their own beliefs, ideologies and they are willing to fight for what they think is right. You might find yourself cheering on the villains more than the \"heroes.\" The morality here is blurred.\\n\\n\r\nBut coming back to the war arc, its main flaw is the final villain (which I will not spoil here). Compared with the other villainous characters from the series, the final character is very bland and their motivations are not entirely clear or most likely not relatable to any of the viewers. That being said, this character is only in the series for a very small amount of episodes and the others certainly do more than enough to make up for it.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 7.5\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAgain we have a mixed bag here. \\n\r\nThis show can look stunning when it wants to, and by stunning I meant big budget movie level of quality. But at times the quality can drop way below par.\\n\r\nI think I should specially mention Hiroyuki Yamashita\u2019s work here. He mainly works on battle scenes and this man is a genius when it comes to it. Even though he only worked on a limited number of episodes, his episodes pushes the animation, choreography and stylishness to 11! \\n\r\nDespite this I can't give it a higher score because this show is wildly inconsistent with its animation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for character designs, we already talked about how Kishimoto made his characters very distinctive and imaginative and how the bright color pallet fuels this.\\n\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\n--------------\\n\\n\r\nThis is an another strong point of the series. Yasuharu Takanashi has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this series that manages to highlight the intensity, the tragedies, and the sorrow of each moment. The emotions that Kishimoto wants to portray make it through to us so well because of this soundtrack. It connects us with the world of Naruto Shippuden in a special way. I would recommend listening to tracks like Samidare (Early Summer Rain) to get a taste of what the soundtrack is like.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Experience - 10\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden is more of an experience that needs to be had than just a mere show. It played with our emotions for over a decade and now it has been concluded. The enjoyment of Naruto Shippuden goes beyond just the series itself. This series has a very big community and fanbase that you could interact with. And its lore is so vast that you would never run out of things to discuss about it. Although it has its share of major flaws, this series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're fine with the hefty commitment.\\n\r\nAnd with this, I conclude my review for this series that defined a generation.\\n\\n\r\nSub or Dub ? : Sub is recommended\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\r\n| Recommendations |\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[Naruto] : Yes, the original series. It's essential to watch it before the Shippuden series because it contains a lot of character development and build-up for the Shippuden series.\\n\\n\r\n[Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ] : This series contains most of the things that made Shippuden great such as good character development, good soundtrack, and excellent world building. This series does it in about 70 episodes which is truly a magnificent achievement. If you like Naruto Shippuden, it's a given that you will like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as well. \\n\\n\r\n[Hunter X Hunter (2011)] : A series that greatly inspired Naruto. Both anime feel very similar in style. If the inconsistencies of Naruto bothered you, you'll find a much more consistent pacing and quality of writing here. Whether the highs of Hunter X Hunter matches up to the highs of Shippuden or FMA Brotherhood is up for debate, but you won't have to sit through any lows like you have to endure with Naruto or Naruto Shippuden.\\n\\n\r\n[Proofreading - SomeRandomNerd]",

            "content": "I am a big anime fan and I have to say that Naruto: Shippuuden is one of my absolute all time favourites. There are probably so many people that would disagree with me and tell me that Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden are a waste of time and that the story is a bunch of fillers put together. I strongly disagree and will tell you all why with this review of mine. \r\nFirst of all, the biggest difference between Naruto and Shippuuden is the darker tone, the maturity and the depth in Shippuuden. In Naruto, the whole series was about him wanting to become the Hokage,being clumsy and always working hard to become better than Sasuke. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Naruto's dorkiness but in Shippuuden he becomes serious. The series as well. Now the friendship and loyalty takes over. The mysteries get their answers and new questions take form. \\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki, the moon plan, Madara, war... the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, the cliffhangers... these things are what makes Shippuuden one of the best animes I know. Kishimoto has built this massive foundation for us to walk on during the first half, and now he slowly digs into the core of the story. It keeps you on the tip of your toes. That's why the story itself gets a 10/10 from me. Story (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOf course the art is much better than Naruto. Shippuuden has much more attention for details, the characters' outfits are much better made, the colouring and effects are so much better animated. The landscapes are beautifully drawn. Fighting scenes and emotional scenes are something I've noticed myself are paid much more attention to. The characters movements flows better.The realistic feeling is all over Shippuuden. Great! Art (9/10) \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I prefer not to notice the sound at all. Sound in movies and series shouldn't be noticed. The music is there to strenghten the mood. And since I don't notice the sound and it makes me feel what I'm supposed to feel, I guess the sound is well picked. I really liked the piano pieces in Naruo. Grief and Sorrow is an extraordinary piece. But I especially enjoyed the Pain soundtrack with the choirs and dark pipe organs in Shippuuden. Sound (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nIn Naruto and Shippuuden, Kishimoto is very focused in telling all characters stories. All characters have their backgounds and special personality. They all feel like real people that you know and they all grow throughout the series. You follow their Changes and that's what is so great and important about a series that is this long. The character development.  (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSo, to justify and defend Shippuuden... \\n\r\nFirst of all, you have to understand the use of fillers. With an anime this long the writer can't keep up with the pace. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of the manga. When the anime has reached too far, they have to buy time for the writer to write more. Or, they could make it like many other animes... Make up another story and end for it or just pause it for a couple of years while Kishi draws the manga like crazy. But that wouldn't make anyone happy. Please, stop going on and on about the fillers. They are there for a very good reason. \\n\\n\r\nNaruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wishes to become the Hokage, to a serious, hardworking, loyal friend who doesn't only want to save his friend, but also the whole ninja world from the neverending cycle of hate and despair. I enjoy the series extremely much and I hope that you do too. ^^",

            "content": "There is a saying that a story doesn't begin with a story--it begins with a character.\r\nCome to think of it, all characters of Naruto are extravagantly uniquely developed.\r\n*Itachi's smile* *Neji's smile* *Obito's smile* *Hinata's face when getting married* *Sakura's 'SHANAROOO' face* *Hidan's killer smile*\r\nYou just can't say anything bad in this anime. Because this anime will teach you how to love, to value your friends, and many other Nintendo that really reflect on the real world. It's fiction, but it's as powerful as it gets...to reach a fanbase of millions and millions worldwide. \r\n'The Crafting'\r\nSuch positive, critical response isn't questionable. The story lives up tohis promise to live as long as fifteen years (in whole). It is a burning legacy. It is something no one will ever come up again. Watch Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, or various recent Shippuden fillers (Season 5 was said to be the best, and indeed it was [Guren arc.], and you'll know that there will be no other Masashi Kishimoto. Or so I thought. Naruto is an original artwork. For since little of age, Kishi after watching 'Akira' got inspired and once upon a time decided how much he loved to draw and make a story. That story has changed my life; it made me really believe on the fact that some inspirations, tend to grow out on us, live like scars, and will teach us something that will only come from us. A life lesson. A burning 'will of fire'. \\n\\n\r\nIt's really stupendous and beyond overwhelming how one man could create an entire universe of action, of tell-tale hearts, of characters that have devil wings but in the end are shown to have a halo. Hundred thousands of fanfictions are up there on the net, extending what Kishimoto left. I included, but let's not get onto that first. \\n\\n\r\nI want to applaud Kishimoto for a job well done: for changing the lives of many, for telling us a story that will only promise us one thing: a dream is a dream, and with hard work and determination, you will get to it. You will live through a hundred hardships, cry a river, lose some, but it is the Road that you've been through that will only make you pass that goal. 'That' road, that fucked you up, taught you how to stand up on your own and live. Because after watching this anime, it made me realize how I would rather fight this big burden inside of me than be nothing. At all. The burden that tells me I won't get anywhere. Because in the end, the idea that you can't do it only lies on you. But you 'are' your own person, only you can tell your story--only you decide which path you're willing to take and what will you do to make your life worth living. Are you doing this for yourself alone? For your new/family? For the friends you so love? Or for the better good? For the world? \\n\\n\r\n'Women in the Shinobi/ KUNOICHI' \\n\\n\r\n'Women have to be strong in order to survive.' - Tsunade\\n\\n\r\nFact: when Kishimoto was molding Sakura, he had no idea he was turning her into a futile, hopeless lover with nothing better to do than be a crybaby. \\n\\n\r\nLooking at it, it wasn't his fault that Sakura was hated. But it was how the media reacted. How the audience stuck up with Haruno Sakura's story and believed that that was all she could ever be: a woman, someone who bickers but doesn't achieve anything. Though in the end, as Kishimoto turned the tables, Sakura's appreciation for her character or strong existence just will never happen.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something going on in this world: there is endless misogyny and sexism. I'm not surprised if it happens in Japan, as many Asian countries (even in the Western) still perceive women 'less'. I am saying this out of the researchers I've done as a student, and I too am a woman living in an Asian country. And women will never be treated equally. Good job on making Hinata's boobs bigger, anyway. Well, not mad or anything, but looking at the boobies-headphones for sale at Comic Alley made me emphasize on the fact that women in anime are either for (1) marriage, (2) appearance, and (3) simply sex appeal. At least, 'most', \\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, you can see drastic changes here. There is Temari with her giant wielding fan that could make tornadoes and hurricanes on a normal, sunny day. There is Tsunade that doesn't give a damn of someone's ribs and will tear apart anyone she likes--or underestimate her, and/or women. There is the Mizukage blowing fires out of her mouth with a pink lipgloss that will warn you how women shouldn't be infuriated. On very recent movies and episodes, Ino and TenTen are more seen taking up on missions instead of being left behind for men to do the dirty work. I just think, after watching this beautiful life-changing prismatic I-see-the-light show, women deserve to be dirty; to be covered in blood; to save the world; to be a hero; to be there (too).\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because they can. \\n\\n\r\n'How this anime changed my life:'\\n\\n\r\nOne recommendation from my brother, who teased me of having a flat chest (kind of is Sakura huh), made me into the artist that faces the world with altruistic visions. I started to make a fanfiction that later reached a hundred-thousand reads in Wattpad. Then I continued, through this self-discovery have I unlocked that I really have the 'will' and 'guts' to turn to the road of becoming a writer, not Hokage. (Lol). It is with Naruto that I dipped into the pool of anime and watched many, inspired me to keep on collecting stories, be inspired by them, so there will come a time I will take my reign as a story teller too. What kind? Director--screen-writer--playwright--novelist--the world is at the palm of my hand. I know it will happen. And I know, I can surpass Naruto...one day. \\n\\n\r\nI know that it is with these characters we remain attached and affectionate the most. They are the story-tellers, and these are the stories we tell ourselves...that such cycle, as Kakashi-sensei once said, the 'surpassing' thing is, is infinite. \\n\\n\r\nNaruto is the greatest anime for me.\\n\r\nBut I don't believe this is forever. \\n\r\n;)",

            "content": "First off I just wanna say that I am super sad that this show has come to an end.  Naruto was my childhood and with it's ending I feel like a part of me is now gone.  This is the show that got me into anime and I'm grateful for that.  This show is no where near perfect, but is anything really perfect ? \r\nI'll start out with some of the cons of this show. As many other reviews have already stated, Naruto is loaded with filler episodes and this can't be any more true.  At times the fillers can befunny and interesting, but most of the time you are just impatiently waiting for the show to get back to the real story line.  There were tons of flashbacks and honestly they show the same scenes from the past multiple times.  The story can be rushed, and at other times it feels like it's been the same battle for like 5 episodes. The artwork in the battle scenes can vary from good to not so great.  But even with it's many faults, I still gave this show a 10/10. ( honestly if you hate fillers that much, just skip around)\\n\\n\r\nI don't know where to start with all the great things that this anime has to offer.  I'll start off with the characters.  The character development was great for the main characters and even some of the sides characters.  I think that the show did an excellent job in giving each character a unique personality and they really made sure that you knew all the characters and their backgrounds.  The development of the characters was so great that I was constantly questioning who my favorite character really was.  At the beginning I honestly thought that Naruto was annoying and ignorant, but the growth and development of Naruto really grew on me and he began to become one of my favorites. Okay next is the story line.  The plot was pretty interesting, but very long.  While it did seem like the story was at a standstill for a while in the show, the writers did a good job at subtly setting everything up.  Little things that happened in random episodes sometimes came up later as being important.  The plot was like a puzzle at times, where I would try to put the pieces together.  I actually really enjoyed how they set it up like that.  Like Naruto and his friends grew, the story grew as well.  In this sense I mean the vibe and mood of the show.  It starts off more as a fun action comedy, but as the story goes on, it gets more dark, emotional, and the maturity level of the anime just increases.  I'm not kidding when I say that this show can actually teach you life lessons.\\n\\n\r\n I highly recommend watching this whole anime.  Even though it is loaded with fillers, by the time you get to the last few episodes, you'll start to feel emotional and sad that it's come to an end.  While this isn't Your Lie in April or Clannad, this show still will definitely hit the feels.  The end will have you feeling nostalgic, sad, happy, you'll honestly be feeling so many different emotions.  This anime may be 500 episodes, but it is totally worth it and in the end you won't regret it.",

            "content": "Oh, I hope that I\u2019ll be the first to write the review when all the Naruto anime series end. Well, what should I start with\u2026 15 years. For FIFTEEN years this anime brought me joy and unspeakable emotions. For FIFTEEN years it taught me right from wrong. For FIFTEEN years it \u2026 it\u2019s been a guide of light for me. Jeez, I was raised on this anime, I became older with its characters, I just LOVE IT!!! \r\n  The Naruto series started when I was in a preschool age, and for 15 years it never stopped to surprise me. Thoughthe journey was long (some might say too long) it was always exciting and brilliant. And I am really sorry if I get carried away by emotions, but true Naruto fans will understand \u2013 this is a tale, a unique and flawless tale, of nearly all of my life and now that I look back and see that little Naruto who used to be always alone, without parents, without friends, and I turn my look to who he became through these years \u2013 the Hero, who saved the world, Best Friend that was always there to help and to understand, and now \u2013 a husband\u2026 ah, I might cry. Seriously. Perfect ending. Naruto and Hinata deserve their piece of happiness. And though we did not see this in original manga series, I was really glad to be able to see that kind of and end in anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\n  Now let\u2019s get back to the show and analyze everything peace by peace. \\n\\n\r\n  I\u2019ll start with the story. Indeed the plot, the fantastic world, all the jutsu techniques, all the creatures and characters, everything that we saw in Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden world is a creation of a mastermind \u2013 Kishimoto Masashi, and for that I bow to him to the ground. Just imagine how impossible it was to create such a wide universe with all of its own structure (villages, clans, fractions), its own history (all the clans and villages wars), its own beasts, beings and heroes etc; and how unimaginable was it to make this huge machine work. There is everything I love about the story and about how it is served to the viewer revealing its genius from all sides. It is groundbreaking in every way possible.\\n\\n\r\n  Now let us head to art style. Generally it is satisfying. Well, it is hard to make every episode look like Kimi no Na Wa (you can consider this a recommendation), especially when you have more than 700 episodes (Naruto + Shippuuden). But I can praise creators for really good special effects and the way they\u2019ve made all ninjutsu types look like. And though I must admit that Naruto movies absolutely compensate lack of original shows\u2019 drawing it does not make the original run look worse.\\n\\n\r\n  Unlike art styling \u2013 music really is the VERY strong side of the series. From top to bottom it is impeccable. Every opening, every ending, every song from the series is something breathtaking and mind blowing. I truly enjoy every track and I can sincerely call the Narutos\u2019 OST one of the best of all time in anime industry. The openings like Hero\u2019s Come Back (OP 1), Sign (OP 6), Toumei Datta Sekai (OP 7), Diver (OP 8), Shilhouette (OP 16) will fire you up and make your spirit riot; the endings like Shooting Star (ED 1), U can do it (ED 15), Dame Dame ga (ED 31), Spinning World (ED 32), Zetsu Zetsu (ED 40) will make you believe that you just witnessed a dream that you never want to end. I am not even mentioning stunning Hisou, Kikyou, Sengunbanba, Utsusemi tracks that appear at very exact lyrical moments and touch your soul in its deepest corners. The chorus tracks like Akatsuki and Pains\u2019 theme songs make you feel goosebumps and your hair stand as you stare through the eyes of our heroes at fearless overwhelming enemy hordes. An incredible work by the composer \u2013 Yasuharu Takanashi.\\n\\n\r\n  The characters. Oh, there is so much to say. This is something galaxy lvl. Nearly 100 characters, each with their own temper, beliefs and credo, each of them is trying to make an impact at the world they live in. I will always remember characters like Madara, Itachi, Nagato, because their own vision of the world and the steel will they\u2019ve shown to everyone is something worth of admiration and respect. All the heroes are versatile, unique and incomparable to each other. I am not mentioning the number of skills and techniques each character possesses and how multiform and complex they are. Worth mentioning are beasts like Tailed once. They are that destructive force everyone is trying to lay their hands on, but the author shows that they are something more than that \u2013 they have souls and feelings, and no one can see their good hearts under the scary masks. \\n\\n\r\n  The enjoyment that I personally got from this show is something outstanding. I enjoyed it to the core and absolutely adore it. Maybe that\u2019s because I felt much the same as the main hero and \u2018ve been a witness of many injustice things in this life, and the anime shows it very good. The human\u2019s greed, the way we only think about our own sake, even the way kids treat someone who is not similar to them \u2013 it is a part of the masterpiece that Naruto is.\\n\\n\r\n  Colossal work by Date Hayato and everyone who worked to make this show to be this titanic and go on nonstop for 15 years.  I personally bow to all of you and say: \u201cThank you for the best childhood memories, I will always carry them!\u201d And again I want to congratulate Naruto and Hinata with wedding, and thus my beautiful dream is over, meaning that I grew up and it is time for me to let my childhood go.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me just clarify this now while we\u2019re both still at the very first sentence of this review, and also, at the very first sentence of my very first review ever, but; Naruto Shippuden, and the entire Naruto series in and of itself, is my most favourite anime of all time. Yes, you may think differently, or even otherwise, but I\u2019ll just simply state this now, it is my most favourite anime ever. If you\u2019d care to know why, or you\u2019re simply curious, read on. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI personally think that the story of Naruto/Shippuden is great; it may not be the best, and it maynot be perfect, but then again, when is anything ever like that? Shippuden follows the life of the protagonist, Uzumaki Naruto, as he attempts to retrieve his former teammate, Uchiha Sasuke, who has left the village and everyone around him, in the pursuit of gaining power to get revenge on his older brother, Uchiha Itachi, for the massacre of their entire clan, including their own family. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, back in the simple days of Naruto, it was all about the story of a boy whose dream was, and still is, to become hokage; the greatest ninja in the entire village. This young boy wanted to prove just that; that he was great. He wanted the village to respect him, to prove that he wasn\u2019t just some \u2018demon-fox child\u2019, who was feared of, due to the terrifying nine-tailed fox that was sealed within him. And now, it\u2019s without a doubt, safe to say, that this story has evolved from so much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in the original Naruto series has ultimately lead up to Shippuden, as we, the audience, learn more and more about the characters and the story as a whole. We begin to delve deeper into the core, as more enemies emerge, and more stories and secrets are revealed. Questions that have went on unanswered are finally beginning to obtain an answer, as more questions take their place, and everything slowly, but surely, begins to get tied together. Shippuden, apart from its former series, takes on a much more serious, deep and mature tone, causing us, the audience, to really empathize and act, to either cry in joy or sadness, and I for one can honestly confess, that yes, here and there, this anime has made me cry, multiple times. This anime teaches you; a lot. Shippuden teaches you about the true value and significant importance of family, friends, and life itself. Sure, perhaps, a few other animes have been able to do so, and maybe even to a higher and greater extent, but nothing compares to Naruto. The long amount of episodes only causes the audience to grow with the characters and the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimple. I\u2019ve seen better. But, Shippuden has really stepped up from its former, in regards to visual aspects and animation, it\u2019s improved greatly. There is much more detail in Shippuden than in it\u2019s former, and the colours are either much more vibrant or the complete opposite, in order to properly convey the scene better. Fight scenes are played out more smoothly, with an adequate use of blood and cuts and scratches and such. Close-ups on the characters\u2019 faces are also quite good, the emotion on their faces seem true, real.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I agree with plenty others, that flashbacks are completely overused. I find myself saying, quite often, \u2018We saw that scene literally an episode ago!\u2019, and honestly, it\u2019s not helping the story so much. I understand the need to replay flashbacks, even of episodes we\u2019ve already seen, and most of the time, I can handle it, but it\u2019s overused, and fails to portray the expected suspense of the current scene. Other than that, art & animation; quite well done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe openings. The endings. The OSTs. Most of which are particularly good! The improvement in the sound is evident, and the animation played out during the openings and endings are well put together, matching the song rather well. Emotion is thoroughly conveyed through the amazing voice actors in this anime, who, excluding the dub actors, perform screams and cries and laughs next to flawlessly. Great!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; also translated to the sum of ones\u2019 personality and being as a whole. The characters in Shippuden are great, excellent even! Each and every one of them have a completely unique personality that differentiates one from the other, and seeing them all come together, as friends or as foes, it\u2019s easy to admit that the character development is superb! There are so many characters, each lovable and excellent in their own unique way, with beautifully well-put together pasts that create the particular character we see now.  We see how the \u2018heroes\u2019 have come about, and how each of them have managed to cope and move on with their lives, to become something else entirely, something better than they ever used to be.  The \u2018villains\u2019, too, have a particular past event, or particular emotions that somewhat humanizes them and redeems them to a strange extent, and we realize that they\u2019re not only \u2018evil\u2019 simply because they are. Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they do, and who they are as a whole and that\u2019s what makes each character amazing in their own way. Sure, some may be bland or dull, weak or annoying, strong or insane, but if each character didn\u2019t even have a single flaw, what would that make them? Human? Surely not. The characters in Shippuden are beautiful and lovable, which in turn, causes us as the audience to feel for them and empathize, and that\u2019s, honestly, great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nShippuden is clearly one of the greatest animes of all time, and perhaps that\u2019s an overstatement, or maybe even an understatement, depending on your own thoughts. But, if given enough thought, Shippuden wouldn\u2019t have become so popular if it wasn\u2019t great or amazing, even to a short extent. Some of you may have seen animes better, or worse, or even of equal value, but towards the end, Naruto/Shippuden is clearly one of its own. I, and anyone else probably, couldn\u2019t agree better that the fillers in this anime are truly horrid and awfully annoying, but, you know what, overlook it. Don\u2019t watch them. Simple. An animes\u2019 worth isn\u2019t valued by its amount of fillers or overused flashbacks or anything, its value comes down to how much a person, themselves, think it\u2019s amazing. So if you haven\u2019t seen Naruto/Shippuden or you dropped it for whatever the reason may be, I encourage you to watch it and give it a shot. 300+ episodes, along with the original 100+ episodes in Naruto, is crazy, sure, but they all add up to one hell of a story and I say, sit, watch, and enjoy the ride.\\n",

            "content": "My opinion: \r\nThe Naruto franchise is one of the most hyped and popular series in the anime world. After 10 years, 500 episodes and a bunch of movies the moneymaker Naruto franchise is finally put to rest.\r\nNaruto was one of my favorite shows as a kid, it was better than anything else on TV and I still remember rushing home from school to catch Naruto on TV, good times. After the original series \u201cNaruto\u201d ended, I was thrilled about the sequel show, \u201cShippuuden\u201d, that was about to start airing but little did I know what a disappointment it was going to be.\r\nStory: 3/10 (Cannon: 6/10& Filler: 1/10)\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden is a continuation of the original therefore the concept of the story remains unchanged but the execution and pacing are a different situation.\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden follows Naruto Uzumaki as he aspires to become Hokage and at the same time tries to bring back his friend, Sasuke, but the story is much more complex than before, now we have Akatsuki hunting down all the Jinchuuriki, Sasuke seeking revenge for his clan , Naruto's struggle against the Kyuubi, Danzo's plot to take over Konoha, the 4th great Ninja War, Madara attempting to end the world and so much more. Yeah, the story gets way more complex but not for the better.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately what was a simple straight-forward and fairly enjoyable plot, soon got covered with pointless subplots that turned the show into a mess, a complete wreck filled with plot armor and plot conveniences. We still have Naruto aspiring to become Hokage while trying to bring back Sasuke but those story-lines get smothered with useless boring subplots and endless filler episodes (not that the main plot was good). That combination ruined my enjoyment of this show. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the next flaw. The pacing of the show is just unbelievably bad, with dragged out scenes that put you to bed, important moments that are rushed and not properly explained, hundreds of filler episodes interrupting important and hyped-up fighting scenes and a lot more is wrong with the pacing/execution. \\n\\n\r\nWhat bothered me the most, as it did many others, were the filler episodes, particularly the ones during the 4th great ninja war that were inserted in the most intense fighting moments. Naruto going full power against his opponent, what an epic scene\u2026why not insert about 20 filler episodes? \\n\\n\r\nThis series has so many twists that you stop caring mid-way. The main antagonist got replaced 3 times because the writers fked up and made them too OP for Naruto to defeat\u2026 so the next logical step is to introduce someone twice as powerful. Referring to Obito who was replaced by the stronger Madara who was replaced by the stronger Kaguya, what a mess...\\n\\n\r\nWhile Naruto Shippuuden is a shonen show that follows the generic path of \u201cget beaten> yell/scream> rise up> win> repeat\u201d and employs cliche themes such as \u201cthe power of friendship conquers all\u201d, despite all of that, I never cringed while watching it and these flaws never stopped me from enjoying the show. \\n\r\nSure, it can get a bit annoying to see Naruto rehabilitate every \u201cevil\u201d guy he meets and turning them into his friends but it ain't that bad.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Naruto Shippuuden does have amazing fight scenes that get you hyped, sad moments that bring tears to your eyes, artistic scenes that inspire the viewer, lighthearted scenes that put a smile on your face... In this area, Naruto did great and exceeded my expectations. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters are generic, cliche and many are one-dimensional or have very little development but that doesn't stop them from being likeable and unique in their own way.\\n\r\nI will talk about the characters I consider important to the series. \\n\r\nCharacters worth remembering are: Jiraiya, Tsunade, Kakashi, Madara.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto is a young ninja who had a harsh childhood during which he faced many difficulties and sad moments. The difficulties he experienced as a child traumatized him and made him the way he is, a cheerful and friendly guy who would do anything to protect those he cares for. Naruto\u2019s dream is to become Hokage but he will not be blinded by that dream and even if it means straying away from it, Naruto will offer his help to whomever is in need, he will put everything on the line to save those he considers friends, no matter the circumstances and that is the quintessence of his personality. \\n\r\nEven though it is not evident, throughout the series Naruto\u2019s character slowly changes and matures after facing and overcoming the obstacles in his path.\\n\\n\r\nSasuke is the \u201clast\u201d of the Uchiha clan after its bloody demise at the hands of his older brother, Itachi. His only goal in life is to avenge the death of his clan and seek revenge on Itachi, not caring about others or the consequences of his actions. Sasuke\u2019s character is stagnant and does not develop until late in the series, he is the \u201crival\u201d that makes Naruto strive to be better and stronger.\\n\\n\r\nItachi was arguably one of the greatest shonen villains until the writers reduced him to a generic, plain good guy. \\n\r\nItachi is the \"prodigy\" child of the Uchiha clan, a skilled shinobi and a good brother until one dark night when he murders every member in the clan except for his younger brother. His character was intriguing and a great addition to the series but ended in miserable failure as the writers decided to rehabilitate him after his death. \\n\\n\r\nObito, another victim of the \u201cpower of friendship\u201d theme. He has lost everything, his dream of becoming Hokage is gone, his loved one is dead, his friend betrayed him, his body is ruined therefore he decides it is best to destroy the world and yet he is easily turned into a good guy by our great hero, Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nKurama/Nine-Tails is one of the nine tailed beasts. Centuries of being regarded as a mindless monster and sought after as a tool for war caused Kurama to hate humans. After being sealed into Naruto Uzumaki, Kurama attempts to maintain its negative opinions about the world, but with Naruto's insistence on treating it with respect, the fox overturns its hatred and willingly strives to use its power for the world's salvation.\\n\r\nKurama's development is quite inspiring and a model we should all follow, with the racism, sexism, homophobism, etc. that is happening in the contemporan society.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation was originally good, fluent with nice colors but it went downhill and resulted in the overall animation&art being bad.\\n\r\nIn order to save money, the studio decided to use lots and lots of flashbacks, entire minutes of already aired scenes from previous episodes, still facial expressions, pointless starring, etc. \\n\r\nAlthough the show started airing in 2007 and ended 10 years later, not many good changes had been made to the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nMost of the opening themes and ending themes are decent and the OST is fairly good. The voice actors did a good job interpreting the characters but not an outstanding end result. I couldn\u2019t find a song I loved but nor could I find a song I hated so I guess the sound department is fine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed the canon episodes even some of the filler episodes but the overwhelming number of shit filler episodes and flashbacks ruined my enjoyment of this series. Not much to say about it\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 \\n\r\nMy bias won't let me rate this below 5...\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden had its good moments that made it shine but it was quickly clouded by the huge amount of filler episodes, flashbacks, inapt characters, subplots, etc. \\n\r\nI will certainly remember Naruto for the rest of my life, it is a show I grew up with and it holds a special place in my heart.\\n\r\nAs advice to the people who have't watched it yet: skip some of the fillers, a great experience awaits you!\\n",

            "content": "Shippuuden was a step-up from the original series in some ways, but it's worse at other points, making it just so-so.\r\nThe story has become increasingly complex compared to the original series. You still have the whole deal with Naruto wanting to become Hokage, but that is very overshadowed by many new plots. You have Akatsuki who's after all the Jinchuuriki, there's Sasuke and his quest for revenge, Naruto's struggle against the Kyuubi, Team 7's quest to get back Sasuke and Danzo's plot to take over Konoha. Yeah, there's a lot going on, and I enjoy that a lot - a plot-rich story is always funto watch\\n\\n\r\nBut - and this is a big but - there's severe pacing problems. And by severe I mean excessively dragged out nonsense which could've been done in half the time... at least. The first arc took 30 episodes. It could've been finished in much less time, but they absolutely have to drag it out with endless nonsense fights. The Sasuke and Sai arc was fairly okay, though, but still a little slow on the pacing.\\n\\n\r\n&quot;But if they quicken the pace it, we'll get more fillers. Oh noes!&quot; Yeah, some people think that. However, I'd rather have them quicken the pace and have more filler than getting my viewing experience ruined by a sluggish pace. Fillers can be good, you know.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Shippuuden is better. The new character deigns are great, and I find that the coloring is less dull than it was in the original series. It's becoming more flawless too, but it still struggles with small flaws here and there. However, it's still Naruto, and its animation has always been simple in my eyes. There are no big details to brag about, but sometimes simple works; it's mainly a matter of getting used to (and most people watching Shippuuden should've already watched the original series, which means that you've most likely gotten used to it).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack so far in Shippuuden is fairly decent. I still haven't heard any remarkable themes, but none of them has been outright bad either, so I'm fine with it, but I wish they threw in some good themes. They do, however, fit right into the current events, which is a small plus. There's not much to say about the OPs an EDs so far; they've been very average. \\n\\n\r\nAs of episode 58, there have been low amounts of character development, and for 58 episodes that&rsquo;s not really good. The reunion of the new Team 7 and Sasuke is pretty much the only traces of any character development so far, aside maybe Sai's interactions with the rest of the group, which is always funny to watch, and it's interesting to see if he'll ever learn how to properly interact with the others. The introduction of him and his actions is pretty much all that keeps my character rating on 7, because we've hardly seen any of the other characters, and the small amounts we've seen of them is nothing special, really; it's like most of them have just faded away. I'm still hoping that some good character development and all that will come though, seeing how Naruto will probably have to struggle with the Kyuubi inside of him, and not to mention getting Sasuke back; I'm hoping that it will provide us with some neat character development.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, I'm very &quot;meh&quot; about Shippuuden, but if it rids itself of the pacing problems I'm going to enjoy this much more than I'm currently doing now.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Well, it has improved as of late (Dec '08), so I am upping the character and enjoyment ratings to 8  \\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuuden! The series that would never end finally ends! After ten years, five-hundred episodes and several movie tie-ins, this milked cow is finally laid down to rest, resulting in one of the worst shounen anime adaptations ever made. While I did enjoy myself with the series and certainly found myself even liking it for the first two-hundred episodes or so, the insane amount of filler, padding, and the abysmal final three or four arcs made me despise this show by the end, and all of the characters and narrative. The filler in this anime is such a goddamn problem that it destroys the entireanime, and at this point, if you did want to get into Naruto, I would recommend reading the manga, or skipping over the filler because, for the most part, the filler is absolutely abysmal and is rarely interesting or adds onto the overall world of the series. Since this review is going to spend a long time detailing all of my problems with the story, I will address the animation and music now. While I still prefer the original soundtrack of Naruto, Shippuuden is still great. The action pumps you up and there is a great variety in songs and moods to fit each moment and scene. The animation is a different story, however. The anime is very inconsistent, and that is to be expected with a show with over five-hundred episode; at its best, it could be movie quality, it\u2019s worst, trashy nineties OVA.\\n\\n\r\nShippuuden is the direct continuation of the original series, set two years after the events that transpired in the original in which Naruto has trained to hone his skills and jutsu. Upon returning to the village, he fights off against the Akatsuki, a group of powerful, rogue ninja who wants to collect all of the tailed beasts to create the ten tails and rule the world, while trying to save his gay lover, I mean best friend, Sasuke. Now, I want to clarify first of all that I enjoyed the first season very much (excluding the fillers, that is). It was fun, the battles were original and creative, and the characters went through great development; it captured the hard life of a ninja perfectly and the cruel world in which they live in. Shippuuden was also pretty good for a little while in the beginning of the series, albeit not as interesting or engaging as the previous story arcs of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne good thing about the sequel is that Shippuuden is a lot darker and more mature than the original series, now with the Akatsuki clan running amok and killing many of the tailed beasts. There is this constant sense of looming danger and tension in the series and the Akatsuki were easily the best thing about part two. All of them are interesting, had unique abilities, and for the most part, are allowed to shine in their own respective battles. Hell, there are even a few character deaths which took me by surprise, which added onto the steaks and tension of the show. The first one hundred episodes of content (minus the fillers) are pretty great although I did have some problems, most notably being Naruto and Sasuke themselves.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto in part two is annoying, whiny and irritating, and his constant journey to save Sasuke feels boring and without much sense logically, since Saskue becomes a complete dick head, hell bent on destroying the entire village. Sasuke starts off wanting to kill his brother, and after the worst plot twist in the series where we learn his evil brother was, in fact, a good guy, which I\u2019ve always hated, all he wants after that is to destroy the village and everyone in it, and his character fluctuates so much throughout part two that it becomes hard to keep track of. Both of their respective story arcs hit brick walls by the end of the Pain arc and hardly develop at all past that, just in their power levels. Speaking of the Pain arc, the conclusion to that very same story arc was so bad that I lost all hope in the series. After a great fight in which much of the main cast die, Naruto has a friendship speech with the villain in which after, he brings back all of the people in the village who died! This removed all of the tension from the series and was such a cheap way to bring back characters that I began to hate the series from that point onwards. Combine that with characters who did receive some screen time in part one, now being pushed to the sideline with no development, aside from Shikamaru, but even after his own arc, he is pushed to the side to make way for the yellow-haired twit. In addition, Naruto\u2019s character is ruined after we learn he is the child of destiny and was destined to save the world since he was born. This meant all of his hard work was for nothing and is such a giant middle finger from the author, that after this point, I hated the series. From this point on, we know that Naruto can never die nor lose since he is destined to save the world. His fate is pre-determined from the start, which does remove some tension from the later arcs.\\n\\n\r\nIt also destroys Naruto's main theme at the same time. Naruto's driving force was that hard work and endurance would pay off in the end, and earn you  respect from the people around you, even when the whole world is putting you down. In the early parts of the series there was a genuine sense of satisfaction in watching Naruto grow as a person and the catharsis pay off that entailed was great after all his hard work. Learning that he is a destined child, and was destined with all these great powers from the beginning ruins all of the hard work and endurance he had to go through to gain respect as a shinobi. Essentially, the author shot himself in the foot and omitted one of the driving forces of his story. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let me elaborate a little more on the Itachi plot twist before I go ahead and why I didn't like this twist in the story. To me, Itachi was a great villain, someone who killed his entire village just to test his limits, leaving his younger brother alive to act out revenge on the part of his fallen clan. Like Saskue, we hated Itachi at the beginning, which we should of, since this makes a great villain. Itachi is strong, ruthless, and cunning. All of this, in my eyes, anyway, made him great as a villain, but Kishimoto, works in a twist that reveals he was a good guy all along and killed his clan to prevent a war from occurring. Essentially he had to carry a huge burden on his back from the village elders, which is admirable, but it also causes Saskue's character to go out of control from this point, and fluctuate so frequently. I always found this twist to be kind of \"meh\", for a lack of a better term. I never hated it per say, to the point where it broke the series or anything, it's just that I think Itachi was much better as a villain than a good guy. But hey, this mini-rant is just down to my own personal preference. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst character out of them all is Sakura. Now, I don't think she is useless in this series. Hell, she has a pretty okay fight against one of the Akatsuki members and wins, which is something I can appreciate, it's just that her character goes nowhere. She stays so stagnant and boring, whilst crying about Saskue. And holy hell does her love for Sasuke feel forced as hell. It makes no sense why she loves him to this extent, especially after the bastard almost killed her and threatened to destroy the entire village, killing everyone she loved and had known. Back in the original I could kind of excuse her crush on account that she was a young child, but now it's laughably pathetic and doesn't even make any sense. This applies for most of the female cast in the series since Kishimotot can't write good female characters. They're either completely useless or completely superficial. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this brings us to ninja war arc and everything that came after. These final arcs were awful. All of the clever tactics and strategies the characters had are now gone, in favour of who could pull off the most landscape reducing jutsu, and Naruto and Sasuke become so powerful, to the point they rival gods, even going as far as having them both die and then re-birth as an act of destiny. What I always hated was that all of the characters that died before; characters that I liked and had well-completed arcs were brought back to life since the author was too lazy to create new ones. This ruined many of the original arcs these characters went through, and I found this, for the most part, to be completely boring since they just repeat what happened previously. Sure, there is some development and growth with the characters, but it's hardly substantial enough to raise the bar. All of the previous rules and ideas that Kishimoto establishes in the early part of the series are thrown out and it's painfully obvious that he didn't even care about his own series in the end since the justsus and abilities some of the characters can perform goes against the rules of the world that he established. A good example is when Kakashi gets two Sharingan which would require a large amount of chakra to use. We've been told time and time again that this character, while having a wide range of impressive jutsu, doesn't have much in the way of chakra and thus can't battle for too long but in the final arcs he performs so many Jutsu it is unbelievable and when he does require the double Sharingan it makes no sense how he can utilise its power, especially since he obtains it at the end of the war and thus his chakra would have been completely gone! Another example of crap writing is after Naruto is reborn, he somehow saves Gai from dying just by simply touching his chest! It makes no sense why he can suddenly do this and this element is never explained to us at all. Not only that, but a few moments later he restores Kakashi's eye in the same fashion, but fails to restore Gai's dead legs, for whatever reason. What an asshole!\\n\\n\r\nThese final arcs are so full of ass-pulls, random power-ups and last for so long that I can\u2019t stand the idea of watching them again. The final fight between Naruto and Sasuke was pretty impressive and I\u2019m glad it wasn't stuffed with filler but it\u2019s not enough to save the whole series. The \u201cfinal\u201d villain Madara was the only thing I liked about the final arc but even then, he was replaced by the true final villain who was terrible, since the author had no idea how to end the series nor of how to get rid of such a powerful enemy.  Kaguya was such a terrible final villain, only being relevant for about ten episodes or so. The biggest problem is that she came out of nowhere. There was no build-up like Madara. Madara felt justified to be the final villain because of the build-up and the pay off with him was pretty good, but Kaguya was boring, dull and had no narrative steaks or intrigue behind her character at all. She was truly the worst final villain I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about every little thing, but I\u2019ve covered everything that pisses me off the most so I\u2019ll leave it at that. I do enjoy Naruto, despite the obvious flaws, but if you want to get into the series, just read the manga.\\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: Believe it! Took 10 years and 500 episodes but it finally ended. Guess that cow finally ran out of milk! \r\n[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 6/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 7/10]\r\nBelieve it! The series who was never meant to end has finally been laid to rest\u2026 or has it? It may have taken 10 years and 500 episodes (280 Cannon and 220 Fillers, believe it, I counted), thank you Studio Pierrot for finally stop milking this cow. Let's be real, all the real fans got so tired of your shenanigans they finished the manga long time ago. So why would you invest in thissuper long show?  \\n\\n\r\nRage aside, what's Naruto: Shippuden really about? It's a story about an unwanted ninja shinobi boy who had the dream of becoming Hokage and believe it he will overcome all the adversaries (including fillers) to achieve it! (But if we are being honest, it's really about Naruto's journey of finding his angry dark lover, Sasuke, to bring back home and he will ignore all his other friends to achieve it)! Jokes or Fillers aside, the main plot has two major arcs, the Akatsiki tailed beast arc and the Fourth Great Shinobi World War arc. This is your traditional archetypical heroic journey style shounen anime filled with every trope known to mankind. So if you believe it, they will employ it! The overarching theme is Friendship & Love conquers hatred & evil. How boring yet sweet & addictive. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are wondering how can such a boring storyline keep the audience captivated for 500 episodes? The unique characters can be a possibility. This show has exactly 212 unique characters (villagers and background people excluded) and believe it do they stand out in one way or another! The major protagonists are Naruto and his Nakamas (which is friends for those weebs who don't know) Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi. On the other hand, the list of antagonists just goes on and each successive one is more ridiculous with godlike powers & jutsus than the previous. Seriously, how Naruto overcomes them and befriends them will leave viewers breathless. Shoutout to Ittachi, for being one hell of a memorable antagonist the anime industry will never forget and should not forget, believe it! \\n\\n\r\nIf the story and characters don't do this show justice, (it desn't) it's definitely the animation and sound accompanying it. Narutoverse completely changed the landscape of fighting style with its unique farcical jutsus that were hand-drawn and animated adequately well. It's impressive that most of the characters were very distinct from one another given this show having 212 unique characters. Fillers aside, the Cannon episodes were actually drawn well and the standard was reasonably maintained throughout, believe it! Moreover, given that this show is 500 episodes, it actually features around 60 unique OP/ED songs. It's a definitely a first for a show that took a decade to finish. The OP/ED songs are well received among fans and non fans of this anime. Furthermore, the background OST is composed beautifully well and it accompanies the fight sequence rather too well. This show really knows how to create HYPE and hit you in the feels so hard it will make even Chuck Norris shed a tear. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't really see myself rewatching this show but I would recommend people to atleast give this show a shot. Why? Because I'm evil, no, because why not? If you are serious about it and only want to watch cannon episodes then definitely give it a shot. It's an interesting bingable show (over few weeks) and if you get tired, then just finish the manga. This show is nowhere near perfect and it has too many flaws that is just not worth ranting about it. If you ask fans of this show, they will say 10/10 but realistically looking at cannon episodes it's 7/10. Therefore, maybe you should really watch Naruto: Shippuden. Believe it!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Below is the outline for all the cannon episode. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n1-27,\u00a029-56,\u00a072-89,\u00a0113-126,\u00a0129-143,\u00a0152-169,\u00a0172-175,\u00a0179,\u00a0197-211,\u00a0214-222,\u00a0243-256,\u00a0261-270,\u00a0272-278,\u00a0282-283,\u00a0296-302,\u00a0321-346,\u00a0362-375,\u00a0378-387,\u00a0391-393,\u00a0414-415,\u00a0418,\u00a0420-421,\u00a0424-426,\u00a0458-459,\u00a0463,\u00a0469-479,\u00a0484-500\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found reading this short but supaishi review helpful.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why people are rating this series so low, I don't know\r\nIt's truly the end. Naruto was always something that I considered bad due to the  fillers, however once I got into it I was hooked.\r\nStory:\r\nAh, the story. It's just filled with so much emotion and it was amazingly executed up until the Pain Arc, yes it went down, and we all know the War was dragged on for far too long but surely that doesn't ruin the moral of the story? Naruto always had one goal, and we always knew that he would meet stronger opponents, some that could challenge his goal, and Obitoand Madara were those two. The later of the War Arc is amazingly written in my opinion, the Obito regret, Madara's reasoning and much more. Overall, the story remained the same and always had one goal, and didn't go off that path. Naruto wanted to become strong, he wanted to be acknowledged and lastly he wanted to the Hokage. All which he achieved.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Naruto's Art hasn't impressed me much, however animation in canon episodes were spectacular, especially in the final battle. Not much can be said.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNaruto's OST is the best I have heard in any anime. Sadness and Sorrow, My Name, Gehika, and many more. They hype you up, just like any OST is supposed to be doing in a Shounen. Naruto's OP''s were great too, I can listen to them all day anytime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNaruto has lots of great characters. Although the bad thing is that in the war the spotlight is mainly on Naruto and Sasuke. This doesn't take anything from the other characters though. Characters such as Obito, Nagato, Itachi and Madara are so amazingly written. Never in an anime have I cheered for a villain. Nagato and Naruto's conversation really hits and it also makes you think about  today's society. People kill and kill but they know this leads to more hatred and revenge, something that will eventually bring the world down, just like it did in Naruto. Naruto and the rest of Konoha are great characters, all are special and are all someone you can get invested into, of course there's the \"muh sakura is useless\", but it's still great to see all characters nevertheless. Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry is unrivaled in my opinion. I have yet to see a Shounen that has a better rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWow, Enjoying Naruto is something very hard for some people, muh fillers, muh the anime show drags on for too long. Naruto can be enjoyed, if you take your mind off other people's. You have to go into it expecting something, if you go into it like many people you will be disappointed. We all know Naruto isn't the best shounen but still, when it gets good, it can be one of the best. I've really enjoyed Naruto as a character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Naruto Shippuden alot. The first few arc were dragging for too long, but I still managed.  Once it got good, I really got hooked. Naruto as a whole is a story which has a really amazing world. People saying, \"wow it's another Dragon Ball Z at the end\" should know that in the first Chapter it was made loud and clear that one single demon Fox wiped out a whole Village. We all knew what Naruto's character was going to become. Naruto is something that will get alot of flack but in many years time, we'll look back and happy we experienced such a great show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I can't actually some people prepared reviews and \"pretend\" they've seen the whole series and are giving low numbers. Wow.",

            "content": "First off, I would like to let you know that this is my first ever review and I'm glad it's going to be for Naruto.\r\nNaruto was an anime which would leave first time viewers with a bad taste in their mouth, it was like this immature anime with not much of a story to it and it's main character was just this silly, clumsy immature kid who is determined to become the Hokage of his village some day. It made viewers go through a painful number of fillers to get to a serious part which made many fans disappointed at the end of the firstseries.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden. This was basically like a present for those true fans who sticked through the endless fillers to finally get serious about the show. It shows how deep and how matured the show was meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nI know this may sound biased, and many would feel 10 is too much for a show like this but bear with me. The MC, Naruto Uzumaki who seemed like this not so tough, silly, immature kid and all he thought about was being the Hokage but the story actually revolves around him in so many other ways. It finally isn't just all him anymore, the different characters who took part in the first series become more important. The suspense of revealing the truth behind more truth is intense, it makes you want to keep going on. There was even a touch of love in the series and it was felt throughout the series. It's a story which will make you get into each of the characters but expecially Naruto as it doesn't miss out a single day of his life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nI didn't want to give art 9 as well as I've recently sceen better art in several other animes but what made me stick to 9 was the fight scenes, the minute details of a single move, the background reacting to every other things and also the characters started to look more like how modern animes had their characters drawn with a clearn touch, and so my score.\\n\r\nI think sound enters this catagory and so, let me explain. Naruto Shippuden has wonderful soundtracks which fits in perfectly for each situations in the anime. You would get that feeling of getting deep into the series with the help of the soundtracks as well. And so I give art, with both great sound and great animation a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nI've mentioned before about Naruto just wanting to be Hokage someday but the character development of this single person was too good, his reasons become more clear as he grows. This anime is named Naruto as it follows him through everyday with every other main characters in different episodes. You get to see him grow up to be a very mature young man with huge responsibilities. But why this anime stands out is that, it doesn't completely miss out on the rest of the characters. Each characters have their out arc and it's explained well and the whole story with it's well times flashbacks makes it as though, the detailed bits and pieces are filling out a huge puzzle, the puzzled world of the Shinoby.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nI had to think twice here about whether to give 9 or 10 and be honest to myself. Though I love this anime so much, I actually skipped all of the fillers, just seeing the start and the end. But that's the only downside for this to miss out a 10. The reason why I did that because I couldn't wait any longer to get back into the series, the story as it was how much I enjoyed watching it.\\n\r\nIt has his humorous moments which would make you laugh for quite sometime but there can be annoying parts where Naruto just stays silly like always but you still end up laughing at it. But as much as it has it's funny parts, it has it's intense parts, love, loyalty, despair and even hate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nOverall, this is one anime which stands out for itself, though it has it's endless fillers to catch up with the manga, it's something you shouldn't miss out. It's one of those very matured, well developed, well characterized anime which keeps you on your feet while you grow up with the series. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the majority of the people who hesitate to try this show from what I've seen was because of the huge number of not so fun fillers. I would recommend skipping out on fillers as they hardly include stories related to the main story.",

            "content": "This Anime is one I have taken to heart more over then any other. Before I begin this review I want to leave a couple side notes. This review may not be entirely accurate on account of my own feelings towards the series. I will grade it the same way I did my Bleach review. If their is anyone unsatisfied with my review, then please massage me with ways of improving the presentation. With all that in mind I hope you bare with me and enjoy what I have to say.\r\n   I'll begin with my view on the story line.I had watched the original Naruto series to ensure I wasn't missing any information in shippuden. The series starts back up where it left off. Naruto had left to train with Jiraiya and become strong enough to save his friend. I figured I was going to find shippuden as bland and unsatisfying as I did the original series, but I couldn't have been further from the truth. The story is quite long, considering the show is on it's 320th episode, and similar to it's counterparts ( Bleach, DBZ and OP ) is riddled with fillers. What makes these fillers less of a nuisance is the fact that each one focuses towards Elaborating on the original story, instead of opening entirely new ones. Since the show is generally straight forward it often has many of those \"Yeah, I get it\" moments where you want to skip dialog that simply states what we already know. Small issues like this can become tiresome and seem to be the biggest issue. It seems that each episode is laid out in a manner that anyone can drop in and have some understanding as to whats happened, happening or going to happen. As for the story itself, well there's a reason this show is one of the most popular. The story isn't your basic young hero kills bad guy story like everything else these days. The young hero is confronted with an enemy that can't be defeated with a spirit bomb or a Bankai. Something beyond all other bad guys seeing as how this enemy exists in reality and is still the cause of a majority of strife in the world. He fights for the sake of his goal not just to become hokage, but to free the war ridden shinobi nations from the very claws of hatred itself. Which includes fighting with his own hatred and overcoming it for the sake of all those he holds dear and the one he seeks to save from their self inflicted fate.\\n\\n\r\n   I suppose I should move on to art now. The art style is very fluent in most scenes and other then some minor issues, mostly flawless. In truth the animations only issue would be the repetition. Some fights will replay Physics animations of trees or rocks being torn or pushed or pulled, then replay it in reverse representing the other side of the explosion or whatever is causing things to go flying. Though the biggest nuisance is the over abundance of flashbacks. Again, this acts on those \"Yeah, I get it\" points and can often kill an otherwise amazing moment in the story. The tree jumping phases can get annoying as well, but are usually used to provide Dialog or representation of travel from plot to plot. The world Shippuden takes place in is beautiful in all rights, with differant climates and cultures that seem to despise each other due to their unstable history of blood shed and chaos. The fight scenes that inevitably arise from this tension gives way to some of the most unbelievably well done animations you could ask for in a fight. Sometimes, I could find the show simply breathtaking, other times people would have to revive me do to my lack of breath ^_^\\n\\n\r\n   Next would be sound it seems. I'm a subbed anime kind of guy so that's what I'll be basing the rating on. The voices were excellent and suited each character like a glove. The soundtrack to the Shippuden series is amazing as well. I enjoyed it so much that I put them on my PSP and Phone. My personal favorite being Hyakkaryouran. This theme was exceptional at building up the pressure right before some of the most badass fights I've seen in all the anime I've watched. Though their are so many others that had the same effect, I found my self attached to that one song more then the rest.\\n\\n\r\n   Lastly would be the characters. Naruto being the main character starts out as a slightly less obnoxious version of who he was in the original series. The few years of training have calmed him very little, and though he is significantly stronger then he was as a child, He still isn't quite as strong as he needs to be. What made Naruto stand out for me was the fact that he wasn't very strong in the beginning and was quite frankly a horrible ninja, and yet was necessary. You see, though his life was just as hard if not harder then his rival Sasuke, He chooses to move past his pain and hatred to make his future and the future of his friends worth living and dying for. To obtain the secrets to peace, though he doesn't acknowledge that as his goal in the beginning, he soon accepts his destiny with open arms and intends to shoulder all the burden so his loved ones can live happily without the pain of hatred or regret. Then theirs his Rival Sasuke, who instead of attempting to better his life, chooses to hunt down those responsible for his pain and make them pay. His power is clearly greater then Naruto's in the beginning, but his goals are clouded in the very darkness and hatred that Naruto seeks to protect him from. I personally hate him, but that's just one of the connections I have to the series. With the two main characters out of the way I can involve Sakura, who's significantly less useless then she was in the original Naruto series. Kakashi, who's just as calm and collective as ever and still one of the funniest characters in the anime. Though with so many new characters such as Killer Bee and Omoi, he might not bear that title much longer.\\n\\n\r\n   Overall this anime is my favorite for many reasons. With a story and characters that I can easily connect with. Action and adventure with small traces of romance and drama thrown in. plenty of laughs and tears ( Both of Joy and Sorrow ). A story that lasts more then just one or two seasons and continues to impress. But most importantly the ability to keep me enthralled in even the most unimpressive episodes. I find that this show causes so many different anime's to go unnoticed and that makes me happy for some reason. Could be reassurance that I'm not the only one who holds the show in high esteem. Or maybe it's just my way of drawing some enjoyment out of all the haters getting riled up over their shows simply because this show's got them beat. With or without my personal opinion, I will always recommend this anime to action adventure fans... Unless they screw up the ending like they did bleach... Who know's, I might have to redo this review later.",

            "content": "Love gives birth to sacrifice.\r\nIt's one of the trinity of most popular animes, which includes Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. All far into the hundreds and hundreds of episodes. I finished the first Naruto series, and I'm close to catching up in Naruto: Shippuuden. So, Let's just jump right into my review, may turn out to be a long one.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nI loved this story, at first. The reason it didn't get a 10/10 is the fact that it's not necessarily an original story, the concept of a ninja based anime is not at all an original concept anymore. Also, there's been reoccurring issues with theplot as of lately with the manga ending and the anime still in a filler arc. But basically, the story follows along Naruto's life as a shinobi, but to take it a step further, there's added a ton of drama between characters, love interests, and how it's done throughout the series makes it such a great anime. It's an anime that I couldn't stop watching for long periods. However. The one very LARGE issue I had with Naruto as an entire franchise, and I think that all the Naruto watchers agree with, is the darn FILLER. If Naruto had little to no filler, I'd be a very happy camper.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's pretty good, the graphics of it have improved a lot between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden. They've changed for the better and I love it even more now.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved most of the intros to Naruto, but not so much in Naruto: Shippuuden. I loved the background music that was in the fight scenes or just random scenes all together. It was great to finally see an anime that understood how to choose music for specific scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime brought out some of the best examples of characters I've seen in awhile. \\n\r\nNaruto: Immature, hard headed,  strong willed, cocky, I could go on. He is a great character, he went through so much crap when he was younger, that I sympathize with him. However, I still get tired of his immaturity. His parents were killed while trying to save him, and he was sealed with the nine tails beast. The people in the village didn't take the time to understand Naruto, and they didn't see how hard it must have been for Naruto to live with that thing, or live without any friends or family. He lived by himself! It makes me mad how ignorant people were back when Naruto was a child. Naruto had to save their village from being destroyed before they really acknowledged him.\\n\r\nSasuke: I know a lot of characters also misjudge Sasuke as well for being too cruel. However, he is a very strong individual who has his mind in place, and is very determined to finish whatever he has started. He feels like a very misjudged character, but he's just a very hard person to read;  you never really know if you picked up on the right notion or if  you were completely off base.\\n\r\nSakura: She's a very strong willed individual. She knows what she likes and she will not stop till she gets them. She's a very determined young lady and she is very powerful.\\n\r\nKakashi: He was Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura's mentor and really liked to pick fun at Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. He's a very mysterious character, but in this series we got a very lengthy but interest flashback to when Kakashi was younger and in his own team. It was very informative and very traumatic to see how sad and heartbroken his past was.\\n\r\nPain: He is my favorite character out of everyone. And by Pain I mean, Nagato, and the 6 Pains. Hence the first quote on this review. It was a Pain quote said to Naruto, in the fight at the leaf village. Nagato was part of the Akatsuki. I love that group, I wish they would base a new anime on just them, and how they came about more in depth, because they explained, Nagato and Konan, and their story but they didn't really explain the rest of them, nearly as much. Anyway, Pain is just my favorite character, I can't express it in words, just his actions, his speaking, and his quotes, all just come together so perfectly.\\n\r\nThere are so many more neat characters I could have mentioned but I feel like the review would go on forever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of this anime was an 7. I loved the plot of the story, and the different battles, but the overall enjoyment was brought down by the whole filler aspect of the show. I realize it's a small portion of the anime, but for me I just want to stick with the main plot of the story and not drift aside. I know I can't change it, and I know that's not the only problem with the anime..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nMy overall has been updated to a 7 out of 10 because of the characters in this story. They were all awesome, and well played out. The characters in this story really saved the over all rating, because if it was just based on the story and the plot I don't know if it would be that high. Now I'm not saying that the filler was the ONLY big problem in Naruto, not by a long shot. There's issues I have with some of the plot holes that seemed to have formed as of lately (seeing as though the manga finished and yet they're still showing filler that's unnecessary). I'm becoming more and more lost as the series goes on. And now it's just become a nuisance to have to keep up with it.. \\n\\n\r\n*I love criticism! Please feel free to write on my profile the pros and cons of my review, I know some of these sections were short, but that's because the characters were the only thing that I really liked about this anime. But anyway please feel free to write on my profile, I want feedback!",

            "content": "At the time of this writing, Naruto is all but over. In fact, it might as well have been over way back when the fillers started in the first season.\r\nWhat started out as a great anime with a deep story and tons of charming characters has inexplicably turned its back on most of what was good about it, first and foremost the relationship between naruto, sasuke and sakura. And there are still filler arcs in Shippuuden, one of which has just begun.\r\nWe are now at episode 95 of the second season and sasuke is still basically nowhere to be seen. The first arc showed bitsand pieces of him, and he was on screen for 5 minutes at the end of it. Since then, he's appeared sporadically in flashbacks and extremely short vignettes as a way to tease the audience into thinking he will return soon and naruto will get back on track...but then another arc starts without him. And another. To top it all off, another worthless filler arc has just begun!\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean to say that sasuke makes the entire series. Akatsuki is an interesting group of characters, and the majority of those great characters from the first season are still present and basically unchanged. However, Sasuke is a huge part of naruto, and he's gone. Gaara is one of the coolest characters ever, and he's gone. And another filler arc has just begun.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has also taken a huge hit with this series. I don't know if they changed production companies or what, but everyone suddenly looks disproportioned and the animation looks choppy and cheap. Sakura has a tendency to look quite mannish when viewed in profile. There is an infamous part of the new ending where Hinata's hair seems to be falling off. The art seems to get even worse during fillers...i don't know if i've mentioned this yet, but a filler arc has just begun!\\n\\n\r\nNaruto is also no longer funny.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I could sit here and write all day about how much naruto has jumped the shark, but there is one thing that should be said: I still watch it. I'm not sure exactly why, but I never miss an episode. If I had to pay even a cent for it, I wouldn't; but I still watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I might stop watching until this filler arc is over. The problem with fillers is not that they are worthless (i'd rather have fillers than nothing) but that they are so often boring and cheaply done, and often stray too far from the roots of the show. There are ways to get fillers right (see Bleach: Turn Back the Pendulum), but Naruto's fillers fail. Miserably.\\n\\n\r\nAnother %*#@%&! filler, and still no sasuke. Can you believe it?",

            "content": "I cannot believe this poor excuse of a directing team gets a near 8 overall, and MANY 9's/10's for their work. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that a \"6\" constitutes \"Fair\". Meaning, this anime is better than \"Mediocre\", better than \"Decent\".\r\n(the mean of the subcategory values doesn't equal 6 because MAL lacks a \"flow\" category)\r\nNaruto Shippuuden is probably the most famous anime to the general American populous. You might consider that one guy the whitest guy on the planet, yet he's probably watched some form of anime: Naruto. In fact, Naruto is so widespread that you could actually have friends that canrelate to you about an anime for once. It is just that popular. However, that exact popularity could lead it to being \"overrated\", and that is exactly what I believe it to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, to be honest, is amazing. I like ninjas. I like people fighting. I like people dying. However, Naruto Shippuuden took a turn for the worst. One of the biggest changes in the show (from Part 1 to Part 2) was the feeling of \"ninja battles\" vs \"demon battles\". In the first part of Naruto, the highest-caliber battle was between the three Hokages and Orochimaru. Their jutsus were so badass, nobody of a lower level could contest with them. However, that level of power is absolutely LAUGHABLE in today's Naruto world. Sasuke's Susano'o will just eat the living crap out of the Hokages. Nagato will use some overpowered six-path rinnegan jutsu that he pulls out of his ass. Oh, but of course Naruto can defeat him. And that's yet another problem with the story. Naruto is apparently able to do everything, and WE ALL KNOW the Fourth Great Ninja War is going to end with Naruto reigning victorious over the antagonists. We already know that. So, with the lack of suspense, why do people still watch this anime? The only reason I can think of is its development of drama.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, this anime capitalizes on \"Talk no Jutsu\" (as coined by Sawyer7mage), where the characters are apparently in a national speech and debate competition over the gold medal or something. Seriously. There is so much talking in this anime that the fighting gets devalued to nothing. And when there is fighting? YOU HIT A WALL OF 20 FILLER EPISODES. IN A DAMN ROW. And that is what I mean by poor directing. A somewhat great storyline with promising battle scenes is RUINED, absolutely RUINED by the existence of filler episodes. Literally 90% of them are completely off-plot and not funny at all; \"oh, they're just saving the 43rd Snow-land Daimyo/Princess/cat/dog/frog\". It is ridiculous how good the producers are at pissing off the fanbase, including myself. Nothing is more irritating than waiting excitedly for the next episode, only to realize that it is a filler. And when you hit a filler, you know you'll be there for a while. Good luck man, it'll only take half a year to get back onto the main plot (or almost half a year; most filler runs are 20 episodes long). By the time they get back onto the main story, you already forgot half the story leading up to that moment, forcing you to rewatch some of the previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Naruto is a great story and will captivate its audiences for certain; however, Shippuuden's great shift from Naruto Part 1's original premise seriously hurts its cause. The incredible amount of \"overpowered\" ninjas along with all the \"demon\" powers and the over-glorification of Eye Techniques leads to a story where only a handful of characters can even function. Couple that with the mass of fillers, and you get an anime series that is much worse than its potential implies.",

            "content": "I was a little late to the Naruto party, i started watching the anime 3 years ago. I immediately fell in love with it. I was cranking out 20+ episodes in a day consistently with ease. \r\nAs many people have surely mentioned, the fillers can be a bit much at times and they can also seem extremely repetitive and for someone who was not watching the series week by week ( or maybe even for them as well) it can be a bit frustrating and sometimes i found myself skimming though certain fillers. \r\nPutting aside the fillers, the story line for this series was verynice, in my opinion. I very much enjoyed the fighting scenes and also enjoyed the transitions from huge fights to normal life back at the village. It was a nice blend of both. The comedic aspect was really good as well. Its tough to write without giving examples from the show, but i don't wanna spoil anything for anyone looking to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an amazing series and it feels weird to me that its over. I had my ups and downs with it but i always came back to watch more. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a long series to watch, beware of the filler sections however. I feel this is an anime everyone should try to watch ( whether you watch it all or not). Believe it!",

            "content": "227 episodes....A good point to make a review in my opinion.\r\nNaruto had its ups and downs but for me the ups were better cause the fillers weren't all that bad.\r\nNow we have Shippuuden and i am both happy yet disappointed. I'll do my best to keep things brief and simple.\r\nThis series has great potential. Naruto still has his goal for becoming Hokage and being a Jinchuuriki doesn't help at all. The akatsuki keep getting in the way trying to steal the Kyuubi. Naruto is of course much older but not that much stronger as i would personally have hoped. If you also are disappointed bythis DON'T drop this anime! Many things will happen to make up for it including him getting considerably stronger.\\n\\n\r\nOthers may have dropped it based on the dubbed versions, well I'm here to tell you that they are rubbish and you should watch the original japanese version with the english subtitles. It sounds much more realistic and believe me if you are new to it, it doesn't take long to get use to it.\\n\\n\r\nFillers are also a reason people put this show on the drop list. Yes, most are annoying BUT some are actually rather interesting. Trust me on that. If you don't wish to watch any fillers or want to know which ones are good then by all means post a comment on my profile. Don't post a comment randomly, asking which episodes to avoid and such because i will ignore it. Give me a range of episodes and i will tell you which are fillers or not. You can find the list on wiki if you like.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is extraordinary. The anticipation and suspense of it all is worth it. As time goes on more members of the Akatsuki are brought forward and hidden details are revealed, like their special abilities and their \"forbidden\" past. You grow to love each member in your own way. You learn who is the true ring leader behind everything and why they did all this. There will be heartbreaking moments. I know because it happened to me once. I actually shed a tear before realizing that i was emotional :P The humor is still the same as before so expect much difference. It will make you smile but not fall off your chair laughing.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may find the idea of Naruto trying to do anything to get Sasuke back a bit stupid or i should say what my friend said \"gay\". I understand that but think about it. Naruto never had any friends to begin with and he was able to make some as the story went on. Sasuke was his best friend and later became the FIRST person the acknowledge him. That is what makes Naruto give his all to bring him back. It's not just a simple reason like friendship, it is much more deeper.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a shounen series that very few surpass. Many will disagree but everyone has their own opinion. Maybe you don't like shounen and that's fine but that is no reason to not give this anime at least a try. It's one of the legendary three. (NS, B, OP) If you liked any of the other two then i see no reason not to like this one. If you still have any questions on it please feel free to post a comment and i will reply as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nHow you found this review even remotely helpful.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback greatly appreciated XD",

            "content": "In the original Naruto, you have a simple plot with youthful, childish humor befitting for children, as it is an anime about children and typically for children. As you near the end, the fillers can become unbearable, and everyone is excited to just get it over with and fly off into a whole new world that is Naruto: Shippuden. Naruto Shippuden is the continued story of Narutos life journey about 3 years later. Although 3 years may not seem all that long, at a crucial age as Naruto is in the anime, and the life that he has to lead, it is in fact anextremely large factor in the noticeable differences between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden. It seems that many Naruto fans begin watching with a mindset that still sits with the original Naruto and it's light-hearted ways, and are unprepared for the sudden strifes and seriousness of the new series. Yes, it is true. 3 years later, Narutos life is no longer fun and games.  He is thrown into a world with struggle and complexities befitting for his new age and the era that has begun in Naruto Shippuden. There is little room for the fun and simplicities as Naruto grows and begins fighting for his village and for the lives of his comrads. The series no longer focuses on childish dreams of friendship and play, it's begun a whole new era of the young Konoha's lives where pain and strife become evident in the role of growing up and they are forced to fight for survival and their \"ninja way\", be it peace or revenge, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is by far one of my favorites. It goes from the fun-loving story of children and continues on with more complexities and seriousness that much resembles what happens when you truly grow up in the world and must face life's tests and troubles. This anime could have either continued on with everyone growing older but their character staying young (in turn keeping the childish nature of the original anime) or it could have had them mature with age and inevitably give Shippuden a more mature, serious flow. I believe that they made the right choice by making the anime mature with the characters. It makes it feel as though I am watching the true life of the characters- Aging, maturing, struggling, laughing, crying, and becoming who they are as a person- as an adult. In the beginning, Naruto always talked about who he wanted to grow up as and what he wanted to be- and I wanted to see him do it. With Shippuden I feel like that is exactly what I am getting. Naruto's finally growing up, he's finally realizing the life struggles around him and taking charge and making a difference instead of being the ignorant child that he once was. Let's face it- their is truly little fun in a ninja world once you start growing up. I like how this anime shows the horrors of their reality finally coming into play, even if that means adding complexities to a once simple anime. \\n\\n\r\nTaking the laughter of a youthful story and turning it into the tears of a growing pain as the years continue. Watching the characters go from innocent, young villagers in (ninja) grade school, to young adults that risk life and limb everyday. This is what I've wanted from an anime. Most anime stories are just  \"this or that\". Simple or complex. Funny or sad. Cute or dark. Etc. But Naruto is different. Naruto is the life of ninjas from simple beginnings to hard endings. Happy, youthful days to waking up with the heavy burdens of adulthood. I feel like I could watch his whole life play out if it were to be written out for me, I really do.\\n\\n\r\n(I am a simple anime lover and as it is a cartoon, I don't take my opinions to extremes as some other might. I don't pick at animation or subtle issues, I look at the overall picture. So, that being said, please note that this factor will show in my review.)(Also, Shippuden might have been 2 in a half years later. Idk, I'm no expert. So, I put \"about 3 years later.\" I know anime fans can be very picky about your \"facts\". :d)",

            "content": "After an endless wasteland of filler, Naruto returns! Joy! Happiness! Frowns turned upside down! I couldn't believe it when the fillers ended. I was ecstatic. \r\nNow I'm ready with a pillow whenever I tune in every friday. Question mark? I'll tell you why I'm prone to falling asleep while watching Naruto:Shippuuden - it just isn't Naruto anymore. It just isn't the same series.\r\nStory: Don't get me wrong, Naruto didn't just magically start stabbing me with disappointment because the story started to totally go downhill. In fact, the first episode's preview with Naruto's future encounter with Sasuke had me on the edge of my seat. Icouldn't believe it: Naruto was back! No, the story continues and follows through adequately as a continuation of the original Naruto. The great elements of the original story are still here: the theme of an everlasting friendship, the importance of maintaining hope, the need to endure and persevere .. these themes are all still there! Naruto is still a great guy and he still strives to protect his friends and 'save' Sasuke while taking on Akatsuki at the same time. So what happened to Naruto? Well, story-wise, nothing. I still love the story. I love the world of Naruto, the ninjas, the techniques, the weapons, the themes, the plot. Although the story doesn't present the viewers with anything deep or complicated, I still like it. But the story isn't the problem. The story as it is and as it continues, gets a 7.5/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It was great to see how much the characters changed from the original Naruto. Character development in this aspect, was great. Pretty much everbody had a new design and they all looked great. In terms of personality, well, they were the same loveable characters, unique in their own way. In terms of Naruto and Sakura, they really developed. Although he still acts like it, Naruto isn't the same happy loudmouth he used to be. He's been deeply scarred from Sasuke's betrayal, and despite all thats happened, he's still obsessed with saving him. Of course, Sasuke's betrayal affected Sakura too and she's really toughened up. She isn't the useless twist she used to be, and shes really grown to respect and care for Naruto. Character development is great, the characters are great, old and new. Sai for example, is an interesting add on, he brought the funnies and kept the comedic aspects of the show alive. The characters aren't the problem either: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation: Here is where Shippuuden starts going downhill. In terms of the new characters and their new character designs, I love em. But Naruto just isn't animated as well as it used to be. There is a lot of repeated animation in Shippuuden. This ranges from terribly animated tree jumping scenes (it actually looks more like they're flying instead of jumping half the time, lazy much?) to staring faces and overused flashbacks. I can understand the need to repeat the frames from things like the tree jumping scenes that are filled with dialog, or the occasional flashback to remind us of what happened in the original Naruto or something a couple of episodes ago. But the extent of it is teetering on the cliff side. The quality is just going downhill. Kakashi's new Sharingan attack for example, was terribly done in my opinion. I could have done that effect in photoshop. To make it worst, they drew it out for minutes on end ... completely destroying the 'cool factor'. There are also several still scenes that consist of pure eye to eye combat with wind blowing in the background. Cool? I think not, not when pointless staring takes up about 15% of the episode's air time. Asides from this, the coloring and detail of the characters in terms of shading and such also seem to be lacking in contrast to the original Naruto. Looking at the two, they just aren't on the same level anymore. Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to the series, or because I've watched so many more series since the original Naruto, but the quality has definitely deteriorated. Of course, some of the big fights are still animated quite nicely: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Things just get worst from here. While I loved the new opening and closing songs, the episode bgm just isn't the same. The upbeat action music heard in the original Naruto has been replaced by lame 'lets make this fight seem really tense and epic' music that fails horribly. I want the old soundtracks back! Granted, the series is alot more serious now, but the background soundtracks really can't shake the excitement meter up to where it used to be: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, so it's the same story, continued. The same characters, with some cool new additions are there. The animatiors are getting a bit lazy, and the soundtracks aren't making me chew my fingernails anymore. Does this really warrant a 6? \\n\\n\r\nPacing: This is what has killed Naruto. Not Akatasuki, Not Orochimaru, not Sasuke, not Sakura's poundings - the pacing has killed our beloved hero, Naruto. This is the sole reason that the plot development seems slow and nonexistent, this is why character development is hard to note unless you really love the series, this is why animation is being reused, repeated, or not done at all, this is why I can no longer enjoy Naruto like I used to. So much time is deliberately wasted on mundane scenes such as staring, or camera panning that there are often many awkward pauses that make you wonder, 'did my computer freeze?'. This should NOT be happening in an anime! The amount of still scenes and overused camera panning should not be in surplus and evident enough to deteriorate the quality of a show! There are so many episodes that had amazing potential to be jaw-droppers, but they weren't. Intense battles like episodes 41-43 are completely ruined due to horribly SLOW SLOW pacing!\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the animators want to avoid killing its viewers with a plauge of fillers, but is it really worth it to completely destroy such a potentially satisfying anime? In my opinion, they're ruining the series. We waited and endured just as our hero taught us to - only to be attacked by this monstrosity. The pacing effectively destroyed my love for this show. You may argue that fillers are worse and thats debatable. What isn't however, is that there is enough manga material for at least another 50 FAST paced Naruto episodes. Thats a year! Probably more when you consider that by the time 50 episodes are released, there could be enough material for another 20 or so potential episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Same enjoyable story with great potential. But the pacing needs to change. That pillow I mentioned at the beginning of this long, terrible review? It wasn't for sleeping. It was to stop me from killing myself from bashing my head against the desk as I watched a potentially good series slaughtered before my eyes. 6/10",

            "content": "-------------------------------------\r\n Naruto Shippuden : Review |\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nNaruto. The series that sold over 220 million manga copies, winning handful of awards along the way. An anime that ranked as one of the most watched series in Japan that got tarnished by a greedy studio and has received tons of internet backlash throughout the years. \r\nLet me start off by saying Naruto is by no means a flawless anime. It's the exact opposite. The series had too many fillers. Sometimes the animation quality was below par and pacing can be painfully slow at times.\r\nBut please bear with me here. I'm going to tell you why it has beenthe best experience an anime gave me in my entire life and dig into what made the series popular and also its flaws.\\n\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\n-----------\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Naruto has been a mixed bag. While it's not bad, it's certainly no Berserk. But what it is, is beautiful (probably not the word that can be often used to describe a shounen anime), but it really is. It's unpredictable, it's thrilling, it plays with your emotions, it's funny, it's tragic, it's sometimes downright frustrating but it is, more than anything, wondrous and fun. This is series gets more mature themes and darker tones as the series progresses. There are multiple issues I have with the series\u2019 story, but main flaws comes down to the filler and pacing issues.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the filler. The amount of filler in this show is staggering. It counts as 219 total filler episodes which make up 44% of the series as a whole.\\n\r\nThe issues that lies within the filler episodes is that they are not allowed to make any significant changes to the story or specifically its characters. This being a mainly character driven plot, this becomes a huge issue because any significant event in fillers could affect the characters so they can't move ahead the plotline at all. So mostly what we get is poorly written mini-arcs and episodes that don\u2019t affect any of the characters or the world in any significant way. This is worsened by the below par writing for these filler episode as they are not written by the original author Masashi Kishimoto himself. \\n\r\nHowever, there are exceptions for this. Some of the filler episodes can be genuinely enjoyable but those are few and far between. The fact that filler can't move the plot along fuels the second big flaw. Which is:\\n\\n\r\nPacing Issues. Aside from what I've said above, even some of the non-filler episodes are very slow paced. This is mainly only an issue at the start of the series. If you're into characters chilling down and wasting a lot of time, this may sit well with you. But even then some of these episodes might be below par for your taste. Once the series kicks it into high gear around 70th episode, it mostly manages to keep that pace up.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we got the flaws out of the way, let's talk positives.\\n\r\nThe main strength of the series is its characters, who drive the plot (which we will discuss in detail later). After the first 70 episodes, things begin to get lot more interesting really fast. The world of shinobi gets expanded exponentially, and if you're a fan of deep lore in stories, this will fit right in your wheel house because it begins to explore the roots of the world and its history very deeply. \\n\r\nOne thing that this series does very well is explaining its concepts to the viewer. The techniques that characters use and how the things in shinobi world works are explained in detail. Also, the concept of Chakra and what a versatile power system it is compared to other shounen series really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of themes explored in the series are vast. It explores all the basic themes of a typical shounen and as it goes on it delves into themes such as the nature of humans, self sacrifice, discrimination, manipulation, roots of war and peace, difference of perceptions, the line between good and evil, and alienation. It manages to deal with all these themes without abandoning the shounen type feel or becoming it pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that the author, Kishimoto, really excels at is setting up events. For example, during the early episodes of Naruto (the prequel to this show), he started setting up major events that happened in the last of Shippuden. In the beginning, we look over these little details and minor events and have no idea that they are going to have such an impact later in the series, and when it all comes together in the end, you feel so satisfied. Most of the times these events and twists will take you by surprise and maybe you'll have fun trying to figure out them before they happen as Kishimoto drops clues for you to pick up throughout the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThe last arc of the series has been very controversial as the constant change of antagonists has irritated some of the viewers. But in all honesty, all of the antagonists that were presented had different motives that drove them to do what they do and distinctively different from each other which made them very enjoyable. That being said, the final part of the war arc was really disappointing as the final villain of the series is the worst character that the series had to offer. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a battle shounen ,of course there are going to be battles, and this is one area that the series really shines.\\n\r\nAs I see it , battles can be broken down into three different segments in this anime , The battle of wits , The battle of ideologies , The physical battle. All three come in union to make some memorable and truly great moments. Each characters ideologies and philosophies gets tested time and time again by their opponents and we can see even the main character himself doubt his ideologies towards the end. When we see someone gets broken inside as well as the outside it's devastating to watch. To put it blatantly, Naruto has the best combat scenes I've ever witnessed in an anime. I have to mention that this style of combat is heavily inspired by Hunter x Hunter. Kishimoto does a fantastic job putting emotions into its battle scenes which are backed up by gorgeous animations (at times, we'll get to that later) and a mesmerizing soundtrack, and with these combined it really sets up fantastic visual storytelling through combat. Kishimoto does an excellent job at setting up the events leading up to the fight to make it feel all the more personal and these battles often comes down to which character outwits the other rather than who can punch harder. This makes characters like Shikamaru Nara who have very little ability make a huge impact in the series. \\n\r\nVariety of the fighting styles is massive, ranging from intimate hand to hand style combats, tactical combats, long range jutsu battles, and most often a mix of all of these!\\n\\n\r\nYou will see friends become foes, foes become friends, unlikely alliances formed and broken, that precious character you loved die, revenge plots, plot twists, character growth, politics, romance, and the world itself change. There are some flaws but it's a full package and Kishimoto always seemed to have the ending and everything planned out from the very beginning.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the core of the franchise. \\n\r\nEach character in Naruto is very distinctive from each other. Each has a core motive that drives them, a unique personality, and a specialty in different skill sets. And hats-off to Kishimoto for his brilliant character design as he used a very bright color pallet and made each one very distinctive to make each of them stand out.\\n\r\nNo matter which kind of characters you prefer, you're sure to find someone here that you can relate to. What the series really does well is making sure that you'll be attached to the characters emotionally. And you will cheer them on as they try to achieve their goals , watch their philosophies and ideologies gets tested , watch them break or prevail and break down crying at their deaths. \\n\r\nYou will get to see how what's happening around the characters change them , mold them. Witnessing how tragedies that's happening around them having an effect on their psyche is one of the strongest points of Naruto Shippuden. It's fun seeing small character interactions from early episodes grow into full blown relationships.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to the \"Villains\" \\n\r\nThis series checks all the boxes when it comes to antagonist character archetypes.\\n\r\n*Self-Righteous Villain with a God Complex* [checked] , *Money Hungry Villains* [checked] , *Religious Psychopaths* [checked] , *Villain who is after Revenge* [checked]. I think I've made my point there. But what makes this villains so enjoyable is that no one is a villain just for the sake for being a villain. The best kind of villains are the ones you can empathize with, the ones that you feel for and understand them and make you question your own morality, this is something that this series excels at. As same as the main characters, the villains too have core motivation driving them. They have their own beliefs, ideologies and they are willing to fight for what they think is right. You might find yourself cheering on the villains more than the \"heroes.\" The morality here is blurred.\\n\\n\r\nBut coming back to the war arc, its main flaw is the final villain (which I will not spoil here). Compared with the other villainous characters from the series, the final character is very bland and their motivations are not entirely clear or most likely not relatable to any of the viewers. That being said, this character is only in the series for a very small amount of episodes and the others certainly do more than enough to make up for it.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 7.5\\n\r\n-----------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAgain we have a mixed bag here. \\n\r\nThis show can look stunning when it wants to, and by stunning I meant big budget movie level of quality. But at times the quality can drop way below par.\\n\r\nI think I should specially mention Hiroyuki Yamashita\u2019s work here. He mainly works on battle scenes and this man is a genius when it comes to it. Even though he only worked on a limited number of episodes, his episodes pushes the animation, choreography and stylishness to 11! \\n\r\nDespite this I can't give it a higher score because this show is wildly inconsistent with its animation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for character designs, we already talked about how Kishimoto made his characters very distinctive and imaginative and how the bright color pallet fuels this.\\n\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\n--------------\\n\\n\r\nThis is an another strong point of the series. Yasuharu Takanashi has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this series that manages to highlight the intensity, the tragedies, and the sorrow of each moment. The emotions that Kishimoto wants to portray make it through to us so well because of this soundtrack. It connects us with the world of Naruto Shippuden in a special way. I would recommend listening to tracks like Samidare (Early Summer Rain) to get a taste of what the soundtrack is like.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Experience - 10\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden is more of an experience that needs to be had than just a mere show. It played with our emotions for over a decade and now it has been concluded. The enjoyment of Naruto Shippuden goes beyond just the series itself. This series has a very big community and fanbase that you could interact with. And its lore is so vast that you would never run out of things to discuss about it. Although it has its share of major flaws, this series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're fine with the hefty commitment.\\n\r\nAnd with this, I conclude my review for this series that defined a generation.\\n\\n\r\nSub or Dub ? : Sub is recommended\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\r\n| Recommendations |\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[Naruto] : Yes, the original series. It's essential to watch it before the Shippuden series because it contains a lot of character development and build-up for the Shippuden series.\\n\\n\r\n[Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ] : This series contains most of the things that made Shippuden great such as good character development, good soundtrack, and excellent world building. This series does it in about 70 episodes which is truly a magnificent achievement. If you like Naruto Shippuden, it's a given that you will like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as well. \\n\\n\r\n[Hunter X Hunter (2011)] : A series that greatly inspired Naruto. Both anime feel very similar in style. If the inconsistencies of Naruto bothered you, you'll find a much more consistent pacing and quality of writing here. Whether the highs of Hunter X Hunter matches up to the highs of Shippuden or FMA Brotherhood is up for debate, but you won't have to sit through any lows like you have to endure with Naruto or Naruto Shippuden.\\n\\n\r\n[Proofreading - SomeRandomNerd]",

            "content": "I am a big anime fan and I have to say that Naruto: Shippuuden is one of my absolute all time favourites. There are probably so many people that would disagree with me and tell me that Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden are a waste of time and that the story is a bunch of fillers put together. I strongly disagree and will tell you all why with this review of mine. \r\nFirst of all, the biggest difference between Naruto and Shippuuden is the darker tone, the maturity and the depth in Shippuuden. In Naruto, the whole series was about him wanting to become the Hokage,being clumsy and always working hard to become better than Sasuke. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Naruto's dorkiness but in Shippuuden he becomes serious. The series as well. Now the friendship and loyalty takes over. The mysteries get their answers and new questions take form. \\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki, the moon plan, Madara, war... the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, the cliffhangers... these things are what makes Shippuuden one of the best animes I know. Kishimoto has built this massive foundation for us to walk on during the first half, and now he slowly digs into the core of the story. It keeps you on the tip of your toes. That's why the story itself gets a 10/10 from me. Story (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOf course the art is much better than Naruto. Shippuuden has much more attention for details, the characters' outfits are much better made, the colouring and effects are so much better animated. The landscapes are beautifully drawn. Fighting scenes and emotional scenes are something I've noticed myself are paid much more attention to. The characters movements flows better.The realistic feeling is all over Shippuuden. Great! Art (9/10) \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I prefer not to notice the sound at all. Sound in movies and series shouldn't be noticed. The music is there to strenghten the mood. And since I don't notice the sound and it makes me feel what I'm supposed to feel, I guess the sound is well picked. I really liked the piano pieces in Naruo. Grief and Sorrow is an extraordinary piece. But I especially enjoyed the Pain soundtrack with the choirs and dark pipe organs in Shippuuden. Sound (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nIn Naruto and Shippuuden, Kishimoto is very focused in telling all characters stories. All characters have their backgounds and special personality. They all feel like real people that you know and they all grow throughout the series. You follow their Changes and that's what is so great and important about a series that is this long. The character development.  (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSo, to justify and defend Shippuuden... \\n\r\nFirst of all, you have to understand the use of fillers. With an anime this long the writer can't keep up with the pace. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of the manga. When the anime has reached too far, they have to buy time for the writer to write more. Or, they could make it like many other animes... Make up another story and end for it or just pause it for a couple of years while Kishi draws the manga like crazy. But that wouldn't make anyone happy. Please, stop going on and on about the fillers. They are there for a very good reason. \\n\\n\r\nNaruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wishes to become the Hokage, to a serious, hardworking, loyal friend who doesn't only want to save his friend, but also the whole ninja world from the neverending cycle of hate and despair. I enjoy the series extremely much and I hope that you do too. ^^",

            "content": "There is a saying that a story doesn't begin with a story--it begins with a character.\r\nCome to think of it, all characters of Naruto are extravagantly uniquely developed.\r\n*Itachi's smile* *Neji's smile* *Obito's smile* *Hinata's face when getting married* *Sakura's 'SHANAROOO' face* *Hidan's killer smile*\r\nYou just can't say anything bad in this anime. Because this anime will teach you how to love, to value your friends, and many other Nintendo that really reflect on the real world. It's fiction, but it's as powerful as it gets...to reach a fanbase of millions and millions worldwide. \r\n'The Crafting'\r\nSuch positive, critical response isn't questionable. The story lives up tohis promise to live as long as fifteen years (in whole). It is a burning legacy. It is something no one will ever come up again. Watch Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, or various recent Shippuden fillers (Season 5 was said to be the best, and indeed it was [Guren arc.], and you'll know that there will be no other Masashi Kishimoto. Or so I thought. Naruto is an original artwork. For since little of age, Kishi after watching 'Akira' got inspired and once upon a time decided how much he loved to draw and make a story. That story has changed my life; it made me really believe on the fact that some inspirations, tend to grow out on us, live like scars, and will teach us something that will only come from us. A life lesson. A burning 'will of fire'. \\n\\n\r\nIt's really stupendous and beyond overwhelming how one man could create an entire universe of action, of tell-tale hearts, of characters that have devil wings but in the end are shown to have a halo. Hundred thousands of fanfictions are up there on the net, extending what Kishimoto left. I included, but let's not get onto that first. \\n\\n\r\nI want to applaud Kishimoto for a job well done: for changing the lives of many, for telling us a story that will only promise us one thing: a dream is a dream, and with hard work and determination, you will get to it. You will live through a hundred hardships, cry a river, lose some, but it is the Road that you've been through that will only make you pass that goal. 'That' road, that fucked you up, taught you how to stand up on your own and live. Because after watching this anime, it made me realize how I would rather fight this big burden inside of me than be nothing. At all. The burden that tells me I won't get anywhere. Because in the end, the idea that you can't do it only lies on you. But you 'are' your own person, only you can tell your story--only you decide which path you're willing to take and what will you do to make your life worth living. Are you doing this for yourself alone? For your new/family? For the friends you so love? Or for the better good? For the world? \\n\\n\r\n'Women in the Shinobi/ KUNOICHI' \\n\\n\r\n'Women have to be strong in order to survive.' - Tsunade\\n\\n\r\nFact: when Kishimoto was molding Sakura, he had no idea he was turning her into a futile, hopeless lover with nothing better to do than be a crybaby. \\n\\n\r\nLooking at it, it wasn't his fault that Sakura was hated. But it was how the media reacted. How the audience stuck up with Haruno Sakura's story and believed that that was all she could ever be: a woman, someone who bickers but doesn't achieve anything. Though in the end, as Kishimoto turned the tables, Sakura's appreciation for her character or strong existence just will never happen.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something going on in this world: there is endless misogyny and sexism. I'm not surprised if it happens in Japan, as many Asian countries (even in the Western) still perceive women 'less'. I am saying this out of the researchers I've done as a student, and I too am a woman living in an Asian country. And women will never be treated equally. Good job on making Hinata's boobs bigger, anyway. Well, not mad or anything, but looking at the boobies-headphones for sale at Comic Alley made me emphasize on the fact that women in anime are either for (1) marriage, (2) appearance, and (3) simply sex appeal. At least, 'most', \\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, you can see drastic changes here. There is Temari with her giant wielding fan that could make tornadoes and hurricanes on a normal, sunny day. There is Tsunade that doesn't give a damn of someone's ribs and will tear apart anyone she likes--or underestimate her, and/or women. There is the Mizukage blowing fires out of her mouth with a pink lipgloss that will warn you how women shouldn't be infuriated. On very recent movies and episodes, Ino and TenTen are more seen taking up on missions instead of being left behind for men to do the dirty work. I just think, after watching this beautiful life-changing prismatic I-see-the-light show, women deserve to be dirty; to be covered in blood; to save the world; to be a hero; to be there (too).\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because they can. \\n\\n\r\n'How this anime changed my life:'\\n\\n\r\nOne recommendation from my brother, who teased me of having a flat chest (kind of is Sakura huh), made me into the artist that faces the world with altruistic visions. I started to make a fanfiction that later reached a hundred-thousand reads in Wattpad. Then I continued, through this self-discovery have I unlocked that I really have the 'will' and 'guts' to turn to the road of becoming a writer, not Hokage. (Lol). It is with Naruto that I dipped into the pool of anime and watched many, inspired me to keep on collecting stories, be inspired by them, so there will come a time I will take my reign as a story teller too. What kind? Director--screen-writer--playwright--novelist--the world is at the palm of my hand. I know it will happen. And I know, I can surpass Naruto...one day. \\n\\n\r\nI know that it is with these characters we remain attached and affectionate the most. They are the story-tellers, and these are the stories we tell ourselves...that such cycle, as Kakashi-sensei once said, the 'surpassing' thing is, is infinite. \\n\\n\r\nNaruto is the greatest anime for me.\\n\r\nBut I don't believe this is forever. \\n\r\n;)",

            "content": "First off I just wanna say that I am super sad that this show has come to an end.  Naruto was my childhood and with it's ending I feel like a part of me is now gone.  This is the show that got me into anime and I'm grateful for that.  This show is no where near perfect, but is anything really perfect ? \r\nI'll start out with some of the cons of this show. As many other reviews have already stated, Naruto is loaded with filler episodes and this can't be any more true.  At times the fillers can befunny and interesting, but most of the time you are just impatiently waiting for the show to get back to the real story line.  There were tons of flashbacks and honestly they show the same scenes from the past multiple times.  The story can be rushed, and at other times it feels like it's been the same battle for like 5 episodes. The artwork in the battle scenes can vary from good to not so great.  But even with it's many faults, I still gave this show a 10/10. ( honestly if you hate fillers that much, just skip around)\\n\\n\r\nI don't know where to start with all the great things that this anime has to offer.  I'll start off with the characters.  The character development was great for the main characters and even some of the sides characters.  I think that the show did an excellent job in giving each character a unique personality and they really made sure that you knew all the characters and their backgrounds.  The development of the characters was so great that I was constantly questioning who my favorite character really was.  At the beginning I honestly thought that Naruto was annoying and ignorant, but the growth and development of Naruto really grew on me and he began to become one of my favorites. Okay next is the story line.  The plot was pretty interesting, but very long.  While it did seem like the story was at a standstill for a while in the show, the writers did a good job at subtly setting everything up.  Little things that happened in random episodes sometimes came up later as being important.  The plot was like a puzzle at times, where I would try to put the pieces together.  I actually really enjoyed how they set it up like that.  Like Naruto and his friends grew, the story grew as well.  In this sense I mean the vibe and mood of the show.  It starts off more as a fun action comedy, but as the story goes on, it gets more dark, emotional, and the maturity level of the anime just increases.  I'm not kidding when I say that this show can actually teach you life lessons.\\n\\n\r\n I highly recommend watching this whole anime.  Even though it is loaded with fillers, by the time you get to the last few episodes, you'll start to feel emotional and sad that it's come to an end.  While this isn't Your Lie in April or Clannad, this show still will definitely hit the feels.  The end will have you feeling nostalgic, sad, happy, you'll honestly be feeling so many different emotions.  This anime may be 500 episodes, but it is totally worth it and in the end you won't regret it.",

For FIFTEEN years this anime brought me joy and unspeakable emotions. For FIFTEEN years it taught me right from wrong. For FIFTEEN years it \u2026 it\u2019s been a guide of light for me. Jeez, I was raised on this anime, I became older with its characters, I just LOVE IT!!! \r\n  The Naruto series started when I was in a preschool age, and for 15 years it never stopped to surprise me. Thoughthe journey was long (some might say too long) it was always exciting and brilliant. And I am really sorry if I get carried away by emotions, but true Naruto fans will understand \u2013 this is a tale, a unique and flawless tale, of nearly all of my life and now that I look back and see that little Naruto who used to be always alone, without parents, without friends, and I turn my look to who he became through these years \u2013 the Hero, who saved the world, Best Friend that was always there to help and to understand, and now \u2013 a husband\u2026 ah, I might cry. Seriously. Perfect ending. Naruto and Hinata deserve their piece of happiness. And though we did not see this in original manga series, I was really glad to be able to see that kind of and end in anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\n  Now let\u2019s get back to the show and analyze everything peace by peace. \\n\\n\r\n  I\u2019ll start with the story. Indeed the plot, the fantastic world, all the jutsu techniques, all the creatures and characters, everything that we saw in Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden world is a creation of a mastermind \u2013 Kishimoto Masashi, and for that I bow to him to the ground. Just imagine how impossible it was to create such a wide universe with all of its own structure (villages, clans, fractions), its own history (all the clans and villages wars), its own beasts, beings and heroes etc; and how unimaginable was it to make this huge machine work. There is everything I love about the story and about how it is served to the viewer revealing its genius from all sides. It is groundbreaking in every way possible.\\n\\n\r\n  Now let us head to art style. Generally it is satisfying. Well, it is hard to make every episode look like Kimi no Na Wa (you can consider this a recommendation), especially when you have more than 700 episodes (Naruto + Shippuuden). But I can praise creators for really good special effects and the way they\u2019ve made all ninjutsu types look like. And though I must admit that Naruto movies absolutely compensate lack of original shows\u2019 drawing it does not make the original run look worse.\\n\\n\r\n  Unlike art styling \u2013 music really is the VERY strong side of the series. From top to bottom it is impeccable. Every opening, every ending, every song from the series is something breathtaking and mind blowing. I truly enjoy every track and I can sincerely call the Narutos\u2019 OST one of the best of all time in anime industry. The openings like Hero\u2019s Come Back (OP 1), Sign (OP 6), Toumei Datta Sekai (OP 7), Diver (OP 8), Shilhouette (OP 16) will fire you up and make your spirit riot; the endings like Shooting Star (ED 1), U can do it (ED 15), Dame Dame ga (ED 31), Spinning World (ED 32), Zetsu Zetsu (ED 40) will make you believe that you just witnessed a dream that you never want to end. I am not even mentioning stunning Hisou, Kikyou, Sengunbanba, Utsusemi tracks that appear at very exact lyrical moments and touch your soul in its deepest corners. The chorus tracks like Akatsuki and Pains\u2019 theme songs make you feel goosebumps and your hair stand as you stare through the eyes of our heroes at fearless overwhelming enemy hordes. An incredible work by the composer \u2013 Yasuharu Takanashi.\\n\\n\r\n  The characters. Oh, there is so much to say. This is something galaxy lvl. Nearly 100 characters, each with their own temper, beliefs and credo, each of them is trying to make an impact at the world they live in. I will always remember characters like Madara, Itachi, Nagato, because their own vision of the world and the steel will they\u2019ve shown to everyone is something worth of admiration and respect. All the heroes are versatile, unique and incomparable to each other. I am not mentioning the number of skills and techniques each character possesses and how multiform and complex they are. Worth mentioning are beasts like Tailed once. They are that destructive force everyone is trying to lay their hands on, but the author shows that they are something more than that \u2013 they have souls and feelings, and no one can see their good hearts under the scary masks. \\n\\n\r\n  The enjoyment that I personally got from this show is something outstanding. I enjoyed it to the core and absolutely adore it. Maybe that\u2019s because I felt much the same as the main hero and \u2018ve been a witness of many injustice things in this life, and the anime shows it very good. The human\u2019s greed, the way we only think about our own sake, even the way kids treat someone who is not similar to them \u2013 it is a part of the masterpiece that Naruto is.\\n\\n\r\n  Colossal work by Date Hayato and everyone who worked to make this show to be this titanic and go on nonstop for 15 years.  I personally bow to all of you and say: \u201cThank you for the best childhood memories, I will always carry them!\u201d And again I want to congratulate Naruto and Hinata with wedding, and thus my beautiful dream is over, meaning that I grew up and it is time for me to let my childhood go.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me just clarify this now while we\u2019re both still at the very first sentence of this review, and also, at the very first sentence of my very first review ever, but; Naruto Shippuden, and the entire Naruto series in and of itself, is my most favourite anime of all time. Yes, you may think differently, or even otherwise, but I\u2019ll just simply state this now, it is my most favourite anime ever. If you\u2019d care to know why, or you\u2019re simply curious, read on. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI personally think that the story of Naruto/Shippuden is great; it may not be the best, and it maynot be perfect, but then again, when is anything ever like that? Shippuden follows the life of the protagonist, Uzumaki Naruto, as he attempts to retrieve his former teammate, Uchiha Sasuke, who has left the village and everyone around him, in the pursuit of gaining power to get revenge on his older brother, Uchiha Itachi, for the massacre of their entire clan, including their own family. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, back in the simple days of Naruto, it was all about the story of a boy whose dream was, and still is, to become hokage; the greatest ninja in the entire village. This young boy wanted to prove just that; that he was great. He wanted the village to respect him, to prove that he wasn\u2019t just some \u2018demon-fox child\u2019, who was feared of, due to the terrifying nine-tailed fox that was sealed within him. And now, it\u2019s without a doubt, safe to say, that this story has evolved from so much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in the original Naruto series has ultimately lead up to Shippuden, as we, the audience, learn more and more about the characters and the story as a whole. We begin to delve deeper into the core, as more enemies emerge, and more stories and secrets are revealed. Questions that have went on unanswered are finally beginning to obtain an answer, as more questions take their place, and everything slowly, but surely, begins to get tied together. Shippuden, apart from its former series, takes on a much more serious, deep and mature tone, causing us, the audience, to really empathize and act, to either cry in joy or sadness, and I for one can honestly confess, that yes, here and there, this anime has made me cry, multiple times. This anime teaches you; a lot. Shippuden teaches you about the true value and significant importance of family, friends, and life itself. Sure, perhaps, a few other animes have been able to do so, and maybe even to a higher and greater extent, but nothing compares to Naruto. The long amount of episodes only causes the audience to grow with the characters and the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSimple. I\u2019ve seen better. But, Shippuden has really stepped up from its former, in regards to visual aspects and animation, it\u2019s improved greatly. There is much more detail in Shippuden than in it\u2019s former, and the colours are either much more vibrant or the complete opposite, in order to properly convey the scene better. Fight scenes are played out more smoothly, with an adequate use of blood and cuts and scratches and such. Close-ups on the characters\u2019 faces are also quite good, the emotion on their faces seem true, real.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I agree with plenty others, that flashbacks are completely overused. I find myself saying, quite often, \u2018We saw that scene literally an episode ago!\u2019, and honestly, it\u2019s not helping the story so much. I understand the need to replay flashbacks, even of episodes we\u2019ve already seen, and most of the time, I can handle it, but it\u2019s overused, and fails to portray the expected suspense of the current scene. Other than that, art & animation; quite well done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe openings. The endings. The OSTs. Most of which are particularly good! The improvement in the sound is evident, and the animation played out during the openings and endings are well put together, matching the song rather well. Emotion is thoroughly conveyed through the amazing voice actors in this anime, who, excluding the dub actors, perform screams and cries and laughs next to flawlessly. Great!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; also translated to the sum of ones\u2019 personality and being as a whole. The characters in Shippuden are great, excellent even! Each and every one of them have a completely unique personality that differentiates one from the other, and seeing them all come together, as friends or as foes, it\u2019s easy to admit that the character development is superb! There are so many characters, each lovable and excellent in their own unique way, with beautifully well-put together pasts that create the particular character we see now.  We see how the \u2018heroes\u2019 have come about, and how each of them have managed to cope and move on with their lives, to become something else entirely, something better than they ever used to be.  The \u2018villains\u2019, too, have a particular past event, or particular emotions that somewhat humanizes them and redeems them to a strange extent, and we realize that they\u2019re not only \u2018evil\u2019 simply because they are. Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they do, and who they are as a whole and that\u2019s what makes each character amazing in their own way. Sure, some may be bland or dull, weak or annoying, strong or insane, but if each character didn\u2019t even have a single flaw, what would that make them? Human? Surely not. The characters in Shippuden are beautiful and lovable, which in turn, causes us as the audience to feel for them and empathize, and that\u2019s, honestly, great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nShippuden is clearly one of the greatest animes of all time, and perhaps that\u2019s an overstatement, or maybe even an understatement, depending on your own thoughts. But, if given enough thought, Shippuden wouldn\u2019t have become so popular if it wasn\u2019t great or amazing, even to a short extent. Some of you may have seen animes better, or worse, or even of equal value, but towards the end, Naruto/Shippuden is clearly one of its own. I, and anyone else probably, couldn\u2019t agree better that the fillers in this anime are truly horrid and awfully annoying, but, you know what, overlook it. Don\u2019t watch them. Simple. An animes\u2019 worth isn\u2019t valued by its amount of fillers or overused flashbacks or anything, its value comes down to how much a person, themselves, think it\u2019s amazing. So if you haven\u2019t seen Naruto/Shippuden or you dropped it for whatever the reason may be, I encourage you to watch it and give it a shot. 300+ episodes, along with the original 100+ episodes in Naruto, is crazy, sure, but they all add up to one hell of a story and I say, sit, watch, and enjoy the ride.\\n",

            "content": "My opinion: \r\nThe Naruto franchise is one of the most hyped and popular series in the anime world. After 10 years, 500 episodes and a bunch of movies the moneymaker Naruto franchise is finally put to rest.\r\nNaruto was one of my favorite shows as a kid, it was better than anything else on TV and I still remember rushing home from school to catch Naruto on TV, good times. After the original series \u201cNaruto\u201d ended, I was thrilled about the sequel show, \u201cShippuuden\u201d, that was about to start airing but little did I know what a disappointment it was going to be.\r\nStory: 3/10 (Cannon: 6/10& Filler: 1/10)\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden is a continuation of the original therefore the concept of the story remains unchanged but the execution and pacing are a different situation.\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden follows Naruto Uzumaki as he aspires to become Hokage and at the same time tries to bring back his friend, Sasuke, but the story is much more complex than before, now we have Akatsuki hunting down all the Jinchuuriki, Sasuke seeking revenge for his clan , Naruto's struggle against the Kyuubi, Danzo's plot to take over Konoha, the 4th great Ninja War, Madara attempting to end the world and so much more. Yeah, the story gets way more complex but not for the better.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately what was a simple straight-forward and fairly enjoyable plot, soon got covered with pointless subplots that turned the show into a mess, a complete wreck filled with plot armor and plot conveniences. We still have Naruto aspiring to become Hokage while trying to bring back Sasuke but those story-lines get smothered with useless boring subplots and endless filler episodes (not that the main plot was good). That combination ruined my enjoyment of this show. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the next flaw. The pacing of the show is just unbelievably bad, with dragged out scenes that put you to bed, important moments that are rushed and not properly explained, hundreds of filler episodes interrupting important and hyped-up fighting scenes and a lot more is wrong with the pacing/execution. \\n\\n\r\nWhat bothered me the most, as it did many others, were the filler episodes, particularly the ones during the 4th great ninja war that were inserted in the most intense fighting moments. Naruto going full power against his opponent, what an epic scene\u2026why not insert about 20 filler episodes? \\n\\n\r\nThis series has so many twists that you stop caring mid-way. The main antagonist got replaced 3 times because the writers fked up and made them too OP for Naruto to defeat\u2026 so the next logical step is to introduce someone twice as powerful. Referring to Obito who was replaced by the stronger Madara who was replaced by the stronger Kaguya, what a mess...\\n\\n\r\nWhile Naruto Shippuuden is a shonen show that follows the generic path of \u201cget beaten> yell/scream> rise up> win> repeat\u201d and employs cliche themes such as \u201cthe power of friendship conquers all\u201d, despite all of that, I never cringed while watching it and these flaws never stopped me from enjoying the show. \\n\r\nSure, it can get a bit annoying to see Naruto rehabilitate every \u201cevil\u201d guy he meets and turning them into his friends but it ain't that bad.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Naruto Shippuuden does have amazing fight scenes that get you hyped, sad moments that bring tears to your eyes, artistic scenes that inspire the viewer, lighthearted scenes that put a smile on your face... In this area, Naruto did great and exceeded my expectations. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters are generic, cliche and many are one-dimensional or have very little development but that doesn't stop them from being likeable and unique in their own way.\\n\r\nI will talk about the characters I consider important to the series. \\n\r\nCharacters worth remembering are: Jiraiya, Tsunade, Kakashi, Madara.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto is a young ninja who had a harsh childhood during which he faced many difficulties and sad moments. The difficulties he experienced as a child traumatized him and made him the way he is, a cheerful and friendly guy who would do anything to protect those he cares for. Naruto\u2019s dream is to become Hokage but he will not be blinded by that dream and even if it means straying away from it, Naruto will offer his help to whomever is in need, he will put everything on the line to save those he considers friends, no matter the circumstances and that is the quintessence of his personality. \\n\r\nEven though it is not evident, throughout the series Naruto\u2019s character slowly changes and matures after facing and overcoming the obstacles in his path.\\n\\n\r\nSasuke is the \u201clast\u201d of the Uchiha clan after its bloody demise at the hands of his older brother, Itachi. His only goal in life is to avenge the death of his clan and seek revenge on Itachi, not caring about others or the consequences of his actions. Sasuke\u2019s character is stagnant and does not develop until late in the series, he is the \u201crival\u201d that makes Naruto strive to be better and stronger.\\n\\n\r\nItachi was arguably one of the greatest shonen villains until the writers reduced him to a generic, plain good guy. \\n\r\nItachi is the \"prodigy\" child of the Uchiha clan, a skilled shinobi and a good brother until one dark night when he murders every member in the clan except for his younger brother. His character was intriguing and a great addition to the series but ended in miserable failure as the writers decided to rehabilitate him after his death. \\n\\n\r\nObito, another victim of the \u201cpower of friendship\u201d theme. He has lost everything, his dream of becoming Hokage is gone, his loved one is dead, his friend betrayed him, his body is ruined therefore he decides it is best to destroy the world and yet he is easily turned into a good guy by our great hero, Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nKurama/Nine-Tails is one of the nine tailed beasts. Centuries of being regarded as a mindless monster and sought after as a tool for war caused Kurama to hate humans. After being sealed into Naruto Uzumaki, Kurama attempts to maintain its negative opinions about the world, but with Naruto's insistence on treating it with respect, the fox overturns its hatred and willingly strives to use its power for the world's salvation.\\n\r\nKurama's development is quite inspiring and a model we should all follow, with the racism, sexism, homophobism, etc. that is happening in the contemporan society.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation was originally good, fluent with nice colors but it went downhill and resulted in the overall animation&art being bad.\\n\r\nIn order to save money, the studio decided to use lots and lots of flashbacks, entire minutes of already aired scenes from previous episodes, still facial expressions, pointless starring, etc. \\n\r\nAlthough the show started airing in 2007 and ended 10 years later, not many good changes had been made to the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nMost of the opening themes and ending themes are decent and the OST is fairly good. The voice actors did a good job interpreting the characters but not an outstanding end result. I couldn\u2019t find a song I loved but nor could I find a song I hated so I guess the sound department is fine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI highly enjoyed the canon episodes even some of the filler episodes but the overwhelming number of shit filler episodes and flashbacks ruined my enjoyment of this series. Not much to say about it\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 \\n\r\nMy bias won't let me rate this below 5...\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden had its good moments that made it shine but it was quickly clouded by the huge amount of filler episodes, flashbacks, inapt characters, subplots, etc. \\n\r\nI will certainly remember Naruto for the rest of my life, it is a show I grew up with and it holds a special place in my heart.\\n\r\nAs advice to the people who have't watched it yet: skip some of the fillers, a great experience awaits you!\\n",

            "content": "Shippuuden was a step-up from the original series in some ways, but it's worse at other points, making it just so-so.\r\nThe story has become increasingly complex compared to the original series. You still have the whole deal with Naruto wanting to become Hokage, but that is very overshadowed by many new plots. You have Akatsuki who's after all the Jinchuuriki, there's Sasuke and his quest for revenge, Naruto's struggle against the Kyuubi, Team 7's quest to get back Sasuke and Danzo's plot to take over Konoha. Yeah, there's a lot going on, and I enjoy that a lot - a plot-rich story is always funto watch\\n\\n\r\nBut - and this is a big but - there's severe pacing problems. And by severe I mean excessively dragged out nonsense which could've been done in half the time... at least. The first arc took 30 episodes. It could've been finished in much less time, but they absolutely have to drag it out with endless nonsense fights. The Sasuke and Sai arc was fairly okay, though, but still a little slow on the pacing.\\n\\n\r\n&quot;But if they quicken the pace it, we'll get more fillers. Oh noes!&quot; Yeah, some people think that. However, I'd rather have them quicken the pace and have more filler than getting my viewing experience ruined by a sluggish pace. Fillers can be good, you know.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Shippuuden is better. The new character deigns are great, and I find that the coloring is less dull than it was in the original series. It's becoming more flawless too, but it still struggles with small flaws here and there. However, it's still Naruto, and its animation has always been simple in my eyes. There are no big details to brag about, but sometimes simple works; it's mainly a matter of getting used to (and most people watching Shippuuden should've already watched the original series, which means that you've most likely gotten used to it).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack so far in Shippuuden is fairly decent. I still haven't heard any remarkable themes, but none of them has been outright bad either, so I'm fine with it, but I wish they threw in some good themes. They do, however, fit right into the current events, which is a small plus. There's not much to say about the OPs an EDs so far; they've been very average. \\n\\n\r\nAs of episode 58, there have been low amounts of character development, and for 58 episodes that&rsquo;s not really good. The reunion of the new Team 7 and Sasuke is pretty much the only traces of any character development so far, aside maybe Sai's interactions with the rest of the group, which is always funny to watch, and it's interesting to see if he'll ever learn how to properly interact with the others. The introduction of him and his actions is pretty much all that keeps my character rating on 7, because we've hardly seen any of the other characters, and the small amounts we've seen of them is nothing special, really; it's like most of them have just faded away. I'm still hoping that some good character development and all that will come though, seeing how Naruto will probably have to struggle with the Kyuubi inside of him, and not to mention getting Sasuke back; I'm hoping that it will provide us with some neat character development.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, I'm very &quot;meh&quot; about Shippuuden, but if it rids itself of the pacing problems I'm going to enjoy this much more than I'm currently doing now.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Well, it has improved as of late (Dec '08), so I am upping the character and enjoyment ratings to 8  \\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuuden! The series that would never end finally ends! After ten years, five-hundred episodes and several movie tie-ins, this milked cow is finally laid down to rest, resulting in one of the worst shounen anime adaptations ever made. While I did enjoy myself with the series and certainly found myself even liking it for the first two-hundred episodes or so, the insane amount of filler, padding, and the abysmal final three or four arcs made me despise this show by the end, and all of the characters and narrative. The filler in this anime is such a goddamn problem that it destroys the entireanime, and at this point, if you did want to get into Naruto, I would recommend reading the manga, or skipping over the filler because, for the most part, the filler is absolutely abysmal and is rarely interesting or adds onto the overall world of the series. Since this review is going to spend a long time detailing all of my problems with the story, I will address the animation and music now. While I still prefer the original soundtrack of Naruto, Shippuuden is still great. The action pumps you up and there is a great variety in songs and moods to fit each moment and scene. The animation is a different story, however. The anime is very inconsistent, and that is to be expected with a show with over five-hundred episode; at its best, it could be movie quality, it\u2019s worst, trashy nineties OVA.\\n\\n\r\nShippuuden is the direct continuation of the original series, set two years after the events that transpired in the original in which Naruto has trained to hone his skills and jutsu. Upon returning to the village, he fights off against the Akatsuki, a group of powerful, rogue ninja who wants to collect all of the tailed beasts to create the ten tails and rule the world, while trying to save his gay lover, I mean best friend, Sasuke. Now, I want to clarify first of all that I enjoyed the first season very much (excluding the fillers, that is). It was fun, the battles were original and creative, and the characters went through great development; it captured the hard life of a ninja perfectly and the cruel world in which they live in. Shippuuden was also pretty good for a little while in the beginning of the series, albeit not as interesting or engaging as the previous story arcs of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne good thing about the sequel is that Shippuuden is a lot darker and more mature than the original series, now with the Akatsuki clan running amok and killing many of the tailed beasts. There is this constant sense of looming danger and tension in the series and the Akatsuki were easily the best thing about part two. All of them are interesting, had unique abilities, and for the most part, are allowed to shine in their own respective battles. Hell, there are even a few character deaths which took me by surprise, which added onto the steaks and tension of the show. The first one hundred episodes of content (minus the fillers) are pretty great although I did have some problems, most notably being Naruto and Sasuke themselves.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto in part two is annoying, whiny and irritating, and his constant journey to save Sasuke feels boring and without much sense logically, since Saskue becomes a complete dick head, hell bent on destroying the entire village. Sasuke starts off wanting to kill his brother, and after the worst plot twist in the series where we learn his evil brother was, in fact, a good guy, which I\u2019ve always hated, all he wants after that is to destroy the village and everyone in it, and his character fluctuates so much throughout part two that it becomes hard to keep track of. Both of their respective story arcs hit brick walls by the end of the Pain arc and hardly develop at all past that, just in their power levels. Speaking of the Pain arc, the conclusion to that very same story arc was so bad that I lost all hope in the series. After a great fight in which much of the main cast die, Naruto has a friendship speech with the villain in which after, he brings back all of the people in the village who died! This removed all of the tension from the series and was such a cheap way to bring back characters that I began to hate the series from that point onwards. Combine that with characters who did receive some screen time in part one, now being pushed to the sideline with no development, aside from Shikamaru, but even after his own arc, he is pushed to the side to make way for the yellow-haired twit. In addition, Naruto\u2019s character is ruined after we learn he is the child of destiny and was destined to save the world since he was born. This meant all of his hard work was for nothing and is such a giant middle finger from the author, that after this point, I hated the series. From this point on, we know that Naruto can never die nor lose since he is destined to save the world. His fate is pre-determined from the start, which does remove some tension from the later arcs.\\n\\n\r\nIt also destroys Naruto's main theme at the same time. Naruto's driving force was that hard work and endurance would pay off in the end, and earn you  respect from the people around you, even when the whole world is putting you down. In the early parts of the series there was a genuine sense of satisfaction in watching Naruto grow as a person and the catharsis pay off that entailed was great after all his hard work. Learning that he is a destined child, and was destined with all these great powers from the beginning ruins all of the hard work and endurance he had to go through to gain respect as a shinobi. Essentially, the author shot himself in the foot and omitted one of the driving forces of his story. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let me elaborate a little more on the Itachi plot twist before I go ahead and why I didn't like this twist in the story. To me, Itachi was a great villain, someone who killed his entire village just to test his limits, leaving his younger brother alive to act out revenge on the part of his fallen clan. Like Saskue, we hated Itachi at the beginning, which we should of, since this makes a great villain. Itachi is strong, ruthless, and cunning. All of this, in my eyes, anyway, made him great as a villain, but Kishimoto, works in a twist that reveals he was a good guy all along and killed his clan to prevent a war from occurring. Essentially he had to carry a huge burden on his back from the village elders, which is admirable, but it also causes Saskue's character to go out of control from this point, and fluctuate so frequently. I always found this twist to be kind of \"meh\", for a lack of a better term. I never hated it per say, to the point where it broke the series or anything, it's just that I think Itachi was much better as a villain than a good guy. But hey, this mini-rant is just down to my own personal preference. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst character out of them all is Sakura. Now, I don't think she is useless in this series. Hell, she has a pretty okay fight against one of the Akatsuki members and wins, which is something I can appreciate, it's just that her character goes nowhere. She stays so stagnant and boring, whilst crying about Saskue. And holy hell does her love for Sasuke feel forced as hell. It makes no sense why she loves him to this extent, especially after the bastard almost killed her and threatened to destroy the entire village, killing everyone she loved and had known. Back in the original I could kind of excuse her crush on account that she was a young child, but now it's laughably pathetic and doesn't even make any sense. This applies for most of the female cast in the series since Kishimotot can't write good female characters. They're either completely useless or completely superficial. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this brings us to ninja war arc and everything that came after. These final arcs were awful. All of the clever tactics and strategies the characters had are now gone, in favour of who could pull off the most landscape reducing jutsu, and Naruto and Sasuke become so powerful, to the point they rival gods, even going as far as having them both die and then re-birth as an act of destiny. What I always hated was that all of the characters that died before; characters that I liked and had well-completed arcs were brought back to life since the author was too lazy to create new ones. This ruined many of the original arcs these characters went through, and I found this, for the most part, to be completely boring since they just repeat what happened previously. Sure, there is some development and growth with the characters, but it's hardly substantial enough to raise the bar. All of the previous rules and ideas that Kishimoto establishes in the early part of the series are thrown out and it's painfully obvious that he didn't even care about his own series in the end since the justsus and abilities some of the characters can perform goes against the rules of the world that he established. A good example is when Kakashi gets two Sharingan which would require a large amount of chakra to use. We've been told time and time again that this character, while having a wide range of impressive jutsu, doesn't have much in the way of chakra and thus can't battle for too long but in the final arcs he performs so many Jutsu it is unbelievable and when he does require the double Sharingan it makes no sense how he can utilise its power, especially since he obtains it at the end of the war and thus his chakra would have been completely gone! Another example of crap writing is after Naruto is reborn, he somehow saves Gai from dying just by simply touching his chest! It makes no sense why he can suddenly do this and this element is never explained to us at all. Not only that, but a few moments later he restores Kakashi's eye in the same fashion, but fails to restore Gai's dead legs, for whatever reason. What an asshole!\\n\\n\r\nThese final arcs are so full of ass-pulls, random power-ups and last for so long that I can\u2019t stand the idea of watching them again. The final fight between Naruto and Sasuke was pretty impressive and I\u2019m glad it wasn't stuffed with filler but it\u2019s not enough to save the whole series. The \u201cfinal\u201d villain Madara was the only thing I liked about the final arc but even then, he was replaced by the true final villain who was terrible, since the author had no idea how to end the series nor of how to get rid of such a powerful enemy.  Kaguya was such a terrible final villain, only being relevant for about ten episodes or so. The biggest problem is that she came out of nowhere. There was no build-up like Madara. Madara felt justified to be the final villain because of the build-up and the pay off with him was pretty good, but Kaguya was boring, dull and had no narrative steaks or intrigue behind her character at all. She was truly the worst final villain I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about every little thing, but I\u2019ve covered everything that pisses me off the most so I\u2019ll leave it at that. I do enjoy Naruto, despite the obvious flaws, but if you want to get into the series, just read the manga.\\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: Believe it! Took 10 years and 500 episodes but it finally ended. Guess that cow finally ran out of milk! \r\n[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 6/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 7/10]\r\nBelieve it! The series who was never meant to end has finally been laid to rest\u2026 or has it? It may have taken 10 years and 500 episodes (280 Cannon and 220 Fillers, believe it, I counted), thank you Studio Pierrot for finally stop milking this cow. Let's be real, all the real fans got so tired of your shenanigans they finished the manga long time ago. So why would you invest in thissuper long show?  \\n\\n\r\nRage aside, what's Naruto: Shippuden really about? It's a story about an unwanted ninja shinobi boy who had the dream of becoming Hokage and believe it he will overcome all the adversaries (including fillers) to achieve it! (But if we are being honest, it's really about Naruto's journey of finding his angry dark lover, Sasuke, to bring back home and he will ignore all his other friends to achieve it)! Jokes or Fillers aside, the main plot has two major arcs, the Akatsiki tailed beast arc and the Fourth Great Shinobi World War arc. This is your traditional archetypical heroic journey style shounen anime filled with every trope known to mankind. So if you believe it, they will employ it! The overarching theme is Friendship & Love conquers hatred & evil. How boring yet sweet & addictive. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are wondering how can such a boring storyline keep the audience captivated for 500 episodes? The unique characters can be a possibility. This show has exactly 212 unique characters (villagers and background people excluded) and believe it do they stand out in one way or another! The major protagonists are Naruto and his Nakamas (which is friends for those weebs who don't know) Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi. On the other hand, the list of antagonists just goes on and each successive one is more ridiculous with godlike powers & jutsus than the previous. Seriously, how Naruto overcomes them and befriends them will leave viewers breathless. Shoutout to Ittachi, for being one hell of a memorable antagonist the anime industry will never forget and should not forget, believe it! \\n\\n\r\nIf the story and characters don't do this show justice, (it desn't) it's definitely the animation and sound accompanying it. Narutoverse completely changed the landscape of fighting style with its unique farcical jutsus that were hand-drawn and animated adequately well. It's impressive that most of the characters were very distinct from one another given this show having 212 unique characters. Fillers aside, the Cannon episodes were actually drawn well and the standard was reasonably maintained throughout, believe it! Moreover, given that this show is 500 episodes, it actually features around 60 unique OP/ED songs. It's a definitely a first for a show that took a decade to finish. The OP/ED songs are well received among fans and non fans of this anime. Furthermore, the background OST is composed beautifully well and it accompanies the fight sequence rather too well. This show really knows how to create HYPE and hit you in the feels so hard it will make even Chuck Norris shed a tear. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't really see myself rewatching this show but I would recommend people to atleast give this show a shot. Why? Because I'm evil, no, because why not? If you are serious about it and only want to watch cannon episodes then definitely give it a shot. It's an interesting bingable show (over few weeks) and if you get tired, then just finish the manga. This show is nowhere near perfect and it has too many flaws that is just not worth ranting about it. If you ask fans of this show, they will say 10/10 but realistically looking at cannon episodes it's 7/10. Therefore, maybe you should really watch Naruto: Shippuden. Believe it!\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Below is the outline for all the cannon episode. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n1-27,\u00a029-56,\u00a072-89,\u00a0113-126,\u00a0129-143,\u00a0152-169,\u00a0172-175,\u00a0179,\u00a0197-211,\u00a0214-222,\u00a0243-256,\u00a0261-270,\u00a0272-278,\u00a0282-283,\u00a0296-302,\u00a0321-346,\u00a0362-375,\u00a0378-387,\u00a0391-393,\u00a0414-415,\u00a0418,\u00a0420-421,\u00a0424-426,\u00a0458-459,\u00a0463,\u00a0469-479,\u00a0484-500\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found reading this short but supaishi review helpful.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Why people are rating this series so low, I don't know\r\nIt's truly the end. Naruto was always something that I considered bad due to the  fillers, however once I got into it I was hooked.\r\nStory:\r\nAh, the story. It's just filled with so much emotion and it was amazingly executed up until the Pain Arc, yes it went down, and we all know the War was dragged on for far too long but surely that doesn't ruin the moral of the story? Naruto always had one goal, and we always knew that he would meet stronger opponents, some that could challenge his goal, and Obitoand Madara were those two. The later of the War Arc is amazingly written in my opinion, the Obito regret, Madara's reasoning and much more. Overall, the story remained the same and always had one goal, and didn't go off that path. Naruto wanted to become strong, he wanted to be acknowledged and lastly he wanted to the Hokage. All which he achieved.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Naruto's Art hasn't impressed me much, however animation in canon episodes were spectacular, especially in the final battle. Not much can be said.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNaruto's OST is the best I have heard in any anime. Sadness and Sorrow, My Name, Gehika, and many more. They hype you up, just like any OST is supposed to be doing in a Shounen. Naruto's OP''s were great too, I can listen to them all day anytime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNaruto has lots of great characters. Although the bad thing is that in the war the spotlight is mainly on Naruto and Sasuke. This doesn't take anything from the other characters though. Characters such as Obito, Nagato, Itachi and Madara are so amazingly written. Never in an anime have I cheered for a villain. Nagato and Naruto's conversation really hits and it also makes you think about  today's society. People kill and kill but they know this leads to more hatred and revenge, something that will eventually bring the world down, just like it did in Naruto. Naruto and the rest of Konoha are great characters, all are special and are all someone you can get invested into, of course there's the \"muh sakura is useless\", but it's still great to see all characters nevertheless. Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry is unrivaled in my opinion. I have yet to see a Shounen that has a better rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWow, Enjoying Naruto is something very hard for some people, muh fillers, muh the anime show drags on for too long. Naruto can be enjoyed, if you take your mind off other people's. You have to go into it expecting something, if you go into it like many people you will be disappointed. We all know Naruto isn't the best shounen but still, when it gets good, it can be one of the best. I've really enjoyed Naruto as a character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Naruto Shippuden alot. The first few arc were dragging for too long, but I still managed.  Once it got good, I really got hooked. Naruto as a whole is a story which has a really amazing world. People saying, \"wow it's another Dragon Ball Z at the end\" should know that in the first Chapter it was made loud and clear that one single demon Fox wiped out a whole Village. We all knew what Naruto's character was going to become. Naruto is something that will get alot of flack but in many years time, we'll look back and happy we experienced such a great show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I can't actually some people prepared reviews and \"pretend\" they've seen the whole series and are giving low numbers. Wow.",

            "content": "First off, I would like to let you know that this is my first ever review and I'm glad it's going to be for Naruto.\r\nNaruto was an anime which would leave first time viewers with a bad taste in their mouth, it was like this immature anime with not much of a story to it and it's main character was just this silly, clumsy immature kid who is determined to become the Hokage of his village some day. It made viewers go through a painful number of fillers to get to a serious part which made many fans disappointed at the end of the firstseries.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden. This was basically like a present for those true fans who sticked through the endless fillers to finally get serious about the show. It shows how deep and how matured the show was meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nI know this may sound biased, and many would feel 10 is too much for a show like this but bear with me. The MC, Naruto Uzumaki who seemed like this not so tough, silly, immature kid and all he thought about was being the Hokage but the story actually revolves around him in so many other ways. It finally isn't just all him anymore, the different characters who took part in the first series become more important. The suspense of revealing the truth behind more truth is intense, it makes you want to keep going on. There was even a touch of love in the series and it was felt throughout the series. It's a story which will make you get into each of the characters but expecially Naruto as it doesn't miss out a single day of his life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nI didn't want to give art 9 as well as I've recently sceen better art in several other animes but what made me stick to 9 was the fight scenes, the minute details of a single move, the background reacting to every other things and also the characters started to look more like how modern animes had their characters drawn with a clearn touch, and so my score.\\n\r\nI think sound enters this catagory and so, let me explain. Naruto Shippuden has wonderful soundtracks which fits in perfectly for each situations in the anime. You would get that feeling of getting deep into the series with the help of the soundtracks as well. And so I give art, with both great sound and great animation a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nI've mentioned before about Naruto just wanting to be Hokage someday but the character development of this single person was too good, his reasons become more clear as he grows. This anime is named Naruto as it follows him through everyday with every other main characters in different episodes. You get to see him grow up to be a very mature young man with huge responsibilities. But why this anime stands out is that, it doesn't completely miss out on the rest of the characters. Each characters have their out arc and it's explained well and the whole story with it's well times flashbacks makes it as though, the detailed bits and pieces are filling out a huge puzzle, the puzzled world of the Shinoby.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nI had to think twice here about whether to give 9 or 10 and be honest to myself. Though I love this anime so much, I actually skipped all of the fillers, just seeing the start and the end. But that's the only downside for this to miss out a 10. The reason why I did that because I couldn't wait any longer to get back into the series, the story as it was how much I enjoyed watching it.\\n\r\nIt has his humorous moments which would make you laugh for quite sometime but there can be annoying parts where Naruto just stays silly like always but you still end up laughing at it. But as much as it has it's funny parts, it has it's intense parts, love, loyalty, despair and even hate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nOverall, this is one anime which stands out for itself, though it has it's endless fillers to catch up with the manga, it's something you shouldn't miss out. It's one of those very matured, well developed, well characterized anime which keeps you on your feet while you grow up with the series. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the majority of the people who hesitate to try this show from what I've seen was because of the huge number of not so fun fillers. I would recommend skipping out on fillers as they hardly include stories related to the main story.",

            "content": "This Anime is one I have taken to heart more over then any other. Before I begin this review I want to leave a couple side notes. This review may not be entirely accurate on account of my own feelings towards the series. I will grade it the same way I did my Bleach review. If their is anyone unsatisfied with my review, then please massage me with ways of improving the presentation. With all that in mind I hope you bare with me and enjoy what I have to say.\r\n   I'll begin with my view on the story line.I had watched the original Naruto series to ensure I wasn't missing any information in shippuden. The series starts back up where it left off. Naruto had left to train with Jiraiya and become strong enough to save his friend. I figured I was going to find shippuden as bland and unsatisfying as I did the original series, but I couldn't have been further from the truth. The story is quite long, considering the show is on it's 320th episode, and similar to it's counterparts ( Bleach, DBZ and OP ) is riddled with fillers. What makes these fillers less of a nuisance is the fact that each one focuses towards Elaborating on the original story, instead of opening entirely new ones. Since the show is generally straight forward it often has many of those \"Yeah, I get it\" moments where you want to skip dialog that simply states what we already know. Small issues like this can become tiresome and seem to be the biggest issue. It seems that each episode is laid out in a manner that anyone can drop in and have some understanding as to whats happened, happening or going to happen. As for the story itself, well there's a reason this show is one of the most popular. The story isn't your basic young hero kills bad guy story like everything else these days. The young hero is confronted with an enemy that can't be defeated with a spirit bomb or a Bankai. Something beyond all other bad guys seeing as how this enemy exists in reality and is still the cause of a majority of strife in the world. He fights for the sake of his goal not just to become hokage, but to free the war ridden shinobi nations from the very claws of hatred itself. Which includes fighting with his own hatred and overcoming it for the sake of all those he holds dear and the one he seeks to save from their self inflicted fate.\\n\\n\r\n   I suppose I should move on to art now. The art style is very fluent in most scenes and other then some minor issues, mostly flawless. In truth the animations only issue would be the repetition. Some fights will replay Physics animations of trees or rocks being torn or pushed or pulled, then replay it in reverse representing the other side of the explosion or whatever is causing things to go flying. Though the biggest nuisance is the over abundance of flashbacks. Again, this acts on those \"Yeah, I get it\" points and can often kill an otherwise amazing moment in the story. The tree jumping phases can get annoying as well, but are usually used to provide Dialog or representation of travel from plot to plot. The world Shippuden takes place in is beautiful in all rights, with differant climates and cultures that seem to despise each other due to their unstable history of blood shed and chaos. The fight scenes that inevitably arise from this tension gives way to some of the most unbelievably well done animations you could ask for in a fight. Sometimes, I could find the show simply breathtaking, other times people would have to revive me do to my lack of breath ^_^\\n\\n\r\n   Next would be sound it seems. I'm a subbed anime kind of guy so that's what I'll be basing the rating on. The voices were excellent and suited each character like a glove. The soundtrack to the Shippuden series is amazing as well. I enjoyed it so much that I put them on my PSP and Phone. My personal favorite being Hyakkaryouran. This theme was exceptional at building up the pressure right before some of the most badass fights I've seen in all the anime I've watched. Though their are so many others that had the same effect, I found my self attached to that one song more then the rest.\\n\\n\r\n   Lastly would be the characters. Naruto being the main character starts out as a slightly less obnoxious version of who he was in the original series. The few years of training have calmed him very little, and though he is significantly stronger then he was as a child, He still isn't quite as strong as he needs to be. What made Naruto stand out for me was the fact that he wasn't very strong in the beginning and was quite frankly a horrible ninja, and yet was necessary. You see, though his life was just as hard if not harder then his rival Sasuke, He chooses to move past his pain and hatred to make his future and the future of his friends worth living and dying for. To obtain the secrets to peace, though he doesn't acknowledge that as his goal in the beginning, he soon accepts his destiny with open arms and intends to shoulder all the burden so his loved ones can live happily without the pain of hatred or regret. Then theirs his Rival Sasuke, who instead of attempting to better his life, chooses to hunt down those responsible for his pain and make them pay. His power is clearly greater then Naruto's in the beginning, but his goals are clouded in the very darkness and hatred that Naruto seeks to protect him from. I personally hate him, but that's just one of the connections I have to the series. With the two main characters out of the way I can involve Sakura, who's significantly less useless then she was in the original Naruto series. Kakashi, who's just as calm and collective as ever and still one of the funniest characters in the anime. Though with so many new characters such as Killer Bee and Omoi, he might not bear that title much longer.\\n\\n\r\n   Overall this anime is my favorite for many reasons. With a story and characters that I can easily connect with. Action and adventure with small traces of romance and drama thrown in. plenty of laughs and tears ( Both of Joy and Sorrow ). A story that lasts more then just one or two seasons and continues to impress. But most importantly the ability to keep me enthralled in even the most unimpressive episodes. I find that this show causes so many different anime's to go unnoticed and that makes me happy for some reason. Could be reassurance that I'm not the only one who holds the show in high esteem. Or maybe it's just my way of drawing some enjoyment out of all the haters getting riled up over their shows simply because this show's got them beat. With or without my personal opinion, I will always recommend this anime to action adventure fans... Unless they screw up the ending like they did bleach... Who know's, I might have to redo this review later.",

            "content": "Love gives birth to sacrifice.\r\nIt's one of the trinity of most popular animes, which includes Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. All far into the hundreds and hundreds of episodes. I finished the first Naruto series, and I'm close to catching up in Naruto: Shippuuden. So, Let's just jump right into my review, may turn out to be a long one.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nI loved this story, at first. The reason it didn't get a 10/10 is the fact that it's not necessarily an original story, the concept of a ninja based anime is not at all an original concept anymore. Also, there's been reoccurring issues with theplot as of lately with the manga ending and the anime still in a filler arc. But basically, the story follows along Naruto's life as a shinobi, but to take it a step further, there's added a ton of drama between characters, love interests, and how it's done throughout the series makes it such a great anime. It's an anime that I couldn't stop watching for long periods. However. The one very LARGE issue I had with Naruto as an entire franchise, and I think that all the Naruto watchers agree with, is the darn FILLER. If Naruto had little to no filler, I'd be a very happy camper.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's pretty good, the graphics of it have improved a lot between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden. They've changed for the better and I love it even more now.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved most of the intros to Naruto, but not so much in Naruto: Shippuuden. I loved the background music that was in the fight scenes or just random scenes all together. It was great to finally see an anime that understood how to choose music for specific scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime brought out some of the best examples of characters I've seen in awhile. \\n\r\nNaruto: Immature, hard headed,  strong willed, cocky, I could go on. He is a great character, he went through so much crap when he was younger, that I sympathize with him. However, I still get tired of his immaturity. His parents were killed while trying to save him, and he was sealed with the nine tails beast. The people in the village didn't take the time to understand Naruto, and they didn't see how hard it must have been for Naruto to live with that thing, or live without any friends or family. He lived by himself! It makes me mad how ignorant people were back when Naruto was a child. Naruto had to save their village from being destroyed before they really acknowledged him.\\n\r\nSasuke: I know a lot of characters also misjudge Sasuke as well for being too cruel. However, he is a very strong individual who has his mind in place, and is very determined to finish whatever he has started. He feels like a very misjudged character, but he's just a very hard person to read;  you never really know if you picked up on the right notion or if  you were completely off base.\\n\r\nSakura: She's a very strong willed individual. She knows what she likes and she will not stop till she gets them. She's a very determined young lady and she is very powerful.\\n\r\nKakashi: He was Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura's mentor and really liked to pick fun at Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. He's a very mysterious character, but in this series we got a very lengthy but interest flashback to when Kakashi was younger and in his own team. It was very informative and very traumatic to see how sad and heartbroken his past was.\\n\r\nPain: He is my favorite character out of everyone. And by Pain I mean, Nagato, and the 6 Pains. Hence the first quote on this review. It was a Pain quote said to Naruto, in the fight at the leaf village. Nagato was part of the Akatsuki. I love that group, I wish they would base a new anime on just them, and how they came about more in depth, because they explained, Nagato and Konan, and their story but they didn't really explain the rest of them, nearly as much. Anyway, Pain is just my favorite character, I can't express it in words, just his actions, his speaking, and his quotes, all just come together so perfectly.\\n\r\nThere are so many more neat characters I could have mentioned but I feel like the review would go on forever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of this anime was an 7. I loved the plot of the story, and the different battles, but the overall enjoyment was brought down by the whole filler aspect of the show. I realize it's a small portion of the anime, but for me I just want to stick with the main plot of the story and not drift aside. I know I can't change it, and I know that's not the only problem with the anime..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nMy overall has been updated to a 7 out of 10 because of the characters in this story. They were all awesome, and well played out. The characters in this story really saved the over all rating, because if it was just based on the story and the plot I don't know if it would be that high. Now I'm not saying that the filler was the ONLY big problem in Naruto, not by a long shot. There's issues I have with some of the plot holes that seemed to have formed as of lately (seeing as though the manga finished and yet they're still showing filler that's unnecessary). I'm becoming more and more lost as the series goes on. And now it's just become a nuisance to have to keep up with it.. \\n\\n\r\n*I love criticism! Please feel free to write on my profile the pros and cons of my review, I know some of these sections were short, but that's because the characters were the only thing that I really liked about this anime. But anyway please feel free to write on my profile, I want feedback!",

            "content": "At the time of this writing, Naruto is all but over. In fact, it might as well have been over way back when the fillers started in the first season.\r\nWhat started out as a great anime with a deep story and tons of charming characters has inexplicably turned its back on most of what was good about it, first and foremost the relationship between naruto, sasuke and sakura. And there are still filler arcs in Shippuuden, one of which has just begun.\r\nWe are now at episode 95 of the second season and sasuke is still basically nowhere to be seen. The first arc showed bitsand pieces of him, and he was on screen for 5 minutes at the end of it. Since then, he's appeared sporadically in flashbacks and extremely short vignettes as a way to tease the audience into thinking he will return soon and naruto will get back on track...but then another arc starts without him. And another. To top it all off, another worthless filler arc has just begun!\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean to say that sasuke makes the entire series. Akatsuki is an interesting group of characters, and the majority of those great characters from the first season are still present and basically unchanged. However, Sasuke is a huge part of naruto, and he's gone. Gaara is one of the coolest characters ever, and he's gone. And another filler arc has just begun.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has also taken a huge hit with this series. I don't know if they changed production companies or what, but everyone suddenly looks disproportioned and the animation looks choppy and cheap. Sakura has a tendency to look quite mannish when viewed in profile. There is an infamous part of the new ending where Hinata's hair seems to be falling off. The art seems to get even worse during fillers...i don't know if i've mentioned this yet, but a filler arc has just begun!\\n\\n\r\nNaruto is also no longer funny.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I could sit here and write all day about how much naruto has jumped the shark, but there is one thing that should be said: I still watch it. I'm not sure exactly why, but I never miss an episode. If I had to pay even a cent for it, I wouldn't; but I still watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I might stop watching until this filler arc is over. The problem with fillers is not that they are worthless (i'd rather have fillers than nothing) but that they are so often boring and cheaply done, and often stray too far from the roots of the show. There are ways to get fillers right (see Bleach: Turn Back the Pendulum), but Naruto's fillers fail. Miserably.\\n\\n\r\nAnother %*#@%&! filler, and still no sasuke. Can you believe it?",

            "content": "I cannot believe this poor excuse of a directing team gets a near 8 overall, and MANY 9's/10's for their work. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that a \"6\" constitutes \"Fair\". Meaning, this anime is better than \"Mediocre\", better than \"Decent\".\r\n(the mean of the subcategory values doesn't equal 6 because MAL lacks a \"flow\" category)\r\nNaruto Shippuuden is probably the most famous anime to the general American populous. You might consider that one guy the whitest guy on the planet, yet he's probably watched some form of anime: Naruto. In fact, Naruto is so widespread that you could actually have friends that canrelate to you about an anime for once. It is just that popular. However, that exact popularity could lead it to being \"overrated\", and that is exactly what I believe it to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, to be honest, is amazing. I like ninjas. I like people fighting. I like people dying. However, Naruto Shippuuden took a turn for the worst. One of the biggest changes in the show (from Part 1 to Part 2) was the feeling of \"ninja battles\" vs \"demon battles\". In the first part of Naruto, the highest-caliber battle was between the three Hokages and Orochimaru. Their jutsus were so badass, nobody of a lower level could contest with them. However, that level of power is absolutely LAUGHABLE in today's Naruto world. Sasuke's Susano'o will just eat the living crap out of the Hokages. Nagato will use some overpowered six-path rinnegan jutsu that he pulls out of his ass. Oh, but of course Naruto can defeat him. And that's yet another problem with the story. Naruto is apparently able to do everything, and WE ALL KNOW the Fourth Great Ninja War is going to end with Naruto reigning victorious over the antagonists. We already know that. So, with the lack of suspense, why do people still watch this anime? The only reason I can think of is its development of drama.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, this anime capitalizes on \"Talk no Jutsu\" (as coined by Sawyer7mage), where the characters are apparently in a national speech and debate competition over the gold medal or something. Seriously. There is so much talking in this anime that the fighting gets devalued to nothing. And when there is fighting? YOU HIT A WALL OF 20 FILLER EPISODES. IN A DAMN ROW. And that is what I mean by poor directing. A somewhat great storyline with promising battle scenes is RUINED, absolutely RUINED by the existence of filler episodes. Literally 90% of them are completely off-plot and not funny at all; \"oh, they're just saving the 43rd Snow-land Daimyo/Princess/cat/dog/frog\". It is ridiculous how good the producers are at pissing off the fanbase, including myself. Nothing is more irritating than waiting excitedly for the next episode, only to realize that it is a filler. And when you hit a filler, you know you'll be there for a while. Good luck man, it'll only take half a year to get back onto the main plot (or almost half a year; most filler runs are 20 episodes long). By the time they get back onto the main story, you already forgot half the story leading up to that moment, forcing you to rewatch some of the previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Naruto is a great story and will captivate its audiences for certain; however, Shippuuden's great shift from Naruto Part 1's original premise seriously hurts its cause. The incredible amount of \"overpowered\" ninjas along with all the \"demon\" powers and the over-glorification of Eye Techniques leads to a story where only a handful of characters can even function. Couple that with the mass of fillers, and you get an anime series that is much worse than its potential implies.",

I was cranking out 20+ episodes in a day consistently with ease. \r\nAs many people have surely mentioned, the fillers can be a bit much at times and they can also seem extremely repetitive and for someone who was not watching the series week by week ( or maybe even for them as well) it can be a bit frustrating and sometimes i found myself skimming though certain fillers. \r\nPutting aside the fillers, the story line for this series was verynice, in my opinion. I very much enjoyed the fighting scenes and also enjoyed the transitions from huge fights to normal life back at the village. It was a nice blend of both. The comedic aspect was really good as well. Its tough to write without giving examples from the show, but i don't wanna spoil anything for anyone looking to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an amazing series and it feels weird to me that its over. I had my ups and downs with it but i always came back to watch more. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a long series to watch, beware of the filler sections however. I feel this is an anime everyone should try to watch ( whether you watch it all or not). Believe it!",

            "content": "227 episodes....A good point to make a review in my opinion.\r\nNaruto had its ups and downs but for me the ups were better cause the fillers weren't all that bad.\r\nNow we have Shippuuden and i am both happy yet disappointed. I'll do my best to keep things brief and simple.\r\nThis series has great potential. Naruto still has his goal for becoming Hokage and being a Jinchuuriki doesn't help at all. The akatsuki keep getting in the way trying to steal the Kyuubi. Naruto is of course much older but not that much stronger as i would personally have hoped. If you also are disappointed bythis DON'T drop this anime! Many things will happen to make up for it including him getting considerably stronger.\\n\\n\r\nOthers may have dropped it based on the dubbed versions, well I'm here to tell you that they are rubbish and you should watch the original japanese version with the english subtitles. It sounds much more realistic and believe me if you are new to it, it doesn't take long to get use to it.\\n\\n\r\nFillers are also a reason people put this show on the drop list. Yes, most are annoying BUT some are actually rather interesting. Trust me on that. If you don't wish to watch any fillers or want to know which ones are good then by all means post a comment on my profile. Don't post a comment randomly, asking which episodes to avoid and such because i will ignore it. Give me a range of episodes and i will tell you which are fillers or not. You can find the list on wiki if you like.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is extraordinary. The anticipation and suspense of it all is worth it. As time goes on more members of the Akatsuki are brought forward and hidden details are revealed, like their special abilities and their \"forbidden\" past. You grow to love each member in your own way. You learn who is the true ring leader behind everything and why they did all this. There will be heartbreaking moments. I know because it happened to me once. I actually shed a tear before realizing that i was emotional :P The humor is still the same as before so expect much difference. It will make you smile but not fall off your chair laughing.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may find the idea of Naruto trying to do anything to get Sasuke back a bit stupid or i should say what my friend said \"gay\". I understand that but think about it. Naruto never had any friends to begin with and he was able to make some as the story went on. Sasuke was his best friend and later became the FIRST person the acknowledge him. That is what makes Naruto give his all to bring him back. It's not just a simple reason like friendship, it is much more deeper.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a shounen series that very few surpass. Many will disagree but everyone has their own opinion. Maybe you don't like shounen and that's fine but that is no reason to not give this anime at least a try. It's one of the legendary three. (NS, B, OP) If you liked any of the other two then i see no reason not to like this one. If you still have any questions on it please feel free to post a comment and i will reply as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nHow you found this review even remotely helpful.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback greatly appreciated XD",

            "content": "In the original Naruto, you have a simple plot with youthful, childish humor befitting for children, as it is an anime about children and typically for children. As you near the end, the fillers can become unbearable, and everyone is excited to just get it over with and fly off into a whole new world that is Naruto: Shippuden. Naruto Shippuden is the continued story of Narutos life journey about 3 years later. Although 3 years may not seem all that long, at a crucial age as Naruto is in the anime, and the life that he has to lead, it is in fact anextremely large factor in the noticeable differences between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden. It seems that many Naruto fans begin watching with a mindset that still sits with the original Naruto and it's light-hearted ways, and are unprepared for the sudden strifes and seriousness of the new series. Yes, it is true. 3 years later, Narutos life is no longer fun and games.  He is thrown into a world with struggle and complexities befitting for his new age and the era that has begun in Naruto Shippuden. There is little room for the fun and simplicities as Naruto grows and begins fighting for his village and for the lives of his comrads. The series no longer focuses on childish dreams of friendship and play, it's begun a whole new era of the young Konoha's lives where pain and strife become evident in the role of growing up and they are forced to fight for survival and their \"ninja way\", be it peace or revenge, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is by far one of my favorites. It goes from the fun-loving story of children and continues on with more complexities and seriousness that much resembles what happens when you truly grow up in the world and must face life's tests and troubles. This anime could have either continued on with everyone growing older but their character staying young (in turn keeping the childish nature of the original anime) or it could have had them mature with age and inevitably give Shippuden a more mature, serious flow. I believe that they made the right choice by making the anime mature with the characters. It makes it feel as though I am watching the true life of the characters- Aging, maturing, struggling, laughing, crying, and becoming who they are as a person- as an adult. In the beginning, Naruto always talked about who he wanted to grow up as and what he wanted to be- and I wanted to see him do it. With Shippuden I feel like that is exactly what I am getting. Naruto's finally growing up, he's finally realizing the life struggles around him and taking charge and making a difference instead of being the ignorant child that he once was. Let's face it- their is truly little fun in a ninja world once you start growing up. I like how this anime shows the horrors of their reality finally coming into play, even if that means adding complexities to a once simple anime. \\n\\n\r\nTaking the laughter of a youthful story and turning it into the tears of a growing pain as the years continue. Watching the characters go from innocent, young villagers in (ninja) grade school, to young adults that risk life and limb everyday. This is what I've wanted from an anime. Most anime stories are just  \"this or that\". Simple or complex. Funny or sad. Cute or dark. Etc. But Naruto is different. Naruto is the life of ninjas from simple beginnings to hard endings. Happy, youthful days to waking up with the heavy burdens of adulthood. I feel like I could watch his whole life play out if it were to be written out for me, I really do.\\n\\n\r\n(I am a simple anime lover and as it is a cartoon, I don't take my opinions to extremes as some other might. I don't pick at animation or subtle issues, I look at the overall picture. So, that being said, please note that this factor will show in my review.)(Also, Shippuden might have been 2 in a half years later. Idk, I'm no expert. So, I put \"about 3 years later.\" I know anime fans can be very picky about your \"facts\". :d)",

            "content": "Another Shippuden Review\r\nby radiantfire\r\nContext:\r\nThis review analyses Naruto: Shippuuden (simply referred to as Shippuuden from herein), an anime adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's shounen manga Naruto. At the time of writing, I have watched 39 episodes of the series.\r\nStory:\r\nTwo and a half years after Naruto has ended, Shippuuden picks up with fresh new characters and story arcs. Although the anime generally remains true to the manga, small fillers give the story an unnecessary drag. It's somewhat amazing how, in some instances, 1 chapter can equal 2 or more episodes. However, I do find some fillers a pleasant addition to the general plot of the series.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation, ingeneral, is good. Most of the time, you get decent to good animation. Other times, however, offer repetitive frames as well as poor cases of movement and facial expressions. In fact, some positions just looks so awkward. Nonetheless, I find it decent to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe BGM is decent but it is incomparable to the amazing work of Toshio Masuda (main composer of Naruto). Emotions and moods aren't expressed as clearly by the BGM. Sound effects are generally alright, so too is the voice acting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nShippuuden, at least, captures the essence of the characters. I like how they're generally portrayed. Evil characters are evil, good characters are good. What more can you ask for?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs a sequel, Shippuuden doesn't match up to Naruto (that is, if you don't consider all those fillers). As a separate entity, however, it's a pretty decent anime. I'm pretty sure there'll be mix comments on how people have enjoyed the series. I, for one, find it okay to watch.",

And naruto's whining about sasuke.\r\nHad to watchmost of it on FF (3 second skip) towards the end of the eps I had.\\n\\n\r\nAnother useful parallel quality-wise, would be DBZ...Except DBZ probably had more variety in the lack of plot :D.

            "content": "Naruto Shippuuden is the new Dragonball Z. Remember back in the day where it took like 6 episodes to finish something that should only take 5 minutes? Yeah... Naruto is turning into that. \r\nOne of the biggest problems about the show is not necessarily the flashbacks (hey think of it as a supplement to the manga), but instead, the recaps. Recycling footage may have worked in the late 80's/90's, but this is ridiculous. You can tell that they're really just trying to prevent the show from going past the manga which, based on past experiences, is a good idea. However, fillers are better if someeffort is put into them (unlike the fillers from the original Naruto). \\n\\n\r\nOther than this complaint, the sequel series has been a great improvement from the original series. The animation was superb and the music fits well into the scenes. The characters are well drawn, and it's great to see the battle scenes drawn well (I still cringe at the thought of what happened to some of the battle animations back in the original). The music, well, I'll admit that some of the ops have been really annoying, but I was instantly hooked with &quot;Hero's Come Back&quot;.  Furthermore, it's great to see some better insight of some of the characters (which means, yes, I do appreciate some of the flashbacks). However, my biggest complaint about the show's character development is the fear that the script writers will revert back to the cookie cutter characters that they made in the past show, which just made things dull. I understand that a lot of the characters have a sad past, but please, cut down on the melodrama sometimes eh? The show is going to turn into a drama at the projected rate that we saw in the last filler arc. Other than that though, it's finally nice to see some villains that I don't hate with a passion though (I'm sick of seeing Orochimaru's &quot;I can't die&quot; routine). Anyways, here's my breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: (10/10) Hey, the core story is very great, simple and yet it involve so many different characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9/10) Gotta admit, the characters are well done. It is great to finally see a better development of the old characters, and also, it's great to see the new characters be unique in their own way (how do you not like Sai's lack of common sense?).\\n\r\nHowever, I'm sick of this &quot;you have no idea how hard my life was&quot; crap from some em...\\n\r\nspecially the last filler character, it's a bad reminder of the cookie cutter side protagonists that they made from the original Naruto in the fillers. However, other than that, \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: (9/10) I think one of the strong points of this show was definitely the animation. Everything that was shown was very fluid which made the show very mesmerizing to watch. I gotta admit, one of the highlights that I found watching this show was watching everyone use their own specialty set of moves.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: (9/10) Ok, I liked the music, it is so great and has it always make me so emotional.\\n\\n\r\nFinal comments: Naruto Shippuuden is the ultimate anime out there for me. I will keep watching it week by week till the last episode (unless there are fillers involved)^_^!!",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuuden\r\nStory(9)\r\nWell, to begin with, the main thing is still the same as in Naruto: Getting Sasuke back. But, the difference is that there are new enimies, some which you've already seen and really fight now and some you haven't which makes the story a lot more interesting. And there are some new good guys as well. Of course there are fillers(the makers of Naruto seem to do that a lot) but they are still beter than the ones in Naruto and really have a story. But....at episode 90, there starts a filler which is very boring(till 94). They could have done it in 2,maybe 1 episode, but they have to put in in 4 or 5 episodes, and when you have to wait one week, and you know that the coming episode will be boring, well, it sucks. But don't skip it, because it still is cool. And it's a lot better when you can get through it in a few days.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9)\\n\r\nThe art is nearly the same as in Naruto and it is still very good. Everything is done very good and looks nice, and makes the action feel a lot more reel.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9)\\n\r\nThere are some new sounds in Naruto Shippuuden, but they sound-alike a lot. And the sounds in Naruto were good, so these are too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9)\\n\r\nAs I had already said, there are some new, cool characters and of course you have the old ones. A very good thing is that they are introduced one by one, and not all at once. That keeps it a little mystery. You just want to know how they look like and what kind of new things they all can do. A very good thing about Naruto Shippuuden is, that not only Naruto is in the spotlight. other characters get a chance as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10)\\n\r\nNaruto was the first anime I've ever watched, so I couldn't wait to start watching Naruto Shipuuden. And I didn't, because they had already made like 40 episodes or something. xD Just as in Naruto there will be a lot of fighting and training, what is even better than in Naruto(sometimes) and what makes it really great to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9)\\n\r\nWell, I can only say that Naruto Shippuuden is a great anime and that the fillers are good as well, so don't be scared by that. ;P",

            "content": "Yes, I'm writing a Shippuuden review. Why? I really don't know myself. Well screw that, lets get into the review.\r\nI read most of the other reviews to get an idea of what others are saying so I don't add to the pile of redundancy, and I see that many people have \"tried to love Shippuuden\". After watching Naruto when I was 13 and loving it, I watched other animes and realized that Naruto was far inferior to most other quality animes. Yet, because I loved Naruto so much back then (It was my first anime), the thought of an amped-up, older, maturer, badass-er Naruto tickledmy anime tooth (or something like that).\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that excited me about Shippuuden was &quot;YES! THE FILLERS ARE OVER! Now we can have some actual plot movement!&quot; The unfortunate truth: You're not gonna be getting any of that soon...\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden feels like it could be going twice as fast, wasting half as much time, and developing characters like no tomorrow. Maybe no one has any ideas about what happens after the Sasuke issue is settled, so they're stalling. It certainly feels like that, and as the episodes drag on, I feel like im drifting farther from understanding the characters, who could be wonderfully developed.\\n\\n\r\nI had set my standards high for the new Naruto, but the only thing that happened in the years that I waited was I got older, the characters got older, the plotline got moldier, the fillers got bolder, and the enjoyment got colder. It feels like even sub-main plotlines are becoming fillers, which is a shame. Naruto has such potential because of its diversity and huge fanbase, but the sad truth is that shippuuden is not much different from the old naruto.\\n\\n\r\nNow that all the bad stuff is out of the way, the anime is not horrible. Its still a good anime, there's just not that special shine that you find in that anime that you usually weren't expecting. Naruto has an unbelievable amount of hype for younger kids, so if you're looking for something more mature, turn away. If you're a young viewer that just started on anime (who I doubt would be reading this, but nonetheless...) look no further than naruto. Again, its not a bad anime, its just slow, and you have to be patient. Unfortunately, that is one thing that I lack while watching anime.",

People have an annoying habit of talking down all the popular anime, and in some cases, popular anime does not deserve all the fame. But here I cant think of anything to talk down on! (Besides fillers of course.)\r\nBut anyway, Naruto Shippuden has many strong points, characters, story, music, I cant think of an any elements to this anime that have dissatisfied me. It has a perfect balance of comedy and seriousness. Its still there although the comedy starts to fade off a bit in Shippuden, but thats because so much is going on!\r\nThe characters,are very easy to become attached too. The Shinobi world is full of great people, each with their own quirk or trait to better the series. The most rewarding aspect of Naruto is probably the way all of the characters, especially Naruto, grow. Coming back from the time skip from Naruto to Naruto Shippuden, you really see the characters change. Even from early Shippuden to current Shippuden, Naruto and all his friends have evolved into outstanding ninja. It really motivates me, when I see Naruto accomplish near impossible feats, when he started as such a knucklehead. My favorite thing about Naruto is that he changes all the people he meets. The author gave his character a unique way with words that makes him even more interesting! The villains, truly project the evils of the ninja world. If there's a bad character, he's bad. They have you fearing them even though they're not real. They always seem invincible, which is the scariest part.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is great. There are so many things about this show that have went unanswered for so long, and the writer does such a great job of tying them all together! The plot progresses smoothly and quickly, the episodes are 23 min, but feel like 5. The twists are unforeseeable, and catch you off guard, yet at a certain degree, are slightly predictable. The foreshadowing is great. Something is said, than 100 episodes later something happens and you immediately think of the quote 100 episodes earlier. There are also so many powerful moments. I'll admit in a lot of the heart warming scenes I've cried. The best part is there's tears of joy and tears of sadness. The story really causes you to feel for the characters. The emotional/moral lessons you can get out of this are stronger than ANY anime I've seen. The fight scenes, 10/10. Each one conveys a unique message about life itself, and they are all powerful.They were all quite motivating imo. The theme of hatred runs throughout the story, and you see the clear differences of those who choose the path of hate, and those who don't. \\n\\n\r\nIt also has great re-watching value, partly because you see all the foreshadowing. There are so many episodes, and a great number of them were memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was great, I loved the openings and endings. It was a pleasure to listen to them before and after each episode. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's any advice I have for this show, don't go through it too fast. The show has somewhat delayed gratification. It's hella good when you take it slow. You can't rush straight into it. I'm going to be honest, it's probably way better to people who watched Naruto as kids, because they grew up, with him. They watched him grow and mature just as they did themselves, so it's extra special. But nonetheless, Naruto Shippuden is a great ride, and anyone can love it. I'd reccomend it to anyone whose already watched the original naruto series.It really is worth the time.",

            "content": "This is not as wretched as My Hero Light Novel Academia, but it\u2019s still pretty terrible in its own right. Naurto came out in 1999 and is essentially a copycat version of superior series 1990 Yu Yu Hakusho and 1998 Hunter x Hunter. I will be listing reasons for why that is in this lengthy review.  \r\nNaruto was one of the first series I watched. For intended purposes I was hooked at that young age. I loved the detailed fights, side characters (in the beginning), powers, clans, tournaments, etc. However, throughout the years of watching other anime I realized how insufferable and cheap thisseries is. I noticed its inconsistencies, poor characters, bad plot devices, weak villains, and it being very unoriginal. Togashi should claim money from this clear dollar store rip off of his work. \\n\\n\r\nThe first to write home about is the poor characterization. Nearly every character is poorly written and has no concluding payoff to growth or development. They all retract to their similar ways, remain stalemated, or die i.e. Rock Lee/Neji/Shikamaru/Zabuza/Shino all so they don\u2019t steal the spotlight from golden god Naruto, edgy SasuGAY, or get back in the kitchen Sakura. \\n\\n\r\nExamples: Team 8 consisting of Kiba, Shino, and Hinata: A: Shino was presented as a clear cut badass who had major potential. Unfortunately, after his brief spotlight he was shafted as forgettable as literally this becomes an ongoing joke for the series. What a disappointment. This character deserved spotlight and was far more interesting than the leads. B: Hinata was presented as a wallflower who wanted to prove herself. While I liked this starting concept\u2026 it became a bore as her only motivation was to one day suck off golden god Naruto. The female characters of this series are architypes of cheerleading characters. C: Kiba was presented as a tough animal loving hardass. I saw potential for Kiba as he only lost to Naruto do to a \u2018comedic\u2019 plot pull. Kiba was like a young wolverine and had nice development with Hinata. I thought they\u2019d make a nice dynamic duo for their opposing personalities. Sadly, she remained a cheerleader for Naruto, and Kiba remained a joke to make Naruto look better. Overall, two shafted guys and one cheerleading moe girl. \\n\\n\r\nTeam 10 consisting of Ino, Choji, & Shikamaru:  A: Ino was presented a fangirl who wanted to one day sleep with Sasuke and remained that way. What a disappointment considering she had a cool backstory of defending wallflowers. You\u2019ll notice 90 percent of the females only strive to suck off the spotlight males. B: Choji is presented as that stereotypical fat kid who eats all the time but has a large heart. Choji had potential to be interesting, but he remained too much of a joke with exception of the Sasuke resuce arc proving him to be more complex. C: Shikamaru is presented as a sloth genius. I liked the odd mixture of personality in character. Albeit his power is a clear rip off of Asato Kido of YYH. Still a unique character. However, he remains a Naruto sidepiece like the rest of them. \\n\\n\r\nTeam 9 consisting of Rock Lee, Tenten, and Neji. A: Neji predicted the entire series and was killed off as a plot device for the \u201clove\u201d of Naruto and Hinata. What a disgusting mess. Neji was one of the best characters. Although, his personality is a rip off of Hiei from YYH as is Sasuke\u2019s. Also It didn't help his character much when after Naruto defeated him he was suddenly \"changed\". B: Rock Lee had the best fights of the entire series and was the one of the most inspiring characters. Seriously if this creator made Team 9 the central protagonist this series would have ended up a hell of a lot better than it is. Lee after being presented as one of the best characters was pushed away as another joke in the Naruto must remain god jail cell. Also his drunk fighting is a rip off of Chu from YYH. C: TenTen, this girl had so much potential as like Lee had no magic powers. Sadly, since she has a vagina, she remains reliant on men for validation of her character. How pathetic. Team 9 the should have been the leading team. Even their teacher Gai was the best out of all the teachers. Gai sacrificed his life for the betterment of the world. Then of course Naruto had to save him to take the glory away\u2026just as Neji had to die\u2026just as Lee had to remain a JOKE. \\n\\n\r\nNow we reach the series lead team and what a piece of work they are\u2026Team lucky number 7 consisting of Sakura, Saskue, & Naruto. A: Sakura is presented as a rude selfish cow obsessed with Sasuke one day penetrating her. Sakura throughout the duration of the series remains that way. You\u2019d think after Sasuke attempted to kill her, the village, and her friend\u2019s numerous times that she may forget about this childish crush she has on him as it is only based around looks. That isn\u2019t the case as for no logical reason she is obsessed with the psychopath and even ends up marrying and having a kid with him. Yet she knows nothing internally about him only that externally he looks good. I\u2019ll admit I was impressed Sakura managed to train in the later half of the show. However, this proves useless as her mental growth is the same as before. A basic fangirl obsessed with a boy who tried to kill her. A rip off of Genkai from YYH in hair, strength, & personality. Even her teacher uses her power to make her Youthful *exactly like Genaki. Absolute insanity. What a cheap loser Kishi is to steal so many ideas. Sakura is one of the worst written females ever. B: Sasuke is presented as an edgy rude pretty boy who is damaged do to his past. A clear Hiei rip off as they share the same personality, same powers, same design, same sword play, & same semi tragic past. Also, a clear Kurapika ripoff for the eye, past, and clan deal. Sasuke is a dollar store version of both of them. Sasuke is slightly forgivable in the beginning as the reasons he is a cunt are because of his vile past. However, in the later half he contradicts himself far too much. As the creator makes up new motives in his head to keep the story more \u201ccool\u201d. This only makes me confused and hate the character as he doesn\u2019t stick to things and remains aloof about everything. Not only that but he has no problem killing his friends and the village even though 90 percent of them had nothing to do with his past. Sasuke just wants them to feel the pain he felt. Well you\u2019re an asshole Sasuke who is a deadbeat father. Terrible character. An embarrassment. C: The god man himself Naruto. Naruto is a rip off of Hiei's past and Kuwabara\u2019s personality. Hiei for the village hating him because he\u2019s a demon and Kuwabara for his loud comedic annoying willpower heart of gold character. Naruto is by far one of the worst characters. Right up there with Izuku Midoriya for how bad he is. Naruto is presented as an orphan who everyone hates & appears as an underdog. Yet he has the best teachers coaching him, gets hack powers, has literal god ancestors, wins constantly, has a hack demon for victories, never studies, remains an idiot throughout, is disrespectful to elders, and is the son of the best Hokage. Why in the hell should we feel inspired by a character like this? Again, Lee should have been the lead. Naruto is a pathetic rip off of Togashi characters and uses the same hack power time and time again. Naruto has an obsessive relationship with Sasuke to the point of it being homoerotic. It is so illogical. They hate each other and hardly talk nor do they have chemistry. It\u2019s not believable in the slightest. Neji and Lee have a stronger dynamic. Its an outright joke. Everyone\u2019s growth is circled around God asspull Naruto. If any character outshines him they die, are shafted as jokes, or become useless housewives. Pathetic! Kakashi is also a bland character who a rip off Kurama with his calm intelligent cool personality and tragic past. Kakashi gets hacks that make no sense and has so many hypocritical moments its ridiculous. This series became an eye fetish show and a homoerotic reality tv fiasco of Naruto and Sasugay! \\n\\n\r\nThe villains are terrible and have no depth or dualities to them. OK they have some unique powers and epic fights but that is superficial. Where is the richness in their goals or personalities? Obito wants to kill everyone over a girl he hardly knew. I mean get the hell out of here! What a weak motivation. Orochimaru is probably one of the only interesting villains, along with Zabuza & Hidan, as he wants to preserve life over the psychological trauma he faced over losing his parents. However, he is a ripoff of Hisoka being that creepy child bearing pedo obsessed with little boys. Itachi makes no sense and isn\u2019t forgivable. OK he agrees to kill off everyone in his clan expect his brother whom he decides its a great idea to psychologically berates and belittle him. WHAT? This guy is a wannabe Toguro and fails miserably. And stop stealing Hiei\u2019s powers dammit! Togashi needs a cut of this money! Who would murder their entire family for only two village elders requesting it? Insane! Another villain who was OK was Hidan for him being the most entertaining. He had a hack power and no melodramatic backstory. But yet again he is a rip off of a better characters, elder Toguro from YYH in personality, & power, and of Hisoka in that he gets sexually turned on by killing. Plus he was killed off early to make Shikamaru look cool for fifteen minutes of fame. To then go back to Naruto god boy saving the day. What a surprise. Oh that's right and we have Pain who many describe as one of the most complex villains. However, I disagree as he has an overdramatic sad backstory yet his motives are changed quickly after god Naruto chats with him. Wow its not like that cheapens the character after being \"cured\" after a short chat. In fact somehow Naruto has this talking ability to change villains and psychopaths convictions after a few words. Why then should any of us be worried or feel tension when we know psychotherapist Naruto will save the day. Also Pain brought everyone killed back to life so his arc was pointless as nothing significant was lost or gained by it. DUMB. Then we have Madara who survives for hundreds of years apparently holding a grudge against the village over not getting his way. Talk about a woman scorned! Madara existence for so long is do to...? And he dies over the creator writing him into a corner. Madara comes in the further emphasis the orgy the show has for the Uchiha clan and how they are the most powerful by literally defying logic in aging & physics by corrupting the MOON. How pathetic! Madara is taken out by a demi God out of nowhere, Kaguya, who is one of the most vapid characters in the series and that is saying a lot. Its sad because the shows beginning villain, Zabuza, was one of the best ones and a highlight for the series.\\n\\n\r\nEvents following this story make no sense as most are used as plot devices to further advance Naruto or to emphasize the \"cool\" melodramatic tragedy. The exams are rip off YYH and HXH exams. Forest of death - YYH and HXH. The power systems/Chakra - YYH & HxH, The fights - YYH and HXH. Villains - YYH & HXH. Powers - YYH & HXH. Clans - YYH and HXH. Where is Togashi\u2019s check? In the end literal gods and dead characters are brought back to life\u2026it\u2019s just damn absurd. What\u2019s the point of dying when characters are brought back? What\u2019s the point of new characters coming in when we can have the old ones come back? And don\u2019t even get me started on the FILLER. 40 percent of this show has filler useless slice of boredom episodes. Who has time for that?! At least make the filler focused on character depth not fanfic slice of life dribble. \\n\\n\r\nThe good in this show are a few fights, three semi cool villains, a few shafted interesting side characters, nice theme music, and that\u2019s it. Everything else is trash. I cannot stomach the loathing I have for the leads of this series. As they are the most annoying, clich\u00e9, idiotic, pathetic characters I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s not worth your time. Watch compilations of fights and download the soundtrack as its good workout music - that\u2019s it. Nothing deep of meaningful will come from watching this show. Period. \\n\\n\r\n3/10. \\n",

            "content": "\"I will bring Sauske back no matter what!\"\r\nThat quote pretty much sums up a lot of Naruto Shippudean and people who read this review if you haven't watched Naruto then I suggest you watch it because there are somethings you need to know before starting Naruto Shippudean because Naruto Shipudean contains spoliers if you haven't watched Naruto. \r\nNaruto Shippudean is a new story that revolves around Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno's adventures and their search for Sauske Uchiha after he defected from Konoha in order to gain Orchimaru' power. There are two new characters that join in Naruto Shippudean which is Yamato and Sai. Theplot also involves the active Akatsuki in their quest to obtain all of the tailed beasts. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime is really different compared to the first episode of Naruto.  In Naruto it was kind of a little bit cartoony a little bit but it still looked like anime. In Naruto Shippudean the art style was newer and the effects were a lot better in Naruto Shippudean.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in the story there is a lot of them but I am going to focus on the main characters. Naruto has the Nine Tails inside of him. He ultimately gets stronger because He is so obessed with getting Sauske back so Sauske is getting him stronger and making him move further. Sakura Haruno is a girl from Team 7 or apart of Naruto\u2019s team. She has gotten stronger because she was trained by the 5th hokage Tsunade who is strong in the previous Naruto series she was obessed with Sauske and practically was in love with him but she was a weak character but now I see her getting stronger. Sauske Uchiha was a former Leaf Village Ninja who decided to wanted to gain more power so he joined Orchimaru and Orchimaru trained him a lot and how he got stronger is because of his hatred towards his brother Itachi and he wanted to kill him because of what Sauske think Itachi did. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment for Naruto Shippudean is that it\u2019s a very good show and if you liked Naruto then I suggest you watch this show because Naruto gets a lot better and stronger. There are things that happen in the anime that will shock you or you didn\u2019t know about different characters but Naruto Shippudean has a lot of in depth fillers about some characters past and I won\u2019t spoil anything because that is for you to find out yourself. The show is still airing as of now and the way things are unfolding is pretty good. Overall if you liked Naruto I highly recommend Naruto Shippudean. \\n",

While only the first 2 episodes are fillers, the remaining ones progress very slowly, probably an attempt to avoid the filler season like the first generation Naruto. Honestly, the slow plot development is worse than having fillers, because it makes each episode much less enjoyable. Conversation between characters( that do not really contribute to the plot) take up easily a third of the air time of each episode. The fighting scenes can best be described as \\'same old\\', apart from the intro of very limited new skills/techniques. On a more positive note, the opening theme showed great improvement overthe first generation.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\\'t started watching the new season, don\\'t- read the manga instead.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me make something clear, it says \"watched 130 episodes\" at the time of writing this review, that's when I stopped watching the show. I've kept up with the manga, I know where it's going, and I stopped watching the show for a good reason.\r\nNaruto, great show, lots of filler, but hey, I watched all 220 episodes, you did too probably. So what, who are we to complain? It ended with one of the best fights anime has ever seen, and a cliffhanger leaving us wanting more.\r\nShippuuden is that more. And frankly, it's kind of like going to a fancy restaraunt, having the waiter charmyou with the menu, bring out some great bread rolls and appetizers, and then fart on your main course. Naruto went downhill, because frankly, the author stopped caring somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nShippuuden starts out alright, they wanna get sasuke back, they see him, leaves you wondering what's going on. And the story at first is pretty good, see some good, detailed fights (which is what Naruto is mostly about) and some interesting twists, strategies etc... which is what we all fell in love with when watching Naruto in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThen came the stagnation. Looking back, it's hard to say why it's just not as good, the events themselves are fairly important and well thought out, but it's the way they're executed that leaves you with a feeling of boredom afterward. Every story arc seems to start out with some promise of development, and end in disappointment, be that because the development in the end didn't really matter, or because the development itself decided it didn't want to exist.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT\\n\\n\r\nExample, Naruto vs. Pain. The entire akatsuki thing concentrates into this little duel, and Konoha is destroyed, Loads of important people die, Naruto appears to mature as a leader, and the entire thing reeks of ending.\\n\\n\r\nThen everyone's resurrected cause Naruto knows how to sweet talk his enemy into self-sacrificial suicide. Everyone who died is brought back to life (except one, who died earlier), and the village goes about it's business as if it was just a tornado that blew through.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER DONE\\n\\n\r\nLet me ask you this, would Romeo and Juliet have been better if at the end, Juliet woke up and said \"jk! lolz,\" and then wandered off with Romeo, who also had woken up, and gave some half-assed speech explaining how their love could defeat even death. If your answer was anything aside from NO, then please feel free to stop reading and enjoy Naruto Shippuuden to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nIf yes, then you are sane, and you will not appreciate this anime after a while. The strategy that everyone enjoyed is slowly replaced by sheer power, leaving a horrible Bleach/DBZ feeling to it. I mean, remember when Naruto and sasuke teamed up against Zabuza and he hid in the shuriken shadow? That was cool! It caught you off guard, and was mentally stimulating! Now imagine if that scenario had ended with Naruto raging out and beating up Zabuza just because it'll lead to an end of the arc. It loses it's touch doesn't it? That's what Shippuuden ends up doing, and it's terribly dissapointing. The plot takes some turns, but overall decides that even it would have rather gone straight, and the character development... actually improves slightly, but that's not what you're watching Naruto for. And besides, the best characters get less cameos anyways, so... meh.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nShippuuden has good quality artwork, that much you can give it. But art doesn't really matter much towards enjoyment. If anything, it's only important during fights, and I guess it gets the job done and then some, they had the budget and they didn't cheap out.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack works to establish mood, op and end are enjoyable, and characters have suiting voices. Sound is A-OK.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nCertain characters (main only) have good development, and some new ones show up, but honestly, I miss Shikamaru. I know he shows up, but he doesn't do anything anymore. I miss having characters actually matter. They got all serious, and it's lost it's fun factor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't tell from my review being full of sunshine and farts, Naruto Shippuuden starts out enjoyable, and then turns sour. I dropped it for a reason. If you don't get it, read the story section again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThere are other anime more worth your time than Naruto Shippuuden. If you want to find out how the story ends, pick up the manga, it's faster anyways.",

            "content": "This review will only cover the beginning of Shippuden until the Kage Summit. I've watched a bit after that, but I don't remember much from it. I don't plan on watching another god damn episode of this anime either. There might also be some spoilers in this review, so if you haven't watched it don't read it, or at least skip over some stuff.\r\nNaruto Shippuden is hands down one of the shittiest battle shounen series i've ever watched. In every aspect Naruto Shippuden fail so badly it isn't even funny. As someone that grew up watching Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, I couldn't give less ofa shit. It's so bad that even the nostalgia is irrelevant to me now.\\n\\n\r\nFirst comes the story. The story of Naruto Shippuden (as far as I've watched) is about the battle against the Akatsuki, and our main characters quest to rescue Sasuke. Firstly, this entire Sasuke subplot is actually terrible. Naruto's goal of bringing Sasuke back to the village makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. He says that they are \"friends\" and he wants to bring him back from the dark side. This makes no sense because Naruto and Sasuke have never shown that much friendship to begin with. Naruto always disliked Sasuke because he was treated better than him. All the girls liked Sasuke and not one damn person liked Naruto. They were never close close friends to begin with so this obsession in bringing him back is a bit too absurd.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but Sasuke is the same person that tried to kill his best friends. I find it quite weird how Naruto is still obsessed in bringing Sasuke back even though he tried to kill Sakura. At that point, he should've just gave up on that goal and act like a normal human being. That's why I consider this entire subplot to be straight up garbage and nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThe Akatsuki is pretty much the only interesting thing about this anime. It's not like they are complex characters or anything, but they were at least good enough to keep my interest. Unfortunately (spoiler alert) Kishimoto gets rid of them way too fast and rushes everything. Some of these Akatsuki had no depth to their character whatsoever. Kisame had almost no depth at all, and he was one of the last surviving Akatsuki. Not only him, but pretty much almost all of them get wiped out so quickly it's ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights in Naruto Shippuden are filled with asspulls/deus ex machinal. Most of the fights the good guys win because of asspulls and plot armor. Sasuke vs Deidara was an awful fight and there's no way Sasuke should have won. Kakuzu, a ninja that has lived almost as long as Madara Uchiha gets beaten by a kid in 1 minute. People with years and years of fighting experience get beaten by fucking Naruto. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about Naruto, he's hands down the WORST protagonist I've ever seen in an anime. Not just Shounen, but anime in general. His character design is just awful, but that isn't even the worst part. Naruto has the shittiest personality out of any character in the series. He went from being the \"underdog\" to the chosen one. He was pretty much gifted since birth, which is complete and utter bullshit. Almost every single damn person he fights becomes a good guy, which is straight up trash. Talk no jutsu wins all I guess..He literally uses like 2-3 techniques the entire show, well as far as I've watched. There literally is absolutely no variety with his techniques. It's just shadow clones, rasengan, and sometimes toads. He is the worst main character in an anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about Naruto I dislike is his shitty Nine Tails. The Nine Tails power is pretty much used as an asspull every single time. Anytime Naruto is in danger of losing/losing his friends, he goes Nine Tails. When he was fighting Pain, Hinata was injured and then he went nine tails. Against Deidara, he goes Nine Tails. I've barely seen Naruto winning fights because of his actual strength. That is absolutely terrible writing.\\n\\n\r\nSasuke is a shitty character as well. His character development is terrible and completely random as well. First he's an edgy kid, and then he goes insane, and then I even heard he tries to become Hokage! I admit that some of the fight scenes Sasuke was in was cool, but as a character he's trash. I might aswell call him \"plotsuke\" because of the amount of damn plot armor he's had. Sasuke should've died a million times. He should've died against Deidara, Kages, and Killer Bee, but unfortunately he's always being saves by asspulls and plot armor.\\n\\n\r\nNow here's one of the biggest problems I have with Naruto Shippuden. All of the characters from the squads (like Neji, Lee, Shino, Kiba) barely had ANY shine or screen time at least. Shikimaru is like the only one that had some shine, but the rest of them were fucking irrelevant as far as I've watched. Rock Lee used to be one of the most awesome characters in the series. In Shippuden, he's reduced to pure garbage. Same thing goes for Neji, Hinata, Kiba, Shino, etc. Now Kishimoto just introduces a bunch of trash characters like Sai and Yamato and make them have more screen time than the characters people actually liked. Absolutely awful. \\n\\n\r\nI'd give the animation a solid 8/10. Most of the time it was pretty good. The only time I remember the animation being bad was during the fight with pain. It wasn't that bad either because the fight itself was pretty good. Unfortunately good animation doesn't redeem everything else that's bad about the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnother terrible thing about Naruto is the flashbacks. Like god damn, every single fight scene there is there would be a flash back that lasts for like 20 minutes! I often found myself falling asleep every time this happens. Not only is that bad, but the same flashbacks are re used over and over again ad nauseam, to the point where it just becames annoying af. In a fight scene, there would be a 10 minute flashback. In an emotional scene there would be probably an episode worth of flashbacks. It's absolutely awful. \\n\\n\r\nNow since this is a review, I'm going to have to talk about the \"good\" things I found in Naruto. The fights in Naruto were pretty good, regardless of the asspulls. When it comes to choreography, Naruto has some pretty good fight. That's a plus. The Akatsuki were good characters, well some of them at least. Shikimaru is one of the only good characters in the Leaf Village (even though he's irrelevant after his arc is done). That's it. That's literally it. That's all this series has going for it.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison to Naruto, Shippuden is straight up garbage. The original Naruto had awesome characters, awesome arcs (Sasuke Retreival, Chunin Exams, Zabuza arc), and awesome villains (Zabuza). Naruto himself has always been a trash character, but at least the rest of the characters were interesting enough in the original Naruto. I give the original a solid 7/10. Besides the filler, it's pretty good. Shippuden on the other hand.... nvm I already said everything I wanted to say.\\n\\n\r\nDont watch this awful anime.\\n\\n",

I clearly remember the first ep of naruto which I ever watched its was a episode from the chunin exam when naruto is writing the test which he doesn't know but the way hehandles the situation was pure epic then I watched the first season of the series the zabuza arc and I was star strucked. The strong desire of the main character to be acknowledged by by his village and his friends was something that resonated with my thinking's. Then the series was such a great part of my life that I cannot put it into words\\n\\n\r\nWhen naruto cried I also feel the pain when he work hard he inspired me to do the same and when he achieved some thing it made me so happy that tears started to flow from my eyes\\n\r\nThere were many moments  which I will never forget like say for instance \\n\r\nThe first time he defeats neji after he wins he takes a victory lap around the arena and everyone in the audience is just shocked to see him win. At that time I was feeling like this is what I want to be. And the infamous scene from after naruto returns the village after defeting pain and the scene in which iruka is telling his story was so heart touching that it made me proud. \\n\r\nThe story itself was so good that I can overlook many things \\n\r\nThe back story of naruto was so sad I clearly remember the ep 'thank you' in which he meets with his mother it was just so beautiful \\n\\n\r\nAt this point you may be thinking that he is just overestimating the series so yes I am. But I too cannot ignore the curse which was making a epic series a avrg one 'filler' it was bullshit pure bulshit, no no it was worse the bullshit\\n\r\nOnly the novel adaptations were worth mentioning. \\n\r\nBut living that aside it was a good series and for me a inspirational one\\n\r\nSo seeing the last episode made me a bit emotional it was 9 years of journey for me and yes I am happy that it ended but I also feel a bit sad \\n\r\nSo if you have not watched naruto a you feel that you are a failure I think you should give it a try Bcz I know if you can connect with it you will not be disappointed. \\n",

The fillers do get annoying in Shippuuden but not nearly as annoying as Naruto's fillers did.  Naruto Shippuuden is a typical shounen anime and I don't think that any of them should really get 10 overall.  But Naruto/ and Shippuuden has just a warm and interesting story that you just cant help but love.  One of my all time favorites for sure.",

            "content": "The only thing this show had going for it was the Pain arc, it was a good tragedy and delivered on the promise that Naruto would one day become a strong ninja. After that, the show really falls flat.\r\nThe main problem stems from the Great War Arc being so long (equivalent to 200 chapters worth of material). Stuff is cluttered, different plot points are tangled and new major villains come out of nowhere. There are something like 4 main villains in this arc, and each one becomes irrelevant when the new one shows up. The arc builds up one antagonist and then tosses it away,thereby destroying the point of the antagonist in the first place. And in the end, you're just left with a Sasuke vs. Naruto fight squeezed in for the sake of it providing closure, when in fact this fight could've just happened after the Pain arc and have had way more significance.\\n\\n\r\nAside from story shortcomings, the animation is some of the worse I've ever seen. Even Hunter X Hunter, which had around 150 episodes, had amazing animation, so I don't see long runtimes posing budget issues for the animation. There are some decent characters (Kakashi, Pain, Gai, Rock Lee, etc...) but they are few and far between, and almost every character is tossed aside so that Naruto and Sasuke can have the spotlight in the last arc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is overhyped and cliche. The 'main' antagonist Sasuke doesn't even show up a lot, and when he does he is just bland and plain edgy. The only high point of the show would be the Pain arc, since it addresses the plot point of Naruto protecting the village that shunned him and surpassing his master. This show gets a very low 4/10, and it would definitely be a 1 or 2 if the Pain arc wasn't a part of it.",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuuden. One of the most popular anime series to ever be created. But did you see what I said? I said popular. Not best, not deepest, and not the saddest. But it is far from being, and I mean far, a bad anime. I came on to MAL completely surprised when I saw that it was rated #510, and even more so that Naruto was #800 something. I sat and thought \"why in the world is it rated so low?\". I looked around on MAL for a little while, and I figured out that there are a couple reasons it is so bagged on.1. Filler. People decide that because Naruto has more filler than the other \"Big 3\" that it has a horrible plot and deserves a 5 for a score. To you people that do that, you should be ashamed. Where do you get off rating a wonderful anime like this one, a 5 because you think there are too many fillers? It's just stupid, honestly. 2. People like to throw rocks at things that shine. I've talked to people who, no joke here, rate low because it is popular. That isn't as common here, but I still see it. and 3. People come in to Naruto already thinking they're going to hate it. News flash, if you come in like that, you come in looking for flaws. And trust me, you will find flaws, Naruto is definitely not perfect. Although, those flaws don't merit this anime the score it has here. \\n\\n\r\nThat's all I wanted to say. I didn't come here to talk up Naruto, I came to defend it. And sure, you can call me a fanboy. You'd be right, but I'm not so \"fanboyish\" to let it get in the way of my judgment. \\n\\n\r\nI've decided that I wont make this into a \"real\" review because I'm satisfied with the other reviews. I just really wanted to get that off my chest.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest: I didn't like Naruto that much. \r\nNow before you think I've gone nuts, hear me out. I liked the premise of the story and I enjoyed the beginning of the series quite a lot as well. The sound track is pretty nice, albeit a little dramatic at times and I liked the animation. I liked most of the characters, even. But there were a few things that really killed the series for me.\r\n One issue was that there were way too many fillers. Even die-hard Naruto fans will agree with me on this. There were so many just useless episodes about randommissions or life at Konoha or whatever, that I started to get sick of watching. Some of them were nice, I'll admit, but most of them added basically nothing to the story line and got on my nerves. Out of the 500 episodes of Naruto, at least 100 are fillers and for me, that is just waaay too many. \\n\\n\r\nThere was also an issue of a few plot holes and good ideas that were not revisited at all, which got me mildly to thoroughly irritated from time to time based on how interested I was in the idea. But in the long run, I don't think that problem alone would have made me dislike the series as much as I do.\\n\\n\r\nThis next one is kind of personal preference. Although Naruto doesn't have a bunch of blatant fan service or girls in bikinis and whatnot. I eventually got sick of the fact that almost every new female character was introduced with an obligatory butt shot or boob shot. For some of them it was more odd and out-of-place than the others, but overall I'd say that the idea just kind of got old. Fan service in general isn't really my thing, but I don't mind it that much if it doesn't become a central part of the story. Once again, however, this is just personal preference, so if you like fan service or don't find butt/boob shots boring, this won't bother you at all. \\n\\n\r\nBut the biggest issue I had was the Sharingan (an eye that grants the user access to special techniques). In the beginning, I really liked the idea of an eye that can copy other jutsu (ninja techniques that are somewhat like magic, but marginally explained) instantaneously. It was an interesting idea and I looked forward to its uses and how it would be developed. I expected there to be some kind of upgrade to it. So when Itachi (one of the characters) showed up with a Mangekyo Sharingan that was very useful to for genjustu (marginally explained mind control), I accepted it. I didn't really get how someone could get from a copying eye to any eye that can hypnotize people, but I just kind of shrugged and went with it. But when Sasuke (one of the main characters) and Itachi started to yank literal skeleton monsters out of their eyeballs, I got super irritated. Explain to me how in the world we got from a copying eye to an eye that has enough room to fit a skeleton. At this point the writer was blatantly just adding complete bs to the Sharingan in order to make Sasuke look more \"badass\". Sure, it made him look marginally more competent, but to me, it was just irritating. It made no sense in any way, shape, or form and was just a major plot hole and turnoff. The final nail in the coffin was when a villain with the Sharingan showed up with a dimension in his eyeball. How? Just how? You're really telling me that there is now a special dimension accessible to Sharingan users that no one had any prior knowledge/ idea about? What does the main ability of the Sharingan, the copy cat eye, have to do with pulling dimensions out of thin air? It was like the writer was trying to see how far he could go with just random, unexplained power ups to the Sharingan. It was infuriating, stupid, and I lost what little respect and awe I had for the Sharingan I had with this \"new ability\". The entire constant evolution issue with the Sharingan was even further offset and outlined by the Byakagan (another eye that gives the person access to special justu). The Byakagan was established as very strong and blatantly more powerful than the Sharingan at the beginning of the series. So when I noticed that the Sharingan was turning into some kind of a monster, God-like eye, I expected some sort of special Byakagan to form. But the Byakagan stayed completely the same from episode 1 to episode 500. If you're going to power up one eye so much, at least stay consist and do something to the other one! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, some parts of the story were done really well. Some aspects of the plot and some of the messages wrapped up in this story are good. But some things in the story just completely killed it for me and even though I watched the entire series, I kind of wish I had just dropped it once the problems became too much for me to handle. Even so, a lot of people like Naruto and there is nothing wrong with that. I just listed what issues made Naruto a no-go for me. So if you have read the plot summary and don't have any issues with the problems I outlined above, go for it! Hopefully you will enjoy Naruto more that I did.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. \r\nShippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the eliteof the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja. \\n\\n\r\nIt is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series. And the end of the ninja drama and misteries is still distant. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a very good series if you were a big fan of the original or before the time skip. The only thing is that it relies heavily on the original series. It is highly recommended that you either read or watch what is before the time skip. Other wise it is amazingly good. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of improvement from the original anime. I personally think it has a better detail in to what is going on. Another one is the soundtrack. It has a more serious tone to it which add to the intensity of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of anime's such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Rurouni Kenshin, Samurai 7, Pokemon. There is a massive possibility you will like it Shippuden. If you have watched the first series then you will adore it as in my opinion this sequel is even better.\\n\\n\r\nRegards\\n\\n\r\n-Kep0v",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuden is 60% filler episodes and 40% story\r\nStory: \r\nThis is your basic gotta get to the next power level to beat Cell kind of story. they do try to throw in some emotional stuff but it falls very flat and the ending ends just how you expect it. The story is so attached to the main group of side characters the only 3 out of over 20+ actually die.\r\nArt:\r\nEven though the anime ran from 07' to 17' the art style more or less stayed in the 07' era thus the later animation is average quality\r\nSound: \r\nMany Many theme songs for some one or 2might be decent enough. However the Main characters voice is like nails on a chalkboard. The same song is used repeatedly(for dramatic effect) in many of the episodes thus nullifying any impact it once had.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe One place where this anime shines and the reason this anime has the most fanfics of any anime. Let me be clear, Naruto the main character has a terrible voice, is pretty annoying and has a extremely gay obession with Sasuke. I hate Naruto, but There are so many other decently fleshed out characters you will find a few that you may like and most of these character get an episode or two where they are the main focus.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nThe fact that every episode has a flash back of a previous episode or flash back of a flashback that we have already seen (which sometime take up more then half the episodes runtime) makes this anime extremely annoying to watch and has gain the nickname FlashBack Simulator. and then smack dab in the middle of a main story arc they put in filler arcs just to extend the series length and making so you have to burn through an arc that has nothing to do with the main story to get back to the main story. Even then some episode are nothing but slow talking with long pauses and by the time the episode ends not a lot has actually happened. Some fights are really really good while others they just stand there and talk a lot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n If You have LOTS of spare time and liked the original series you may like this or you could skip to the last 10 or so episodes and be like ok this is them 2-6 years later the end.",

            "content": "[Story]\r\nGreat story, won't put too much because I wouldn't want to spoil anything.\r\nThe story of Naruto Shippuden follows a few years after the events of the original series.\r\nNaruto, the main protagonist, is a ninja that everyone loves.  He is goofy, nice, not always the sharpest tool in the shed, but determined to help the people he cares about and gain the respect of the people in his village, never straying from his path to become the Hokage. (Hokage = Leader of the village)\r\nNaruto is a Jinchuuriki, or a person who has one of the nine mystical tailed beasts sealed inside of him.  Thisoften caused him great grief and sorrow early on in his life because the villagers feared and hated him for what he was.  He occasionally has bouts with the nine-tailed beast inside of him, usually over control of his body and the use of it's evil power or chakra.\\n\\n\r\nIn Shippuden, a lot of the focus is geared towards the Akatsuki, an evil organisation with a plan (not revealing) and Naruto's childhood rival and \"friend\" Sasuke.\\n\\n\r\nI'm done typing about the story, so if you want more, watch the show and you'll quickly pick up what's going on.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\\n\r\nA sound effect for everything, like there should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe ambient sounds and situational music haven't changed in forever+2.\\n\\n\r\nThey were good when the series started and that hasn't changed, I only give it a 7 for never ever ever ever changing.\\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\\n\r\nWell they don't change clothes, so they must either not sweat or have really great hygiene.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not one to judge art too harshly, but the angles are good and you can usually tell what's going on in a fight.\\n\\n\r\n[Character/Hate]\\n\\n\r\nMain characters:\\n\\n\r\nNaruto - Pretty much described in the [Story] section.\\n\\n\r\nSasuke - Emotional, tormented, get's exponentially stronger every time you see him.  Sasuke is Naruto's childhood rival and \"friend\" that Naruto is always trying to save.  Sasuke has a horribly tragic beginning in which his whole clan was slain by his brother who then taunts him to grow spiteful and strong to eventually come and get revenge on him.\\n\\n\r\nTobi (No spoiler) - A member of the Akatski with a plan. All I can say when putting the words \"no spoiler\" in it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWon't go on about the side characters, except for this following hate part:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great for the most part, except for Sakura... ok, pretty much every female ninja.\\n\\n\r\nAll the female ninjas in the series are portrayed as weak, emotional, annoying, bothersome, in-the-way, etc..  overall useless individuasl in a male oriented ninja world.\\n\\n\r\nSakura does nothing in fights other than get in the way and attempt to heal people (pretty much always failing) at the end.  When she's not failing, she's punching our friendly protagonist in the face and being an all around bitch.\\n\\n\r\nHinata is portrayed as thinking of Naruto all the time, like she has no life apart from her childhood crush, except from when she's being put down at home for being a girl.\\n\\n\r\nIno, short story, she's a bitch that you could never want to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nI'd have to say the only women in the whole series that isn't a total failure is Tsunade, because she doesn't take shit from anyone.  She still has her occasional emotional breakdown though.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Cons/Hate]\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I love this series to death.  \\n\\n\r\nThe five minute episodes go by so fast, and I say five minutes because that's about all the time in each episode that isn't dedicated to some flashback of the last episode's flashback.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the plot is actually being advanced, it's exciting and attention holding.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the show is also so entangled with filler episodes, which I skip, so much so that it feels like they make an episode once a  month!\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\\n\r\nGreat show, been following it weekly since the original Naruto series first aired.  If you are looking for something entertaining, this could very well be it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show would be great if you just start watching because you can browse through the currently 254 episodes, skipping over countless fillers and flashbacks, and actually enjoy the advancing plot, exciting battles, and interesting twists.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I consider Shippuden superior to the original series, I would recommend watching the original first to get some background as to what is going on, or you can actually watch the flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 - I hope Naruto Shippuden stays alive.",

            "content": "Naruto: Shippuuden review\r\nNaruto: Shippuuden is one of the most famous anime of all time, but sometime, being famous doesn\u2019t mean it is good. People generally just base their opinion on what they liked but not on what they disliked about Naruto so that\u2019s why you might have heard that it is a good show. If people love so much this anime, it is basically just because they found it entertaining or because they grew up with it, but if we look at it objectively we can clearly see that it is a huge waste of time and attention.\r\nFirst, the main story line is about Narutodealing with Obito\u2019s past. Let me explain myself, Obito was in love with a girl called Rin when he was around twelve years old. That girl died because she had a beast sealed inside of her that was supposed to destroy her village. Instead of coming back to Konoha, she decided to kill herself to save some life. Even if she suicides, Obito couldn\u2019t bear it so since that day he decided to avenge her by destroying the ninja world. Naruto will have to counter all his plan to save the ninja world and his precious comrades. So what sucks about this is that Obito is now a lot older and still didn\u2019t get over it, which is just stupid. Almost everything that\u2019s going to happen in this anime was indirectly or directly because of that incident that happened many years ago. It is so exaggerated, the Akatsuki exist because of Obito and there will be another Great Ninja War that last for more than the half of the anime (which is 500 episodes!). \\n\\n\r\nSecond, the psychology of all the characters is messed up. You will learn the story of a lot of them and it might seem like a good thing at the beginning because it justified the fact that some of them are evil. In facts, it makes the anime last a lot longer for no reason because they all have the same story. There is more than one hundred characters and none of them has a unique story, including Naruto they are all thinking the same way so they all doing the same thing. Here\u2019s a few of the characters story that you\u2019ll see many times:\\n\r\n1.\tThe character loses someone he holds dear, so he will want to avenge him by destroying the responsible and his village (Ex: Obito, Nagato, all the member of the Akatsuki)\\n\r\n2.\tThe character is a total failure for martial arts and has a genius (a genius in Naruto is only someone who his not totally stupid cause they are honestly never doing anything smart) in his team, so he\u2019ll try to surpass him and become hokage (Ex: Obito, Naruto, Guy sensei).\\n\\n\r\nThird, as I said before it is too long for no reason, but not only because of all the unnecessary character\u2019s story. A fight in Naruto: Shippuuden can last for many episodes because of all the efforts of the director that wanted to make it epic. I remember that fight against Orochimaru that was like 4 episodes and two of them were basically Naruto standing in the middle of a bridge just to show the power of his beast and Orochimaru talking to Naruto in beast form that can\u2019t answer him back. All the things that Orochimaru said were useless, it was only a reaction to Naruto\u2019s power. Another proof of that is clearly the Ninja war that last for hundreds of episodes. Every time that Naruto\u2019s side finally succeed at beating Obito or Madara, there will be a stupid reason for them to come back with more strength. You\u2019ll see that those two will be beaten two or three times each, but there\u2019s always an excuse for them to recover. \\n\\n\r\nFourth, there are a lot of character (especially girls) that are useless. Sakura for example which should be one of the three principal characters after Naruto and Sasuke isn\u2019t doing anything and gives nothing to make the story go further. She is only in love with Sasuke since she saw him and always try to stop Naruto that want to bring him back to the village. Pretty much every female Ninja student in this anime exist because they love someone or just because some teams miss a girl. Even the Hokage (the chief of the village) is useless. She is one of the most unqualified person to take that role. She is very weak and dumb, the only thing she knows to do is how to lose a fight and give orders, but again she is a girl and her team needed one when she was young.\\n\\n\r\nFifth, Naruto\u2019s way of thinking just doesn\u2019t make sense. He is always saying that what he wants the most is to protect his friends, but you\u2019ll see that he will excuse Obito for killing a lot of them and his parents just because the guy said that he hoped for Naruto to become Hokage. All the bad things that happened to Naruto were in some way because of Obito and he wants to forgive him because of some worthless words? That is ridiculous! Normally I wouldn\u2019t waste time on one specific characters like this, but it is the main one, so I think it is worth mentioning. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I think that Naruto: Shippuuden only has one quality, it is entertaining. Unfortunately, this one isn\u2019t enough to make this anime a good one because of all the defaults that it has. If you are looking for an anime that has a good story, good characters, relationships with real feelings or some interesting psychology, you are not at the good place because it is too simple, too repetitive and doesn\u2019t feel real for a bit. If you are interested, I can suggest you Katanagatari which has some theme in common with Naruto: Shippuuden but certainly a lot more mastered. Also, you can go look at Ranma \u00bd that inspired Naruto, a little bit too much in my opinion (It is a lot better, but not a masterpiece).\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR\r\n+ some OP and ED songs\r\n+ short-living cool moments\r\n- fillers and flashbacks\r\n- visuals, all of them\r\n- overused sound assets\r\n- pacing and episode direction\r\nStory\r\nStory continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable.\r\nStory in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who isblinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying to save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nAnimation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation. Even in fights, you can see a lot of changes from one still image to another, because the \"characters move so fast\"... Right.\\n\r\nBackground images could be split into 3 types - trees, village, cave. None of these are eye candies really.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nPersonally, more often than not I enjoyed opening and ending songs. What's worse though are background sounds. Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible, but they were nice to listen to the first million times. They've become something like a trademark now and watching the episodes muted wouldn't wouldn't make any difference as you can easily guess what'll play.\\n\r\nVoice acting has been ok at best. Naruto is still voiced by a lady.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacters didn't change at all at start, except they grew bigger and stronger. A lot later there's some development going on, but only between 2 main characters. It's still very refreshing to see though.\\n\r\nSo basically, Naruto is still gutsy dude who wants to be the very best and Sasuke is still darkness. That's about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed few nice battles or moments. Unfortunately, most of these were partially or completely destroyed by horrible pacing and animation. Most of the rest can be easily skipped.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nStarted off as \"ok\", but for a long time now, this show has been a mass produced garbage made just to milk more money from fans. The only way an episode can keep my attention is if I triple the playback speed.\\n\r\nI suggest you watch this ONLY if you haven't seen the previous season and stop as soon as you start getting bored, because trust me, it will only get worse. Whether we like it or not, Naruto is a big piece of anime history and it shold be experienced by all fans (at least a bit).",

            "content": "Naruto is and always will be one of the great long shonen series out of all the shonen series. It has provided a story that still makes its fans wanting more, it has revived criticism for its filler but when filler is not being aired  it is excellent.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nNaruto Shippuuden is the sequel of the first series of naruto and continues on from when naruto goes to train with his personal sensei jiriya so he can get stronger to find and rescue his best friend and rival sasuke. But the story of naruto becomes much more than that as the series progresses with somany unexpected twists and turns. If you want a good story i strongly recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNaruto has shown that is has many strong points when it comes to animation but when it comes to consistency of quality in animation it dose not fair to well. The anime has had moments when the quality has strongly declined (Battle of Pain) but most of the time the anime keeps up the quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound fx of Naruto Shippuden to the soundtracks and sounds of attacks are nothing short of awesome. The music playing while people are fighting in the anime have an elegant sound to them and gives a nice feeling of relaxation while watching the fight unfold.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\n The Characters are nothing short of amusing and interesting every single one of the are different and they all have different goals in mind. Which leaves you wondering in naruto shippuden every time a new character come on screen you become intrigued about what the character will be like.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI Saw the original series for the first time in 2006 from a recommendation from a friend and i loved it after a few episodes once i finished i had to go on into shippuuden which was twice as good. The original naruto was differently a calm before the storm for shippuden because of the amount of enjoyment that shippuden gave later on.\\n\\n\r\nOver al 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series to anyone in a heart beat regard less of their anime preference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I, for one, read the manga, which is really starting to yet interesting but I also watch the anime, when the episodes come out. There are some who are starting to dislike Naruto Shippuuden because of \"fillers\" and yeah.\r\nOverall, I find the animation similar to the original Naruto, but there were some changes in it, too. There is and gonna be more action in Naruto Shippuuden, I can tell, sinceI read the manga, some do too. If you are a Naruto fan and just can't wait until the new releases for the episodes, I suggest to read the manga, there are some sites online like; onemanga.com. If you've seen the latest release of Naruto Shippuden, which is episode 27, you should start on Chapter 276. But it would be nice to keep up with the new releases of the episodes and chapters.\\n\r\nThe new releases of chapters also take 1, sometimes 2, weeks to be release, similar to the episodes' releases, but the manga is way far ahead.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in Naruto are totally awesome and have interesting powers/skills/techniques, well, the characters that are going to appear, later on in Naruto Shippuuden, so the excitement of Shippuuden only just begun, there's much more that's gonna happen, Enjoy!\\n\\n\r\nI hope I did okay for my first review.",

            "content": "Here I am, typing out my second review of Naruto. Apparently I feel pretty strongly about this series, and not in a good way either. But first, let me tell you why I even bothered with this series.\r\nIf you were in middle-high school in the mid to late 2000s, then chances are you were exposed to the full brunt of the Naruto craze. I was in 5th or 6th grade at the time and all I was ever exposed to were AMVs. It wasn't until a few years later that I decided to take it upon myself to watch the series to the bitter end.And what a wonderful mistake that was. Alright, with all the personal bullshit out of the way, let's get to business. Since I'm lazy, I'll just write a review for the original series by extension as well. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nAbout as predictable as you can imagine. Some bratty kid has an overly ambitious goal and the story revolves around him trying to reach it. And of course, he does, and some people might argue that the suspense lies in how it all happened. In other words, when there's already a foregone conclusion, all the stuff in the middle is supposed to be exciting. While the story is not necessarily \"unexciting\", it IS drawn out, bland, and riddled with plot holes. Villains are constantly revealed to be mere puppets for an increasingly more powerful villain, and all Naruto has to do to convince them to his way of thinking is talk to them. Rinse and repeat like four or five times. The story also contains way more characters than it can handle, as key characters from early on in the series, like Orochimaru, are simply forgotten in favor of other plot developments. The bigger fights can easily span over 5 episodes, leading to the action being just as slow as the plot progression. Ultimately, the story seems to take its focus off of Naruto and his journey to reach his goal and devolve into a somehow even less interesting Uchiha clan soap opera.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing spectacular but also not totally hideous to look at. The REAL flaw lies in its animation, which fluctuates in quality and shows a lack of care on the animators' part. Everyone knows the notorious Naruto vs Pain fight, one of the most major fights in the series. In an attempt to make the animation look more fluid and polished, the character's faces and bodies are stretched and skewed and basically everything goes to hell. Plus, there's the animators' crippling inability to draw faces or objects that are far away. Some of the filler characters are either intentionally ugly or just lazily drawn, but we're not touching those. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is admittedly pretty impressive. I mean, it's normal to get sick of the opening after the tenth or so time, but some of them really shine. The music is a mix of traditional Japanese instruments and punk rock, and somehow they just mesh so well together. However, I can't particularly choose a favorite track. There are very few that really stand out, but all of them are great. However, I think I have a clear bias towards Shippuden's soundtrack, because it feels grander and more emotional. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10 (this is gonna be a long one)\\n\\n\r\nFor me, THIS is where the series truly fails. As I said before, Naruto has way more characters than its story can handle. Stories with large casts that all have good development is possible, but this is not the case for Naruto. The first problem is that the main characters are significantly less interesting than the side characters could be. Naruto is designed to be a goofy yet charismatic guy who just draws people to him without explanation, but instead comes off as annoying and preachy. He inexplicably converts the worst of villains to his way of thinking, and it comes off as just plain stupid. It's possible to have one character be a moral compass and not have everyone worship them. Then there's Sasuke, who's designed to be a polar opposite to Naruto, but instead comes off as an edgelord. Rounding off the main cast is Sakura, who is supposed to be a strong heroine type but instead comes off a doormat who lets Sasuke toy with her emotions and relies on Naruto to do shit for her.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast is simply bland, but it's the villains I was most disappointed with because of how they were handled. After shaping them up to be generic  bad guys without feeling or remorse, Kishimoto likes to trick you into feeling bad for them by slapping on a tragic backstory, usually shortly before or even after their death. Their backstories almost always involve the death of a loved one driving them to their current state. This is part of Naruto's message about forgiveness, but it still doesn't work as a narrative device. To make a villain sympathetic, you have to humanize them while they're still alive. The other reason Kishimoto fails at writing tragic villains is because their true motives are usually only presented to the audience as opposed to the characters in the story, and so the good guy never questions what they're doing (not that this would have worked anyway). In short, Kishimoto shouldn't have even bothered trying to make most of the villains sympathetic. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, I got bored with this series after all was said and done. Almost the entire cast was underdeveloped, and while the side characters had the most potential, they slowly but inevitably became part of the Naruto circlejerk that encompassed the entire ninja world. The animation tends to fluctuate depending on the animator's budget, and the story is exactly what you would expect from the Big Three: bland, incomplete, and way longer than it needs to be. I should mention that one of Naruto's messages is that previous generations should carve the path for the next generation to take their place. Now that its glory days have long since past, I think Naruto should do the same.",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuden. One of the most hated series that is super popular. Why is it so hated? No real reason to be honest. Atleast that is what I believe. But don't worry I am not calling anyone who hate it 'morons' or whatever i'm just saying I 'think' it should NOT be as hated as it is. Not even CLOSE. I myself though think that episodes 1-110 aren't THAT good but after that is when it starts to become a 10/10 anime.\r\nI will get on to the why. And don't worry I will not make it too long since I think people won't read itall meaning it will all probably go to a big waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nI will not give a summary of the series because you can just read it in the main page or pretty much anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nOK now I'll say why I gave it a 10. (Scored FILLER-FREE).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (for the most part) gets a 10 and the music gets a 10 too (i also believe EVERYONE should give this a 10 music wise). I believe it has the best music ever along with One Piece CLOSELY beating the music of Pokemon, Bleach and Fairy Tail. The story gets incredible as it progresses and so does the level of enjoyment. Naruto and Sakura become better characters than before but Sasuke declines character wise (that's a given though since he does turn into a heartless villain). All the other characters are as awesome as they were from before (I myself only don't like Ino). The akatsuki are the main villains of the series and in my opinion best villains ever (beating Phantom Troupe and Homunculus  by a LITTLE). They have unique special abilities and are VERY fun to watch. And there's Sai, Sasuke's well ... replacement and he is actually not a bad character at all either especially as the story progresses. The action is superb and VERY entertaining and at times you don't know who is going to die (not mentioning names). Sometimes the action is clever too. A lot of strategy is going on in them. So as a result from these things there is too much suspense in it for words. It is unpredictable and VERY suspenseful. They are in such situations at times that you do not know how the problem might get solved.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will counter the negative things it might have/people say it has but some reasons might not be good. \\n\\n\r\nFirst problem people say it has- Some parts are RIP-OFF from hxh (both). I have watched hunter x hunter 2011 (my 2nd favourite anime if anyone is wondering where it goes in my personal rank) but I do not at all think this series is a ripoff of Hunter X. The whole eye deal is similar. But it is not a copy.More like inspiration. a copy is doing it exactly like it was but the eye deal in Naruto has a different twist and special things added to it. Like i'm pretty sure Kishimoto (the author of Naruto) knows that something this big will be noticed. Why did he do it? Because he knows it's no big deal or that it shouldn't be. And I haven't heard the author of hunter x complaining to him either so yeah Naruto is not a copy of hxh at all. And to anybody who mentions the hunter exam and Chuunin exam rewatch both they are VERY different. The concept (again) might have been taken but the actual content is EXTREMELY different. \\n\\n\r\nSecond problem people say it has- FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. Naruto doesn't have too many enjoyable ones but some (Chikara arc for example) are very good (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of Naruto (Shippuden in this case) filler' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip.\\n\\n\r\nThird problem people say it has- the length. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 4 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times).\\n\\n\r\nAnyways I know there might be reasons you will disagree with but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this a 10. Action, suspense, great animation, it is almost perfect (for me). \\n\r\nFinally, I hope you enjoyed the review (took me quite a lot of time to do it) and that you give it a chance (especially from episode 110). Before that it is enjoyable but I find from episode 110 it's MIND-BLOWING.",

            "content": "An incredible work ethic and boundless determination should never be underestimated. \r\nAt first glance, Naruto Shippuuden, the continuation of Naruto, has a few noticeable differences. Firstly, Shippuuden shows its complexity and serious undertone early on in the series, through the obvious change in Naruto\u2019s personality. And secondly, protagonist is easily defined as Naruto, opposed to our duo of Naruto and Sasuke in the previous season.\r\nThe story of Shippuuden is driven through the ploy of the Akatsuki, whom are fixated on capturing the jinchuriki and extracting the tailed beasts within. The canonical plot of Shippuuden is definitely attention grabbing, through the use multiple plot twists andnumerous life or death situations. The non-canon plot however, is not so great. Overused flashbacks, dwelling on insignificant season one plot, and the apparent need to remind us of events that take place no less than a dozen episodes ago gets tiresome, quickly. It\u2019s truly a shame that the amount of filler in Shippuuden is so high, because the canon portion is outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nOnce the storyline unfolds after a few episodes the character cast of Shippuuden presents great depth and variety. Each of the reoccurring Hidden Leaf Village shinobi and kunoichi are developed to a great extent, they each have a unique back story and you\u2019re almost certain to find someone you can relate to, if not, become attached to. The ninja of the other main villages and the antagonists all display distinctive features that allow them to be memorable, be it the untouchable Kazekage, Gaara or the cunning missing-nin Orochimaru.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of artwork in Shippuuden\u2019s canonical differs greatly from the non-canon. It\u2019s painfully obvious that the filler in Shippuuden is of a lower standard than its counterpart. With that being said, in the main storyline, Studio Pierrot has done a great job. Battle animations are fluid and eye-catching, the scenery is vivid and emotions are portrayed outstandingly. \\n\\n\r\nSimply, an outstanding soundtrack, those are the first words that come to mind when I think of Shippuuden. With outstanding openings such as OP3 \u201cBlue Bird\u201d almost welcoming you into an episode with open arms, and endings such as ED12 leaving you begging for more, the soundtrack of Shippuuden is definitely a memorable one. The composer Yasuharu Takanashi incorporates gritty strings, rhythmic percussion, penetrating woodwind instrumentals that captivate the moment, from intense, heart pumping battle music, to calm, vivid emotion evoking melodies, no expense is spared. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shippuuden is an amazing ride if you can either grind your way through the filler, or skip it entirely. The canonical plot more than makes up for the shortcomings presented though out its counterpart. Comedy is used at appropriate times, the action is engaging and the emotions are high. If I\u2019ve learnt anything from this viewing ,it\u2019s that sticking through the bad times with your head held high whilst never lowering your work ethic will rewarded, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely someday, believe it.\\n",

(even though its still simple but cool)\r\nSound: 7 - Good\r\nThe sound was good but sometimes they put weird background music! I can't just believe they see that as a good for the ears! Mostly the sound was good. Openings and Endings are about 90% good.\r\nCharacter: 8 - Very Good\r\nSomehave unique characteristics and others are common. Some are annoying and others are likeable.

One thing that annoys me though, is the never ending fillers (because i really cant wait for the episode to continue). You wouldn't dare missNaruto Shippuden.

I mean, when some ninjas bust in to an evil ninja groups lair, you dont have conversations withthem!!!!! But overall, the shows great! Also, it has one of the best theme songs EVER!!!!

            "content": "I really love this series. Since the first inception of Naruto in 2007 up until now, I have not been disappointed. Naruto, a seemingly trite and boistrous young man who wants to become the next Hokage in the hidden leaf is now fighting to keep his friends and family from harm from the most volatile enemy he can ever face, which is Sasuke Uchiha. A long time classmate until Sasuke's sudden disappearance to join a hidden group of cut throat killers. Naruto now finds himself closer to his nine tailed demon as a partner rather than foe because of his mothers implanted consciousness. With thehelp of her, Naruto nears his goal of attaining the most powerful demon as his own weapon. But he still has a few fights left to overcome the obstacle. However in the middle, are his new friends from the hidden cloud clan. Bee, a man of weird intelligence which he likes to mix with rap in a conversation, helps Naruto beat his Nine tailed fox to such a degree, that the fox has no choice now but to listen. Yet their foe the Akatsuki, still need to acquire the nine tail fox in order to bring back the original demon - The ten tailed fox. All that is left is Naruto's and Bee's demons to make it happen. In the middle is Sasuke who wants nothing more than to destroy the hidden leaf, and with the akatsuki's help, his dream might be realized. Although now, with naruto's new powers of his sage mode and nine tail, sasuke will have even more of a challenge using his own dark evil demon. I think this series is great, to see naruto grow up from series episode to the next until his teen years, to now where he is virtually a full grown man, is enlightening. I have to say that for all the anime's I've watched, the story just keeps getting better and better. I can't wait until the huge final showdown between Sasuke and Naruto. But for now, I want to watch the Naruto Blood Prison movie coming soon. That should be quite the story.",

            "content": "Okay so after seeing so many bashings of the anime i've finally had enough and decided to write my own review.\r\nSTORY:10/10\r\nOkay so the story is the same as the original Naruto series or rather almost the same , because as the characters develop and change so does the plot. And even though everyone complains about how the whole \"Save-my-best-friend-from-the-evil\" is really cliche i have to disagree. The story is so much more than saving Sasuke if you have failed to see that then it's understandible why you don't like the anime. Every character in the anime  and their own story can be made intodifferent animes that's how interesting some of their past and future acts are.There are alot of plot twists and i don't know about you guys but i find the idea to split Naruto into two part , Naruto and Shippuuden as in young and older, is really great. Even though we have this gap of 2.5 years of training ,as the anime progresses further we ,step by step, begin to uderstand just how much the charcaters and their atitutes have changed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:9.7/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about ypu but i personally love the art , true at some point it does get lower in quality but i still like it. The fight scence are done really well ,you know the more inportant fights.Lately as the Kage Summit arc has started  the animation is really smooth and good, too.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are great i don't know just how many of them i have downloaded and i listen to them ,like, everyday.The backround music is fitting too and the voice actors are doing an amazing job so far, too .I can't even imagine what it would be if the VAs change .\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:10/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay this is one of Shippuuden;s strong points, if not the strongest. Every character,almost, has development and if you actually look into them you'll see that Naruto, the main hero,  has one of the littlest developments. We see that Sakura is stronger and she doesn't cry that much she is more independent and she has some feelings for Naruto as well , to what extent is unknown yet. Shikamaru's stories is also one of the best and we get to see just how responsible and genious he is. Sasuke is well.........Sasuke but he has changed alot too [ and i actually started to like him ] His and Itachi's stories is amazing you have to see thaat it's really complicaded and yet sp meaningfull and tragicly beautiful. Gaara has really been opening up to people , he smiles sometimes and he is friendlier and he puts alot of effort to change and act like a normal person.So as you can see most of the characters's backrounds are revealed even the Akatsuki members's and it's done in a really good way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:10/10\\n\\n\r\nNaruto/Shippuuden is one of the best animes I have evr seen , even though i used to not like it so much at one point . The fillers i have nothing to say about, every long anime has fillers so that it won't chatch up to the manga that way there won't be anything to animate.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI love this show mainly 'cuz at first it seems so childish and so smiple but it's actually alot more complicated and wonderful but i guess it's not really for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nP.S I enjoy feedback and sorry for the grammar mistakes :)",

Before this series came out I couldn't wait to see it because of how good the manga is but sadly I realized it's different.  Naruto Shippuuden has got to be one of the most boring animes out.  If you think you're gonna see an action packed anime think again for the characters stare at each other for 15 minutes before anything happens.  By the time the fight starts you're already asleep.

            "content": "Back in high school, I was an avid Naruto fan. I discovered the series when I was 14 years old and binged it all in 2 weeks, and started Shippuuden soon after.  I loved it at first, and revered it during the Pain arc, but soon after I found the show started to decline in quality. And now looking back, I find the show had pretty serious problems throughout its run.\r\nJust to get this out of the way, the egregious amounts of filler amidst very few canon episodes as well as a lot of episodes consisting of 70% flashbacks and 30% actual content isseriously off-putting. \\n\\n\r\nYes, I know Naruto spent his childhood alone on a swing-set; no, I don't have to see that scene for the billionth time. \\n\\n\r\nThese aspects became so unbearable that I (and many of my friends) ended up dropping the show halfway through the Great War arc and just read the manga chapters whenever they would come out. Doing this made me realize how poorly the pacing and execution of that last arc was handled, and when I eventually went back to catch up on what I missed, I wasn't surprised to find these errors hadn't been rectified at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI think there's a common theme to be had in considering the series that is Shippuuden: inconsistency. In almost every aspect here, Naruto excels at some point in time and then fails to deliver otherwise. The series is definitely one of highs and lows, and I think the lows have overwhelmed whatever high points the series ever had.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10. Our first look at the inconsistency of Shippuuden is targeted at how the various arcs vary in quality and immersion. I want to talk about what I consider the highest point and lowest point of the series: the Pain arc and the Great War arc (respectively).\\n\\n\r\nThe Pain arc was a beautifully told story focusing on themes of abandonment, true peace, war, perseverance and acceptance. We saw amazing character development in Naruto: from the loss of his mentor/friend/father-figure to his ability to finally surpass his limitations and become a great ninja, it seems this was what the whole show had been built up to. Furthermore, we had an amazing villain to complement Naruto: Pain. A rather intriguing villain who we can empathize with, Pain and his tragedy really helped build on the themes of the arc. He challenged Naruto, both in physical prowess and personal philosophy, and through it all Naruto was able to learn what he holds dear. All in all, a really great arc; not without its flaws, but still a great story well told. \\n\\n\r\nThen comes the Great War arc, which is 1) too drawn out, 2) ignores character development and replaces it with obscure power-ups, 3) ignores 99% of the interesting cast to focus only on characters with special eye powers and Naruto, 4) has too many villains, each one diluting the significance of the other. \\n\\n\r\nThis arc didn't need Kaguya. Obito and Madara were fine villains on their own, and whatever themes the arc wanted to handle could've been well done using only them. Once Kaguya is introduced, we go into the territory of power creep, bs powerups and no one being able to keep up with the villain unless 1) they're a main character like Naruto, 2) they have special eyes like Sasuke, or 3) they randomly get god powers (i.e. both Naruto and Sasuke). Chakra was such a great power system in the original Naruto that didn't model rather one-dimensional power systems, lie Ki in DBZ. It seems now that chakra unfortunately devolved into becoming glorified Ki.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside, if you watched this arc while it was airing and stuck through it, I'm not sure how you did it. I watched this arc while I was an avid fan of Naruto and ignored every criticism of it, and even then I had to drop it for a time to read the manga before I could eventually get back to watching it. The filler; the flashbacks; the slow pacing: all of these put me off. When an episode is 15 minutes flashback and 5 minutes of actually story progression, the show loses sight of where it wants to go and just becomes something that beats already explored themes and concepts down your throat. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10. Inconsistent once again. Some scenes are downright shoddily drawn and bland. I understand that long running shounen tend to have this problem, and we see it a lot in shows like DBSuper and One Piece, but it still holds that the art leaves something to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does have its moments with some pretty aesthetic character designs and well animated fights. The Pain fight is an example of pretty bad art at times, but amazing animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. The OST for Naruto is pretty freaking great. However, given that the show has around 20 openings and endings (maybe even more, I haven't counted), there have been a fair share of really bad and really good songs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10. After the Pain arc, we see character motivations start to morph into one-dimensional determinations or become outright forgotten. The biggest offender is the Great War arc, which takes away 99% of an interesting cast to focus solely on Naruto and Sasuke and their bs powerups. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, imo, Sasuke is probably the worst written character in the show. I don't want to get into an entire essay on why I think this (because trust me, I could), so I'll just list out some of my points for why I really despise him and the writing that surrounds him and his circumstances.\\n\\n\r\n1) The love relationship between him and Sakura makes no sense. They literally have no chemistry together.\\n\r\n2) Itachi gives up his life to ensure his brother can live in peace, and Sasuke decides to start a war to honor him. Way to respect your brother's wishes. Alright buddy.\\n\r\n3) Dude causes grief to literally every character in the show, then pops up like it's nobody's business during the war and lets it slide that he's going to become Hokage. I actually had to pause because I burst out laughing. Did he really think he'd be taken seriously? \\n\r\n4) His overbearing arrogance borders on stupidity. He attacks a 5 kage summit, ignores advice from others and then cries about the arrogance of the leaders of the hidden leaf who put Itachi through pain. You're not any better, dude.\\n\r\n5) My last point, his undeserved strength and the fact that his relevance to the plot hinges on that alone. Without his eyes, he would be NOTHING. Everything special about him comes from Kishimoto giving him powerup after powerup; atleast in Naruto he had to work for things like Chidori. Now, he can just fire off infinite Chidoris, summon black flames that never go out and eventually conjure up a gigantic Titan made of chakra to dispose of enemies. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10. My enjoyment, as well, was inconsistent: it varied a lot while watching, from downright bored to immensely engaged. I consider the Pain arc the highest point of the series and one of the best arcs in shounen, and that arc alone deserves a 9/10 at the very least. But after that, I'm afraid the show went through a downward spiral and destroyed itself with the final arc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10. \\n\\n\r\n+ Pain arc\\n\r\n+ Everything up to the Pain arc is somewhat interesting\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Show falls into a downward spiral after the Pain arc and crumbles during its final arc\\n\r\n- The diverse and interesting cast is underused in the final arc\\n\r\n- Chakra loses its nuance \\n\r\n- Fights after Pain become a matter of who can stack on more god power + eye powers to win\\n\r\n- Some sub-plots are entirely ignored and never answered in the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you really want to watch Naruto, you might have a better time now that you can skip the filler, but the pacing still leaves something to be desired. At the very least the manga fixes the pacing problem somewhat, but I still find it fails to deliver in terms of story and characters. All in all, the show was a major disappointment.\\n",

But, there is something about this such as on fan-base and applause for this. Many also compare this show to other shows even some from a different genre.

But, this starts a bad view of mere. \\n\\n\r\nAt my school, not a lot of people like anime and some don't even know what it is! Baffling!

The few that know what anime/manga is only know about Naruto, Bleach, and the BIG 3. They are not real anime fans really. \\n\r\nThey are just enthusiastic about anime. \\n\\n\r\nLet is be specific here: \\n\\n\r\nNaruto lacks character development. I don't want to spoil anything; but this has to do with THREE CHARACTERS that appeared in the manga and anime; but introductions for them was bad. \\n\\n\r\nAnd art was fine. \\n\\n\r\nStory was dreadful because with poor character development and there is no other form of intro to us when in lookout for other parts.

            "content": "Before I even start the review, I would like to mention this is based off of the anime only.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nI have to admit Shippuden starts off weak, but gets better once you reach the Hidan and Kakazu Arc which is the 5th anime arc. Then it keeps getting better until the Shinobi War Arc where both the manga and anime go way downhill. I always found Naruto had the best pacing and the most consistent story out of the big three. Even though many fillers, it wasn't until the War Arc where it started to directly affect the canon material and this was due tocanon episodes and filler episodes being mixed together in one arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt 1/10\\n\r\nAt first I defended Shippuden's animation because it was just new, not worse. And it was like that for a long time. Then came the famous fight between Naruto and the final Pein where the animation was just horrendous. Then it got a bit better, but when the 5 Kage Summit Arc started, animation began to go downhill. The point where I stopped defending the animation was the double episode 220 & 221. This double episode was the most inconsistent animated episode I have ever seen. Even if you are an anime only watcher, you could tell canon from filler just based on how the scene was animated. I am serious on this. But that wasn't even the worst yet! And the next example I am going to use may not be either since at this point it is only at episode 321, and unfortunately the animation may get even worse. Anyways the worst animated was episode 298. This was the first episode of a 2 episode fight; the fight Naruto and Killer B vs Itachi and Nagato. Don't get me wrong episode 2 was also bad but this was worse. Not only did the characters look like rag dolls swinging around when they fought, but Itachi didn't even look like Itachi. At least in episode 2 he looked like himself. And BTW these were canon episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI've always like the openings and endings better in Shippuden than in Part One. I guess they are more of my type of music. As for the soundtrack, it was different than Part One, but I enjoyed it just as much. I have always found that the OST's in both Part 1 and 2, were matched perfectly with the scene and the music is just really overly well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nWhy I am giving this such a low score is because all attention is focused on either Naruto or Sasuke and every other character that showed promise in part one, seemed to be instantly dropped from the canon material. At least the fillers gave them a bit of spotlight, but in my opinion it was by no means enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nWhy I am giving this such a low score is because of all the filler that interrupts the series. Now that wouldn't be necessarily a bad thing if the filler was good, but its just really bad; except for the Konoha History Arc which was done well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nFace it, Shippuden just isn't as good as part 1. Maybe if Masashi Kishimoto would have focused on making more characters a part of part two and he paid even a little attention to what goes on in the anime, it might have been decent.",

            "content": "Naruto makes up one of the Big 3. This review shall be for the entirety of Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden and shall contain my opinion of Naruto while trying to be as unbiased as possible. Before anyone asks, yes I have read Naruto entirely, and it was one of my first mangas/anime and I was somebody who thought Naruto was a perfect anime before realizing its fair share of flaws and before watching/reading other animes/mangas.\r\nProgression (6): Naruto is a manga with 700 chapters... 700 CHAPTERS, it is definitely long and of course has some useless arcs which make you wonder what the point of thatarc was. There are also useless conversations that feel repeated between two characters in the show, and there are the past of characters remembered that are often repetitive. However, the fight sequences are done absolutely spectacularly. The hype level while major fights occur are often unreal and are often deserved because the fight scenes are quite good.\\n\\n\r\nStory (4): The story of Naruto is somewhat mediocre to be very brutally honest. It is riddled with Deus Ex Machina writing, so much so that the fans have dubbed the very often Deus Ex Machina writing with a term called \"Plot no Jutsu.\" There are also some plot holes within the show, but I do not find too much fault with the plot holes as any show this long shall probably have at least one plot hole. The themes of Naruto would be good if they were not told from a black and white morality viewpoint in which the victor of the battle was always correct. Also the themes are not depicted very well (as with the case of Neji believing that heritage meant everything, and oddly enough turning out to be correct in the end as we find out who Naruto's father is, even though he concludes that heritage does not matter.) The biggest theme in this show seems to be about friendship, and although it's interesting the first and second time they talk about it, it becomes too repetitive whenever all Naruto says is his answers are his friends. Humor also loses its effect in the story when it's done in the middle of the story which breaks immersion. I wouldn't mind it if it was a slight chuckle, but the fact that they are trying to make you laugh uncontrollably drives you away from the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8): The art is not anything to write home about in Naruto, however the fight scenes are done very well. Very little times have I seen fight scenes in other anime and manga be able to compare to Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): The music in Naruto goes very well at times with what is going on in Naruto. In fact some soundtracks are good enough to be listened to without any accompaniment of the episode, such as \"Sadness and Sorrow.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1): My reviews are always honest, and being honest, I must be brutally honest that the characters in Naruto were AWFUL. The reason why I say this is that although there are interesting characters in the show, they become quite insignificant. My point is this, there are maybe 10 characters that matter in the entirety of Naruto, and everyone else could have never existed and the plot would have been relatively the same. Fan favorite characters such as Rock Lee or Neji become insignificant enough that towards the end of the manga, my brother (who also reads this with me) asked me who Rock Lee and Neji were. The characters that do matter are often cliche and even boring. There is the main character who falls very easily into the shonen mainstream hero archetype, there is the angry child archetype, the girl who has a crush archetype, and the wise teacher archetype.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5): Although the story was not very great and the characters were terrible, at the end of the day the product was still somewhat enjoyable. The main reason why was because of the fight scenes and the fact that you get to see MAGICAL NINJAS FIGHTING. If that isn't an awesome setup for spectacular fight scenes, then I do not know what is. However, the really boring and generic story, the boring characters, and the nothing that often happened in an arc puts this score down quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR?\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\n*The fight sequences are spectacular\\n\r\n*Good soundtrack with the fight scenes\\n\r\n*Chuunin Exam arc has remained up to date one of the best shounen arcs I have seen\\n\r\n*The humor can be funny as a pick-me-up.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n*Terrible Story - Much deus ex machina (plot no jutsu) writing, or writing that feels as though it were made up in the last moment, and there are few plot holes. The plot holes are faulted slightly less by the fact that any story this long will probably have at least one plot hole.\\n\r\n*The length of the story is far too long. It loses much charm and interest after such long periods of time. After a while you lose immersion.\\n\r\n*Much filler (doesn't really apply to the manga or to those who skip filler so it does not have much minus on the review)\\n\r\n*Very cliche characters, and the minor characters who were fan favorites become completely irrelevant to the point where they could be nonexistent and nothing would change.\\n\r\n*Themes are not depicted well, especially with the black-white morality. It feels as though whoever wins the battle has the correct viewpoint which is narrow-minded.\\n\r\n*Plot often feels repetitive, just about everyone has lost somebody close to them in the past and have decided to become the villain because of that.\\n\r\n*The pacing is inconsistent. At times you'll be going down a rollercoaster ride having a character learn much at one time, other times Naruto will be yelling Sasuke's name and looking for him in a fruitless attempt to reconcile.\\n\r\n*The humor can also get in the way of the story. At times, the tone will be feeling more serious, but when comic relief (beyond a chuckle) happens the atmosphere is broken, immersion is lost, and you lost the chance of taking that scene very seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 5.5/10 (Just round it up to 6/10)\\n\\n\r\n***Please keep in mind that this is just a review and a personal opinion. I am just being entirely honest here about what I thought was good and what I thought was bad. This is not a hate review or a love review, and I try my best to be unbiased and write what I truly thought about the show/manga after watching/reading it. If you enjoy/hate this anime/manga, feel free to accept my thoughts on said anime/manga or discard it.",

            "content": "Naruto: Shippuden - what can I say? I used to love this shit. Back in 2007 I would wait for the episodes, coming back from school every Friday to excitedly check whether or not the latest episode had been uploaded and subbed. Unfortunately I no longer find the series nearly as enjoyable as before.\r\nSTORY \r\n I know this might anger all you angry Naruto fanboys out there, but come on guys, where is the story in Naruto: Shippuden? All it's about is our title character, Naruto, trying to bring Sasuke back from the dark side. I admit that Kishimoto isn't as bad as Kubo inthis department (who seems to be making the shit up as he goes along; either that or he likes trolling us (eg: \"Who said the Espada numbers go from 1-10?!?!\" *trollface*) but of course that is an entirely different matter. All I can say is that at least Kishimoto seems to plan a few weeks in advance). I wonder if people ever get bored of Naruto chasing after Sasuke. \\n\\n\r\n\"But no, psyxwar, Naruto isn't just about him chasing after Sasuke!\" I hear you say. Maybe you have a point. It seems that the series is now about the Akatsuki, a criminal organisation, chasing after \"tailed beasts\", beasts of \"chakra\" (that's Naruto terminology for energy, ki, etc) with tails and their plan of world domination. I agree. There seems to be a little variation in events. This is why I have given Naruto: Shippuden a very generous score of \"2\" for Story. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, you, being the passionate, die-hard Naruto fanboy that you are, probably do not accept my reasoning and justification for giving Naruto: Shippuden a \"2\" in the Story department. Fair enough. But shouldn't you put this into perspective? Would you read a book that had a guy chasing another guy as its plot? I know I wouldn't. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Naruto: Shippuden is about a guy chasing another guy\\n\\n\r\nART \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is okay - nothing exceptional, but pretty good nonetheless. There are countless examples of newer animes with better art and more fluid animation, but I won't hold this against Naruto: Shippuden. I've seen far worse in my years as an otaku.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good as well, but again, nothing exceptional. I would usually skip over the same opening after watching it one or two times which usually just means it's \"meh\". There was nothing godly like \"Hare Hare Yukai\" (where I would watch that every. single. time.) \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nThe character development and characters in general admittedly weren't that bad. Naruto definitely develops in skill (and maturity?) a fair bit over the course of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything so I won't really elaborate further on the issue of character development. I'd like to add that despite somewhat \"maturing\", this may simply be superficial as he still chases after Sasuke. He should know by now that he's a goddamn sociopath and wants to kill everyone and destroy his village. The characters are for most part unique with their own personalities. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Meh, it was alright. Nothing exceptional. I feel as if I've wasted hours upon hours watching this shit though. I feel that if I wasn't such a dedicated fanboy in my youth, I would have enjoyed this series a lot less.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT: 4/10\\n\r\n\"PRETTY BAD\"\\n\\n\\n",

Eventually I ran out of time and lost rhythm with the anime. I ended up finishing the manga version though. I already know what happens story wise. This manga is too slow paced and long winded. They could of made this show happen in 250 episodes combined. Both naruto and shippuuden. Instead it became a cash cow and quality suffered. It could be I fell out of love withthis show because perhaps my tastes changed as I got older.  It was one of my favorite shows when I first started watching it. Then when at some point during high school it just didn't attract me, it ended up feeling like a chore rather than an enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nStory wise it started out good, then became way too repetitive and predictable. They drag things out for no reason. Its not like this show will make you think on a deeper level. The plot is basically what you would expect for a shonen anime.

            "content": "Tl;dr: This title is a masterpiece, but with the excessive volume and poor quality of the filler episodes, watching the filler destroys any prolonged enjoyment.\r\nThis show starts out delivering a 10/10 experience right out of the gate. Its a more mature Naruto with some great villains and a story that keeps on delivering. The anime however falls into the \"we don't have enough content\" category and consistently pushes arc after arc of terrible filler that is by far some of the worst of any show. I don't know why the quality drops so much but it just does. \r\nWhen the show is on manga contentit delivers superb animation with great character and scene design, top notch voice acting and music, and an excellent plot with character development. Where I am now with watching the show (roughly episode 415) nearly 30-40% of the show has been filler and the current story line shows 1 or 2 episodes from the manga then goes off on a filler flashback tangent for 10-20 episodes, then back to 1 episode of actual story, then back to another 10 episodes of filler garbage. Specifically right now, we're on our 3rd (maybe 4th) flashback on the same character. I can't stress that enough, we're on the 4th filler line for one specific character and they don't even try to hide that they have 1) no more ideas for original story, and 2)  they've transplanted Naruto's character and personality into the other character's past. \\n\\n\r\nSo basically we're watching Naruto, if Naruto was another character, in the same village. It is a complete degradation of the story back to the original Naruto series before this title grew out of the childish plots and ploys that made that show work, but also makes me never want to return to it again. Awful.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much hope for this pulling any higher than a 6/10 for me at this point. If you had asked me 100 episodes ago if I thought that I would rate this show any less than a 10, I'd tell you that you were out of your mind... I haven't seen a show tank this hard since Bleach.",

            "content": "So it goes like this - Akatsuki a criminal organization of rogue ninjas is on the move to capture all the jinchurikis. Naruto is on the move to bring Sasuke back. Sasuke is on the move to kill his brother Itachi who is an Akatsuki member. Other characters are inconsequential in the eyes of the writer.\r\nThere are a whole lot of problems with this series but the main problem is Naruto himself. Why would he go so far to bring back a dick like Sasuke who does not give a shit about him or any other person. Naruto completely sidesteps his ambition to become ahokage. His new goal is to bring back Sasuke. Why the hell is Sasuke so important? For this series to work Sasuke should have been a real great guy who was loved by and who was a real hero but Sasuke is a self centered dick,piece of shit,asshole. The only persons who care about Sasuke are Naruto and Sakura and it is an established fact that both of them are retarded. So the main problem with me is the motivation of the hero which is completely illogical.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem is the hero itself. Naruto is a weak person. He has had his balls removed. He is a self pitying piece of shit who cries on a drop of a hat , who treats important people like shit and sucks up to Sasuke. It would have been great if the hero had been a guy like Edward Elric because Ed also has a tendency to get emotional and well up but no one can call him a sissy pants.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the most excruciating aspect of the series is its pacing. It just goes on and on and on. It eats up a whole episode to do something which requires merely 5 - 6 mins. There are flashbacks to remind you about what happened five minutes ago and this also happens during action sequences which kills the momentum and intensity which is already lacking.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I am so angry because I think this series had so much more potential. It throws you into a complex and interesting world of ninjas but focuses on the faggots - narusasu. It gives us awesome characters like Kakashi and Ero Sennin and sidesteps them completely. They should have been the heroes. It also treats female characters like shit and portrays them as worthless (Sakura' Ten Ten,Hinata)  ***THAT IS ALL END OF RANT***      \\n",

The only criticism that I can relate to the graphics, which compared to the first series has dropped in quality, not much is clear, however, an improvement was due at least as quality goes the others Anime. The sound, I would say thatthere are not equal, along with Bleach, I think they are the best soundtracks ever made for an anime, there are no words to describe the great and splendid quality of the music that accompany the anime.\\n\r\nThere is everything in Naruto, comedy, drama, spectacular fights, psychology ... I repeat, nothing is missing. For this reason I think it is superior to all other anime of its kind, even when compared to giants like Dragon Ball.\\n\r\nThe last comment: Although perfection does not exist, I put 10 because I saw that the negative votes were the result of the insertion of filler which in effect have created much discussion, I shared it too, but it seems too fall into exasperation, because they are interesting and related to story.\\n\r\nSTORY: The story starts from the drain Sasuke. The protagonist in the meantime has to train to be able to bring home his friend and defend himself against Akatsuki, an organization that wants to capture all the devils with tails, also it is precisely in this series that you discover many secrets, like the story of Uchiha\u2019s clan or Naruto\u2019s parents.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: here are introduced to new characters very well characterized, especially the Akatsuki\u2019s members.\\n\r\nFIGHTS: here fights are a bit longer and made much better than the first series, in some cases are even epic.\\n",

The show begins with Naruto returning to hisvillage , Konohagakure after 3 years of training with the legendary sannin Jiraiya. He looks stronger , taller and more muscular however he has not learn any new jutsu at all even after training for THREE YEARS. The organization , Akatsuki has also began to take action as they are starting to take action as they are slowly kidnapping the Jinchurikis for their plan. A new dark threat lies ahead and also Orochimaru is also planning to make Sasuke his new vessel and Naruto must save him from it before it happens. Now the story is pretty standard and good however the only thing that makes me frustrated is that there are always fillers that makes you think what the hell is this? What is the point of showing this? If only there are no fillers and freaking 10 minute flashbacks that always happen frequently this show would have been definitely less than 400 episodes.However, if you remove all the fillers and flashbacks, you will have a fantastic story which is filled with great action and some of the saddest scenes I have ever seen. Unfortunately the story is overshadowed by huge amount of fillers that is just plain annoying. Don't get me wrong, there were some fillers that were just plain awesome such as the Kakashi anbu arc which is a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7/10\\n\r\nThe art of Naruto Shippuuden is definitely a lot better than its prequel. There were some ups and downs which there were some episodes which the art just looked plain weird but there were some episodes in which the art looked fantastic (Episode 322). Overall the art is average and there is really nothing much to complain or admire about.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Naruto Shippuuden is pretty fantastic. There were some ost that I listen to frequently (Pain's theme). The openings and endings are pretty average as there were some which is so awesome (opening 6 and 16) and there were some that were just plain awful. Overall the soundtrack is pretty decent as there were nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the keypoint and the best part of the show. Each and every character always has enough depth and background which shows you why are they doing this. Naruto Uzumaki has really received so much character development and has grown from a young kid who loves to pull pranks to a strong and dependable adult. The supporting characters are all fantastic and amazing especially Uchiha Itachi and the Fourth Hokage who are both just plain awesome. My only complain about the characters is Sakura Haruno who at first looks like she has become stronger and more independent but as the story progressed, you can see that the author just doesn't give a crap about her and makes her do all the annoying things. Hell the only thing she did was yell either Naruto or Sasuke's name. The fillers character were also just annoying. For example there was this kid who keeps talking about his home which annoyed me to no end. Despite me complaining so much about the characters the characters were really great and it was really entertaining to watch them do the things they do.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 6/10\\n\r\nTo be honest I really enjoyed watching Naruto Shippuuden main story but when it comes to the fillers all my excitement goes down the drain and I just multitask while watching it. For example the current episode is also a filler which seriously pissed me off as they just showed an incredible twist then boom they suddenly show a flashback about a story which I don't give a damn about. Well the show is really enjoyable when it comes to the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7/10\\n\r\nOverall Naruto Shippuuden has its ups and downs. Hell I cried like a baby so many times at some scenes which were incredibly sad. I also had goosebumps at some scenes which were just plain awesome. Naruto Shippuden is definitely a lot more mature and better than it's prequel and best part of all is that people actually die in this anime. Such a pity that the large amount of fillers and flashbacks really drags this show down as if they remove the flashbacks and fillers from the show, I would have given this show a 9/10. I hope you guys enjoyed reading my review!\\n",

OverAll I'd have To say that Shippuuden has to be WAY better then the original Naruto Series, not To Mention More Action Packed. There also Tends To Be less Fillers Then there was in the First Naruto Series, At the Same Time I Believe Even If Most Fillers are completly retarded, that they are Necessarily Because Without Them We Would catch up to the manga, and if we catch up withthe manga, Episodes would be delayed like crazy (Just Like our Friend inuyasha). Think About it We're currently 90 Chapters Behind them, And i'd say about 3-4 chapters are in each episode. That leaves around 30 or Less Weeks. at the same time, If We're going at 3 chapters a week, and they're going at 1 chapter a week, without fillers or DELAYS, We would catch up in almost no time at all!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Despite The Similar Story For Every Filler, i Would Give this Anime an 8 Out Of 10",

            "content": "Note: Review has been suitably edited to match my views on the anime as of present time. Will have spoilers. You've been warned.\r\n-I'm not a native english speaker, there may be some errors. Please accept my apology.-\r\nNaruto or Naruto Shippuuden?\r\nIf I were to compare naruto and naruto shippuuden, somewhere down the line I would still prefer the former. Although I accept naruto shippuden has better fight scenes, the disappointing twists and turns have multiplied considerably too. \r\nCharacters:\r\nNaruto shippuuden has an army of fans for a reason, and one of the biggest reason is this - the characters. Almost all types of people will find atleastone lovable character in this series, not to mention there are so many! In naruto there are no outright good or bad guys. Almost every character is very believable although sometimes they tend to get repetitive (spoiler >> all those \"healed\" by naruto pretty much have the same sob history as him. Gaara, pein..why?)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development:\\n\r\nThe leads:\\n\r\nThe thing I find irritating about the series is that sasuke is hyped too much. (haven't we had enough of mourning for sasuke while the characters grew up?) ..and yet he is nowhere to be seen. I'd prefer if the entire series stops going hush hush about him and actually have him take up proper screen space for once. The \"mystery\" charm is not working anymore, in fact its getting irritating.\\n\r\nIn the recent episodes, naruto's significance has considerably increased which makes me happy because to me it somewhat always felt like naruto as the lead was being sidelined a bit. A character's importance is not entirely calculated by his screen space. He has grown up wonderfully after his recent encounters with akatsuki, and for once something in naruto made me feel all happy like the good ol' naruto series.\\n\r\nSasuke, he seems to be really strong now after training for years under Orochimaru but much can't be said as the anime hasn't progressed so far. The manga is another ball, ofcourse. Although on personal or emotional level (whatever way you like to see it) he still remains the b@st@rd who will not even twitch for a split second before tossing naruto's feelings aside; who along with sakura is still ever so determined to bring him back home. Such level of coldness for someone who loves and cares for you so much is not \"cool\", its outright irritating.\\n\r\nThe third and probably the most criticised one, sakura, is a complete contrast from her old days now. While the heartache of losing sasuke is still there, she's become a gem of a medical ninja AND has the much in/famous montrous strength inherited from Tsunade; which is impressive. I don't mind if she's not in the war zone fighting, as long as she is good in what she's doing which she is, so even though I didn't like sakura initially; I do not completely agree to her being criticized now. I just hope they give her more significant role to play. Also, her relation with naruto has developed considerably and in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe side sicks:\\n\r\nspoiler >>One thing I find really irritating with this series is that every character you start liking meets an unexpected end, and not in a good way. Sasuke is TEH GOD, naruto is the broken hearted kid in distress and sakura..well she still exists. Not that I have any grudge against sasuke, infact he used to be one of my favourites in naruto series; but I think there are far too many good characters with great potential in the series that are majorly sidelined while sasuke is being hyped to the level that it left some fans irritated. (Again I must go back to the point that if he is so important then don't have almost 100 episodes with pretty much no screen presence of him at all! Talk less and show more is what I want to say, and minus the army of fangirls if at all possible.)\\n\\n\r\nAkatsuki: SPOILERZZZZZZ!!\\n\r\nWhat excited me most about naruto shippuudin is akatsuki. What excited me most about the entire naruto universe ever since I came to know something like akatsuki existed is AKATSUKI. When they were finally introduced, I was nearly ready to shed tears of joy. I guess that was one of the very rare fangirlish moment I had in my life as an otaku. But the way it happened made my jaw fall on the floor. With disappointment, that is. They make an awesome character like hidan, and he pretty much (almost) dies with not even one \"proper\" fight. It left me utterly frustated. And I just couldn't understand someone like kakuzu who survived a fight the great you-know-who got his ass handed to him just like that by naruto. Okay, naruto got stronger and all that but still, the transition was a bit too sudden for me to believe. As for sasori I really can't complain because what happened was no surprise (and one thing .. please he did not get owned by sakura. I find it so hard to believe why people keep forgetting that someone who actually knew so much about him was there too!! Defeat was only natural).. but I'd have been really happy if he had made a come back or something. Whatever, illogical demands.. heh.\\n\\n\r\nAnime progress:\\n\r\nAnother blooper is the progress of anime. With animes where anime and manga have become quite close, frequent fillers are acceptable and NEEDED. But naruto manga is like..zillion light years away from the anime then what is the need of such slow progress? I dropped naruto at ep 100 due to its slow progress and temporarily switched to other animes. Once it gains its pace, being a narutard I'm; I'll most likely be lured into watching naruto again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nSomething is wrong with naruto's quality, its not just the same anymore. The anatomy sometimes is horribly wrong .. to the point that you're able to notice it even when something really interesting is going on. The jumping from trees to trees scenes almost always look like people are flying, and some things just don't make sense anymore. Considering that the anime takes its own sweet time in progressing compared to manga, this type of quality is a major setback to fans but if you're a narutard fear not. You'll pretty much still be glued to this anime no matter how bad it gets.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm one of those people who don't get bothered a lot by sound unless its so off to the point that its ruining the scene so I pretty much find the sounds okay. The openings and ending except one or two aren't all that great compared to other animes but still fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest setback.. fansub: This is not important and perhaps not related.. but while I'm at it why not cover this too?\\n\r\nWe all know dattebayo, if you don't then you probably don't watch naruto and shouldn't be reading this review because its full of spoilers. Anyway, the biggest setback came to me when crunchyroll took up naruto leading dattebayo to drop it. My source of watching HQ naruto was lost because DB won't sub it, crunchyroll won't air it for our country because its licensed here and I won't get to see it because for whatever xyz reasons CR doesn't know, NARUTO IS NOT ON SALE HERE! Shipping from abroad costs more than the actual anime, which is obviously not an option.  And its not just me, a huge chuck of anime fans in my country stopped watching naruto for the same reason after DB dropped it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I think naruto shippuuden is a good anime with outstanding characters, but not-so-good priorities and balance between characters. Neverthless, it still deserves at least one time watch. Its one of the most popular anime of today's time, reviews only matter upto a limit.. don't they?",

            "content": "How do I even sum up this series? How can I review something so special to me? Still, it must be done, so let me tell you why Naruto is a series you can't leave on your PTW list. \r\nLet's start with the basics: sound and art. Naruto (especially Shippuuden) has one of the best soundtracks in anime. Not only with its openings and endings, but its OST songs fit the anime and its tone better than any other anime I've seen. The art is GORGEOUS. Again, especially in Shippuuden because it's more recent compared to the older animation of the original Naruto series. Thelighting effects and bright colors make every scene entrancing. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know whether to talk about the story or the characters next because both are as high quality as high quality can be, but I'll start with the characters. You can't FIND development like this anywhere else. For one thing, each character is indisputably unique, and it's nice to watch an anime in which you can find a piece of yourself in every character. Also, each of their stories-- heroes and villains alike-- was developed with such care that you can't help but be interested. More than both of those things, though, the sheer power that these characters hold is what really makes them remarkable. Not physical power (though, that type of power gets developed really nicely and realistically throughout the series as well), but mental power. These characters are written with goals and convictions that bring them to life in a way that will capture your heart. You'll become addicted to the characters simply because they give everything all they've got.\\n\\n\r\nNow, finally, we come to the story. This is going to be hard to talk about without getting detailed, so I'll keep it as brief as I can by saying this: this story is special. It isn't always unpredictable, and things don't always end happily, but the journey you'll take is-- dare I say-- one of the best you'll ever take. The care that was put into developing this story so that it had the most impact it could have must have been immense. This very well might be the only story I've ever experienced in which I didn't want to skip ahead to see the ending at some point. Every part of the story was important and made me feel so lucky to have found a story like it; I wanted to savor it as long as I could. The story itself is an art piece. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of that was my emotions reviewing the anime and not actual critiques, but isn't that more convincing? Naruto has become so special to me, and I'm really, really glad that I got past my assumptions about it beforehand and took the plunge to watch it. I don't think I'll ever find something quite like this again-- and that's why it's so beautiful. Please watch this if you're even a little curious because it'll change your life, I promise you. \\n\\n\r\n\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3001\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8.",

            "content": "Covering the 2nd half of Naruto manga, Shippuden adapts the teenaged years of the titular character. I wanna start this review by admitting that I am quite thankful there were people who managed to really enjoy the full road Shippuden brings. It's a long one, 500 episodes counting filler and around 300 even if you aren't. It took me 5 months to get through all the material skipping everything filler related. Now, it's actually been quite a while since I finished Shippuden (finished it last November) but I feel with a clearer head now's a better time than ever to go over everything with theseries.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed very little of Naruto Shippuden.\\n\\n\r\nTo start with, Naruto is... Well, not a very fun protagonist to say the least. He starts off the series seeming at least a little more mature and less annoying than his original counterpart but as the series goes on his character takes a complete nosedive and it was hard for me to really enjoy him as a character by the end. His obsession with getting Sasuke back (who at the end of Naruto abandoned the Hidden Leaf to join that series' big bad in a move that would've potentially ended with his death), while understandable, feels completely unbelievable and unjustified. I feel this could've been corrected by exploring both characters similarities (which happens... 470 episodes in...) But for the majority of the series the goal of bringing back Sasuke feels so hard to care about. Another one of the main characters I enjoyed very little of was Sakura. Sakura is actually just not good. Her character in the previous series, while annoying and mostly unlikable, made sense. She was the most realistic of the cast, reacting to events how an actual 12 year old girl would in the events. Her treatment of Naruto and obsession over Sasuke back then felt understandable and it led me not to really dislike her much.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Shippuden Sakura.\\n\\n\r\nShe starts off fairly well with some new abilities (becoming stronger plus learning to heal from Tsunade). However this only lasts for one story arc as by the second story arc she's reverted back to her old ways fairly quickly, rarely amounting to much in the story. She gets one cool moment towards the end of the Ninja World War when Team 7 reunities but not only is the scene poorly built up, aside from landing a good blow to the final villain she doesn't do too much. As a character her interactions with Naruto are dreadful. Really amounting to nothing more than Sakura deriding Naruto for being stupid, praising him for managing to do things despite that or maybe sometimes a little bit of hero worship. However she hits her absolute lowest as a character anytime something involves Sasuke. Her little childhood crush never goes away and while it doesn't seem to bad, the 5 Kage Summit arc is just... Well lemme explain.\\n\\n\r\nOnce Sasuke is officially labeled a rouge ninja which means he must be eradicated, the majority of the original Genin kids (Sans Naruto and of course Sasuke) decide that'll it'll be up to them to take care of Sasuke. Sakura however decides to fight him on her own. I didn't mind this because it shows a small semblance of character development. However she struggles to do so due to still being in love with him and honestly she is unable to hold a candle to a weaker Sasuke (having just killed a man after all). I find it very disappointing and really dumb of Sakura. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the cast of characters in this series is VERY expansive but good luck seeing them on screen at all. Older characters that could use development or could be used in new arcs end up getting replaced with new characters who serve on simple purpose and then usually get put on a bus and forgotten anyways. Heya Sai, Taka members. The one exception to this is Shikamaru, the only member of the original Konoha 12 that isn't Naruto or Sasuke who continues to develop. He actually gets his own story arc, the first story arc in the anime to actually be above \"meh\" level. In fact, I'd say it's pretty damn good. Otherwise, the cast of characters is mostly dreadful in this arc. However I will admit: even many months later Shippuden has some great villains. Wasn't big on Orochimaru in the original series, so the amount of good villains actually surprised me. Whether they be mini-bosses like Hidan, Kakazu, that one guy who flies on a clay bird and uses explosives (forgot his name my bad) or Itachi. The bigger bads are definitely some of the best though. Pain and Obito are still my two favorite anime antagonists. Kinda surprising considering my thoughts on the rest of the series so far...\\n\\n\r\nThough to be honest I still don't like Madara. He's not really bad, just very basic imo.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, what about the story.\\n\r\n*Large exhale*\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't bad when it starts off if I'm gonna be honest, but they aren't really all that great either. I felt very little reason to care about the story, a thing which I blame on it's characters. It's not until a major character dies around 70 episodes in where I actually found myself getting invested in the series. Episode 81 (The Episode titled \"Team 10\" is one of the most well directed anime episodes I believe. From there on the series begins to start getting back to original Naruto levels of decent. Sasuke's fight with Itachi, the reveal of Pain, many major plot events all culminating in \"The Pain Invasion\" as Naruto becomes the last objective of the Akatsuki's hit list. While overall the arc tends to become quite frustrating (One notable thing being that Naruto isn't around for most of the invasion, training in another dimension, which is something that could actually work in the other characters advantage as Naruto's capture would mean the end of the world. However Tsunade objects, wanting Naruto to be apart of the fight which is a bad idea in every way knowing how more experienced fighters lost to Pain and Naruto is a 16 year old). However the fight between Naruto and Pain makes up for it. A battle between two different ideas of peace with some amazing animation and Naruto's subsequent breakdown towards the end I'd quite heartbreaking. However, at the very end Naruto simply talks Pain out of his evil ways turning him good. While this is a fairly common Naruto story element and on that I defend in fact, it was poorly implimented and was the beginning of the final downfall of Shippuden. I could go on about the Fourth Great Ninja War arc but it's fairly lengthy (About 2/3's of the whole anime) and so a rant would probably be quite long. Overall the plot sets itself up as interesting but nothing interesting actually happens. I found more often the not I'd either be anticipating a singular event that was to take place in the story, or just straight up anticipating the arcs ending. \\n\\n\r\nCan I also talk about the series' animation? The art design becomes a lot softer and more exaggerated as the series continues, which I appreciate. However for the most part the characters look and move stiffly no matter where the series is. Every now and then the series gets its best animators on a single episode (mostly fights with spectacular results see Sakura vs Sasori, Sasuke vs Deidara and Naruto vs Sasuke) but this is only 5% of a 500 episode anime. The show looks DREADFUL through and throughout \\n\\n\r\nI can say though: Its soundtrack is phenomenal. Probably my favorite or second favorite soundtrack. It's a little weak at the start but by the end of the ninja world war it really hits its peak. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly what can I say about Shippuden. It really hurt to get through and unless there's some sort of Shippuden Kai, I'm never watching this series again.\\n\\n\r\nOh, but one thing before I finish this review. Don't forget how the series tore down it's whole heartwarming idea that hard work will pay off. Naruto, who was always played up as the underdog who came from nothing, turned out to be not only the chosen one, but was also related the VARIOUS strong individuals from the past (1st Hokages wife is his ancestor. Son of the 4th Hokage. Reincarnation of ninja Jesus etc).\\n\\n\r\n*Sigh*\\n\\n\r\nWhy Kishimoto... Why...",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nIt's OVER! Sweet Jesus it's finally over! This series had some cool characters, great music, excellent animation, and yet ended up very mediocre from the astonishing level of shark jumping bullshit! I found myself imitating a famous scene from MS3TK and simply shouting EEEENNDDD! EEEENNNNNDDDD! At the screen over and over again!\r\nwarning! Major spoilers!\r\nPlot: 6/10\r\nThe plot started out fairly strong, created a unique and fun world, and provided us with years of light hearted adventure that casual fans and even seasoned otaku (although most won't admit it) were able to enjoy. Unfortunately, Kishimoto wasn't able to pick a single villain and develop him or herinto a truly great shonen antagonist. He just kept stretching out the story with villain A is just a sad sob manipulated by villain B, who is controlled by villain C, who is ruled by villain D. It became more and more absurd with every arc of the story! This was combined with more random \"heel turns\" and pointless \"face turns\" than a season of WCW wrestling. That is exactly what the character development reminded me of. Sasuke is gonna be a bad guy this week, then randomly be a good guy, wait, now he's bad again, nope lets end with him being good. Fucking Orochimaru got a face turn and chance to be a good guy! WHY!? He was the only decent, nasty villain Kishimoto ever created! Who in the FUCK wanted him to turn good?! It makes no God damn sense! Finally, Kishimoto ends the series with the absolutely POINTLESS antagonist Kaguya, who is never given any character development and simply comes out of nowhere to be the big bad guy behind everything. Kaguya is like Ultimecia from Final Fantasy 8, the bad guy that was controlling everything all along, but we don't feel anything when she dies because she was introduced so late in the story and we know so little about her that it destroys any chance of her being an effective villain. The difference is that Final Fantasy 8 had to be made on a tight schedule and rushed development can be blamed for a rushed ending. Kishimoto had over 10 years and absolutely no fucking excuse for this last minute BULLSHIT!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden had a very wide cast of characters and pretty much everyone will find a couple of characters that they like. Unfortunately, most of the best characters were given little screen time and some of the most obnoxious characters were given WAY too much. Naruto is the main character, yet I would argue he is one of the worst characters in the whole series. He is a purely generic shonen protagonist that doesn't really have any unique or interesting character traits. We have seen the plucky young fighter who never gives up and always triumphs over evil. His name was Son Goku. Sakura got more \"time in the sun\" in Shippuuden, but never really became a likeable character. Sasuke was annoying as all hell and I just wanted Itachi to pimp slap him! The most interesting characters in my opinion were: Itachi, Gaara, Hinata, and Deidara. None of whom have enough screen time! At least Itachi got brought back briefly in the end to be a badass once again and Gaara was given some time to shine. Deidara was easily the funniest character and perfectly captured the snooty, \"art for art's sake\" kind of writer/painter. He left us too soon. Deidara will return in a new anime by \"nose towards the sky productions\" \"Tatami Galaxy 2: Fuck you casuals, this is ART!\" God I wish that would happen! Hinata was easily the most relateable character and captured the social awkwardness and nervousness that many otaku feel in daily life. Her progress towards becoming a stronger and more assertive person was one of the highlights of the entire series. Also unlike Shinji I didn't want to punch her in the face every 5 seconds! I admit this theme and character type has been done in anime before and has been done better, notably \"Welcome to the NHK\", but still she was a lot better written than most of the character roster. At least Naru/hina won out over Naru/Saku! My ship won! Fuck you team Sakura!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art throughout Shippuuden was kept to a pretty high quality and we rarely had the piss poor animation and loops of the Sasuka Retrieval Arc and some of the other story arcs from the first Naruto series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can hate Naruto all you want, but the soundtrack was genuinely not bad. It isn't AMAZING like the Bebop soundtrack or anything, but it was honestly pretty good in my opinion. (raises flame shield against elitist attack).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe more this series stretched on, the more of a pain in the ass it was to read and watch. I took a long break, but finally came back and finished the manga. The anime technically hasn't finished yet, but it should wrap up in a few months.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the final judgment of Naruto. Naruto....was ok. It wasn't a great series, it wasn't a very well executed series, but it wasn't terrible like so many critics today claim. It badly squandered its potential, jumped the shark 8 dozen times, and really went down hill in the last few arcs, but I couldn't really say the series sucked overall. It was just...meh, but with good art, sound, and budget to lift it above a 5 and to the land of 6/10. For me, this means that it is just slightly above average, since my average rating for the roughly 200 series I have seen is a 5.3.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Half of an entire season is fillers that are irrelevant to the main story. I watch this anime to see the great action and story following Naruto and his friends. Not some imagined on the spot character that brings up a over-dramatic life. \r\nThey take more \"breaks\" than they make episodes. \r\nJust recently they cameback to the main story after a few months of fillers i have no interest in but just after that one main episode they decide to take a few weeks for a break, then they did it again.. and again.. and again.\\n\r\nI use to see stores with anime fan toys and souvenirs, They prohibited all their merchandise and decided to monopolize it at a overpriced retail.\\n\\n\r\nI wish some other company would take over naruto and bring out its full potential instead of soliciting ratings from millions of students and swimming in their pools of yen.",

            "content": "Alright, Naruto Shippuuden itself is badass. You just can't help but to love certain characters, the action is great and the emotion is there but most of the times you either won't care or you won't even notice. The music in the anime is fantastic and really gives that ninja/shinobi feel, especially due to iconic Japanese instruments such as the shamisen. Some tracks may be overused a bit, but it's not bothering in general. It just makes certain moments predictable.\r\nAlthough I love the story, I can't stand the fillers and flashbacks. They use flashbacks and fillers on the most inappropriate moments. \r\nLet me give youan example: In the middle of the final battle they will throw 12 fillers in your face.  After that they continue with the final battle for one episode, and while a character's performing a major act for the story.. he decides to have a flashback, continued with another flashback episode. Seriously, it's ridiculous. It totally ruins the atmosphere, excitement and enjoyment. They also repeat a lot of scenes from flashbacks, heck I wouldn't be surprised if some episodes are the exact same, but with the scenes in another order.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why I rate Naruto Shippuuden a 6 overall. I find myself saying \"AH NO\" way too often on the first frame of the \"Next time on Naruto Shippuuden!\" at the end of every episode, which isn't a good sign. Will they make it better with the episodes to come? Time will tell.",

And of course with so much time you can tell so much but this also means that the franchise targeted a few stages of teenage years to create something bigger than the story itself by adding theelement of time to the viewing experience. Some people will call it undeserved hype, but they also probably masturbate to stuff like Aoi Bungaku, Steins:Gate or animes that did not get a second season but oh boy was it going somewhere. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is timeless, Naruto and Miyazaki are immortal and if we would be fair enough to only grant access at an hypothetical bar in upscale London to animes that were able to obtain such status, the bar would never be short on staff.\\n\\n\r\nHaku should of gotten more screen time, Jiraiya's death was needed but very dramatic, sasuke is ultimately kind of a douche, sakura should of been stronger and knowing that there is traffic on narutopedia is somewhat cool.",

But because Naruto series probably will be end soon, I hope to see some Boruto series too, hehe :3 \r\nThe only problem (and some can agree with me) are the fillers arc/episode I have to say that I prefer when animeis linked to the manga.. But the fillers are also  good because they tell us more about characters and show us some things that happen before. I also think that also characters from Naruto taugh us some important things in life.. for example Naruto himself has proven not to  give up on our dreams because if we work hard and won't lose the hope, our dream can come true. \\n\r\nI am happy that I could watch Naruto from being an clumsly ninja, turning into a hero and hokage \u2665  \\n",

I was a fan of Naruto (the prequel to Shippuden) and I really enjoyed it.... but trying to finish this show was as fun as watching seniors play checkers. SERIOUSLY.\r\nStory: Ehhh it was same old Naruto plots and stories. Easily predictable and boring.  Some friend is in a pickle and Naruto goes all emotional to save him even if he met that that guy 2 minutes ago, because he wants to be hokage. Yawn. I saw enough of that in Naruto. Basically, if you watched Naruto and liked it, think of it as the samething... minus the excitement.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was no eye popper, but it surely was no total trash. The action and fighting scenes are still eye candy for actionholics, but other than that, it pretty much is what you'd call standard Naruto animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is possibly the best part of Naruto Shippuden. The OPs are still great, expected from Naruto, and the endings weren't that shabby either... Shooting Star (the first ending) grew to be one of my most favorite endings of all time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All the characters show some development... but in an easily predictable way. Naruto ends up a BIT mature, Sakura grows ladylike... at least for her, and Sasuke grows to be more of a bastard than in Naruto. Some new faces pop up now and then... but they are as memorable as the dust in your belly button.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Now this is where the opinions get diverse. Some Narutoholics will say this is that best thing since Spam and some will say that they watch this show at night just to go to sleep. I'm no Narutoholic so I'd say that the enjoyment for this show is just horrible, but it will be a way for you to waste time if you can get through all the predictable plotlines. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Naruto Shippuden could be, should be, and WILL BE a huge disappointment for Naruto fans who enjoyed the show out of pure action enjoyment. But of course they say that 60% of Naruto watchers end up dying their hair yellow out of love for this show, so it all depends on how you look at Naruto. But overall, Naruto Shippuden isn't something you'd go crazy for. Take my word for it. \\n\r\nOverall: \\n",

            "content": "I've been watching Naruto for a very long time. I've read the entire Manga and completed Naruto (Part 1) I've also seen a few of the movies and all the ova's and specials. \r\nThe story is utter garbage. It's dragged out and supplemented with horribly written filler arcs. The pacing is painfully slow and unnecessary. The battles are relatively interesting but there is too much needless talk and deliberation. \r\nThe art/animation is inconsistent and changes from episode to episode. It's usually very poorly done and while this might be good for saving money and time. Naruto is one of the most heavily marketed Anime inthe world, it should have enough funds to pay for decent Animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the best thing about this series. My personal favourites being Madara, Sasuke, Itachi, Orochimaru, Naruto, Kakashi, Hinata and Jiraiya. These characters are pretty deep and deal with their own struggles. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good. Good OP and ED's.\\n\\n\r\nIt's enjoyable to watch but people need to stop rating it so highly. It's not a masterpiece, it's not perfect and it's pretty damn overrated but it does provide me with lots of entertainment and I'm still watching after 399 episodes... I like this series but lets not pretend its as great as the classics. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nArt - 5\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7 \\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I just want to start this review by saying that I love this series and I have my reasons, and while I will try to be as objective as possible, I am a fan (this should be known). \r\nStory: One of the benefits of such a long story like Naruto is that it truly feels epic. When you finish the series, you feel like you have been through it all with these characters. The story is character-driven as you see our main protagonist, Naruto, and the difficult journey that he experiences throughout his life. This series is quite a bit darker than the original andvery mature. This works in this series benefit as its a seriousness that is needed for many of the key moments in the show. It spans through various story arcs that will always have there fair share of intense and \"edge of your seat\" moments. I want to note that there are many times where you will find yourself freaking out due to a particular storyline or amazing moment. \\n\\n\r\nArt: This is my lowest grade as the animation can be all over the place. However when it really counts, this series knocks it out of the park with its animation. Some important episodes in the story will literally look like series of high-quality desktop wallpapers flashing in front of your face (no joke, it looks that good sometimes). The fight scenes in this show are probably among the very best anime has to offer. They are visual spectacles and fights with key villains are a whole other level of amazing. It can look slightly weird at times but nothing that will stop you from watching the show or lessen your enjoyment of what you are watching. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The openings and endings are all incredible in their own right, with a wide span of music genres (rock songs to love songs). Some soundtracks like Konoha Peace and Experienced Many Battles will literally invigorate you with so much emotion (its crazy). I will say that not all the tracks are perfect but they do their job. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I can't even describe how good the characters are in Naruto because you just have to see for yourself. I think you can attribute this to how good the Chunin Exam arch was in the original Naruto, but in this series they are just more fleshed out and deepened. You will literally see characters that you may hate at first but end up loving a couple episodes later. The main character, Naruto, is extremely well done and you can't help but like him. The other main character, Sasuke, is equally well-written. The rivalry between the two characters is really something that this series nailed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This review really can't do this show justice or express my love for the series as a whole. There is a reason Naruto is as popular as it is, and its because it has touched so many people around the world. While there were some bumps along the way, it was worth it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10-One of the best anime created",

            "content": "It's 2 and a half years since Naruto left to train with the Legendary Sanin Juraiya. You'd expect him to be bad*** right? Guess again. Naruto is still the goofy little kid who still gets his *** handed to him in every fight. What exactly has he learned? No new jutsu to be sure, just learning to control his Kyuuba. That sounds cool but it's really not. This lies a problem with character growth.  It's nonexistant in shippuuden until around episode 50 (avoiding spoilers). Naruto still wants to find Sasuke. Guess what? SASUKE WILL NVR COME BACK, GET THAT THROUGH YOU'RE THICK SKULL!!!!!\r\nAnother problemis the story. Shippy progresses too slowly. Half an episode is just talking, the other half is the slow fighting. It will literally take 5 minutes just for someone to punch the other guy. And the flashbacks are just silly. Why do I need a flashback for something that happened 5 minutes ago? This has happened quite a few times. The character designs aren't bad except Ino's. She looks like a Britney Spears wannabe and who'd wanna be her?\\n\\n\r\nI gave Naruto shippuuden a 7, but my review makes me sound like I hate it which is not true. Shippuuden actually has a deep story. If it progressed fast it'd be epic. More about the Akatsuki's goals are revealed and when a fight actually occurs it can become an awsome fight.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuuden also has a different animation style to it that I enjoy. It sets the mood for a dark and deep story which I enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 7 because when something good happens it becomes REALLY awsome. The story pacing just keeps it from it's true potential.",

            "content": "Contrary to the opinion of a big number of fans I believe that Naruto Shippuden was better than original series. The story may not have foreshadowing like One Piece or symbolism like the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter X Hunter but it is still amazing and in my opinion it has the best fights. Every big battle contains a high level of intensity, strategy and creativity and that includes the final arc which everybody criticizes without realizing that even after the power level of the characters grew, they are still using their heads.\r\nMy favourite part about thestory is that unlike other anime/manga from the battle Shounen category, Naruto Shippuden features the adventures of two main characters, Naruto and Sasuke, as they reach closer to the final stage they will share. Basically it's like watching two different anime at the same time. The main theme of the story is pain and how can we reach to understand each other by understanding each others pain. Besides that the arcs which show us the events from the past and how the world reached to be like this feel just like a history book, not a boring one from school, but one full of action which keeps surprising you till the end.\\n\r\n         Some people will most likely say that this anime is not worth watching because of the huge number of fillers which are not even as good as the ones that other big Shounen have. Even though this review is supposed to be about Shippuden I feel responsible to say that the fillers from the original series are awesome. The first anime material I have watched and what convinced me to watch anime in the first place were those fillers. Some of them were just as funny as Gintama and One Piece and it would be a waste to skip them. As for the fillers from Shippuden I must admit that they are not that great, but I still liked them because they gave some characters the screen time that they deserved. And I don' know if naming some arcs is considered spoiler (hope not), but the fillers which show us Kakashis and Itachis pasts are so well made that I consider them canon. And the filler arc about Naruto and a few other characters travelling with a boat in order to reach an island from the land of lightning(an event which is canon) was again extremly funny. And if you are that stubborn that you don't even wanna give those fillers a chance you can just skip and you will still have more than 200 episodes to watch, after all there are people who would say that even 70 episodes is too much.\\n\r\n         The artstyle used by Masashi Kishimoto is one of my favourites and the only part which is not perfect about it is the pretty plain hair. As for the animation, it may not be Madhouse level, but that doesn't make the anime less enjoyable. The soundtrack is also amazing being able to bring every emotion from sadness and despair to anger and excitement to its peak.\\n\r\n          Unfortunatly some of the main characters have not received enough development, but there are also lots of characters with such great backstories, roles, and well developed personalities that I can honestly call them some of the best characters ever created in the history of anime and manga. Even the less developed characters have matured after the timeskip and evolved without loosing their personalities. \\n\r\n         In coclusion Naruto Shippuden is a great anime which I highly recommend to not only the Shounen lovers, but also to the other kinds of fans and it still remains my favourite after watching over 60 different anime from all the genres.",

The many character's in the story also add to the excitement of the story and each character's various back story's are well potrayed and conveyed as the stroy continues.\r\nAnd well i personally love this anime because this anime really did teach me a lot, from when i was very young andit still continues to do a fine job at it.",

            "content": "I was skeptical at first with Naruto Shippuden because shonen anime has a terrible reputation for being too long, drawn-out, and humorless. But now, after watching the series, I think that Naruto Shippuden deserves all the praise that it gets. \r\nFollowing the sequel to the original Naruto, Naruto Shippuden follows the story of our favorite hyperactive knucklehead ninja, Naruto Uzumaki. Only, this time, Naruto and his friends are teenagers. This anime can be divided into 2 main arcs, the Akatsuki arc, and The Fourth Great Ninja War arc. \r\nThe Akatsuki arc is the superior of the 2 arcs listed above. Back in Naruto, we wereintroduced to a criminal organization with unknown motives. In Naruto Shippuden, Naruto and his friends will fight all the Akatsuki members. The Akatsuki is undoubtedly one of the best evil anime organizations ever. Each character is so unique and has their own little unique quirk. \\n\\n\r\nThe Fourth Great Ninja War is arguably the decline of the Naruto series. Retcons, power escalation, and insane amounts of fillers contribute to The Fourth Great Ninja War's flaws. But even after all that, The Fourth Great Ninja War is still in my opinion, decent. It expanded the lore of the Naruto series and tied all loose ends of the narrative. The Fourth Great Ninja War was also filled with suspense, thrill, and mystery. The fights scenes are also ones to behold, there were so many fantastic fights scenes in The Fourth Great Ninja War. Some people say that this arc will Naruto's downfall, while others loved it for the fantastic fight scenes. Really, my largest complaint about The Fourth Great Ninja War was the finale. \\n\\n\r\nPeople gripe about the amount of fillers in Naruto Shippuden, but I think that is unjustified. Now that the show is finished, you can just skip the fillers. And I highly advise you do.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding, like most shonen animes. It is one of the better drawn shonen animes, although definitely not the best. I think it is better than One Piece's art but worse than Fairy Tail, Dragon Ball, and Bleach.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Naruto Shippuden is outstanding. It has one of the best soundtrack I have ever had the privilege to listen too. Its soundtrack is up there with Fairy Tail and Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of character development in Naruto Shippuden is amazing. My only gripe about it is that some of the amazing side characters that were hyped in part one get sidelined. Characters like Neji, Gaara, and Rock Lee had so much more potential. The main character's developments are one of the best in shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nI immensely enjoyed Naruto Shippuden and I would recommend it to everyone.\\n\\n\\n",

I got so excited as I thought this was gonna be so awesome. Like the be all to end all clash of epicness. The first two arcs were pretty damn good I'll give that. There were some tearful moments when a few of you're favorite characters were seen dying. I thought that was a good way to really get you hooked. But by the end of it Naruto Shippuuden felt like such an after thought. \r\nNow for me the originalanime got so many things right. The character development was big for some of the characters, The action was enjoyable and of course it really kept you excited for things. My only real complaints were that the filler lasted forever sometimes and it felt like it was taking too much inspiration from a lot of anime. As they were targeting the right audience for both kids and adults. It had just enough humor and serious action for all the fans.\\n\\n\r\nBut let me get to why Shippuden basically fails on some degree. The first point is that Naruto himself seriously lacks character development. I mean sure he does learn a new jutsu here and there. But he lacks his own sense of humor compared to the original series. It's also very hard to feel for him most of the time. The only time I ever really felt any sympathy for Naruto was when someone special to him died. I'm not going to spoil any of the big moments as if you are curious you can check it out for yourself. The rest of the other character development is take it or leave it. You'll have to decide for yourself which characters you love the most.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline this time around is nothing to write home about. While I will give it something for trying to connect everything more. Also the fact that it tries to be very mature in some parts. Though its something I can't get into in general. The fights are also really awesome to some degree. It has a lot of amazing moments and it was really good. But I seriously began to lose interest after some filler arcs and when I was two or three arcs into Shippuuden. The artwork however is very good in general. I think the anime looks very sharp overall and the presentation is quite good to me. The music is great once again. With traditional Japanese music and some epic orchestra music thrown in. The presentation might be one of Shipuuden's strong points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Naruto Shippuden is something that has dissapointed me. I did really enjoy the fights to some degree. The music and artwork is also quite good as well. But to a degree this has dissapointed me so much. The emotion also feels very lacking and you could really careless about the story. But I find it very difficult to really enjoy Naruto Shippuuden in general.\\n\\n",

Every caracter is original and different, special in his own way, you are able to love any of them and to feel happy or sad about them.\r\n3. You can get explanation for everything, you are learning what is...why something.....how something works.. In anime/cartoon/movie caracters can do anything but while you are watching Naruto you are asking yourself how and why and you get explanation, like it's exists in reall life!\r\nI dislikeNaruto Shippuden because:\\n\r\n1. There are lot of fillers so the storyline doesn't have some normal path..You can lose yourself in fillers and you can forget which episode are you waiting to continue...Also flashbacks are so frequently that you can freak out... \\n\\n\r\nI suggest to skip fillers but part to part, not the whole episode at once so you can see what was it about..so things wouldn't be unclear to you..Also, sometimes you can find an important information in filler...\\n\\n\r\nSorry for my bad english! <3",

            "content": "(Some minor spoilers up ahead, sorry)\r\nAh, Naruto Shippuden! Where do I begin with this anime? I used to be so in denial about Naruto, I used to hate it because of it's notoriously cringy fanbase and the comments about the show that I had heard even though I hadn't watched it. But now that I have finished it, I feel like a new man :D. \r\nAlso, I know I'm kind of late on writing a review about this show as it finished about a year ago and there has been a load of reviews about this show, but I felt like I needed to expresshow I feel about this magical show. And please bear with me, I'm not a pro reviewer or anything of the sort, but I did my best. (Also comment on my profile if you have anything to tell me about this review, it is important to me how people feel about my writing.)\\n\\n\r\nLet's begin!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8.5\\n\r\nThe story may seem really simple and stupid at first if you only read the short synopsis of the anime, but to me it is a complex and engaging story with many plotholes, funny moments and lots of emotion, even if it's an anime about ninjas not really being ninjas. I vividly remember just sitting at the edge of my seat or laying in bed buried in blankets just being excited about what was going to happen next. I even watched this show in school when we would get laptops for , well, school work on them. That's how hooked I was. I've also heard a lot of backlash from people about the final arc, the 4th Ninja War arc and I can kind of see why, but I think people are definitely exaggerating over it. Yes the pacing was at it's slowest then. Yes there were lots of flashbacks. Yes, Kaguya was a bad plothole. But at the end of the day, this is also the arc where Madara truly shined as a character, and not just Madara, Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Obito, Guy, the Akatsuki members, Gaara, and many, many more. This is the arc where we got some of the best fights in the whole series. This is the arc when the big, \"evil\" plan of the Akatsuki was revealed. I feel that this arc is mentioned only as a con of the series despite all of the great things it had going for it. This arc is not the best, but it is not the worst and it definitely did NOT KILL Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nThis anime had some of the best characters the anime medium could offer as a whole. From the strong loser Naruto to the evil but also friendly Obito, these characters are really just unforgettable. Even some of the filler characters are really likeable. Not to mention the villains. I could honestly say that Naruto Shippuden contains my favorite villains I've seen in any show or movie. So why is this section only a 9 then you may ask? Well, its because this series also had a few not so good characters. There's a handful of some I really don't like but I'm going to give you my top 3. Tenten, Danzo and Sasuke. Tenten was just really annoying, Danzo was just an unlikeable lunatic with delusions of grandeur (Basically a worse version of Tobirama) but I think Kishi tried to give him a hidden finesse so he is the one out of these 3 who I dislike the least, and Sasuke, who had potential to be among my favorite characters, but in my opinion he turned out to be the biggest and the most retarded douchebag in the whole series. I honestly don't know why Naruto liked the guy so much. Again, Kishi tried to give Sasuke a lot of finesse and depth, and yes, I admit that he had a very complex development but his ignorance, cockyness and overambitiousness just made me dislike the character.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest with y'all, Naruto Shippuden had really bad animation at the start of the series. It was an upgrade form the original Naruto, but not by a lot. It sometimes felt a bit lazy too, but you must take to consideration that Naruto is a longrunning anime. When watching a longrunning anime, this is a risk you must take. Despite this, most of the fight scenes were fucking beautiful and when the wasn't a fight going on the atmosphere was pretty clean after about 150 episodes. Not Hunter x Hunter 2011 level, but still, pretty damn clean.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThis should be pretty freaking obvious. The OST was godly and the most openings and endings were very catchy. My favorite op's were openings 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18 and 20 and my favorite ed's were endings 1, 3, 6, 8, 25, 30, 33 and 34. Both the subbed and the dubbed versions are good, but I prefer the sub and thus recommend the sub over the dub even though the series has some of my favorite english voice actors like Travis Willingham, Crispin Freeman and Troy Baker.\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment - 9\\n\r\nThis anime has a really special place in my heart. To me, the story was truly capturing despite being hard to follow at times and having some terrible plotholes. It had some of the best battles in most likely any shounen battle anime I've seen. It's one of the only anime that has actually managed to make me cry, and that's telling something. I truly recommend this anime for everyone who is up for the task like I was, but be prepared, this anime will have some things you might dislike.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nEven though I fucking love Naruto Shippuden and feel like it had a bunch of really good things going for it, Naruto Shippuden is not perfect. The story is slow, it had some bad plotholes and had a lot of flashbacking midway which made the story even slower. And these flashbacks I talked about were for the weekly watchers when the anime was aired on TV, so if you are a bingewatcher like me, this is just another minus. Despite this aspect the story is definitely worth every second of waiting for it to actually bloom. Naruto Shippuden is also obviously an anime which will not end in a shortly since it has 500 episodes, 269 if you count out the filler, holy shit, and 220 original Naruto episodes, again, counting out the filler, 126 episodes. BUT, there are fillers that are pretty important to the main story and I have gathered a notepad which has all of these filler episodes which I like to call \"Half Canon\". The original Naruto only 6 of these episodes and those were 136-141. The Naruto Shippuden \"Half Canon\" episodes were episodes 28, 45, 49, 127, 284 to 289, 316 to 319, 347 to 359, 386, 394 to 413, 416 to 417, 419, 451 to 457, 460 to 461 and 464 to 469. This show may look very scary to start because of the intense amount of episodes, the constant hate this show gets and the other negative things I have mentioned, but at the end of the day, everyone is different, everyone has different tastes and if this review didn't make you feel like watching Naruto Shippuden or Naruto at all for that matter, I guess that's just tough luck.",

            "content": "Review for both Shippuden and the Original Naruto.\r\n      Naruto is... a journey.\r\n      I remember back in my earlier years of school watching the show late at night was kind of ritualistic for me (together with Shaman King). Now, me being a year away from graduating high school and the show airing for 14 years coming to a close earlier this year, I decided to watch the last 100 or so episodes after taking a long break from anime to put and end to a part of my childhood. Man, didI miss out.\\n\r\n      The anime itself, through time, grew and changed, just like everyone that watched it since the beginning. It started off as a silly-headed shounen about ninjas and super powers and ended with the main characters aiming to save the world from devastation.\\n\r\n      Story-wise, Naruto goes through hardships, endures pain, learns from his mistakes and tests his strength against many foes, but ultimately the final showdown is between him and his first rival, which proves that the show didn't lose focus throughout the years and finished on the note that Kishimoto wanted to (brilliant on his part).\\n\r\n  While the artstyle is unique and easily-recognizable even for non-anime viewers, quality really drops at time, most evident in the filler episodes, which I'll talk about later on.\\n\r\n  Music is really well put all-around, it makes you pumped when there's an action scene coming up, makes you emotional when something sad happens and makes you literally laugh out loud when needed.\\n\r\n      Something that strikes me as surprising is how well-developed is the supporting staff. Most of them are filled with personality and distinguishable, likable design. For every arc focused on Naruto, there are a couple focused on his friends that help him through his path, which leads me to my next point.\\n\r\n Naruto's motto, ninja way or nind\u014d or whatever you want to call it, is that of never running away or going back on his word, which really speaks about the show itself and the lesson it wants to teach.  As the already mentioned hardships suggest, Naruto never altered his vision or casted aside someone else's feeling or dreams, showing that there is always a reason to try your hardest and be righteous.\\n\r\n     Not everything is without its mistakes, though. The only gut-wrenching flaw about the series is how. many. god. damn. filler. episodes. there. are. They make up about half of the episodes, while most of the provide little to no content. To cut some slack off, some of the arcs are pretty amusing by themselves and deserve a watch.\\n\r\n      Overall, the anime is great, it certainly has a special place in my heart, even if I won't revisit it sheerly because of volume. As undoubtedly one of the most memorable long-running anime out there, it surely is  a thing to relish if not for the entertainment it brings, but for the millions of people that it inspired, just like dragon ball did to the previous generation. Now the baton is passed to his son, Boruto, and only time will tell if he'll make his dad proud.",

            "content": "Well this time I'm writing an anime without being a fanboy or anything like that, to be honest I once dropped Shippuden in its 50's but I caught up about 300 episode in 2 weeks,and I'll be honest this 7  could be 9 if not the characters and the Art (the animation as well).\r\nStory : I think most of all know what it's about , a teenage orphan who wants to be a hokage the strongest ninja in the village etc.. Yep this is a predictable mainstream shonen so don't expect some original mindblowing things in the story, however it has its good pointsand bad points.Let's start with the good ones, naruto has its own pace, its charm that makes you love it, and no matter what score you give to this show , you love its simple story about the kid naruto and his adventures and misadventures. Also the fights are quite epic and exiting , getting to the bad points, the fillers, Omg the fillers, I won't talk about it more.7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : Now getting to this point , the characters in naruto is one of the very very weak points. Most of them are useless , and apart from Naruto and probably Sasuke the development isn't really present , most of the characters are used to help naruto or to be in opposition to him finally to get by his side in the end of the arc or the fight etc.. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation : Okay this point is really weak too ,an 8 for the art ,  Gj kishimoto , and the animation mm it's a 2/10 yeah I don't like it at all , Bj studio pierrot. so it's a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound : Nothing to say , good ost, good openings , aand good endings.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : Now the best point of naruto , nobody can deny that this anime will have you sitting in front of te screen for hours without caring about any shit in this world in the beginning of the summer I watched about 300 episodes in 2 weeks ( already said it lol ) and that shows ust how much I enjoy this shonen stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : So as an enjoyable anime with its good and bad points I would recommand it to everyone even if you hate it or you don't like watch it it's probably worth your time. (7*2 +5(characters)*2 + 10 * 2 + 5 + 9)/8 = 7.25 \\n\\n\r\nSo it's a 7.",

            "content": "The series brings some new things, and repeats some old weaknesses to the storytelling.  I'm assuming that anyone reading this has seen at least some of the original series, so please do so if you have not before reading this.\r\nStory:  Just as there was a timeskip and gap between series in the anime, the author took a slight break between the two series too.  Which places the studio in an awkward position of when to start releasing the anime series and what pace to set.  Afterall, the reason for almost 100 filler episodes in the original series was to give themanga author time to work.  Even then they are catching up frighteningly fast and are already beginning to \"pepper\" in a couple of filler arcs.  Unlike the old filler arcs however, these segue nicely into the original plot and don't stand out as much as the old ones did.\\n\r\nAs for what happens, it picks up as Naruto returns to Konoha after 2 and a half years of training with Jiraiya.  I will say that I'm somewhat dissappointed with how little he's improved.  Pervy Sage must be a slack-off because the other characters seem to have improved a lot more than Naruto has (even though he's all around stronger, faster, etc.).  He's matured a little, but of course that leaves room for improvement.  As Jiraiya stated before filler hell settled in during the first series, he intended them to return right as Akatsuki would begin to move and Sasuke's life would be in potential danger.  That prediction is dead on as after he is back less than a day Akatsuki begins it's quest to capture all the \"jinchuriki\" (ninja who have tailed beasts within them) starting with Gaara.\\n\r\nYou can go on your own from there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The world seems less...fresh than it did in the first series.  They, so far mind you, have stuck to the seemingly endless woods around Konoha and a brief foray in the lands of the Sand Village (Sonagakure).  The difference in character design  is fascinating, all due to the original author of course.  Both Sai and Yamato are intriguing for their lack of distinguishing features.  While all the other characters are as notable for their looks as their personalities.  Of course all the original young ninja have matured, all hanging around ~15 yo by the looks of things.  The differences are largely subtle and well done.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is the biggest letdown.  Not because it's poor quality, but because it's always the same 3 tracks playing.  There is no variety in music and the same \"Battle/danger\" music plays all the time.  The variety of music from the first series is gone and that is sad because the original Naruto has an excellent soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Naruto is much the same, but tempered with maturity in that he is able to understand others (except Sakura of course) much better.  He is still obsessed with rescuing Sasuke, and is still reckless and rash.  He seems especially stagnated in comparison to the others who have all become Chunin and even Jonin.  Naruto does show maturity when he learns that Gaara has not only surpassed him but has achieved his own goal by coming Kazekage of his village (though it's later revealed it was for political reasons).\\n\r\nSakura has changed the most.  One of my fav moments from the new series is how she actually becomes interested in Naruto (noting his physique has matured) but is quickly disuaded by discovering his lack of \"coolness\" (aka bragging about a \"new\" sexy jutsu to Konahamaru and telling her that she looked the same (she's \"filled out\" BTW)).\\n\r\nDue to 9 tailed fox's increased power within Naruto, and the fact that they are lacking Sasuke, Tsunade assigns two former ANBU members to join their squad (Kakashi ends up back in the hospital right away of course).  They are Yamato and Sai.  Yamato is the result of one of Orochimaru's experiments, which gives him the powers of the first Hokage.  These are the power of wood element (he can build a mansion in seconds) and limited control over tailed beasts, namely the nine-tailed fox by using the pendant that Tsunade gave Naruto.  Frequently they play off his amazingly blank face.  Naruto, and the viewers for that matter, find his face kinda eerie at times.  They don't hesitate to have fun with this.  He's very kind-hearted though and looks up to Kakashi, calling him Senpai (implying that he served under him in ANBU.  (note: Yamato is not his real name, but he continues to use it)\\n\r\nSai, is originally planted in the group by Danzo, the leader of ANBU root and Tsunade's political nemesis within Konoha.  Trained not to show any emotion, he eventually begins to respond to Naruto and the others.  He provides a lot of comic relief by trying to interract with the others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  It's not as groundbreaking as the orignal, but the series continues to be fun.  Naruto continues to grow and mature over the (now 100 episodes) series and is even learning to better use his current jutsus, thanks to Kakashi actually involving himself in Naruto's training for the first time.  The gags continue a lot but now that characters are actually dying (other than enemies or the elderly (3rd Hokage) it's gotten more serious as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The series has a long ways to go, and since the author is far from finished it will be interesting how they decide to keep pace.  They are currently on their 2nd filler arc.  The first was somewhat silly, but gave everyone background on Asuma which is very important for reasons I refuse to give away at this time.  The 2nd seems to be explaining where the 3-tails jinchuriki came from so it'll be interesting to see how they handle it.\\n\r\nOf course the original story is very strong and fast paced.  To this date the highlight of the series has definately been when Naruto takes on Orochimaru.  It helps you appreciate just how strong Orochimaru is.\\n\r\nThe battles with the Akatsuki have been fascinating, mostly because they have so few weaknesses and how hard the Konoha ninja have to work to defeat them.",

Naruto was one of the first anime that I did pick up when I was actually getting serious about watching. I watched the original series, OVAs, and movies. It was ok overall, but I felt it could do something with that story. Then comes along Shippuuden, which I thought it would do expand the story and make naruto seriously epic. I was wrong. I don't even know how I managed to get to episode 255 including all those countless filler. I mean sure Bleach and One Piece havefillers, but Naruto takes it to a whole different level. I really can barely recall at least 5 episodes for Naruto that were seriously epic. So on that note, no more naruto for me. I may peep the manga from time to time, but its not a priority.",

            "content": "Given the voracity of the backlash against the \"not-so-bad\" rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don't think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance.\r\nSo where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title moreor less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn't as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke's blandness and Naruto's charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed.\\n\\n\r\nIt is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn't saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto's Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about.\\n\\n\r\nHow one feels about Naruto probably depends, in good part, on their anime viewing mileage. As a person that has been watching anime for a decade and a half, there isn't too much here that I haven't seen done better elsewhere. However, it has managed to get better as it progresses. Although uneven in most aspects, this show is a good introductory title that will likely bring many newcomers into the fold of anime fandom.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, Naruto, while being better than worse without a doubt, doesn't quite succeed in being as mind-blowing as the hype-machine would have you believe.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime volleys between a two-star and a four-star feature depending upon your anime viewing mileage and how easily you can stomach an anime so action laden. If you are relatively new to anime and a fan of DragonBall Z and YuYu Hakusho, it is a four-star feature. Otherwise, this is a three-star series at best",

            "content": "When I first heard that will be a sequel to Naruto i thought WOW that's cool, but I hope that the filler episodes won't  apear in the new Shippuuden. But to that Later...\r\nStory/ The story is great, many twist, many thrilled moments and so on. But that's only the main sotry from the manga. Sadly... everytime when a main arc is enden a new filler arc begins... I wouldn't complain if the filer arc would be over 2-5 episodes, but those damn fillers won't get off of my screen!!! The avarage duration is between 15-20 episodes so that means over 15 weeks of sufferingand bleeding... But if it wouldn't of the grat and I have to it again GREAT main story outline, the rating could be much worse...\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/ Well... unfortunately I have to say it's just sad... The first episodes were very good animated but as the time pased the animation gets worse and worse... But there are a few episodes that are great animated for example: Ep. 26 or 85 and the episode when team Kakashi (Yamato) meat Sasuke. First I thought WOW finally the animation gets better, but after 2-3 episodes it gets miserable again... I think it's year 2009 and not 1992... Even Dragon ball had a better animation quality and try to find how old that anime is... In my opinion animaton is the weakest part of Shippuuden\\n\\n\r\nSound/  Is very good, not better then the original Naruto but much better then other anime series. The openings and Endings are nice to hear and some openings I had to download becouse I liked them a lot. And the OST supports the episodes very well. Good JOB.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/  Finally the strongest site of all the Naruto series. Naruto is very well known of the deep  character outline. EVEN THE FILLER characters are well done becouse all of the characters have their own past (mostly sad). some of them are evil and some of them are moch worse and I can't think of their next move. And here we are the good characters... I'm the badguy so the goodguys are only in my way :D, but most of the good characters are losers or geniuses with a sad past and their will force them to maximum. And Naruto when he doesn't give up and tries to others believed in him then so do I. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/  I have to admit that i enjoied Naruto Shippuuden a LOT and even the stupid fiilers can't change that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/  Naruto Shippuuden is a well done sequel with some mistakes. Some of the mistakes are big and some small but the good side overhelmed the Fillers.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Sorry for my bad English :D Im from Czech adn I'M 16 so :D",

Despite his lonely and sad childhood, he didn't let those things to overcome him to become dark, but instead, he let those sad memories as a fuel to drive him to become a better person. i love everything abouthis character, his annoying yet funny stupidity, his unconditional love towards his friends and comrades, his endless hard work even when everything around him comes crashing down. most importantly, i love  how he use his past to understand others instead of judging them. being as strong as he is but still is humble enough to lower himself for something he believes in is just pure inspiration. from being a loner to being around many loyal friends and comrades and have the trust of all shinobi in other hidden villages. he will make an amazing hokage. this anime might be fictional, but i value this anime so much it has more meaning and depth than that. im very sad that this anime is coming to an end, but this anime and the messages it contains will forever live. \\n\\n\r\nthank you Kishimoto for this amazing journey you've shared with me and the rest of naruto's fans.

            "content": "Naruto is the greatest anime I have watched to date. This anime is all about tragedy and triumph. For every tragedy there is a story of triumph, a story of an underdog overcoming their short-comings and becoming the hero. These tragedies brought me tears and the triumphs inspired me to do amazing things. Never before has anything played with my emotions more than Naruto. Every character has a tragic past, but in the end they are able to overcome their past and become a hero in one way or another. If anything the soundtrack is what tugged and my heartstrings the most. The way theOST was used in every situation made each episode more intense, dramatic or sad. I listen to this OST religiously and even to this day it still brings me to tears and reminds me of the hardships each character went through. I am sitting here struggling to find the words to explain how amazing this anime is but I still feel as if I am not doing Naruto any justice. The endless number of characters and jutsus still amazes me. With every episode there is something new, even the \"fillers\" that people tend to complain about. If you take the fillers seriously then you will learn things about the characters and gain a greater appreciation for them no doubt, especially the side characters. The depth that this series has is hard to grasp because of the numerous generations that this story is told over. The storyline covers centuries of shinobi and how each of their stories effects the next generation, I still have a tough time grasping this theory. Each decision made in Naruto effects the next, whether it is good or bad. Each character is likable in their own special way, even the so called \"villains\" of the show. I wish the anime/manga would never end. Naruto will always have a special place in my heart.",

Some are good and others not so much but i don't judge an anime by the amount of fillers because its not their fault. Naruto's story was really good because it was complicated yet easy to understand and it kept you interested. Their were some plot holes but that was because shonen jump refused to run naruto unless kishimoto made it longer. The art quality was average and rarely bad but they made it beautiful when it was really necessary. The op's, ed's, and sound tracks were reallywell done and pretty. They stayed in your head and you could tell that it was from naruto shippuuden. Naruto Shippuuden is an anime with a lot of character personality and development. You know every characters past, personality, and even know what they will do next. Naruto Shippuuden was very enjoyable with a great balance of drama,comedy,sadness, and action scenes with a little hint of mystery to always keep you guessing. Overall I give it a 10/10 because of its enjoyment, characters, sound, and story and of the life lessons this anime gives.",

            "content": "Firstly, I have read the entirety of the Naruto manga and am up to date with the Shippuuden anime series, but I will try and make this review as SPOILER FREE as possible, as long as you have seen the original Naruto series.\r\nI will not be mentioning \"filler\" content in this review, everything will be related to the canon manga.\r\nSo Naruto: Shippuuden starts off 2 years after the events of Naruto. They're all a little bit older now, and a hell of a lot stronger now. The spoiler free story for those who have finished the original series, is pretty much Naruto training hard withhis two goals, one of becoming the Hokage, and the other is bringing Sasuke back to the village.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\r\nFor someone who has read the entirety of the manga and seen everything so far of the anime, I must say it is an amazing story the entire way through Shippuuden with no plot holes and everything fitting in perfectly. This show is full of twists and turns, some that you might expect and other's that will just blow you out of nowhere. Trying to keep this as spoiler free as possible, the story follows Naruto as he gets stronger and stronger, unlocking new Jutsu's and powers throughout as he tries to achieve his one true goal of becoming Hokage. However you are solely mistaken if you think the story of Shippuuden is nothing but the character Naruto, as Naruto is only one of the three main characters and the story follows the other two just as much and also goes very in depth with a lot of the support characters too. They all play their own major role in the different events that happen in the story. Would be really hard to say much more about the story without spoiling anything, so ill end it there.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nAs an art and animation student at a university, this art is definitely my most favourite type of art that any anime can ever have. Its very defined, very simplistic and also looks very realistic and amazing. With just a few lines and curves making up a characters face, every one of them is different yet they are all still so simple which makes it the best art to have. I've always said to myself if I were to create my own art style, I would heavily reference the art style of Naruto. Every different emotion is defined perfectly on every character without having to go over the top and greatly exaggerating the persons face, like some other anime's do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nThe character's is probably the main reason I really love watching these long running shounen anime's, and more specific, Naruto Shippuuden. I have seen the entirety of whats out of One Piece, Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter and Fairy Tail and Naruto: Shippuuden has the best or second best characters of all of them. Every character has a different personality and a different skill set and almost every character in the series at one point in the show has a back story or a \"flashback\" to tell you more about them, which is exactly what you want when you find a character who you favourite in a show and want to know more about them. Trying to create my favourite character list without filling half of it with Naruto characters was a serious challenge.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series so much, that It took me just over two months to watch the very first episode of the original Naruto series, to episode 468 of the Naruto Shippuuden series, and also to read the rest of the manga until the end, and... to watch Naruto: The Last, Boruto: Naruto The Movie and get up to date with the Boruto manga, but they're all topics of a different day. I even enjoyed most of the filler episodes, although some of them got boring, I wanted to watch them anyway because I simply just wanted to watch more of Naruto because of how much I love this show.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna end this review with saying that Naruto: Shippuuden is 2nd on my favourite list out of over 150 anime's and that it is a must watch for those who have seen the original Naruto series. If you're here without watching the original series, then what are you doing! Hurry up and watch the original series!",

            "content": "ROAD BLOCKS IN PLOT WRITING AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM: SPECIAL ABRIDGED KISHIMOTO EDITION\r\n1)\tI created a unique main character with a great ambition, how do I make this character instantly likable?\r\nKishi says: I\u2019ll let you in on a trade secret: \u201cTragic motherfuckin\u2019 back-story.\u201d  You want your character\u2019s childhood to be filled with angst, bullying, depression, thoughts of suicide, and maybe molestation (save this one for an easy shock reveal later on!). Remember, your character in present-day needs to be NOTHING like his childhood self for he will have overcome that shitty past with the almighty \u201cSTRONG RESOLUTION\u201d. It\u2019s all about the compare and contrast.\u201cGood people deserve good futures\u201d, readers love this.\\n\\n\r\n2)\tEvery protagonist needs an antagonist. What should a good antagonist be like?\\n\\n\r\nKishi says: Polar opposite. A perfect antithesis of the main character. Have him bent onto a totally evil goal, like say... oh I donno... revenge? Also, make him sexy and make him mysterious. Chicks love that shit. And don\u2019t you fucking forget about that tragic back-story!\\n\\n\r\n3)\tShould my female characters be important and useful?\\n\\n\r\nKishi says: No.\\n\\n\r\n--- Many pages of wisdom later ---\\n\\n\r\n56) I have followed your sage advice. My protagonist has forgotten his original ambition and is now stricken with intense homolust for the antagonist. As per your suggestions, I have also went through many INTENSE training arcs: a new ability training arc, a training arc to prepare for a training arc, another new ability training arc, a timeskip training arc, a training arc after a training arc to control the new power gained from a previous training arc, and finally, super saiyan training on Namek.\\n\\n\r\nKishi says: *wipes tear* This is beautiful. I couldn\u2019t have done better myself.\\n\\n\r\n---A few pages of growing regret later---\\n\\n\r\n72) Since that timeskip you recommended, I feel my protagonist has become severely overpowered, rendering everyone, but his lover, primitive in comparison. It seems that he has already long surpassed his original goal and achieving it now won\u2019t amount to any sort of satisfaction. What hurts the most however, is seeing my fans clinging onto the hope that the plot would carry on, only to be repeatedly swindled with more pointless drivel. Should I bring my manga to a quick close with an epic fight against a greater evil?\\n\\n\r\nKishi mutters: Don\u2019t be asinine. Now is the perfect time for another flashback.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[After many complaints, the book has now been renamed to \u201cWORDS OF ADVICE FROM MASASHI KISHIMOTO: EXPERT TROLL AND MILKER OF DRIED TITS.\u201d]",

            "content": "\"Naruto is Naruto\" and though Ive only seen the first 5-8 episodes I would still keep watching it. The only thing you should expect from naruto is a great fight scene and a great  story. I didn't think it was that different from the older naruto. The characters do however act differently, such as naruto. Ive seen the new guy and all that. Instead of comparing this to the old naruto, you should be looking forward as things will change when he gets old and you should expect that from a series that continues as the characters get older. Things have definitely got moreserious but the fighting is way better. I stopped watching old naruto at episode 120 because it became to childish for me(even though I really love the series). This is why I like shippuuden. Because they have taken a more serious approach with the series. So naruto fans Id high recommended this to you: )",

            "content": "Naruto...one of the most popular anime to ever be created, and one of the big players in mainstream shonen anime. Regardless of whether you love Naruto or hate it, you have to admit it did something right -- nothing can get this popular while being very bad.\r\nStory -- 9\r\nThe story of Naruto is probably the best and worst quality of this anime. It's built around the complex world of ninjas (shinobi) that is very carefully crafted with hundreds of characters, tons of ninja abilities (jutsus), and an immersive system of countries/villages. All this creates an almost surreal realistic effect. The amount of work it takesto actually become well versed in all of Naruto-dom is a lot, but anyone that watches the 400+ episodes combined between Naruto and Shippuuden will learn them. So the greatest part of this anime is that it is large, evolving, changing. But the world, can, be at times, almost TOO large. You can have one episode in the middle of Konoha (Village Hidden in the Leaves in the dub) and then suddenly jump to a location far far away, with little pretext. While that's fine and dandy, it's hard to jump from place to place and time to time. Some episodes also are happening at subsequent times with others: randomly making up numbers, but 42 and 43 could happen at the same time in the Naruto world -- just in different places. The world is great, but the method they use to show it can be jumpy and confusing at points to someone that isn't used to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt -- 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Naruto isn't bad. Well, yes it is. Wait, no it's not. Wait, yes it is. And that basically sums up the art in Naruto -- it will be pristine one moment, then trash the next. I remember at one point during one of the ever-so-long filler arcs, the art quality got so bad that you could just see straight lines for people's edges, rather than the often used inventions known as curved lines. But as soon as the story came back into the main story arc, the art suddenly jumped back. I think even the studio that works on Naruto gets tired of the filler, sometimes. Overall, it would be a 7 or 8 normally, but due to the laziness of the studio in some episodes, I'm bumping it down to a 6. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound -- 8\\n\\n\r\nThe other great thing about popular shows is that they can always have an amazing soundtrack. This is true for both Naruto the original and Shippuuden. The opening, closings, and themes of Naruto are not overly complex, but recognizable and not harsh on the ears. Some memorable themes from both series would have to include \"Blue Bird,\" \"Sadness & Sorrow,\" and \"Sengunbanba.\" Though they are spread out -- most of the openings and closings aren't bad, just not memorable -- there are the occasional few that you will remember and think \"that  music paired up so well.\" At one point, a very emotional instrumental piece -- Sadness & Sorrow -- was played during the funeral of one of the ninja leaders. The somber attitude, good artwork (for once! hooray!) and moody and powerful music allowed that particular episode to stay in people's minds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, character, character. The characters of Naruto are always evolving, changing, etc., etc. But the problem is -- is that when you have such a large world, with a couple hundred characters, the majority of them will get put on the side. So you are introduced to Awesome Character Z, who you love for maybe 10 or 20 episodes. But then they're put to the side, and they just become filler every now and then -- it's hard to include everyone. The main characters' development is nice, to say a lot. If you compare the Naruto at the start of the original series to the Naruto now, a lot has changed. Even more so if you compare it to what has happened in the manga. It basically follows his life from the 12 year old child everyone hates (you know there is one of those kids you hate in your life, don't lie!) to a respectable and caring adult (ish?) person. Of course, he's still the same old perverted, bloody-nosed kid on the inside, but the change in attitude, thinking, and manners is noticeable to say the least. Other characters -- specifically Hinata -- are thrust into a main-supporting role, with small development -- she basically has a crush on him which cripples her, and then she has to confront that and either save herself or Naruto in order to be productive, and stays like this for well, the entire series. These sort of characters (see: Temari, Gaara, Hinata, Neji, etc.) are basically only used for the advancement of the main characters (see: Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, Sai, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -- 7\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Filler. Filler. Filler. OMG Awesome episode-! No, wait, filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of Naruto is spliced up -- the fillers are generally boring and only put out to keep the massive drones that support Naruto appeased -- but I have to admit, there are some pretty awesome fight sequences and battle scenes. If you are one of the people who likes to skip over / breeze through filler, then you will get a greater enjoyment out of Naruto Shippuuden as a whole. It seems as of late like they've been stretching each of the episodes out a little more than needed (as if to give the manga an already larger head start which it doesn't need), but I'm willing to chalk that up as a decision to explain what's happening fully. At the moment, a lot of complicated drama and plots are coming together and unfolding, so the pace doesn't need to be as fast as in the manga. Regardless, counting filler, enjoyment is about a 7. Without it, it would be an 8 or 8.5; just filler would be a 4.5ish. So as a whole, it's a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.5\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\r\nYou can't really put \"halfs\" on these reviews, so I decided to be generous and give it that extra .5. Out of the \"kings\" of shonen mainstream anime, Naruto definitely is not the worst (see: One Piece, Bleach) but not as refined as the best (see:Fullmetal Alchemist). It has very strong story and sound elements, and can have both very crappy and very well made art. The character development for main characters is fantastic -- just not so much for the static and supporting characters. The enjoyment value is high when it's following the manga and not in filler -- it is dismal when it is in filler, though. Overall, it's a decent series. Maybe not watching 400 episodes worth if you want to catch up / are starting new, but not a bad series by any means.",

            "content": "I started watching Naruto the wrong way. \r\nThe first thing I knew about Naruto was his battle with Pain. Then after that, I began watching Jiraiya's fight with Nagato. Sakura and Granny Chiyo's battle with Sasori. The Third Hokage's death. And so on... I missed a lot of episode, nevertheless, I knew I should begin with the first episode not in Shippuuden but in the original Naruto itself. \r\nBut nooo. I was so stubborn so I began to read the manga first. Ever since I heard that Naruto has ended, I was itching to read its manga for good. And I did. A week later,I found myself crying and inspired. I regret not paying attention to such an amazing manga. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY :\\n\\n\r\nSome would say I'm exaggerating, but for me, Naruto is what I can proudly say a \"masterpiece\". I love Naruto so much it pains my kokoro. Any month now, or maybe a year, Shippuuden will end like a flash. Fillers may make this masterpiece a junk but I assure you, some fillers are worth a shot. If you hate it, then don't watch it. The pacing will still be the same. Naruto will remain the same. I may not be a super Naruto fanatic, I can't call myself that yet. Naruto may not be my childhood favorite but it is my inspiration. The heck with Naruto-more-then-a-decade fans. I, too, has Naruto inside me. \\n\\n\r\nNinjustu. Gengutsu. Taijutsu. Senjutsu. Fuinjutsu. There are so many justu to elaborate with but that makes this anime special. Over the past decade, I hear many jutsu throughout my community. I remember how I used to play games on my friends ps3. Naruto here, Naruto there. Even now, when I attend cosplay events, Naruto is still popular. I always ask myself why. Why is Naruto so popular? Is the anime even this good? Why is Sasuke such a news word in the society? Now I know why : it's because you can never change time. You can never change hearts. You can never change memories. \\n\\n\r\nNaruto has its own place in the anime industry. As well as any other anime out there. Even if A LOT are already tired of fillers and unending battles, this anime will never waver. Who could ever forget Naruto famous \"I'll become a Hokage\" quote? I'm sure that I won't. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER :\\n\\n\r\nAhhh. This is what I love the most in this anime. So let's start with Naruto Uzumaki. The Nine Tails Jinchuriki. The prophecy child. Who would not love Naruto, anyway? He may be a loser, a brat, a stupid shinobi, but who would have thought that he could can the whole shinobi world? Naruto's development started when people hated him more and more as he grows up. And later did he blossom when a person finally acknowledge him. He is not just the nine tails jinchuriki. He is Naruto Uzumaki. And he will become a hokage. A man full of words is better than a man who doesn't recognize his worth. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there's come Sasuke. Sasuke Uchiha, the avenger (coughs). Kidding! I honestly hated Sasuke at first. Unlike Naruto, he only wants vengeance. He locks his self in his own wicked world. He wanted to become strong to kill the person who attacked his village, his parents, his everything. I know it must have been painful to witness your beloved killed also by your beloved, but putting everything aside  for vengeance? Alright, that's pretty much okay. No one could ever stop you anyway. And if it wasn't for Sasuke the avenger, things would not end up the way it is in the end. Everyone has a purpose in life. Despite of everything he did, I'd still want him back. He's home is Konohagakure after all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for Sakura. Oh, I love her development. From a weak and fragile girl to a strong and powerful woman indeed. I never hated her, really. She has her own issues and I respected that. She love Sasuke (who doesn't?) so much that she was willing to do everything for him.  Love is a battle, and so she took her own path by becoming a shinobi that can stand by herself. She is a character that has an open development. Watch the anime and you'll see how she strive everything for her to be acknowledge the same way the rest of the Team 7 were.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many more characters to praise. Everyone changed for the better. They had their own pain, happiness, beliefs. Thank you specially for Naruto's Will of Fire for leading the shinobi world. Everything was worth it. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND :\\n\\n\r\nI am not really good when it comes to analyzing the art style but from what I saw, it was an okay for me. There are some fights that I was expecting a lot of animations but thank you for the sound and effects my feels stays the same. I love how the sound can be so perfect from time to time. There are many soundtracks too that I would love to listen over and over. The background music is always fitting with the atmosphere. It makes me cry, ya know!!! I just hope the animation will be amazing in the last part of the series. (MadaraxGuy / SasukexNaruto fight pls)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT :\\n\\n\r\nI cried. I laughed. I felt the pain and the hopes of many shinobi in this anime. And I wouldn't have asked for more.  Thank you for the roller coaster ride, Naruto. Thank you for teaching me not to give up. Thank you for the comfort and love that I haven't realized all these years. And oh, thank you Kishimoto Sensei for creating Naruto. I love you so much, thank you thank you thank you!!! Words will never be enough for inspiring me to believe in myself. I will never give up. No matter how hard life may be, I'll always remember Naruto's will of never giving up. \\n\\n\r\n\"And my future dream is to be the greatest Hokage! Then the whole village will stop disrespecting me and start treating me like I'm somebody. Somebody important!\" - Naruto Uzumaki\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is worth a shot. Try watching every episode and refrain from skipping fillers. Some of it may be very important, ya know! \\n\\n\r\n\"A masterpiece will never be considered as a flawless creation nor idea. Everything and everyone has its own flaws and mistakes. Nevertheless, a masterpiece is considered to be acknowledge and not to be judge by others.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is what I learned from watching this amazing anime. May others find their own inspiration in you, Naruto.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well .. so as One Piece and Bleach .. this anime is one of the most known animes around the western world.. well there are a lot of theories about it but let me notice you .. POPULARITY DOES NOT MEAN IT IS GOOD ! \r\nThis anime started extremely well, with epic scenes and epic battles plus a nice pace on the development and a good work on exploring the main characters.. combined with a nice sound track and a fair art, it could be a 9/10 .. BUT .. it makes the same mistake as one piece .. IT'S TOO DAMN LOOOOOOOONG so itgets repetitive and meaningless .. plus the action gets worst so as the pace and the character development is always the same. I mean for more than 200 eps i'm hearing this :\" I'm not alone, i have friends, so i'm strong and i won\u00b4t lose ! Oh and i want to be Hokage by the way\" .. just makes no sense .. \\n\\n\r\nTalking about this anime makes me sad because i always think how much potential was wasted here .. \\n\\n\r\nStory : 9/10 . Well i will have to talk about the first season, \"Naruto\". Here the plot was a 10/10. Just perfect. The plot is interesting, creative and original at astonishing levels and it just looks extremely great. Since the first episodes they give us some mysteries and throughout the show they will reveal them and adding another misteries related to the plot .. which make us throughout the first season of Naruto (taking out the last 2 arcs which are fillers) and the first part of Naruto Shipudden hooked to the plot because we always have something to figure out.  \\n\\n\r\nBUT .. now they at the current time of the anime, they already explored everything, and the anime is just boring.. there are no secrets anymore, i already know the entire history since the beginning of the world it self ! Now we are just seeing extended crappy fights with shit talks about friendship for like 15 min of each episode .. i'm done with that ! Plus they always are showing the same thing over and over again .. why? Because they don\u00b4t have anything else to show. \\n\\n\r\nAn example is like how Garen became one of the Naruto's closest friend .. i've seen that memory so many times throughout the fights which is just stupid .. the same thing happens with all of the other characters.. so every episode we have 3-4 min of crappy fights, the rest is just the characters talking to themselves the same thing over and over again.  \\n\\n\r\nPlus .. the piece of art that they had was just amazing .. and they were able to blow it up to what we have now .. a silly ninja story which only focuses the importance of friends .. it's so disappointing .. For the first part of the show, we can see some maturity in the anime, which is pretty rare for a shonen. It talks about interesting themes and have some nice conversations .. now ? It looks like they copied One Piece .. It really makes me mad. The plot used to look mature, now it looks so childish.. \\n\\n\r\nThe action reached ridiculous levels .. at the begining of Naruto Shippuden, some fights were beyond epic. Each fight had a \"mini twist\" when it comes to the actual power of the characters .. so when we think he is using his best skill, we get to know that he has more powerfull skills to show, which make the action so good. Plus, each character has a lot of special skills, different from each other, so we can\u00b4t never predict what he is going to do. Now ? Basically they do a contest about who can make the biggest explosion. So naruto trhowing Rasengans all over the place, and the openents doing the same thing with some kind of \"energy ball\".. how cool is that? (it really sucks)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. The detail is almost none because to \"hide\" the detail they make some huge explosions and everything gets covered by dust, and the characters don\u00b4t look great. The background is also weak, so nothing here excels. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Every single opening is pretty damn good (check on the web and see how many openings are only for naruto shipudden), the OST are memorable ! I mean i loved the entire OST related to Akatsuki and the Bijus. Just incredible damn good. It fits nice with the action, give us a nice mood and ultimately, some epic scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Another failure .. did you ever heard about Itachi? Or Nagato? Or Madara? You probably heard about them all .. they are just astonishing characters with a excelent background story .. meanwhile .. the FUCKING 5 HOKAGES ARE THE SAME SHIT . Yes .. the same shit. \"I will protect my village\" it's basically all they have to say. Plus every other characters (like Naruto's friends) are just there to be there. They have no development at all, they are just there to fill in. And then we have characters like Sakura. Well she says \"i won\u00b4t be dependent on Naruto anymore\" like 5 times, after each times she ends up depending on him for everything. Naruto carries his village and it's the only \"OP\" character at the moment, which is a shame. In Naruto and even in the first part of shippuden, we do have some nice characters getting development and being part of some excelent fights.\\n\r\nNow? It's basically waiting naruto using Rasengan 1000 times and defeat the enemies.  \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters can be resumed with this sentence: I have friends, so i will always win. \\n\\n\r\nThe villians: I'm alone, because that's how we can get true power. Friends are nothing. \\n\\n\r\nIt really works like that, each character has the same motivations, if it is a villian, probably he had some dark past and now he belives he is better alone. Is it is a good guy, he belives in friends and that kind of stuff. Really there is 0 variety when it comes to characters. (of course taking out those 3 that i talked about) \\n\\n\r\nAbout Naruto it self .. well the typical shonen main character.. about his rival, Sasuke.. he had his highlight on Naruto and Naruto Shippuden first part .. well now it's just a pussy and no one cares about him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10. It's just boring, meaningless .. for an action anime, there is no action. That's all i have to say. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10. As you were able to see, we can divide Naruto Shippuden into 2 parts. The first part (9/10) and the second part (4/10) .. which only makes a 6/10. If the show is going to get better? Well i don\u00b4t know, hopefully it will, but i doubt .. for who likes shonens, there are betters out there, even though this anime has the best plot i've ever seen, it does not worth the 100 fillers plus the crappy low anime that is being now .. if i advise this one? Well at least the first part is great, the second one? Don\u00b4t touch it. I consider the first part everything except the fillers from the first episode of shippuden until the beggining of the 4th ninja war.",

            "content": "Overview: I like Naruto Shippuden\u2019s special abilities, complex battle scenes, and rivalries. I think they are unique to the series and kept me invested throughout its run. However, the delivery of Naruto is the key to understanding why the show is so good. The unique philosophy each character abides by, the lack of a villain who is evil \u201cjust cause\u201d, and the ongoing themes embedded throughout the series are what truly makes the show great. I\u2019m writing this review because I enjoyed watching Naruto immensely, but also because I felt the show constantly shifted my outlooks on power, dignity, friendship, and isolation. To me, ashow that is both fun to watch and makes you think deeply about how your perspective compares to that of the show\u2019s characters is the ultimate form of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden has one of the most, if not the most, enticing story for a long-running anime. Yes (semi-spoiler), there were perhaps too many \u201che/she was just a puppet for a greater being\u201d toward the end of the 4th Great Ninja War, but other than that, everything else flows smoothly. The transition from villain to villain and plot to plot is relatively clean, and I never felt any milestone or major feat within the series came either too soon or too late. The way in which Naruto Shippuden tells its story is unique in that we are always able to see both sides of the fight, instead of only that of our protagonist. I know that is more of a character analysis, but I felt it really helps the viewer understand the weight of each conflict. And don\u2019t even get me started on the fights. From the brief, speechless fights where the tension is so thick you could cut it with a knife, to the drawn out, intelligent fights where characters use both their abilities and their wits to fight it out for hours, Naruto Shippuden\u2019s fights rarely cease to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the fights is fluid and each frame could be considered a masterpiece given its context. However, not all of Naruto is fighting. In fact, as crazy as it may be, a majority of the time is not spent fighting. The characters talk, walk, and eat too. It\u2019s crazy. For these sections, the art can lack compared to the fights. It never seems to be bad or even average animation, but Naruto definitely has some stronger attributes than its animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nGiving any show a 10 in sound is hard, probably because of shows like Naruto. The theme songs change every arc or so, yet I would say almost all the theme songs do a good job of expressing the emotion embedded within the arc. Some theme songs are also just straight up amazing hype songs, and to watch any theme song that gets you pumped up for the next 20 minutes worth of episode is always a delight. The most well known Naruto song, Sorrow and Sadness, perhaps epitomizes the greatness of Naruto\u2019s sound. The original, upbeat Naruto theme song which played whenever a young Naruto triumphed over evil evolved into an emotion filled, moving classical symphony that reflects both the changes of Naruto and the show as a whole. No other show I\u2019ve seen has done such unique, incredible music, and I think it\u2019ll be like that for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is the hardest part of my rating. Personally, I love Deidara. He is a stagnant, narcissistic asshole who values his ideals above all else. Usually, this type of character would piss me off because of my ability to relate him solely depends on whether or not I agree with his ideals. He has little background, and never grows. This is the brilliance of such a character, however. By staying true to his ideals throughout the show, all of Deidara\u2019s decisions can be tied back to the idea he represents. Because we cannot relate to Deidara, we view him not as a person but as a representative for his motives. He lives to create art, and he believes his form of art is superior to all. By constantly risking his life to prove this sole belief, we come to accept Deidara values this ideal above his own life. So when characters who do have backgrounds, who do develop, and who seem more human than Deidara arrive, their methods of interaction with him emphasize the charcter\u2019s feeling toward the idea Deidara represents. Naruto Shippuden does this with many characters, as each character seems to have their own personal philosophy of how the world ought to be, and their own motives for changing the world as well. Naruto himself is annoying at first, but he gets better as he matures, and the events which cause his maturity are well-paced and dignified. Sakura sucks, but not as bad as everyone says she does. The Akatsuki are dope in general. Sasuke, well, he is two things. He is a mess of a character who\u2019s actions can be quite baffling. While I feel I understood Sasuke personally, many of his actions don\u2019t make sense unless you understand the mindset of a psychopath. At the same time, he is the perfect foil for Naruto in literally every way and makes the show 100x better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend skipping almost all the fillers except for those toward the end, and binge watching Naruto can get hard. It\u2019s best to usually watch one arc in a short amount of time than take a break for s few days to a week or so before picking it up again. This just prevents the show from losing its shine. Other than that, Naruto was a blast to watch and I have definitely rewatched the series a decent amount of times. It\u2019s that good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers) Naruto is a show that constantly asks the question \u201cHow do we make the world a better place?\u201d Pain, Madara, Sasuke, Naruto, Kakashi, and many other charcters try to answer this question. Each character seems to have their own personal opinion on the answer to this question, and each character seems to have their own motive for trying to make their opinion a reality. The conflict of characters who all desire the same thing yet are inspired by different motives and different backgrounds creates an engaging story. Ultimately, Naruto Shippuden may not be the show for you if you purely enjoy watching a story that lacks mistakes and leaves you with a warm feeling In your stomach. But, if you like the idea of controlling powers beyond belief, villains who are real charcters and not just one dimensional antagonist, an intense story, a main character who constantly is growing, and a range of perspectives which make you question your personal beliefs, then Naruto Shippuden is the show for you.",

Each character represents the diverse emotional problems people face in their lives. There is a war-torn era, a post-war era and another war-torn era, and finally an era of peace. In all this, the mangaka didn't forget to show how it all began, giving a very interesting symbolic history of the world's past. Then, there are the heart-wrenching representations of the war-orphans, the downtrodden, the outcasted and even the privileged. The antagonistshave also been shown to possess really important reasons to turn against the norms. Philosophies of peace, conviction, life, death, art, purpose, etc are voluminous. As a shounen, it has the most creative battle scenes and character developments. The art and animation are brilliant. There are references to Japanese, Indian and other cultures, traditions and myths throughout the story. The sacrifices done for national cause, the underlying political crises, all are shown with brilliant symbolism. Kishimoto is a rare genius and should be considered a legend. The beautiful background scores and heart-touching ending songs all make it a very emotional watch. Especially, the MC being the most motivational and iconic character in any work of fiction. A must watch for every being living in this world!\\n\\n\r\nNote: The DIRAI technique of rating was developed by me. Five criteria to rate any work of art, across any genre. The aggregate of these five lends the final rate. All five criteria are equally necessary. You can't call one greater than the other.\\n\\n\r\n-Depth is the layered meaning of a story. How symbolic or allegorical a work of art is.\\n\r\n-Importance is how necessary a work is. How significant it is with respect to social, historical, philosophical, political and scientific standpoints.\\n\r\n-Relevance is how appropriate a work of art is with respect to the current time, period or circumstances. It lends weight to the work. Even symbolic reference to the modern civilization is a great factor for relevance.\\n\r\n-Artistry is how a work of art is executed or portrayed.\\n\r\n-Imagination is the thinking up of new ideas. Be it in the form of new characters or a mind blowing story, a new tune or a new kind of literature itself.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: Lots of reviewers tend to rate works by how much they were able to relate. I do not even consider that a factor. Entertainment and relatability are not proper criteria for reviews. Well, whatever, thank you. This is my first review, I shall be posting more very soon.",

I have gotten watched through the pain arch and it has proved to be a very pivotal moment for my understanding of this show. Whenever Naruto is brought up people often bring up the fact that its laced with filler or other pointless qualities that would degrade the quality of the show. Talk to me about filler before I have seen this arch and I would have agreed but with where I am now I wholeheartedly believe everything this show hasdone is justified; regardless of how drawn out segments of the show can tend to be. You can only get as much from this series as you are willing to get from it, thus if you want to achieve the most intense take away from this there must be a method to the madness. I believe the best approach is through marathoning significant moments from the series because everything builds. Watching this show has made me finally understand why English teachers love analyzing literature. Its not about the spectacular fight scenes its about the message this show sends to its viewers. The bigger picture this show has to offer is all to relevant to this time period and my interpretation has allowed me to fully appreciate anime of this caliber as a whole. For example they manage to give almost all the core villains fully justified means of their actions. There is so much more to speak of but I feel this is a path of self discovery and I am fully interested in unique thoughts about this show as a whole. To those on the outside it seems like I'm drawing blood from a stone. But lemme tell ya I found a whole lot of blood.",

            "content": "After the marathon of Naruto, we end up here, Shippuuden.\r\nNaruto left the leaf village with Jiraiya and has been away for 2 and a half years.\r\nThat's a massive time jump, so it's going to take a while to learn the little bits and pieces of everything that's been happening while they were away, with both Naruto and Jiraiya, plus all the friends they left behind.\r\nIt kicks straight into the main story pretty much immediately, while you're getting all the information about what's been happening in the background. \r\nThe Akatsuki are ready to make their move, Orochimaru is still with Sasuke and the Leaf Village hasbeen waiting for what Orochimaru has planned and for Naruto to return.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really nice to see the progress in the characters, they're still technically kids, but it doesn't seem like it at all. Maybe except for Naruto, he's still pretty immature, the difference is he knows when it's okay to let that side of him out.. Most of the time. It's obvious they've all learned a lot, and it's exciting to see what's different with everyone as time goes on. \\n\\n\r\nThe fillers are more abundant than before, but they're still worth watching. Most of them have some main story material through them, though mostly small pieces, they're still important to see.\\n\\n\r\nA part I really enjoyed was learning more about characters other than Naruto, seeing as it's such a big series, the other main characters and background ones are still very prominent, it's interesting and you need to learn more about them to see why they are who they are. Once it gets into it, a lot of them have similar backgrounds of losing people and it helps explain why they're all so drawn to and supportive of Naruto and his mission. \\n\r\nTheir backstories really help lay out the plot in more detailed means, it's great when small plot points spiderweb into backgrounds of different people and it all comes together.\\n\r\nThough, you only get the full experience of it by watching the fillers, as that's where most of that information comes from. \\n\\n\r\nOne of Naruto's best qualities is that he has such a big heart, like many characters say, he has the ability to inspire anybody without even trying, and he cares so much. \\n\r\nThough from that, Shippuuden isn't holding back on the deaths.. It is a war, after all. So be prepared to be both incredibly sad and really shocked. I was so devastated at one of them I wanted to just quit the series, hibernate for a few days and never return. This is 1 of 3 anime that has made my heart sink to that extent. \\n\r\nWhat adds to the sadness is how caring Naruto is, even people just getting hurt upsets him and makes him so angry that sometimes bad things happen. But when people he cares for die, especially ones that are so close to him, the emotions for that through Naruto are portrayed so well, seeing him cry and be so hurt just makes your heart ache. \\n\\n\r\nBig questions start to get answered around halfway through, all the little bits and pieces start making sense and coming together to completely flip situations and the story you thought certain characters had. It's done really well, so it feels even more satisfying when the questions come to light.\\n\\n\r\nI'm finishing writing this halfway through, it's a lot to watch all at once unless you've been watching it bit by bit or as it released. \\n\r\nLike the previous, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought it would. Naruto in general gets a lot of judgement for having so much filler. In the first half the characters are kiddy and pretty annoying if you're watching a lot at once, but once you get past that it's a decent series. \\n\r\nI don't regret putting so much time into it and I'm actually looking forward to wherever it may lead. \\n\r\nThis part is definitely better than the first, the story, characters and flow of the series is nicely done and you can't help but crave to know what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking at watching this you've either watched Naruto and you're moving on, which you'll really enjoy the evolution of the series. Or you've heard Shippuuden is good but are weary about the amount of episodes and fillers involved, or have trouble pushing through the first part. If you enjoy long series, with adventures, fighting, regular character growth (excluding the time skip but it's pretty well explained so it doesn't really count), good comedy with some pervy goodness added in, plus all the other things the series brings, it'll be worth it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",

After 2 and a half years Naruto finally returns to his village of Konoha, and sets about putting his ambitions to work, though it will not be easy, as He has amassed a few (more dangerous) enemies, in the likes of the shinobi organization; Akatsuki.\r\nNaruto is an extremely popular Anime in Japan and even across the world.. The setting and the characters of thisanime will make you want to live in this world.. The story is good but not unique, the art look is outstanding, so overall I'll rank it 9/10..",

He has used the same jutsu, the same yelling tactics to throw his enemy off(?) And the same \"I'm hokage\", \"I'll save you!\", or \"My childhood sucked!\" Lines. He hasn't grown or learned a thing. I would think he would stop endangering his team, being disrespectful to his senior officers, and trying to solo things rather than listening to the plans. When they were younger it was acceptable, it was even funny at times, but not now. Any scene with naruto I skip immediately. Itis either screaming, crying, or &quot;kage bunshin no jutsu&quot;. \\n\\n\r\nSakura and others are shown to have grown and learned many things through their training. Sakura has become way cooler than she ever was in Naruto, as well as tenten and others using newer styles of fighting from Naruto. I guess we will never see a change in the main character. I really did enjoy Naruto, but maybe I expected too much from Shippuden, or to much of a change maybe? Either way, I feel like now that they are older and with the main character still acting like this, makes the whole shinobi thing, along with all of the danger and life-threatening fighting look like a complete joke to the theme. As well as they are afraid of killing people off in my opinion, having them win against people who are said to be the greatest in the world. Making the characters older really did nothing, it is meant for the same audience that watched Naruto, and who didn't want any change or development.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty good though, I enjoy learning about the plot development as it goes by and want to see more about Akatsuki's plans. The story with sasuke and orochimaru is good also, as I feel it will all be tied together at some point in the anime and we should see some good fight scenes (I hope).\\n\\n\r\nThat's about it, it's not that I hate it, but I was severely disappointed by it in a lot of ways.",

The original Naruto was way too immature with Naruto acting too much Shit and 100% determination with no brains whatsoever(I dont konw how the plan to beat Neji came to his mind alongside Kiba), but in Shippuden, the Naruto was much more mature, rational, logical and everything he did made sense.The most epic part being his promise to free the world from the curse of hatred.(Not his hokage dream or Sasuke revival).\r\nThe only thing that hampers its productive abilities is the amount of fillers and flashbacks. But believe me; skip through themand you will find Shippuden the most beautifully pesented anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Well the strory has grown more complex than the original Naruto.  The plot seems to join all the stones ever in the ninja world history to be unturned. But Shippuden has a weakness which Naruto dosent have; thats character depth of some people.ROCK LEE turns out from something into nothing.The overall background strorytelling of the character's had again lived up to its reputation.10/10 for strory.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Naruto dosent really have the fighting OSTs which gap is filled by Attack On Titan, but the soundtracks which Shippuden presents is sad, emotional, beautiful and soothing. The \" Sage of six paths death theme\" and \"The guts to never give up\", being my favourites. But the first spot is STILL held by \"Wind\" from Naruto.10/10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters have grown incredibly powerful with some people coming into action like the hokages, Madara, Obito. The series also has my favourite villain- PAIN and my fav characetrs of course- NARUTO and ITACHI .10/10 for characetrs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, I reacommend that please people skip through the fillers and dont spred any rot about this epic. 10/10 for overall presention.(ignoring the fillers).",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE- No taking about specific characters OR specific events.\r\nCHARACTERS:  The best part of the show is the diverse interesting set of characters.   I would argue that I love them more than the main character in many ways.  Everyone has interesting traits and each characters grows and changes during the series.  The Japanese voices are the best in terms of how they are acted. However later in the series it gets to the point where there are too many to keep track of so I made a link to 2 character maps for you for later in the series.  \r\nSTORY:This is a story about more than ninjas.  It is about community, fighting for your dreams, overcoming prejudice, learning from the regrets of the past, learning to overcome hatred and fighting for a better future for all.  It gets convoluted and difficult to keep track of every character at times.  Every character is developed as the series goes on and has a back story that makes you understand even the worst characters.  The tone of the show ranges from fun & childish to dark.  It all does comes together nicely and is well rounded by the different tones.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the downside, there are too many flashbacks that represent more of an emotional state rather than ones that give context to the story so I can forgive those.  The Filler is also beyond bad; however I enjoyed the filler during the great ninja war.  Because of excess of characters it is too easy to become lost and that becomes even worst during the filler episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nGRAPHICS/SOUNDS:  It is not important to me (I am a story/character person) so it is best to go to other reviewers.  I mean I love the theme and how it fits.  I love the animation and the sound track\u2026 even after 400+ episodes I never started to hate it.  \\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING:  Watch the sub version ONLY.  Never watch the English version because the translation and voice acting is terrible. \u201cBelieve it\u201d and believe me. \\n\\n\r\nTHE BEST PART:   I feel like this is a piece of art that makes my soul grow/glow warm.  I really care about these characters and the story makes me think about life.  This is a series all about growing up and the change it brings.  \\n\\n\r\nWARNING:  You have to watch the original Naruto Series First.  I HIGHLY suggest you only watch the sub version.  The English actors are the worst of the worst.  It is so poorly translated that it will make you HATE this anime.  Also Skip every, and I MEAN EVERY, filler series.  As much of a fan I am I HATE the filler and they are not important to the main story. \\n\\n\r\nSKIP THE FILLER EPISODES WHICH ARE: 57-70, 90-111, 144-151, 170 & 171, 223-242, 258-260, 279-281, 284-295, 303-320, 347-361, 376-377, 389-390, 391-393, 394 \u2013 413, 416 \u2013 417, 419, 422-423, 427-I WILL UPDATE.\\n\r\n  I am the type of person that likes to see everything so when I tell you to skip it, you know you can trust me when I say it is stupid, bad, and full of contradictions/plot holes.  I HATE the filler.  My rating of the show with the filler is like a 6.5.  Do not watch it\u2026 just do NOT do that to yourself.  I personally found enjoyment in watching the fillers in the great ninja war but the problem is you get lost because you forget characters and get lost.   I will fill in the fillers I liked later.  \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL IMPRESSION:  This is one of the best amines I have ever seen.  Seriously skip the filler and watch the SUB version only.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER MAPS: \\n\r\nAfter all AKATSUKI Revealed: http://safrika.deviantart.com/art/Naruto-Complete-Character-Tree-119003764\\n\\n\r\nStart of the war: http://penjualkomik.blogspot.com/2010/10/salasilah-komik-naruto-naruto-family.html\\n",

One of the main criticisms of Shippuuden is the number of filler episodes which is a criticism I disagree with due to my opinion of every episode being integral to the plot as it shows the maincharacter's lighter side. If you haven't seen the whole of Shippuuden, why are you on this site? You are not a true anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nNote: A messy haired boy in my class did not understand the complexity of Naruto: Shippuden so I battered him as it was a insult to this masterpiece.",

I never read the manga of either naruto or naruto shippuden but after watching the anime i was intrigued mostly every episode and i fully enjoyed watching it. I am not going to pinpoint every tiny detail because the story in general is worthy of 9/10 or even 10/10.\r\nart- 10/10 \r\nThe evolution of the naruto shippuden art is outstanding to say the least, by just watching the anime openings you see frame by frame how much detail and pure ,beautiful artand time the animation studio put into this anime. I don\u2019t even need to say anything to explain why i am giving this a 10/10 so i will leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good, it was all in sync as it should alot of great voice acting and also great action sound effects. However, i did hear repeated music in some scenes which i did not mind but i also heard some use of the same action sound effects which were quite annoying which is why i am giving it a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in naruto shippuden were questionable to some but for me i would say most of the characters had good story plot to them and were developed through time and you would able to see that in the series as you progress through different arcs of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nNaruto shippuden has alot of wacky jokes here and there or great plot and even great action scenes. I found it to be very enjoyable 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is one of the best out there among the top and yes it has its faults but its most likely up to personal reference of what you think of this anime adaptation.",

Oh even if most of the fillers is basically backstory, or side mission, I like to call them.\r\nYo, I am The Self-proclaimed Idiot, and that was my take on being sarcastic. In this review I will answer the hard hitting questions, for example, Do I have to watch the fillers? Is the art really $h!t, because that episode with pain face make me believe it like that all the time? Is it just me or the all shounen anime have plot armour?\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10): This is an anime about a boy trying to get recognized by his peer. Oh, vague. Hard hitting question #1: No you do not need to watch the fillers, but I recommend it. You play games like Skyrim, Fallout, and Gta. And you telling you don't play the side mission. You are losing out on content or backstory when you don't watch the Fillers. This story is literally an adventure. It is also a roller coaster of emotion. You will laugh a little and cry a little. But to me that is what make an anime great.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): Hard hitting questions #2: Because you see what some people think is a mistake the degrade animation of its beauty. Me, a least think the art style fit beauty even the fight with Pain. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): I loved every opening and ending song. Voice acting fit every character perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10): Every main character and antagonist had backstory (hint: watch the fillers)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): Did feel a little bit of slow paced, but okay.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10): Don't have to watch the fillers, but do. A little slow paced. Amazing song. Beautiful artwork. There might be some down sides to this anime, but you have to find them yourselves.",

            "content": "So now that the manga has ended its serialization and the anime still continues to spew endless filler for no reason other than to milk as much money as possible, I am writing a review to explain to you why Naruto: Shippuden was a promising anime that went downhill since the first episode.\r\nThe story of Naruto is an interesting and unique one. Its something that hasn't been told too often and it has a great setting. But the anime does a very poor job of executing it. There are a few canon episodes, then a plethora of fillers appear out of nowhere, so that whenthe canon story continues from where it left off, I have somewhat lost my hype on what was happening before the filler. This is even more prominent towards the end of the series, which is where there's supposed to be excitement above all else. The fillers themselves are so bad they ruin the characters' personalities to some extent.The canon episodes are dragged on by the same flashbacks so many times you'll start feeling sleepy. The characters' backstories, especially Naruto's, are shown so many times, you won't even feel sentimental anymore. There were some great story arcs like the Pain arc, but the rest all drag on and on.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, Naruto has some of the best characters in anime, hands down. Protagonists like Naruto, Shikamaru, Kiba etc and antagonists like Itachi, Nagato, Madara are some of the best ever in anime history. But I feel that as the series progresses, the series starts focusing too much on Naruto and Sasuke and leaves out interesting supporting characters. Even the notoriously bad guys are somehow turned into good guys through some bullshit backstory so that they MUST turn good before they die, even evil-F*CKING-Madara. so the series kinda ruins the characters it brought up, though I wouldn't say they are bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation too goes downhill since the beginning, and this is one of the worst aspects of the show. Too many still images, too many flashbacks, too long recaps are all there to increase the runtimes and save up some budget. There were some arcs that were decently animated, but others are sloppy and still to the point I sometimes thought my computer froze.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has a great Ninja-esque felling to it, and it unique and in most instances, pretty catchy. Most of the opening songs are great while the endings are average (I guess). The voice acting is done greatly, as one would expect of anime (lol). The dub, of course, is terrible.WATCH THE CAPTIONS!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Naruto is good if you ignore the plethora of fillers, the sloppy animation and the terrible dragging on of its episodes, but that just can't be ignore can they?\\n\\n",

The overlaying story is very well done(for the most part). the art, i like(unlike some younger people used to way different quality). Sound is on point. Unique and impactful. That being said, everything else about the show is mediocre at best. The characters advance, but done actually DEVELOP, with the exception of naruto and sasuke(i'll give you shikimaru as well i suppose). Sakura learns to fight, and then barely does. everyone else has basically a static personality that may change a little bit, but thengoes back to as it was. This show, along with bleach, are what i call failed potential. Great premises, could go so far, but seems to fall short due to filler and mediocre character development. I will say the show is enjoyable, but come prepared with a filler guide and if your anything like me, u can watch naruto and around 100 episodes of shippuden before you feel it's worth watching. as for me it was the first death involving an akatsuki attack(if you've watched, you know who) that finally made the show seem to have some form of realism and depth and frankly it shouldnt have taken that long. If a 12 episode anime with a crappy story can make me cry, why did it 300+ for shippuden to illicit a similar response? If you read this, thank you and i encourage you to watch the show, as it lasted for a reason, even if i feel it fell short of its mark.",

I read the manga up to where it is now, and I can see how it got there, but how the anime maintains fans still amazes me. The fans are classified as \"Narutards\" to the public, due to its overwhelming popularity.\r\nThey provide 20 or 40 episodes of filler after 20 slow plot episodes, and it's just not funny at this point. I already stopped watching it an entirely moved back tothe manga. The manga still manages to keep me interested, but the anime is dead to me.

            "content": "It's been nearly 4 years since I reviewed the original Naruto and nearly 8 since I finished watching the Japanese dub. Being bored of recent anime seasons I decided to watch Shippuden. Gosh... 3 months later and 400+ episodes finished and here I am.\r\nI'm old now but not quite old enough to be jaded on things I used to love. I still love and enjoy the original Naruto and series like Naruto. It's a light hearted, filled with emotion show that just pulls all the right strings. It's a show that I can rewatch random episodes and still feel the same way as if Iwas watching it for the first time. Naruto ended on good terms, the turn of Sasuke seemed like a natural progression which was foreshadowed since the beginning. A classic betrayal that didnt need a 500+ episodes. Well.. that's what I thought heading into Shippuuden and boy I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThere was so much more story that needed to be told. While the first half I commented on the strength of the side characters.  Shippuuden is about Naruto, when he is absent the show drags. And it drags quite a bit with filler and some boring arcs. But if you go pass the fillers (which have improved somewhat with some really good moments) you get just pure shounen goodness. \\n\\n\r\nI'm updating this review to reflect the entirety of Shippuuden. The show is massive there's some good aspects some pretty bad and downright terrible moments. The ninja war arc was overblown and must have been terrible to watch week in. Together it kind of works but barely. What saves the show is Naruto himself. \\n\\n\r\nWhat started as an annoying titular character becomes Naruto the hokage during shippuuden. It's hard to stay with a series for 10+ yrs and almost 1K episodes. So hard in fact if you did end up finishing both series you're pretty much automatically a fanboy/girl. I can see why the fandom died down in favor of shorter with a more 'impact per episode' quotient. However watching Naruto grow up over that long period makes it feel more significant. In that way it surpasses it's contemporaries plus the new upstarts.",

            "content": "Peace to all.\r\nI don't want to be considered as the hater here about Naruto Shippuden. Don't get me wrong. I have watched the complete manga and also \"Naruto Anime\" complete and I have found them both very pleasant; great series with a excelent history and a whole new world, with the exception of the last episodes. \r\nLet me make it very clear. This review is about Naruto Shippuden, the anime, not the manga of Naruto or the anime Naruto, which are great.\r\nStory 7 of 10:\r\nFirst of all, I would like to say that NS is pretty much overrated. The main spine of the story isvery good, but is (most of the times) very predictible. Basing on the motivation and purpose of the main chatacter we could say that it's monotonous and ever sometimes annoying. The anime is full of pointless filler plots that the team of production use to gain some time, making the story a total mess. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7 of 10: \\n\r\nNot much to say about it. In this part I have to explain that I was very disappointed with the animation and art of this anime. Having watched Naruto, you'll know that I mean. Some fights were just poorly made and sometimes it even gives the impression of being made by some kind of fanart (without stealing credit to the great FanArts that are out there.)\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 of 10:\\n\r\nThe sound is in fact very good. Almost all the main songs (Ending or opening) are well made and kept a good relation with the serie. The soundtrack is fun and unique, not being able to compare to any other thing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8 of 10:\\n\r\nHere you have a good variety. Everyone has it's own history. You'll surely find one that you will be identified with. The characters are marked by families and a sort of abilities so it's very easy to found a favorite and embrace it. Here, I have to make the exception of the fill stories, whose characters are just useless. Totally useless.\\n\\n\r\nFinaly in Enjoyment and Overall it's a solid 7 of 10:\\n\r\nYou can definetly have some fun and exceiment watching this anime, especialy if you saw Naruto (If you havent dont watch this one, xD), buuuut (and it's a big \"but\") the animation and plot takes a lot of the enjoyment of the series, so badly sometimes that it's even  harmfull to your eyes. If you dont believe me, search \"Pain's fight\" in youtube. Just saying.",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuden. This show is both loved and demised. I personally like the series, it's good and nice to watch, nothing overly amazing and not that much overly crap shoot stuff I hate. (OH WAIT)\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story in Shippuden is nice, all wrapped up with a bow. At times it is serious and somewhat thrilling to watch, and other times you're blowing bubbles in your chocolate milk as people talk about stuff for over a minute. The overall plot in the story stays the same almost the entire way through, Naruto wants to \"save\" Sasuke, somehow stop Akatsuki, and be recognized by the village. Thelast one happens after Pain is defeated, and none of the other ones have happened so far so, more sludging through. (WEEEE)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe animation changes so much throughout this series, in such varying degrees and yes, I know that the studio has a budget, but when you use the same flashback over five times, barely even ****ing shade anything, keep characters frozen still while they're talking, and try to pass off people staring at each other for a FULL MINUTE as part of the show, you start to wonder how Studio Pierrot is even doing. But the show does have nice, fantastic animation. It's just not as frequent. Also, some of the best animation and shading I've seen in this show have been during fights and the OPs and EDs, and some other places throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThis is a another reason why people hate Shippuden. I'm not talking about the voice actors, they're great, I'm talking about the music. Sure, there are nice tracks throughout the series, some are beautiful, others I could somewhat jam to. But when I think that you've played that same stupid \"OMG SUSPENSE SH*T IS HAPPENING\" track for the hundredth time, I feel like face-desking. So many tracks are overly repeated to the point where you feel like you could play them if someone gave you the instrument they were playing the music with somewhat mediocrity. I'm also including OPs and EDs. A lot of the openings and endings sound great, like \"Cascade\" and \"FLAME\" Others sound, well, annoying, overly produced, and bleh. BLEH. Like the sh*tfest which is \"Totsugeki Rock\". Just, ewwww.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are nice. Sure, some of them are kinda tropey, but most them have something unique. Naruto seems to go through lots of pressure, CAUSE GUESS WHAT? OP PEOPLE WANNA MURDER YA! So he gets to experience and grow through that. Sakura is still romanticizing with hopes of being with Sasuke, and I can be harsh here, but I can't. I'm a hopeless romantic too. *sigh* She is tough though, and doesn't take no sh*t. Sai is shown to have had a bond with a person who was like a brother to him, and they then had to fight to the death, (**** you Danzou) and it had feels. Sasuke is a stupid hormone controlled idiot who wants to destroy the thing his brother protected, and \"build a new nation\". Can I call him stupid again?The other characters are fine, but a lot of them you couldn't really feel for since you didn't know that much about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nFILLER. FILLER. FFFFFIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. I\"M HERE WANTING TO SEE A NEW EPISODE OF CANON, I SAY, CANON SHIPPUDEN, AND PIERROT THROWS A ****ING FILLER EPISODE OUT. AND IT\"S AT SUCH UNNECESSARY MOMENTS TOO, LIKE A BATTLE JUST ENDED, EMOTIONAL SH*T HAPPENED, AND YOU THEN GET FILLER, YOU THEN FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TWO TO THREE WEEKS AGO, AND YOU DON'T GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HAVE TO REMIND YOURSELF WHAT THE **** HAPPENED, OR YOU JUST FORGET ENTIRELY IF THE FILLER RUNS FOR EIGHTY YEARS. AND SOMETIMES THE FILLER SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO THE MAIN STORY AND IT'S BULLSH*T. THE PEOPLE THAT CAN JUST BINGE THIS SHOW AND SKIP FILLERS I WISH I COULD PUNCH. *heavy breathing* The fights are nice as well, like GAI V MADARA. IT WASN'T WORTH THE WAIT, BUT IT WAS STILL AWESOME.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nShippuden is an average anime. It's ruined by filler that isn't even interesting or good in the first place, constant reused flashbacks that taint the whole entire series, and the animation at times can be atrocious. (See Pain V Naruto, or ALL THE STILL SHOTS EVER SEEN) The fights can be fun, emotional, or awesome. The main story is nice, but falters at times. The sound can be the most annoying thing of the show at times, but can also be charming or pleasant. This show has over 400 episodes. If you are a person who likes 13 episode anime, then this series is going to be tough on you. If you don't like shonen, then stay away. If you're expecting romance, there ain't a lot of it, I gotta tell ya. There's only around four major moments out of over 400 episodes. If you want awesome action stuff, then this show may fit to your tastes.",

            "content": "My Thoughts on the Ending of Naruto\r\nFirst thing first. I will miss Naruto like no other. I first came into contact with Naruto way back in the 7th grade of middle school when it used to air in English on Toonami. It was love at first sight. The date was September 10th, 2005. I eagerly awaited each week for new episodes, and Naruto never disappointed, even on its worst episode. Fast forward 9 years later, and I'm still eagerly awaiting each new episode every week, even though I have already finished the events of the manga. Critics of Naruto say that the anime/ manga hasgone on for way too long and that it should have ended earlier; it's no longer good. I can't deny that Naruto has a ton of plot holes, but even so, the author has given me something to consistently look forward to for 9 years. How many anime series can you say have done something like that for you? \\n\\n\r\nMoreover, my interest in Naruto is not solely tied to the plot. To this day, I've bought 12 Naruto games and counting. I love the Naruto universe. I love the characters. I love the powers. I love the action. I love the voice actors. All of the Naruto games I own do an amazing job at recreating the characters from the series and letting you feel as though you are the character. When I choose Sasuke in the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, I feel like I become Sasuke. All of his powers from the show, I can command at the tips of my fingers. I'm the one using the Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu, and I'm the one unleashing Susanoo. As a result, the joy I get from being my favorite characters in these games heightens the amount of pleasure I take away from the series itself. \\n\\n\r\nIt's been a couple weeks since Naruto ended, and it's still hard to believe it's over. When I read the final chapter, I honestly didn't want to turn the pages. Seeing all of the characters that started off at 12 years old become adults, get married, and have kids, really got believing that it is in fact over--the end of a generation. I was 12 years old myself when I began watching Naruto, now I'm 21. In a way, I feel as though I've grown up with these characters and that my youth is also approaching it's end soon. In the coming years, I'm not sure if I will ever experience an anime that has done what Naruto has done for me ever again. I'm really sad that my journey with Naruto is rapidly approaching it's end, but I'm also thankful for these past 9 years. Arigatou gozaimasu, Masashi Kishimoto.",

The sad stories in Naruto always make me cry and there are lots of hilarious moments. In addition, this is one of the few anime where the English dub does not tick me off.  \r\nAs viewers we are able to see Naruto's growth as a character from an immature brat to someone who can truly understand the pains of mankind. The only downside for me about this anime is how long you must wait forthe episodes to come out. I've been watching Naruto since I was in 6th grade and its been 10 years.",

            "content": "NARUTO SHIPPUDEN, for now, is one of my favorite animes of all time. Despite this receiving the highest rating of ten out of ten, I do believe this show still has flaws (a bit of them). Also spoilers.\r\nLet me just get out of the way what I don\u2019t like about the show. Firstly, as you can probably guess- the convoluted nature of the war arc. The worst part of it comes down to Obito post unveiling with all the ten tails garbage. And then, to top it off- the twist of Black Zetsu being the manipulator and bringing back Kaguya. See, I was entirely finewith Madara, who made morse sense to be the final antagonist. His relationship with Hashirama was really well developed in flashbacks and had great purpose. I really enjoyed Obito when he was under the persona of the masked man (Madara). He had this menacing voice and sense of intrigue. But then he loses that voice since it\u2019s actually Madara\u2019s and has this terrible raspy voice. While I\u2019m actually fine with Naruto being the good side of the coin while Nagato was the bad side juxtaposition, it just didn\u2019t work well with Obito and Naruto. I do not feel bad for Obito at all. I just never connected to him, and the fact that Naruto said he was the \u201ccoolest guy\u201d was just baffling. Obito\u2019s motivations were good on paper. Witnessing Kakashi\u2019s accidental murder of Rin and life spiraling out of control and just looking to seek her out again. I just never fully connected with it and it slightly held down the arc. Kaguya is self explanatory, just because she is the most powerful, she isn\u2019t a good antagonist. Her flashbacks were boring and she had no depth. Naruto and Sasuke being the descendants of Ashura and Indra was also pretty dumb and felt a bit forced. That\u2019s about it regarding my flaws about the war, I thoroughly enjoyed most of it. \\n\\n\r\nMy second problem with the show is the filler and the way the show is structured. I\u2019m not necessarily angry about filler episodes itself since you can just check which ones are which online and just skip them. I\u2019m more annoyed at the way recaps are done at the beginning and how episodes are specifically structured. I feel really sorry for everyone watching it while it was still airing. Despite it being a staple of shonen and the reason being is because of its production being weekly, it ends up not holding up well post fact when you\u2019re going through the series all at once. The fan edit Naruto Kai apparently addresses these issues, but it\u2019d be interesting if an official cut was made by the creators themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s about it. There\u2019s some small things that bother me a bit but I love pretty much everything else about the show. \\n\\n\r\nThis is complimenting a bit of the original Naruto more but Shippuden continues the trend of great world building. The Shinobi world is so expansive with just so much history behind it. We get a better view at all the different villages which all have different aesthetics. The Sand Village\u2019s establishment at the beginning with them explaining how they can\u2019t grow medicine so easily added to the story in an interesting way. Also learning about the beginning of the Leaf Village with Hashirama and Madara just added so much depth and finally learning the story behind the statues at the Final Valley was great. \\n\\n\r\nThe art design within the show is amazing as well. Every character has got redesigned for the season and I believe for the better. Naruto has a much more sleek design with the black instead of blue. And while the Akatsuki robes were featured in the original- they\u2019re just so dope. Also the quality of the show just increased ten fold due to more technology being available and a higher budget. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in the original Naruto was great, but Shippuden\u2019s managed to top it. The show opts for more violin and orchestra to present a darker aura for this new era of Naruto. Every track plays at a perfect time, always making each scene as effective. The Hurricane Suite is one of my favorites. While having dark pieces, it also shines with more triumphant music. These songs add so much to the atmosphere in every way. Also the Shippuden OP1 and ending 1 are a banger. The first thirty episodes got me so hyped every time I\u2019d watch and finish one. Also, OP2\u2019s YOU ARE MY FRIEEEEEND is pretty catchy I can\u2019t lie. The rest of the OPs are alright, not that great. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing I primarily love about the show is my emotional connection to the characters. I genuinely care about most of these characters and their backstories tend to be really sad. I\u2019ve shed some tears during this show with its handling of grief. The scene after Asuma\u2019s death where Shikamaru and his father are playing shogi and he flips it over and whales out in tears. That is just a powerful execution that just sends chills to my core. I care deeply for all these characters, despite this show sort of shoving a few of them off to the side- most of them have had their development. Besides shoving Rock Lee and Neji to the side, Kishimoto knew which of the characters weren\u2019t really that interesting and focused on a lot of better ones. Specifically Shikamaru who has developed so brilliantly from the small little slacker into absolute genius leader. Meanwhile, we have the central conflict of the whole show - Naruto and Sasuke. You care so much for Naruto and feel for him that he just wants his friend back but for a while, you just can\u2019t understand why he keeps bothering. And as the series continues to progress, you finally see how deep that friendship meant to Naruto himself and how Sasuke\u2019s repressed feelings for still thinking of Naruto as a friend is slowly revealed. The show is full of emotionally touching stuff but to name a few, Itachi\u2019s reanimation death, Naruto after Jiraiya\u2019s death, Minato with Naruto, etc. \\n\\n\r\nAdding to the emotional core, is the superb voice work done in Japanese. Every actor has a unique voice that perfectly fits their character. Naruto\u2019s voice is giddy and high pitched yet not annoying. He\u2019s kind and genuine. Every actor pours their heart out into the role, with bursts of anger and fits of sadness. You feel these moments so much more with this excellent showcase of acting. \\n\\n\r\nAnother great part of the show is the thematic value and moral grey area presented. While the first Naruto showed up the glorious, fun parts of Konoha, this one flips everything on its head. It questions every \u201cmorally right\u201d piece in the series and the idea of shinobi. Itachi Uchiha\u2019s revelation is also a perfect example of this moral grey area. A lot of people will quickly hate him due to his decision seeming too grandiose and horrifying to slaughter his clan for the sake of the village. Others will realize how this decision does not have a good answer. It\u2019s the worser of two evils. If Itachi didn\u2019t kill the Uchiha, and joined them in a civil war. Danzo would most likely have gathered all neighboring villages to attack against them. The series, while somewhat still celebrating him, has the perfect send off for him when he tells Sasuke that he never has to forgive him but he\u2019ll always love him. Nagato\u2019s entire purpose as Pain, leader of the Akatsuki, presents another moral grey area between him and Naruto. The cycle of hatred continuing. Humans just don\u2019t have the capability to create peace since we always lust after violence. You can relate to Nagato\u2019s ideals and after learning everything - you know his actual true quest was for peace. Sasuke\u2019s arc of wanting to change the village and seeks to be the Hokage also flips the ideology of the Leaf being a perfect system in contrast to Naruto\u2019s constant hope to become this Hokage figure. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation primarily was well done with a few small mishaps every now and then. The most annoying part of the show is during some fight scenes, the outlines on characters disappeared and they looked a bit strange when fighting. Despite this, the fights always had a sense of excitement and energy. \\n\\n\r\nA common complaint is the show delves into a Dragon Ball type series once everyone\u2019s power continues to rise and rise but I disagree a bit. I feel as if the show has always held onto that idea of strategic tactics but it ended up becoming on a much larger scale. Despite all the tailed beast forms and Susano\u2019os, there was always scheming going on against Obito, Madara and even Kayuga by the end of it. One of my favorite arcs is the Hidan/Kakuzu storyline where the amount of strategy is absolutely brilliant. Usually when strategies are at full form, it\u2019s due to the genius of Shikamaru in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is also surprisingly a plus. While always remaining interesting, the show uses a slower pace to build up tension and character. Naruto\u2019s rise to god-like power was absolutely justified by how much we\u2019ve seen him struggle and be below a lot of his comrades, and the sweat and tears behind his training. It was perfectly built up as he continued to train to be able to control Kurama. The only arc that overstays its welcome by a long shot is the full war arc and spanned out way too long. \\n\\n\r\nThere is so much more to say, but this was my attempt to explain my love for the show. One last note, fuck the english dub for this show. \\n\\n",

The biggest problem people seem to have with this is the amount of filler that is in it, which obviously is a problem. But almost all of the anime that are long like this have alot of filler and it`s way worse with other anime. Sometimes in this anime it`s even pretty enjoyable. It can give a nice relief to some of the intense situations that are going on. But if you wanted to skip the filler it`s really simple and obvious.There are many sites that show which episodes are legit or not.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSo other than the Filler this is the greatest anime/tv show I have ever watched. Everything is so well done in this, the characters are all super likeable and perfect. Even the bad guys are awesome in this. Plus there are so many characters that its easy to get attatched to a couple of them. I guess it`s similar to One piece in that way, so if you liked One Piece you`re definitely going to like as much or probably more.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound:\\n\r\nTHe animation in this is well done, it`s definitely better than naruto was but it`s nothing groundbreaking. I didnt have any problems with the sound, I actually really loved the voice actors for english. Also has some pretty good action music and intros. Most of the songs are pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nThe story:\\n\r\nI loved the story to this anime. it has the perfect story. There is just the right amount of action, comedy and serious moments in this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nI highly recommend that you watch this anime, it is long so it`ll take a while but it`ll definitely be worth it. You will feel like you lived an entirely different life.\\n\\n\\n",

A bad thing or to me I didn't see it as a must to happen was the final battle, after you watch the 4th great ninja war maybe will find that it wasn't necessary to.make a battle between Naruto and Sasuke,  I didn't liked it, and the fight was exactly like Naruto part 1 when Sasuke left and Naruto tried to stop him, I didn't enjoyed as I was expecting.

            "content": "Above all, anime is a journey. Each different show carries its own distinct narrative fueled by a cast of characters residing in a setting; one thing that separates anime from the majority of mainstream Western television is this fact, that this industry of Japan puts in the effort and grunt work to adapt manga and novels and light novels and video games and create its own original work that follows a continuous story that\u2019s not episodic. Now there are plenty of episodic anime like Cowboy Bebop and Mushishi; but for the most part, this medium is known for running multi-episode stories on television. Shows likeOne Piece, Dragon Ball, and Naruto that air for 10+ years are rare west of Japan, and for obvious reasons. Such commitment requires significant amounts of money, time, and human capital.\\n\\n\r\nThe longer a journey goes, the more you grow to love the characters, obviously. One immensely popular show that\u2019s by all rights really good, Game of Thrones, in Western television has aired for seven seasons so far since 2011. And that\u2019s enough time, plus the time progression within the story, to cherish certain characters as they\u2019ve grown throughout. I\u2019ll name Arya Stark as a prime example.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned Naruto earlier. This amazing anime aired from 2002 to 2017 for a total of 126 (Naruto) + 262 (Naruto: Shippuuden) = 388 episodes or approximately 142 hours, or 6 days, and that\u2019s not counting filler. That\u2019s also not counting Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, which may also be quite long. Compare this to Game of Thrones, which takes up 2 days. If we\u2019ve been able to grow to adore certain characters in Game of Thrones after 2 days, then all the more so for Naruto, wouldn\u2019t you think?\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. My point is, that regardless of the various flaws in Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden, it\u2019s worth watching to go through this journey and see Naruto\u2019s way of Ninja. You must consider Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden together as one cohesive whole; although the latter is significantly more mature and improved on many points. Flashbacks are crucial to the characters\u2019 development in Naruto; in the same way, when you look back to little annoying Naruto in the first episodes, and compare him back then to who he is now as (spoiler alert, but we all knew it was coming) Hokage, like seven hells, the growth is stunning. One of Naruto\u2019s strong aspects, if not its strongest aspect, is its characters. Not only are they well fleshed out for the most part, but the way they interact and display their emotions, especially when amassed over 15 years, make them realistic in a way that One Piece and Bleach aren\u2019t able to convey. It\u2019s difficult to describe each of them with one word; right now I was going to write something like \u201cShikamaru\u2019s nonchalance, Sakura\u2019s kindness\u201d, but then realized the futility. It would do these shinobi injustice to describe them thus; as two-dimensional they are on the screen, they\u2019re completely three-dimensional to my heart. The main characters in particular -- Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno -- these three are just\u2026 human.\\n\\n\r\nI could end this review right here. I could say that the journey itself with these ninja is worth alone. But I won\u2019t, because the Naruto universe presented through the anime has so much more to give you. From now on, I\u2019ll be focusing on Naruto: Shippuuden, which let me tell you again, is much better than Naruto. So when you watch Naruto and aren\u2019t too intrigued by the no. 1 most unpredictable ninja, keep in mind that this is just a prequel, an extended prologue, to the true story that lies in Naruto: Shippuuden.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll start with the soundtrack. Yeah, it was kind of annoying, those tribal-esque war cries in Naruto, that played whenever Naruto would bust out a new technique. But Shippuuden brings you an intense score of Star Wars Duel of the Fates-esque dark choral majesty to back certain antagonists that are SO BADASS. They\u2019re so cool that I actually didn\u2019t want them to lose. The way they talked with each other, showing their cold personalities supported by crazy strength, oh my I really liked those guys and once the story moved on the show actually lost some of its dark hue that had made it so appealing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is what really distinguishes Shippuuden from its counterparts like One Piece, Bleach, Fairy Tail, etc. The main villains are easy to empathize with. They have legitimate reasons for doing what they do. They\u2019re not even evil to the sense of the word, they\u2019re just trying to enforce peace in a war-torn world in their own revolutionary way. Again, this is a story in which I actually sided with the bad guys more than the good guys.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s just one side of the coin gilded by the Muses. Shippuuden is high-octane wicked cool at times, but also deeply emotional at others. The soundtrack is also wonderfully beautiful and heartrending, for there are plenty of emotive moments. You can view the entirety of Shippuuden as a plot of salvation. Naruto, who possesses a power similar to Monkey D. Luffy that enables him to befriend enemies and change the hearts of those he meets, commits himself to saving a certain other character at the onset of Shippuuden. His almost blind devotion to this task, coupled with his lesser intelligence and sheer stubbornness, aren\u2019t exactly desired traits but his willingness to believe and keep on striving, no matter the circumstances, make them meritable.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll now discuss plot armor. This narrative-prevalent device is so endemic to shounen that it\u2019s practically getting on my nerves. (Bleach, I\u2019m talking to you.) Yeah we don\u2019t want the good guys to die, but in real life it doesn\u2019t make sense for like all the good guys to survive and all the bad guys to die. If you want to make the gravity of the conflict greater, then even some good guys should die. It\u2019s not like the good guys were stronger than the bad guys at the start. Heck, more often than not the bad guys are much stronger.\\n\\n\r\nHunter x Hunter (2011) is a good example of a shounen in which good guys do die, and the main characters don\u2019t always win their battles. Shingeki no Kyojin, although protecting the main characters extremely well, does kill off many supporting characters. One Piece, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t even kill off the bad guys except all of those marine grunts that fell off the ships. The bosses are just soundly knocked out cold and wounded, but that\u2019s it, they\u2019re still alive.\\n\\n\r\nShippuuden does protect many of its good guys, but several pretty important ones do get killed, and each time the death carries a weight that resonates long afterwards. What\u2019s more, being a world of shinobi who usually fight to the death, the loser does die (usually). There is that part of a certain jutsu that severely redefines plot armor, or should I say, plot reanimation, but that\u2019s essential to a certain extensive arc so I guess it\u2019s okay but I\u2019m still not too sure about it.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s discuss the art. The improvement from Naruto, which was kind of hazy and reminiscent of classics like Evangelion, to Shippuuden, which has pleased me with its palette of gentle and warm colors, is legitimately aesthetic. I\u2019ll even dare to say, that at certain moments, it rivals the plethora of modern 1- and 2-cour anime that are well drawn and styled. Towards the end I discerned another shift upwards in the quality, although by that time the characters\u2019 faces became even more sharply defined, like what you see in anime produced by ufotable. I\u2019ll also mention that for certain fights Studio Pierrot lowered the quality, but that\u2019s OK, the fights are so fluid and berserk that it doesn\u2019t really make a difference, and it actually makes it look more artistic.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fights\u2026 damn. The fights in Shippuuden are some of the best I\u2019ve seen in anime. That last fight in particular. Much of it is hand-to-hand, and watching shinobi battle it out, kicking, punching, putting hands together for some jutsu, summoning creatures, manipulating the elements, manipulating the laws of physics, it\u2019s insane. They\u2019re not quite as realistic as those in Gintama, nor as visually alluring as those in multiple ufotable works, but they\u2019re certainly a sight to witness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, I\u201dll mention the plot. Many have criticized the flow of antagonists up the climax of Shippuuden, especially how they were connected. The way I see it, the fact that Antagonist A was related to Antagonist B who was related to Antagonist C isn\u2019t necessarily cause for complaint, but rather, cause for acknowledgement. Well, at least I personally like it when something the viewer suspects to be fact is in truth something deeper. The last conflict is somewhat stretched, though, looking back on it, but as we\u2019ve seen since the beginning, a fight between shinobi isn\u2019t as simple as stronger beats weaker; strategic use of jutsu and deception is as natural to shinobi combat as making webs is for spiders. That\u2019s just how they do it, so as a matter of course any battle between strong characters is bound to last for some time.\\n\\n\r\nJust kidding, I forgot to mention the filler. I really don\u2019t like how this is the #1 cause of complaint for many people. Yes, it is the studio\u2019s fault for creating so many filler episodes that plague the viewer\u2019s experience each week. But you have to understand, people. The medium of anime is not like the medium of novels. Books are completed before publication, their stories finished. Anime are by no means finished, as each week a new episode that only furthers the plot incrementally is aired; furthermore, each episode is the culmination of many hours and days of grueling, collaborative work among many people, each contributing a different part from the music to the storyboards to the animation to the production aspects and so on. Watch Shirobako for more detail. What\u2019s more, the anime industry is heavily pulled back by meager budgets. Before being adapted into anime, manga have to meet certain standards of popularity before studios feel like it\u2019s worth spending the time and money hoping to make a profit out of a 1- or 2-cour or multi-season anime. Animators especially aren\u2019t paid very much for the immense amount of work they put in. And the fact that anime that are based on manga, which are also being serialized on a regular basis, only leads to filler as well. If the anime in terms of storyline has met where the manga is, there\u2019s obviously not enough material to adapt, and since the anime doesn\u2019t want to bereave its fans, it resorts to unrelated filler to kill time. Also filler and/or recap episodes serve as backup for when the studio falls behind its deadlines, as they\u2019re much easier to make.\\n\\n\r\nSo let me make this clear. Having filler, even lots of filler, doesn\u2019t detract from the quality of the show itself. That\u2019s a mere technicality. Obviously if the industry were better funded and its employees paid more, we would see less of filler. If Shippuuden didn\u2019t have any filler, I can guarantee that its general conception would be significantly higher. Moreover, in today\u2019s age of services like blessed Crunchyroll, you can skip the damned filler as easily as Itachi throwing kunai at targets.\\n\\n\r\nWho cares about the length. Yeah you\u2019re busy (I\u2019m in college) and Naruto is crazy long and it looks like it may never end with this new show called Boruto. That\u2019s original, isn\u2019t it. The more episodes, the merrier. The more to enjoy this fulfilling journey with Naruto Uzumaki, the shounen who dreams of becoming Hokage and showing the world his unique way of Ninja.",

            "content": "Naruto as a series, is an incredibly complicated masterpiece. Assuming the person reading this has first finished the original Naruto series of our blond haired hero in his trademark Orange tracksuit, I will give a quick summary of some of the critiques I have of this series and what to look forward to in this next amazing sequel.\r\nFirst of all, the soundtrack remains iconic and amazing. The openings remain  catchy and the soundtrack is both epic and marvelous. It tends to move away from the very fast-paced Japanese sounding instrumentals of the first series and enters into hymn and choir territory, especially with relevanceto characters of God-like status relating to the plotline.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto shippuden is a very lore based series, and relates more towards philosophy and morality then the first series ever did. The battles are long, the speeches are longer. I assume Creator Kishimoto wanted his viewers to age up with the anime, beginning to question things they never did as a child. Therefore, expect the anime to become very complex and confusing at some points.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, The loveable Konoha  side characters that we independently learned and watched fight in the Chuunin exams and Sasuke retrieval Arc have a lesser role in the sequel. New characters and plot lines are introduced and many shinobis are cast to the side lines. The sequel is very much about focusing Sasuke and Naruto's bond and Naruto's own personal character development..\\n\r\n I would argue that  the young shinobis still have much relevance, but less screen time in the main storyline as it progresses.\\n\r\nThe meme of 'NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARUTOOOOOOO' and 'SASUUUUUUUUUUKEH' is pretty much relevant to the series as Naruto fights further to bring Sasuke back to the village. ^_^\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters, especially the Akatsuki characters throughout the story, are super interesting and unique, so look out for them. They are all powerful individual shinobi with incredibly unique designs and jutsus. I found them to be the most enjoyable of the series and I hope the reader does too!\\n\\n\r\nNaruto Shippuden may not have the carefree, often comedic,  nostalgic attitude of the first series main storyline, but it still provides a much enjoyable series and definitely a fantastic must see sequel to the first series to finally get a sense of closure.\\n\\n\r\nI have repeatedly stated the 'main storyline' through out this review, because if you thought the fillers of the first series was bad after the Sasuke retrieval arc...then I have news for you. There is a lot of filler. If you only care about the story and not the alternative universes or random plot lines, you may want to stick to the main story line and skip the filler episodes, however some of the fillers I'd suggest keeping a look out for - especially the alternative universe ones, as they give an interesting opposite perspective to the main canon universe. Just try not to get jealous if the alternative universe seems more...idealic then the real world, blood thirsty shinobi world..that was my trap of watching them! I wanted things to be different! ^_^''\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy Naruto as much as the rest of us do, and watch our snarky, smart-mouthed Kyuubi protagonist manifest and develop into an amazing, strong-willed character with all his comrades behind him as he fights for what he believes to be right and true. Dattebayo!\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, this review contains spiders and spoilers so watch out. This isn\u2019t going to be a spoiler free review, because I feel like I need to talk about specific things in the show to fully explain my opinion and score of it. So if you haven\u2019t seen the show and don\u2019t wanna be spoiled, stop reading. \r\nGosh\u2026 where do I start when talking about Naruto Shippuden? If I was to graph the quality of the series as it went on it would look a lot like a sin curve, with a big old dip right at the end of it. The individual arcs are justso inconsistent with one another in terms of quality. And for every great arc like the Pain Assult or Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant there is an equally bad thing, such as the seemingly endless, fillerific and boring Fourth Shinobi War arc. \\n\\n\r\nI guess if you were to list everything that happens in Naruto Shippuden as either good or bad then the good would potentially outweigh the bad by a tiny bit. But the problem is the bad bits are so bad that they really do drag down the great bits of the show. The show has this incredibly strong fetish for redeeming villains as they die, which I think is fine to occasionally do when it fits, but if you try to do it for every villain, which Naruto has a lot of, then it just feels so damn shoehorned. For example, Pain was an amazing villain and the two arcs with him as the major bad guy are some of the greatest anime episodes I have ever watched. It was tense, there was death, character arcs and consequences and Naruto\u2019s fight with him truly was his graduation into being a fully-fledged hero after so long. Then when he was defeated Pain just decided to become good for poorly explained reasons and brought back everyone he had killed besides one person back to life. Effectively ruining and retconning most of the good stuff he as a villain did. And for what? To make you feel bad for the guy that just spent the last 20 episodes being ninja Stalin? Scenes like that just reverse half an arc really paint a picture that this story really wasn\u2019t planned out very well, if at all. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that ending\u2026 it honestly goes against fundamental storytelling basics. To briefly explain it, after flip flopping between major villains like it was going out of style, it looked like Madara Uchiha would be it, the big baddie was finally settled. They managed to set it up so that he was the mastermind and cause of almost everything evil in the plot, from the nine-tails attack to the actions of most of the other major villains to the death of the girl that turned Obito into an evil person. They made him complex, making him not specifically evil, he just wanted everyone to not have to suffer like he did and have a blissful, perfect life. His plan had even succeeded, and only Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi and Sakura were awake to stop him. And he had basically become a ninja god and is ready to unleash his full power on them. Then\u2026 he just is killed and replaced by someone we had heard about once beforehand. No foreshadowing about it, the villain the show had spent so long building up had been swapped with some random woman that was purely evil with vague motivations who is pretty quickly dispatched of. What was the point of that? To extend this crap even further? \\n\\n\r\nAs for the fillers, well to be fair to they are better than the filler bits from the original Naruto, which were painful. Yeah it isn\u2019t amazing television but filler arcs like the Three Tails one could be decent enough time wastes, and seeing the fillers flesh out some of the backstory of the world was nice. But the repeated flashbacks are a huge issue, I swear some of them were repeated like once an episode at some points. If I hear Obito say his stupid line about ninjas who abandon others being scum once more I think I might try to eat my desk. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a big problem with the side characters in that most of them are at points interesting but by the end of the show they are cast aside so that the show can focus just on Sakura, Kakashi, Naruto and Sasuke. And apart from Kakashi all of the main good guy characters are all just kinda\u2026 boring and bland. Except for Sasuke, he is just terrible and dumb. I get that in a series with as many side characters as Naruto you can\u2019t focus on all of them but seeing characters like Sai get so much work done early on in the series to make him somewhat interesting just to be completely ignored by the end is unsatisfying. But that sums up the problem with Naruto, it takes one step backwards for every single one it takes forward. It has so much promise and goodness, then it has a bunch of lacklustre stuff and badness to follow it up. \\n\\n\r\nIf I am being honest, Naruto Shippuden is enjoyable. There is enough good stuff and enough great stuff to entertain you, especially the bits directly from the manga. But if you are like me you will get frustrated watching it. It has the big problem where if a little more planning, polish and forethought was put into it then you would seriously have one amazing series. But the imperfections build, and they only get more and more noticeable as the show goes on. Heck I have barely spoken about the plot. But that is because the plot is hard to explain. Whilst not confusing it just goes all over the place, which isn\u2019t at all helped by the constant passing of the \u2018main bad guy\u2019 torch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I hope I am not sounding too harsh with this review, because I don\u2019t hate this show. I want to like it, because I remember sections of it like the Team 10 vs Hidan and Kakuzu fight or the Jiraiya vs Pain battle and really want to like it. But then I remember the niggling problems that bubble and build up as the show goes on, so I can\u2019t give it a higher rating than a 5. I mean the soundtrack is at least pretty damn great. Give it a go but don\u2019t be surprised if you end up hating it for its flaws.",

            "content": "Naruto, one of those legends in japanimation. No need to introduce it at this point... So for starters, I'll just say that this review will focus more on the anime aspect than on the story, which comes from the manga.\r\nI personnally really liked the manga, at least until the Pain arc.\r\nSTORY\r\nLong story short, it depends on the arc. This should be something obvious today : when making literally HUNDREDS of episodes, you can't hit a perfect score. There are some very good arcs and some much less interesting.\r\nMain strong point : from all those long-sh\u00f4nen anime/manga, Naruto is the most consistent, telling a straight story(from A to Z, without much detour).\\n\\n\r\nMain weakness : the fillers. There are WAY TOO MUCH and some of them have to be watched as they contain bits of the canon story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThis is what matters when making an anime adaptation of a manga. And I'll be blunt : the visuals were way too screwed up for me to enjoy Naruto.\\n\r\n- First, the drawings : they are way too simple. There are too few traits, and the colors are way too \"unicolor\".\\n\r\n- Then, the animation : this really depends on the episode. Some fights are simply amazing, but some of them are screwed up.\\n\r\n- Finally, there are no light effects (which is why it is all \"unicolor\").\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the visuals are way too simple and irregular.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nTakanashi is a genius of music. The OST is great, although if I had to compare with Fairy Tail, I would prefer the latter because of the style. I'm not really fan of the \"ninja music style\" from Naruto...\\n\r\nAs for the openings, there are so many...! Some of them are really good, some are not really memorable. I personnally really like the FLOW and Asian Kung-Fu Generation openings.\\n\r\nOverall it is really satisfying.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAgain, I won't really develop that point. Some of the characters are awesome, but I do feel like they could have done a better job with all those secondary characters. Naruto's friends aren't really interesting most of the time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nToo many fillers, visuals too simple, and an overall resullt way too irregular. Because of those points, I really didn't enjoy the anime of Naruto. I do like some parts of the manga, and I was really expecting a lot from some arcs in the anime version, but wound up disappointed because the animation is sometimes awful.",

            "content": "My First Review Here. English is not my main language so i may have some mistakes.\r\nFirst of all, the story of Naruto Shippuuden is not perfect and i give it 7 because of the fillers that were unnecessary but without them naruto would not be so popular and the memes around its fillers are amazing.There are some fillers that are good butt others are just so boring and uninteresting.\r\nSecond, The Art  I give it 6 because of Studio Perriot they fucked up a lot of the episodes with bad art and animation but instead they gave us a few rather 100+ episodes or sowith good art and animation like episode 322 with Madara.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8-Shippuuden has some of the best anime tracks.I think that a lot of people liked the sound/tracks of the naruto franchise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-7 Team 7 as characters developed a lot through the series.The other characters also had a major development. I like that we can see how the characters change through the series from being a kid who does only trouble to a hero and a legend and most importantly Hokage that is Naruto.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9. Naruto had many amazing fights,sad scenes and funny moments but the fillers ruined a part of the story and the hype.If only the art and animation for some of the fights were better then it'd be perfect but nonetheless i liked every bit of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nI will never Forget Naruto because it was a part of my life for a long time and it will be in the future.Next is Boruto I hope that it'll be as good as Naruto or better.\\n\r\nBelieve IT! :D \\n",

            "content": "\"In the ninja world, those who break the rules are scum, that's true, but those who abandon their friends are worse than scum.\" What a fun and long winded journey this was, but damn Im glad I experienced it. Last year I was one of few anime fans that never watched Naruto and now Im one of many to have completed the series. The prequel series ended with Naruto leaving his village to train with his sensei Jiraiya in order to prepare for his encounter with the Akatsuki. On the other hand Sasuke joined Orochimaru so he can get stronger in order to kill hisbrother Itachi. Due to the huge events waiting to come I had very high expectations heading into the sequel. The original was very good series with awesome fight scenes and did a great job on introducing the ninja world to the audience. I was both excited and nervous to see how the series as a whole would conclude hoping it would explore more of the ninja world and some of its characters. Now time to review the long sequel that is Naruto: Shippuden.***contains MINOR spoilers***\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:8/10\\n\r\nA great long winded coming of age story with deep themes and s lot of depth. The series isn't just about ninja conflict but about people growing up. We see Naruto and his friends go from children to teenagers to grown up in a way that's very satisfying giving all the dark moments they go through. Where the story truly excels is its world building. We are given all of the ancient history of the ninja world and it's all greatly expanded upon in the series. We learn all about the villages and great nations on how they look and impact the story and how they all contribute with one another. Pacing issues at times are a problem as there are so many training sequences with Naruto to the point where it got kinda repetitive. The story was also dragged heavily with once again its use of flashbacks and filler. However having seen all the back and side stories really packed an emotional punch that added so much depth to the main plot and in some ways outshined it. The story had several great moments but towards the end made some bad choices during the Fourth Ninja War. Overall the storyline is better than most shonens that Ive seen thus far.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nShippuden is a series that when it wants to it looks so damn GREAT. It became noticeable that during the more intense and violent battles of the series it uses different style animation that helps make the movements more fluid. This was done by animator Norio Matsumoto and notable examples of this would be Sasuke vs Deidara and Kakashi vs Obito. However the animation in the series wasn't always great and at times it looked too exaggerated. The most perfect example of this would be Naruto vs Pain where in some shots the fight looks so bad to the point fans made memes out of it. Usually in a long series keeping consistent animation is a hard thing to do and Shippuden does at times suffer from this but thumbs up for the series for not being afraid to use different animation for some of its scenes. Where the series really improve from the original were its editing and use of color palette. There are some views and angles of the series where it just looks downright beautiful that we didn't really get from the prequel. All in all it's the battles scenes where the art truly excels and its one of many reasons why Naruto is considered to have one of anime's most memorable fights. \\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this series is how memorable most of the quotes are. \"You presumptuously see yourself as the ruling powers, and distance yourself from death. Softened by peace, you've become thoughtless. Kill and be killed. Hatred connects the two.\" All of this was helped by great voice acting by the cast and there's so many quotes to choose from. The music overall is very good. Most of the tracks portraying some of the scenes more intense and emotional moments. Arguably the best track is Pain's theme song \"Girei\" it's a very dark and godly track that perfectly portrays the character. As for the opening and ending themes some were very good but some were okay. My favorite opening would have to be the first one \"Hero's Come Back\" from Nobodyknows. The OST's biggest strength were definitely the background tracks. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nIt is here where I think the series truly shines. The franchise as a whole is so character driven and really does an amazing job at making us feel for them especially the villains. There are some many characters that have their moments to leave an impression on the audience whether if it's from the use of backstory, interactions, personalities, or abilities. What makes this cast so fun is how much variety they have in their abilities. There are ninja who can spit fire, turn into paper, become giants, heal wounds, take over bodies, you name it and it really helps add joy to the cast as a whole. Character development is also big here as so many people learn and undergo changes from character arcs and make them complete. As with a lot of large casts giving depth to all is very tough and towards the end of the series a lot side characters do get pushed to the back to lead way for Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. It even throws in a villain at the very end with little to no build up and it really didn't help at all. Even so the series does such an amazing job at making most of its cast feel relevant to the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\\n\\n\r\n+Strong coming of age story with great exploration of deep themes(war, discrimination, vengeance, etc)\\n\r\n+A dominate cast with a surprising amount of complexity and backstory\\n\r\n+Outstanding world building that completely fleshes out the ninja world\\n\r\n+The final battle between Naruto and Sasuke\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\\n\r\n-THOSE DAMN FLASHBACKS!!\\n\r\n-Narrative starts to lose momentum as the series progresses\\n\r\n-Fourth Ninja World War\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Favorites\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s): Kakashi, Pain, and Itachi\\n\\n\r\nArc: Pain Assault\\n\\n\r\nFight: Kakashi vs Obito\\n\\n\\n\r\nBoy what a long yet legendary series this was. Naruto is a series of highs and lows but its highs really do outshine the lows for the most part. The franchise is an iconic juggernaut with huge merchandise and sales and its hard to find people who haven't heard of it. It has strong storylines, great battles, awesome characters, deep moments, I would have to say that it's w/o a doubt one of the best shonens anime has had yet and it's a franchise that I see myself talking about for years to come.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSub or Dub Recommendation: Sub",

            "content": "I do have to say that most of the time I enjoy watching Naruto but it certainly has its flaws and is far from perfect. I also think that you can't just discard fillers as necessary and just discard them while writing a review. \r\nLets start by looking at the most important part of an anime, the story.\r\nThe main story line is actually very well written and thought out. It gets me really into the anime and makes me want to keep watching all day if it were possible. Now the flaw are the fillers. Yes I know that fillers are necessary and I amnot saying that I disapprove of fillers. The problem I have with fillers in Naruto is the terrible quality and timing of them. If they were able to make a good storyline for them to follow during the fillers and not suddenly interrupt big moments in the anime I wouldn't mind that much at all.\\n\\n\r\nThere were even a few times where I dropped the anime in between because I got bored with it. But after a while I couldn't help myself to start watching again. The reason for this was the main storyline. Without the fillers I would have to give the story a 8 out of 10 but the fillers just take out too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I have to like most of all are the characters. Al the important characters have their own background and there is no black and white way of looking at the. The bad guys are not all that bad, they all have there reasons and motivation why they are doing what they do. The only thing that bothers me is the recurring \"Naruto\" type character, that can perfectly relate with the lead character of the show. I feel like they are repeating the same character over and over with just a slight twist each time. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall it is a good anime, and the main storyline is good enough to still make it enjoyable overall. I am still hoping that they'll remake the whole thing at some point and just remove all the filler material and also go over some of the artwork, because there were some moments wherein the animators seemed to be rushing.",

            "content": "First of all i would like to pin-point a few things.I have watched all the known mainstream animes that many of us used to watch all these years. Bleach -One piece-Fairy tail( this is kinda a  new one comparison to the others) and i must sayNaruto is by far the best on all its aspects.\r\nPeople hating  this anime where they havent even watched it is wierd \r\nStory 10-----This is one of the deepest animes i have seen. There are about 50-60 characters in this anime that all have their own stories which drag-on and they have their on impact  in the flowof the anime.Putting together a solid story with all these characters and the actual story of the anime is something beyond difficult.\\n\r\nThe clans, the villages, the bijuus, the skills, all the chakra explanation and the battle system.Naruto-Naruto Shippuuden its a world of its own running in a perfect flow.\\n\r\nWho would epect Obito would be alive after the accident, a story that took palce like 500 episodes ago-Naruto shippuuden does that, its not like the other animes that every episode erases its past and starts a new story , its a well-built story  with almost non-glitches\\n\\n\r\nSound 10-- 10 is too litle for the most succesfull anime in terms of soundtracks and music. Yashuharu Takanashi has done it again(and Toshio Masuda of course) all the tracks are masterpieces, no wonder why some of the tracks are of world fame and used  for other rasons aswell\\n\\n\r\nArt 9-- Very much improved from its prodeccor Naruto-not eprfect though\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10---Who didint like that clumpsy loud voice kid at the first part of this anime...Naruto and the others have grown in Shippuuden but in a great way. Naruto has grown as much as he should be and changed as much as he should be.He is not a complitely different person  neither the others, but they all have added new aspects i their characters matching the years difference from Naruto.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10- Seriously Naruto Shippuuden is indeed a famous (maybe?)mainstream anime?. So what?? That doesnt make it  bad.Its a high quality anime , one of the best that ever have been aired with very deep story, best music ever made, quite good art and amazing characters. Highly recommend it to everyone(MANDATORY u have watched Naruto first)\\n",

Sound is really good tho and it has great intros and outros, naruto tho is the most typical shounen there is so dont expect, one punch man animation or , death note storytelling! The characters that are good are really good! like itachi uchia, sasuke uchia, naruto altho he can be annyoing sometimes, and the enemys in the hole show are some of the best ive seen in an shounene anime, overall 9/10 without fillers, but now its filleruto so 7/10",

I've always neglected watching Naruto because of how big it is, but I finally took a chance, and finished it within 3 days because of how amazing the story development was. And now, Naruto Shippuuden is even better.\r\nStory - 9\r\nFirst of all, this an amazingly thought out story. From the history to the jutsu (ninja abilities), it all connected so well. The provided explanations for how the characters execute their abilities, it just can't compare to one piece, with how you eat some devil's fruit and gain powers. I understandthe stories are completely different, and one piece is one of my favorites, but Naruto is just so much better when it comes to being realistic, to the point that I wouldn't be surprised if there were actually ninja who could mold chakra in this world. Also, Naruto (shippuuden) is not one of those anime where the main characters are always able to win against an enemy. But that's what I love about it, and with how the main chars aren't just given massive powers from the start. They have to work for their skills. And even in the most dire situations, they aren't able to get past it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nUnlike \"modern day\" anime such as SAO, the character profiles aren't just smooshed at the mouth, nor are the nostrils just magically not there. All parts of anatomy are present! Other than that, the art is amazing, especially in battle scenes. Just watch it. You can understand what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nOne of the main things that makes this anime so good is the ost and op... and the necessary, icky, but realistic, sound of weapons piercing flesh. The openings are really suitable to the anime, and it's a nice selection of music. Especially OP 3 (watch the anime to hear what it sounds like! don't just go to google). And then there's the sound tracks of the animation. Probably one of the best I've heard. Although each OST is suited to their situation and/or scene, it's mainly the sad tracks that wow me. They convey the perfect feeling of sorrow, whilst at the same time emulating the theme of Naruto. What I mean is, at sad moments, you feel sad, and it sounds like a typical Japanese instrument, which, in the Naruto time period, that's what people would be using. Tabun.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  - 10\\n\r\nHere we go! Well, actually, to see the char development you'd have to start from Naruto, when they were actually... developing. But from the start of Naruto to Shippuuden, the characters never fail to amaze me. If you had seen Naruto, you would assume the evil characters are just evil, the side characters are just boring, and the main characters are just the epitome of justice. No. All of the characters have another side to them, and I hadn't known that until watching Shippuuden. Even the side chars. Down to their family history, all of the characters are just so well developed. I hadn't even known (***spoiler*** well it's not that important anyway) Asuma was Sarutobi-sensei's son until season 2. Not to mention, who would have thought Naruto's teacher would be some perverted hermit, instead of a clean, know-it-all peacemaker. Like Konohamaru's teacher, you know, the guy with the glasses. JK.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the anime the whole time, EXCEPT the fillers. Definitely not the fillers. eaughh. That doesn't mean all the fillers though. I just mean those fillers that don't show any character development, just another mission, or another waste of time. But that's only a small fragment of the anime. Shippuuden that is. For those of you who have seen Naruto, remember that massive section of fillers? Again, eaughh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10...00000000\\n\r\n:D",

            "content": "Now I know you might be surprised of my score since Naruto Shippuden seems it had gone through a lot of hate lately mostly because of the filler episodes however, it didn't seem to bother me that much. Sure, there are some fillers from a few episodes ago but it will be until episode 100 after they stop with the \"overwhelming\" amount of fillers in each episode.\r\n---\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is about the same Naruto we knew from the main series however, now that he is more mature he will get over following Sasuke all the time and focus on training to become a hokage (P.S. Iwas just joking, the whole plot now focuses on this whole part).\\n\\n\r\nLeaving the jokes aside, although the story focuses on Sasuke throughout the whole series, like OnePiece, it shows how hard it is to achieve something you want after you see how much you have to go in order to accomplishing it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: As you *may know*, long running series start off with lower graphics and then grow in quality by a lot although the graphics it started off didn't bother me at all, It's just the way they try to covering things to save more budget is really bad. No further comments there. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Surprisingly enough, I just love the Naruto Shippuden soundtracks since I am a big fan of Japanese instrumental songs, However! It could get really annoying as it gets overused as many other long running series do the same thing to safe money which is understandable, but I didn't feel like they were as good as in the main series, remember those sad soundtracks which really gave you the vibes when they started? Well, none of these here which was really my main disappointment. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: If there's something Naruto Shippuden has improved in from the main series, it would be the animation and characters. The characters have evolved a lot in mental as well as physical strength (ex: Shikamaru) which also made the Naruto series somewhat more *mature*. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Too lazy to continue so ==> (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn conclusion the story is pretty good executed although there are bits missing here and there.\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed my boring review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This series is a spectacle in the shounen genre. Let us not mince words!! This show succeeds in utilizing its cast of secondary characters due to a long episode count and filler episode budget that the animation studio has. Battle sequences are epic where new abilities need to be learned for our main character to keep up with the looming threats wanting to destroy the shinobi world. The villains in Naruto are very fleshed out. Naruto Shippuuden gets you invested in the main characters and rooting for them quickly into the first Akatsuki onslaught. The filler episodes fall into the \"hit-or-miss\" category, so if youare watching for the story or over-the-top shounen fights, you might wanna have a list of filler episodes ready so that you can accelerate thru the long episode count. I don't suggest marathoning such a long-running shounen; save your sanity. But this shounen is worth the watch!!",

            "content": "Good : \r\nInteresting premise and world, magic system that allows for many enjoyable fights, interesting character designs, characters with relatable motives.\r\nBad :\r\n-Characters\r\nNaruto :\r\n  a)He started as a likeable kid with troubled life that could be overbearing at times but tried his best. He became annoying when he would spout the same things over and over again while never actuall achieving anything , diving head first into the enemy without thinking and getting his ass kicked.\r\n  b)In Shippuden he shed that immaturity and became more bearable.\r\nUnforutnately he still had his dumb moments that completely messed the tone in many instances. His immaturity also clasheswith the tone and style of the rest of the series. Characters like Luffy are ok to be \"dumb\" because the whole world of the manga is kind of silly and ridiculous with over the top scenarios, locales and cahracters. Every character on his crew is a bit of a nut in their own way, and many characters in the rest of the series are too so it doesnt feel out of place. But it does in Naruto.\\n\r\n  c)Also he was still an almost useless fighter. Sasuke had managed half a dozen different Jutstus in the 2 year timeskip, Naruto not only learned nothing but he couldnt even do rasengan without a clone.\\n\r\nApart from Pain he never had a decent fight with an equal oppoenent to show his skills and competence. After that he just uses the Fox which throws most ninja techniques out the window.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Sakura :\\n\r\nMost annoying character and impossible to like.\\n\r\nHas an unhealthy obsession over Sasuke, even after all his crimes and attempts to kill her making her look like an unhinged ex-girlfirend with Battered Wife Synrome than an independent strong character.\\n\r\nThe antics with Naruto where she gets angry and slaps him were never funny, just cringy and annoying making her look like a bitch.\\n\\n\r\n-Sasuke\\n\r\nHe started off interesting if a little emo.\\n\r\nHe opened up, he made friends, but had to leave them for his own purposes. Ok so far.\\n\r\nAftet the 2 year timeskip he goes full-on edgy emo and tries to kill them for no good reason. It made sense to abandon them in favor of training under Orochimaru, not kill them.\\n\r\nHe puts on a permament poker face being unable to show any emotion at any time.\\n\r\nPlus after al the shit he did, he was forgiven way too easily.\\n\\n\r\n-Hinata\\n\r\nAnnoying too high pitched voice even after she became a teen, too timid even for a timid personality, too obsessed with Naruto, barely any good interaction between them.\\n\\n\r\n-Karin\\n\r\nThat was a big missed opportunity. After she as almost killed by Sasuke her dialogue made it sound like she realised the truth and would forget Sasuke coming to her senses. She observed Naruto and how he was so much \"brighter\" than Sasuke. Given how they were also form th same clan it was a ripe opportunity for interesting character development betweeen them.\\n\r\nNaruto could realise he was not alone, Karin the same. They could become close, bond over their troubled childhoods and support each other in the coming battles.\\n\r\nBut her character was wasted and the very next scene with her, she just still craves Sasuke's dick for some reason.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-battles :\\n\r\nThat was hit n' miss.\\n\r\nSome fights, especiallu the early ones were interesting with various strategies and techniques being used in creative ways to make dynamic battles.\\n\r\nWhile however some characters like Sasuke or Shikamaru were given interesting fights, the protagonist himself Naruto most of the time had lame ones. Others like Lee, had onnly brute force but ultilised it in the same way we see Chackie CHan and other artists use it in fulm so it was entertaining.\\n\r\nNaruto offered none of the 2 : neither brain fights nor strength fights\\n\r\nHe usually just used brute force instead of his brain, even when the opponents were much stronger and it was obvious it wasnt working.\\n\r\nHe never learned any elements to supplement his arsenal, he never improved upon them.\\n\r\nHE learned th wind elements which he used to create his super rasengan and then he totally forgot about it. he didnt create any new technique that was less dangerous than that.\\n\r\nHe went from 0-100 with no in-between.\\n\r\nTowards the end, the ninja fitghts are almost gone and we just have gods playign with each other so...whatever.\\n\\n\\n",

That's when everything was changed....!!\r\nI have seen the first episode, to me it was amazing. It captivated me completely. That Anime had made a great impact on my life. I've learned so many things from that Anime. High in morals, it changed my way of thinking.\r\nI'm here to write a review on Naruto Shippuden which is a part of Naruto's world.\r\nTo all Naruto/Naruto Shippuden Haters who think that Naruto isn't the best anime.....Idisagree with you...coz is not only the best it's greatest of all time. And one more thing, Naruto/Naruto Shippuden is not for immatures and those who run out of patience very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nI consider it as Masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI do hate fillers...but I like them as well because even fillers in Naruto/Naruto Shippuden has something to do with the morals and the way of living.\\n\\n\r\nWe all know that story revolves around a knucklehead Ninja who wants everyone to acknowledge him. With help his friends he was able to finally achieve it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many reasons why I like this Anime....they are:\\n\\n\r\n1. Great Story(High in Morals)\\n\r\n2. Deep Characterization(every character in this Anime teaches some good to us, you will get attached to them)\\n\r\n3. Evolution(yes evolution in everything - in the story, in characters, in fights, in techniques), I like new things...!\\n\r\n4. Emotions, Relationships \\n\r\n5. Side Stories(yes side stories of other characters - they are really cool)\\n\r\n6. Memorable heroes and villains(yes though we have one main protagonist we have several side heroes and villains with their awesome stories)\\n\r\n7. Logic(logic in every Jutsu development, in every fight)\\n\r\nI've seen Anime with higher ratings but no logic in their battles, training.(IDK why people like something which doesn't support logic)\\n\r\n8. Explanation - everything is explained in detail.\\n\r\n9. Life Lessons - yeah I have learned so many things from this Anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all characters are my favorite but the special ones are Itachi, Naruto, Nagato(Pain), Shisui, Orochimaru, Madara, All Hokages, I will never forget Akatsuki....they are amazing..!!\\n\\n\r\nMy most favorite episode is a filler....yes it's a filler, a filler in which writer expressed his views about the real world, real people, what it is to create and what it is to destroy, what is life, what is love, what is power? what we can do with our life and how we can be helpful to others!! So many things were just taught just in a single episode. The name of that episode is Ninja Creed.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many things that I wanted to explain here but people will get bored of my review so I'm ending this here. \\n\\n\r\nKeep watching Naruto Shippuden coz anime is still going on and the rest of the episodes will amaze us just as the previous ones did.\\n\\n\r\nSayonara!!!\\n\\n",

I know that they put it there so the anime doesn't catch up to the manga but it was way too unsatisfying. It is because of these filler that I dropped the anime for a long time.

I learn many life lessons from naruto and it will forever a part of me and the anime/manga that had made me the way I am now somehow...so, I am really bitter about saying how shippuden change my high opinion about it. \r\nWith it's enormous amount of fillers, the story was hard to follow at some point and I lost my interest pretty fast. The fourth ninja war was dragged for too long in my sense, with always a new final boss showing up, the dead that are broughtback to life, and again fillers with new characters that sometimes appeared out of nowhere and weren't even in the manga. And this is my personal opinion, the end was really lame...I mean, the fight between naruto and sasuke, how they settled thing once and for all was great but I found the fact that they both survived stupid, and that was only to reach a sequel in Boruto which is...no comment....only a way to save the franchise and make it go on. Maybe not kill off naruto and sasuke but at least one of them (sasuke) but both you'd have been better and the spirit of naruto would have stayed in people's memory. Well, that would have been so much more better. Anyway even though shippuden was overall average to me, Naruto (from the old days) will forever stay my treasure.",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuden is the continuation of Naruto. Naruto Shippuden is definitely better than Naruto. Here's is what I thought about the show so far:\r\nStory: The story is pretty interesting and unpredictable. You not going to know what going to happen next. Some episodes might be drag on and a big amount of flashbacks are shown in almost every episode so it might be a little bit boring for some people. If you are a patience person then you can make it through the show, the show gets better as time goes on.\r\nArt: The art is a step-up from the original series but I woudn't saidthat the art is great. I noticed that Naruto Shippuden uses different animation in different arcs. The show never stick with one animation. Some episodes the animation might be really good and some episodes the animation is just horrible. Overall, most episodes have decent animation so the art wouldn't be a big problem.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Naruto Shippuden's Soundtrack is not as good as the first series. However, The OPs and EDs are great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Naruto Shippuden have a variety of characters with different personalities. Some characters had developed while some other characters didn't develop much (except their appearance). The characters in Shippuden are lovable so I beleived that you guys will find at least one person that you like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Naruto Shippuden might be boring in some cases but if you are patience, you will be rewarded BECAUSE WHEN NARUTO SHIPPUDEN IS GOOD, IT'S GOOD.",

The character development for the new characters is pretty good...\r\nEnjoyment.. is bad because.. well... FILLERS... EVERYWHERE... it tries making you bored out of your mind or on the edge of your seat so even the most pointless event seem exciting. It's dragged out so long. I believe it should only be around 50-100 episodes. I quit watching the original Naruto at like 80 then started watching Shippuuden because my friend really likes it, but we literally skimmed throughthe first 40 episodes within about 2 hours, and I did not miss any details at all. I discussed the main bad points about Naruto with my friend and he agreed with all of them which include the ones that I have talked about before.\\n\r\nThey're overcomplicating it in my opinion, and should stay focused on the main problem, create \"sub\"-problems that lead up to ending the main conflict, which seem to be the problem with a lot of mainstream shounen anime. They try making a series as long as possible to make the most money out of it rather then creating a good story, with good art, and characters that a person will thoroughly enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Naruto Shippuuden gets a 5/10, There are a lot of shorter anime series that gets to the point of the anime which are much more exciting, because they cram all their interesting ideas into a short time span rather than having a single event drag out over a term of 3-10 episodes.",

I feel all the things that the characters are going through. It's about friendship,family,pride of where you come from. This show makes me laugh,makes me cry, I've even yelled at my computer screen when things happen I don't like. lol. I never came across any show like Naruto that had me fall completely in love with it. I do admit when I heard of this show I thought it was just for kids. Thatit was going to be this lame kid show. Boy was I wrong! My sister actually got me into anime and introduced me to Naruto. I'm so glad she did! I thank her like everyday. I love everything about Naruto. The storyline,the characters,music,animation. EVERYTHING!!. Naruto is always in my heart. Hands down the best anime! This is my opinion though. People have others that they love more or what they think is the best ever. I've told some other anime fans that Naruto was my most fav and they would laugh. Doesn't bother me any because it's what I like not what they like.",

Instead of grading Naruto Im gonna just do The good, The bad, and The Ugly. \r\n\"Your doing something different? Thats so stupid and wiierd. Why would you do that?\" \r\nIt's simpler, faster, easier, and because f**k you, thats why.\r\nTHE GOOD:\r\nStory has a very fun and interesting premise with tons of action, superpowers, ninjas, respect, badass fight and much more. The story is so long and complex it really has some great plot twiststhat are a pleasure to watch even if you know it's going to happen 50 episodes before it happens (because most of us read the manga). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are awesome and you become attached to them the more you watch. They all have flaws, they all have personality, and they all have history. It all ties together quite nicely over the years since this anime began.\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD:\\n\r\nThis is strictly my opinion so feel free to completely disregard this section and go onto the next because I know for a fact that alot of people will not agree with what Im about to say.\\n\r\nIt didnt have enough romance, there I said it. I think there could have been a few places where romance could have boosted this anime up to around an 8.4ish score. Once again I dont expect people to agree with this so please disregard this section if you disagree. I would actually appreciate a personal message telling me what you think about this whether its good or bad. Im very interested on what you guys have to say about this topic and upcoming movie. Anyway, moving on.\\n\\n\r\nTHE UGLY:\\n\r\nIm pretty sure you all know what I'm goin to say...and yes you are right....FILLERS. Now dont get me wrong. I grew up with Naruto starting in 5th grade and this show holds a special place in my heart. But I gotta say, there is nothing worst then a very important climax or battle arc getting interrupted by a stupid filler. It can be a complete turn off. Are some of them fun to go back and watch? yes! of course! but the timing of them is horribly off in my opinion and they can get lengthy and as you watch more of them you start getting angry and frustrated. \"this is pointless\" probably describes the feeling best to some of you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE OVERALL: 9 in my personal enjoyment, 8 in terms of quality overall (as a critic)\\n\\n\r\n I have been watching for so many years now so it is really hard for me to critique this fairly. I hope for the most part you guys understand where Im coming from. Overall this anime is a great watch. Probably will be a classic when its all over, but that will be along time from now.\\n\r\nIm extremely jealous of anyone just starting the series now because you get to skip all those fillers. But yeah, please watch it, it only gets better as you watch and the more you watch the more you wont be able to stop. \\n\\n\r\nMost deadly jutsu?\\n\\n\r\n Flashback no Justu hands-down. This jutsu can easily can rip anyones mind to shreds, destroy someones sanity, or worse.....make them turn off the computer/TV in a matter of seconds :0\\n\r\n.....deadly",

I mean, other than the fillers and poor animation, the Anime is of a very, very high standard; not many other Animes have such in-depth characters as for example Itachi Uchiha. Nor are many other Animes able to convey, and bring out from you, the levelsof emotion that this Anime does. Seriously, it is GOOD. Especially the episode I just watched that made me want to express how good of an Anime Naruto Shippuden actually is. Seriously..... I really do hate how this is a 7/10 here.

            "content": "Naruto Shippuden is a good Anime in my opinion. I know many people look upon Naruto as being \"mainstream\" and somehow inferior to other Anime, they are right and wrong.\r\nI like Naruto because of the troubled lives that the Shinobi live and the morals that the show tries to impart to the viewers although that is lost on most people.\r\nShippuden has a more refined feel than Naruto part 1 and that's most likely due to the development and maturity of the characters. Naruto as always stimulates powerful moments of emotional empathy from the viewers and always transfers some wisdom to the viewer, most notably relatingto friendship, family and duty. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall main story arc is interesting and has many interesting developments which show what it's like to live the ninja life. There is Naruto's humor which still creates funny moments although that isn't as big of a part of Shippuden as it was in Part 1. The combat is also interesting and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the bad parts that makes people view Naruto in a negative way. There is many fillers which seem completely pointless and while that's not really an issue if you are able to trick yourself into liking them, It is very boring to watch. There are repetitive elements which can become stale after a while but if you become a fan you can overlook the repetitiveness. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: Naruto Shippuden isn't close to being perfect, but you will learn to care about the characters, mostly Naruto which greatly helps enjoy the show. It's interesting to watch but requires a lot of time since there is so many episodes and if you watch part 1 also (I suggest you do) then that adds up to quite a lot of time. Perhaps find a list of filler episodes and skip them. \\n\\n\r\nGive it 10 episodes to see if you enjoy it.",

            "content": "I don't even know where to begin. When I started watching the original Naruto it was great, tons of potential but once it hit shippuuden it didn't just go down hill, it flew down vertically with no stop in sight. It's depressing to see an anime with a lot of potential be destroyed. As it continues it looks like they are trying to squeeze out all the money possible out of this story instead of just ending it. Many people would disagree with me and a majority wont really give arguments other than being a fan boy but anyway here's my review.\r\nStory - Originally thestory was supposed to be about a failure ninja who is hated by everyone because of the beast in him. He cries all the time, is extremely annoying to all his peers yet he still blames his beast for being hated. Anyway, the whole plot to this anime is to create bonds, friendships, and get acceptance with the title of \"Hokage\". In the first part of the Naruto series that's exactly what he worked to do and now with shippuuden everything changes, no more bonds, no more friendship, it's just an anime that resembles some sort of animal trade using tailed beasts. Naruto continues to chase sasuke and even after all the advantages hes born with he continues to not be able to catch him. Theres virtually no training in this anime at all, just free powers given over and over. Villains are just a line of people controlling one another.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Basic, Average, Modern, not unique. Most of the characters all look like they have been drawn using the same template. Just take off naruto's hair and eyes, throw in sasuke's hair and eyes, BOOM flawless.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The music isn't anything special, usually its an asain man yelling what sounds like \"SEA SAW\" at you with background music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Not unique, very obvious copy of DBZ.\\n\r\nnaruto - Easily resembles goku, orange suit, blonde hair, raised by an old guy(hokage), both become monsters with a tail. Only difference is while naruto cried his whole childhood, goku lived alone with innocence.\\n\r\nSasuke - Very obvious copy of vegeta, from the hair, to the death of his whole race and getting revenge.\\n\r\nJiraya - Narutos, frog sage, old, perverted teacher, very similar to roshi, goku's turtle sage, old perverted teacher. Even the way naruto received training was similar, both asked for a large breasted hot girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - At first it was enjoyable, now it makes you wanna rip your hair out at how ridiculous it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10 - and with good reason.",

Naruto is the type of anime that has good character storiesx due to its long run and has a decent story in which usually doesnt stale in my eyes atleast. I really enjoy naruto definetly one of favorites but it does have alot of flaws. First of all the art style tends to change just recently in the story the art style changed from what it was before its not a big change but its still there. Second HUGE flaw about this seriesis the constant filler in this anime we will get around 3 episodes of cannon and then get thrown into flashbacks and even sometimes it will takes months off of the story to show us a full filler arc and the amount that it happens makes watching very boring but they do make up for it when the story usually resumes. Another thing that can sometimes be wierd is the animation it can be good and it can also be at a stand still and just freeze at times. In my opinion Naruto is a good show to watch its a 10/10 in my book just because of my connection but for the average person a good 8/10 sounds about right give it a watch if you like long running shows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, The Anime Gods",

They were not even in the chunin exams... Fillers r destroying this best anime.",

            "content": "Most people forget what Naruto is and what it is meant to be and start comparing it with anime that arrived a decade later. And it's almost impossible to assign numbers and evaluate a series like this one that has been running over a decade. Naruto was never a show made to compete with mind boggling story such as... I don't know let's say Cowboy Bebop for a lack of better example. But it was made in midst of a shounen revolution where the importance was placed on Friendship, goodness, and perseverance. \r\nNaruto is very little about ninjas. In fact it's very bad atportraying what ninjas are. But Naruto is creative at least. Taking this ninja genre and combining it into several martial and weapon arts to make this very unique show. Well unique is a bit subjective but whatever. I applaud the series for combining the natural elements, weapons, and even mixing human behaviors to create a world full of unique fighting techniques. \\n\\n\r\nStory wise, Naruto is about the character Naruto becoming the leader of his village. He is an orphan cursed with bearing a monster with him and the whole anime is about him overcoming the world of ninjas, which is filled with hatred and suspicion. See the series have some of the most fascinating characters. Each of them with their own background, although many of them could've been kept a secret for the better story progression and pacing. Many of these characters' actions are justified by their past and as the series progresses you can see how each of them changes and influences each other. However the best aspect of the series is also probably the worst aspect of it. While many main characters are given a good amount of attention and care and many of them are nurtured with logic, others just become fodder characters uttering 1 or 2 lines then their worth are never revisited again. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Naruto is about never giving up, making friends, and well, whatever standard shounens babble about. But Naruto is one of the few exceptions because Naruto is rarely a hypocrite and actually always stays around its core beliefs. As the series is ending, it's sad that many of the traits of the characters like Sasuke and Obito are reversing and villains are entering the infamous Dragon Ball complex (you enemy becomes bff lol), the main thing is Naruto remains Naruto: stupid and somehow still influential. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this series at different intervals and after watching other anime, I came to appreciate Naruto. Because I watched several long running shounen and nothing really even came close to the emotional appeal Naruto formed. I think I can safely say that this show truly keeps it promise and shows Naruto is a hardworking guy who becomes special. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I still can't forgive this series for wasting the potential of so many characters, random power-ups, unnecessary glorification of Sasuke and Naruto (WE GET IT THEY'RE THE MAIN CHARACTERS) and Bleach-esque arse pulls. The fillers are downright horrible and let's not even explore the comedy. Seriously, many of the plot like Kaguya and other backstory could have been omitted, no they should have been omitted, to give Naruto a more refined ending but it is what it is. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Naruto is a good series about a guy never giving up as he faces challenge to save his friend and save his village. Indeed it is a tale of a gutsy ninja. Characters like Itachi, Jiraiya, and Pain are some of the noteworthy characters in all of anime. Naruto is a good series on what it stands for. Stop comparing it to high level, 13 episode series because all anime loses its lust after 500 episode mark. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, this is not a proper review. Just whatever I feel about this series. I recommend it for the nostalgia and some really good fight scenes.\\n",

            "content": "Naruto Shippuuden takes a nice shit on the Naruto series. Even if you take away all the filler, the core material completely eradicates the main message of the original series. Naruto was supposed to be about a child who was not gifted and he attempt to follow his impossible dream. But Shipuuden takes the typical shonen route and makes the story about a chosen boy who must save the world. This is not a good series, most characters are back seated for Naruto, and though it has its good moments, the series took a huge nose dive. The story follows the end of Naruto, andnow Naruto wants to save Sasuke and defeat the Akatsuki, while the Akatsuki look interesting at first, the story starts to unravel into a huge \"this was all apart of my plan!\" type theme. Where the evil genius keeps being trumped by another evil genius. Naruto's character changes for the worst, sakura looks as if she is going to become an actual decent character but that is shit on. Kakashi is decent along with shikamaru but eventually every character becomes a narutard, also known as a character that falls in love with naruto and just spouts out naruto like messages, this turns their characters into naruto clones. The villains were interesting, and they would be good if the series stopped using the whole \"He was just like Naruto, except he could not be happy\" type theme, it became an in series cliche. The art was eh at many moments, yet the music was good. So I was NOT look at this series, instead if you want some shonen in your life go READ one piece, as the anime has become visual garbage. also soul eater should take care of your anime fighting craving, and it is short as well.",

I watched every episode of Naruto when they aired starting the year the show received an English dub. I stopped during the final arc of the show. I had highly enjoyed the show through much of it and I don't think I'd take those moments back. \r\nHowever, I cannot recommend this show whatsoever to anyone. The studio who made this show MILKED their FANS for money. The manga had been completed at the time the show decided to start running filler in the middleof their final arc. I have spent 7 years watching this show as a loyal fan and I stopped during the final arc. It's because the filler they started doing in the middle of the final arc lasted for over 2.5 years. I waiting 2 years to let episodes build up so my father and I could watch roughly 120 episodes together and binge it hard. There were only 3 canon episodes released within those 2.5 years and the manga had been finished that whole time, meaning the studio was purposely writing 2.5 years of filler to make money from view counts. It's absolutely disgusting. \\n\\n\r\nThen to top it all off they made the damn Boruto movie before they even finished the Naruto Shippuuden anime. I am so mad and disappointed. I will never watch another anime from this garbage studio again. Save yourself the trouble and watch a different studio's show. They'll probably care more about their fans and give you an enjoyable show.",

This anime is nowhere near perfect. Answer is actually pretty clear. I am a viewer who can put his time on this long series and enjoy it. So if you can relate to what I am saying, I can ensure you that this show has the most epic scenes in the world.\r\nIt all comes down to the person who watches. This anime is not for everyone. But those who finished it know howthey fucking enjoyed the boner they got when Guy and Madara fought. What I am trying to say is, this show pays off when you put your time on it. Just like other episodic series.\\n",

            "content": "Naruto Shipppuuden has a spectacular story with well built characters. I am not only talking about the main characters, but also secondary characters and especially the villains.\r\nNot to mention that it has the best fighting animations ever seen. Not only the animation at technical level but the own choreography and strategies of the fight according to each individual and its power.\r\nThe story has many ramifications and variants, which despite one and another plot hole (which is understandable because of the extended time of its development) every each character evolve and go through a growth and development of character.\r\nNaruto is that character that we can understandand we want to be like him. We see his growth, it is not a character of 2 dimensions, but of 3 or 4. The same happens with many others, and the most fascinating are the villains. Especially those from Akatsuki. For me, Pain is one of the best-built villains I've seen so far in anime and even in movies.\\n\\n\r\nI quoted this anime on my master's thesis countless times, exactly because of its story and character construction, and also because of its animations and fight choreography.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who loves a good fight (choreographically and visually) will feel immense satisfaction in this anime. Just like anyone who likes a good story with good heroes and good villains, both quite human. They do not make the characters just the flawless hero or the inhuman villain. No. The characters have a reason that moves them, because of their life experiences.\\n\\n\r\nI strongly advise.\\n\r\nMy favorite anime, no doubt.",
