            "content": "After watching Ergo Proxy completely and thoroughly, I must say that this is one of the most enjoyable series I've watched yet. The story is so complex and can at times be very agonizing because you are just so clueless as to what is going on. Then, usually, by the end of the episode or by the next episode all of your questions and doubts about what is going on will be answered.\r\nWhy did I enjoy this series so much? First, this series is a real psychological mind boggling experience. I haven't see too many series that make me question what is going on orgoing to happen until the very end, yet Ergo Proxy did it. Even during the last episode, I was still asking myself the same question as I had been throughout the entire series, \"what the hell is going on?!\" This kind of experience kept me wanting more and left me trying to fill holes myself, which is exactly the kind of thing that I enjoy. Something that makes me think for myself and makes me WANT to figure out whats going on or say, \"Hmm, I wonder what that meant...\"\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story is another thing that made me enjoy this so much, a post apocalyptic world where everyone is being kept in the dark and left wondering whats just beyond their grasp. Theres not much that I can say about this plus for me, it's just something that I enjoy. If you enjoy stories set in this kind of environment, you'll like this aspect of Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy makes use of a lot of different aspects of psychology and history, which is a good thing. I believe it was only the first fourteen episodes, but at the end of each respective episode there would be about two minutes when they would reflect back on things throughout what you had just seen. It was a very nice touch that I felt was something more series should do. It basically would tell you things that the author of the series/story used as a reference or what something that occurred in the episode was based on. I thoroughly enjoy history and psychology so this aspect of Ergo Proxy really appealed to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development didn't fall short of my expectations either. It was done quite nicely. I wish I could go into further detail about it, but apparently I'm not supposed to say anything to spoil the series and I'm not quite sure how to go about this aspect without doing just that.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was extremely well done. The way some of the faces are drawn may look a little odd at first, but I didn't mind it at all. It matches the show quite well and really compliments everything around it. Everything that was done in this series, animation wise, was completely believable. Sure, there are somethings that you just know can't be true/made from something real, but it just feels true/real with everything else about the series combined. \\n\\n\r\nOh, don't let me forget Real Mayer. She's one sexy woman. Not sexy in the stereotypical way with an out of proportion body and an annoying voice. She is more real (pun intended), she's not overdeveloped, her voice isn't annoying, she doesn't have any super human powers, she isn't a amazing when it comes to combat, and her feelings/emotions are that of a real woman/girl. It just makes her character so much more believable and real, which is why I love her so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ergo Proxy is the complete package in terms of story, animation, sound, character development, THE characters, and the enjoyment of everything put together. If you don't enjoy this show, then you either aren't human, don't like anime or are too stupid to understand the story.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review, this is the first one I've ever written. If you like it, then please leave an comment letting me know so I'll be more encouraged to write more. See ya kiddies.",

            "content": "As far as I know, there are no Spoilers or Summaries here.\r\n-There is one thing I need to point out about my scoring.  The enjoyment of a show is weighed heavily by me.  If I can't enjoy a show then what's the point of watching it? \r\nNow without further ado.\r\nStory:\r\nThe actual story and plot of the show isn&rsquo;t bad other then being a bit confusing.  It jumps into the plot right away for the first few episodes.  The story progresses rapidly at first before coming to almost a complete stop.  For about 7 or 8 of the episodes between 10-20,I felt like nothing happened nothing really changed and that the story and plot crawled by very slowly and in some cases made no progress at all.  And then at the end when I expected things to pick up and everything to come together like in the movie Fight Club or Donnie Darko.  It just didn&rsquo;t happen.  I felt like the ending was throwing answers at me that didn&rsquo;t add up, like a puzzle where the last 5 pieces don&rsquo;t fit at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn a general wholesome look the plot makes sense.  But on a detailed level I felt the story was just pulling ideas out of a hat and tried to make things work that really didn&rsquo;t.  The idea was good but it was executed poorly and fell short of its intention.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines.  The visuals in this show are easily some of the best I have ever seen.  Many of the visual angles used were unique, fresh, and quite artistic without taking away importance or detail from the scene.  The animation was very fluid and realistic.  The colors and lightning were also done well.  Scenes in bright places were done quite well almost in a blinding way.  While the darker scenes did a great job representing the destruction and despair throughout the rest of the world.  The art/animation is the best thing about this show.  Although there was a lot of dark scenes, so be prepared.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell I&rsquo;m not much of a Radiohead fan so the ending theme didn&rsquo;t do anything for me, I skipped it every time.  The opening theme didn&rsquo;t do much at first but it wore on me and near the end I actually started to enjoy it.  Although the OP didn&rsquo;t fit real well, it was to &ldquo;active&rdquo; to really relate with the show.  As for background music I can&rsquo;t really think of any of them specifically which I guess means it wasn&rsquo;t great but it wasn&rsquo;t bad either and did a good job of blending into the scenes.  The sound effects were good at doing what they were supposed to, adding to the scenes and the detail of the world.  The voice actors did fairly well I felt like for the most part the voices fit each character fairly well.  I didn&rsquo;t watch the English dub so I can&rsquo;t say too much about that.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOne of my biggest problems with Ergo Proxy which also greatly lowered the enjoyment as well as overall score was with the characters.  I simply did not care about them.  The two main characters Vincent and Re-l didn&rsquo;t do anything for me.  I wouldn&rsquo;t care if they died, or if they fell in love, or if they disappeared never to be seen again.  Maybe I might have liked them more if they turned into slugs or something.  Re-l&rsquo;s bright blue eye shadow/mascara whatever it is bothered the heck out of me the ENTIRE series as well.  All I wanted to do was wash it away.  Also there were a few instances where the producers wanted the viewer to care or get emotional over different things between the characters, all it made me do was yawn.  \\n\\n\r\nThe one and ONLY character I liked was Pino.  Pino was used many times as comic relief and did a decent job of it too.  When she dressed up in her costume, it was very cute as well.  Although even then, there were times when Pino just didn&rsquo;t evoke any emotion from me except boredom.  \\n\\n\r\nOn an objective level the characters were well developed.  You get a good understanding of their story.  You even occasionally get a good analysis of their psyche and mental stability.  They were fleshed out and felt like completed beings.  Some of the supporting characters were well done as well.  Although some of them were much more unstable than you originally think and act in ways you wouldn&rsquo;t have expected.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nTo be honest, I did not enjoy this show at all.  I frequently thought about dropping it but I told myself to get through it.  I was hoping that everything would click in the end and I&rsquo;d end up loving it, but that didn&rsquo;t happen.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply there were a few times that I&rsquo;d be watching and suddenly start nodding off in the middle of the episode.  The next day when I tried to watch the following episode I couldn&rsquo;t remember what happened and had to re-watch the previous episode a second time.  None of the episodes really grabbed me and held my attention like it could have.\\n\\n\r\nMy sleeping problem seemed to occur more frequently during some of the middle episodes, 10-20.  Some will disagree with this, but I felt many of these episodes were pointless filler episodes.  Yes some of them did give a little bit of back-story or history of the world but none of it really had any major impacts on the series as a whole.  They could have been reduced to 2 or 3 episodes that could have presented the same information in a better way.  Some of those episodes also felt extremely out of place.  Many times an episode would start off in a completely different totally unrelated location from anything else in previous episodes.  And at the end of the episode you are left scratching your head asking what the hell had just happened.  Many times I felt I had wasted 24 minutes of my life which could have been spent on an episode of a different show.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nFrom some of the other reviews and from the score, I had some decent expectations for this show.  I went in knowing that it will require some philosophical reasoning which is fine with me.  But nearly everything about the show seemed to fall completely short of what I anticipated.  Even after seeing the &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; near the end, I was left feeling uninterested, a &ldquo;So what&rdquo; expression hanging around me.  \\n\\n\r\nBecause it is highly regarded by some people I can&rsquo;t completely say you should stay away from this anime.  If you understand that this will be a confusing trip and don&rsquo;t mind experiences resembling the last two eps of Neon Genesis then it won&rsquo;t hurt to give this show a try.  But if you are like me, and by about eps 8 don&rsquo;t care about the characters or about the story, just stop before things get really ugly.  \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion if you don&rsquo;t see this show you aren&rsquo;t missing out either.  Although I do think if I re-watched it, I might respect it a little more.  But the first time through was miserable enough and I couldn&rsquo;t watch it again.  So if you do plan to watch this you probably should re-watch it to fully enjoy the show.  If you cant imagine yourself re-watching it then you should stop where you are and move onto a different show.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is a highly experimental show, and just like all shows of that kind it always divides the viewers into two camps: while the ones enjoy its complex story and thought-provoking symbolism, the others fiercely criticize it for \"pretentiousness\" or simply scratch their heads in perplexity, wondering what this whole thing is supposed to mean. \r\nAs for me, I firmly believe this is an amazing series with no exaggeration about it, and with this review I'll try to explain you why. Since the anime has a site description you can always read, allow me to skip further introductions and get straight to business.\r\n STORY\r\nObviously,the most contentious part of Ergo Proxy. The story and the method of storytelling this anime employs are highly unusual, and that is by far the main reason why quite a number of people dislike it. However, I think this story does not \"pretend\" to be clever - it is clever indeed. Moreover, it makes Ergo Proxy one of the most clever series I've ever watched.\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story at the core is a journey of self-discovery, hence the main idea is pretty simple yet great, at least as I comprehend it: you should find your own way instead of being somebody's follower or lower-rank copy (\"proxy\"); for that you should realize who you are, what you live for and how the real world looks. The anime certainly makes you ask important questions and reflect on your own life, and that always counts as a great quality in my book.\\n\r\nSecond, Ergo Proxy is a highly experimental show as it presents a diverse mix of genres: cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, sci-fi, action, mystery, drama, psychological mindf*ck, road movie and even a bit of comedy, romance and slice of life. Consequently, it results in a very unorthodox narrative full of plot twists & genre switches that many viewers disliked as they felt trolled and confused while watching. Well, I do understand those complaints: it is indeed very unusual, confusing at times and probably not to everybody's liking. Besides, one may argue that the anime goes a little too far with experiments in episodes 15 and 19 which makes them too different from the rest in their style. Perhaps, the show could've done better without those two, as it would've also made the 2nd half of the series more compact to provide better pacing and better build-up for the ending. \\n\r\nAside from that fairly tolerable issue, the plot is very well-written & coherent despite its complexity, and the credit for that goes to Dai Sato - the author of the original story and one of the best Japanese scriptwriters who also participated in writing scripts for Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. In fact, it still makes me wonder how he and his team managed to weave all those genres and events into one logical & continuous plot. So, not only those swings & changes are very interesting and uncommon but they also don't exist there just for the sake of it - instead, they actually form the story, with each episode adding something brand new to the plot & character development, and that's amazing indeed.\\n\r\nHowever, the main reason why this anime seems unintelligible to so many people probably lies in its third peculiarity which is the astounding number of symbols & allegories employed: almost every single name & situation is allegoric and requires your interpretation to get the whole story. Moreover, not only those allegories turn out relevant & contributing to the plot but also extremely diverse, referring to Greek mythology, Descartes' philosophy and Shakespeare's plays among other things. No doubt, the high degree of symbolism is what makes the series quite a riddle at times; yet it is in fact a very entertaining and well-thought-out riddle where every element serves its purpose to convey the show's message, and I personally had lots of fun deciphering it.\\n\r\nWith all those complex aspects the story never turns into pretentious nonsense or something really incomprehensible because it actually answers most questions, though often in roundabout and not obvious ways. That means it just demands a little more attention than in your average series, and if you pay it, you get it. Well, I don't consider myself an intellectual and yet I understood almost everything from the first viewing. There were a couple of moments I didn't grasp but it took me 3 minutes (!) to use google, click the first link and read an insightful explanation that satisfied me.\\n\r\nAnd even if you don't get something it's not a reason to dislike the show - it is actually a great motivation for you because this anime is highly rewatchable, and during every viewing there will be new discoveries that will enrich you.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\r\nErgo Proxy's art style is easily recognizable for its omnipresent dark colors and realistic yet unusual character designs that give the series a westernized & very artistic look. The animation quality is great except for a considerable inconsistency in character drawing, and the style fits like a glove although some viewers may need time to get used to its murky appearance.\\n\r\nThe music is a number of ambient tracks by Ike Yoshihiro, a U2-esque opening theme by Monoral and an ending song by Radiohead. All the tracks are nicely composed to create the engrossing and mysterious atmosphere of the series, and even those who dislike the show agree that the soundtrack is simply amazing.\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is also very well-done as the voices perfectly fit the characters, and the seiyus did a very good job at conveying emotions. \\n\r\nTo sum up, the production values are impressive indeed, and the style is memorable & totally appropriate for the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nWell, Ergo Proxy is an anime about self-discovery, hence its primary focus lies on the characters and their development. The main difference from other shows of this kind is that the story for the most part doesn't emerge from characters' actions & choices - rather, the characters are put into an already crafted plot full of twists & symbols mirroring their inner conflicts, and they receive development while going through this labyrinthine plot & unraveling its mystery step by step. As a result, you get a story-driven series with strong emphasis on the characters, which looks paradoxical on paper yet works surprisingly well in reality, being one of the most original aspects of the show. \\n\r\nThe other interesting aspect is how the characters don't feel overblown in any way. Unlike many other series that endow each character with one or two exaggerated features (extreme cuteness, extreme coolness etc.), often at the cost of everything else, Ergo Proxy successfully avoids that common pattern by presenting a trio of very well-balanced protagonists in Re-l Mayer, Vincent Law and Pino:\\n\r\n- Re-l is a confident, no-nonsense investigator with very good analytical and shooting skills which, however, don't exceed the capabilities of a trained person and thus don't make her an invincible action hero or an omniscient genius. At first, she acts rather cold towards others (Vincent in particular) because she's a bit spoiled by her social position and because the circumstances demand her to be on guard all the time. However, as the show goes on Re-l changes quite a bit, and it becomes evident that she's a perfectly normal girl with normal human emotions. Also, she's very attractive but not oversexualized which is indeed an extreme rarity for this medium;\\n\r\n- Vincent lost his memories and a huge part of his identity with them, so he feels an obvious lack of confidence... and yet he knows how to repair things, how to hold a weapon and shoot, and  despite acting very shy at the beginning he embarks on a dangerous & often bewildering journey of self-discovery and gradually develops into a completely different person by the end of the series. So, he ain't some useless angsty teenager typical for anime - rather, he is a very kind and helpful guy who wants to learn the truth about himself. His angst never feels overblown to the point where it gets annoying, and his development throughout the story is truly one of the most fundamental I've ever seen;\\n\r\n- as for Pino, she's an autoreiv that accompanies Re-l & Vincent, providing some nice examples of man & machine interaction as well as some lightheartedness to compensate for the grim & serious setting. She is an awesome & very lovable character who at the same time never gets sickeningly moe because she acts like a normal girl of her age and not some typical loli you often see in anime.\\n\r\nAlso, the show has one more protagonist i.e. Ergo Proxy, but the identity & role of that guy is a huge spoiler so I can't tell you anything about him - you'll have to learn it yourself.\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that the right balance in characterization and the natural step-by-step development is what makes the protagonists very realistic, and while there may be people who don't like it because they find the characters \"boring\" (or not extreme enough in comparison to other series) I really enjoy this approach. What I enjoy no less is that the supporting cast receive a great share of development as well, with Raul Creed, Daedalus, Hoody and Iggy being the most outstanding examples. \\n\r\nSo, in general the characterization is great, and even if you don't find the cast that interesting at first, just give them some time and see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nPerhaps, the story could do better without a couple of questionable episodes, and the character drawings could be more consistent. Therefore, I can't really call this show a flawless masterpiece. However, I will easily give it an excellent rating and with lots of pleasure take it to my personal top-10.\\n\r\nMy final advice for possible newcomers is simple: if you look for some lighthearted entertainment with J-pop, sugoi, ganbatte, tomodachi, squealing voices and bright haircolors, stay away from this anime as you will only waste your time. The same is if you look for an action-driven series because action is not the focal point of Ergo Proxy.\\n\r\nHowever, if you look for a compelling story, if you are not afraid of a certain intellectual challenge, if you are open-minded and able to keep attention for 23 episodes, I highly encourage you to watch this show. Of course, I can't guarantee you will like it as much as I do, but I'm pretty sure you at least won't regret it.",

            "content": "- - - - [ Ergo Proxy :: Episodes - 26 ] - - - -\r\n[ Could contain minor spoilers. Sorry.. ]\r\nErgo Proxy. When I first saw that title, I was curious. I knew what a proxy was, on Internet and in real life. But I didn't know what Ergo was. So I got the series, mostly out of curiosity. I didn't expect much at first. The main female character, Re-L (Lil, Real, or any variant. Depends of fansub) has a freaky face with blue mascara, and wields a shotgun. I expect an all-out gun action series, with some mecha. But I was wrong! ErgoProxy is a great series, definitely worth seeing, and has even made it to my favourites list. Beware, there are not much humour or laughs in this series. It's a deep, dark and philosophical series. But trust me, definitely worth seeing.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Animation ] -\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that amazed me since the start of the series, till the very end is the quality of the animation. They combined modern and traditional to make a very good blend. The producers have been successful in creating a dark/moody atmosphere when needed. The light effects were amazing. They pointed out details wherever needed without flaw. The motion of the characters was very fluid, while maintaining the complexity of the backgrounds. If I may include a small spoiler here, the desolated lands pictured a bit later in the series are well made. You really get the feeling of sorrow and despair creeping in. However, although it may only be from my point of view, but in long-shots filmed from afar, you sometimes see the characters' features distort. Eg. an eye is above the other or toes seem strange. Can't expect much details from long-shots anyways but an eye above the other? Weird! Another dark point is that sometimes, the scenes are excessively...dark! You can't discern details easily. Apart from these, there are no major flaws in my opinion. Again, I should point out that the animators took some time to work on the scenes and have created beautiful and detailed backgrounds. Not overly detailed that you get the impression that you are in live-action, but just enough.. or just a bit not enough sometimes (dark scenes specially). Very little frame-reuse or even no frame-reuse if you ask me, just something nice to note.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Sound ] -\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I usually don't pay much attention to sound in animes. It's just there, nothing special. But here, it's different. The OP was great! The music suited my tastes entirely. Even the ED was very well made! The music really accompanied the moody and dark story. Just a side-tracking here, but I really like the way the ED credits is presented: A new, slanted type of presentation. Innovative if you ask me. The atmosphere sounds were well done, and did well in enhancing the moods and feelings of the Ergo Proxy. Not much in-series music available though. However, the OP and ED music don't seem to really fit in the quiet, dark and suspense-oriented Ergo Proxy. It's just too... lively. The music was great though!\\n\\n\r\n- [ Story ] -\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let me say it straight here itself: Ergo Proxy's story can be very very confusing and difficult to understand sometimes during some episodes, a bit Evangelion-like if you want i.e. Complex! But unlike Eva, most mysteries are eventually cleared, except for some. It's a series that you will want to go through once, get all the explanations, then go back and rewatch it just to appreciate the way the mysteries are introduced and pay particular attention to the minute details.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that adds confusion is that some episodes seem really out of place and do not seem to have any meaning at first. In fact, they are here to explain the details of Ergo Proxy in a non-intrusive and non-flagrant way. Be on the lookout for those and pay attention. They clear a lot of mysteries. Hint: Pay attention to the episode with the Quiz! :P Just like I said, some episodes seem out of place. Often, you are led on an episode with a very different story, only to find that one of the characters was dreaming or whatever like that. Sometimes, it's just too puzzling. You finish the episode and tell yourself \"What the hell just happened?\".\\n\\n\r\nNow, on with the main story which is about Re-L Meyer, grand-daughter of Donov Meyer - the administrator/head counciller of Romdeau Dome city and Vincent Law, an ordinary employee of the Autorave Division. At some point of time before the scene, Earth's environment became very polluted as a result of a Methane Hydrate layer combustion. This may be considered spoiler but it doesn't really affect the plot to know it. Anyways, 85% of Earth's population was wiped out as a result. The survivors now live in Dome Cities such as Romdeau, since the air outside the domes is nearly unbreathable. Later, you are explained the significance of WombSys and Amrita Cells. I can't reveal what these 2 things do without going into spoilers. However, Anikimeiski provided an elaborate explanation of Ergo Proxy's plot-line. If you require help after watching it, refer to his explanations. Google it to find out about the site.. (If you do not mind major spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nRe-L, working with her assistant Vincent Law, is investigating something known as Cogito (Cognito) Virus which allows Autoraves (robots that co-habit and help humans) to gain something with resembles emotion. So, they tend to become unpredictable and need to be eliminated. However, the real plot starts early as episode 2. During one of these investigations, Re-L is attacked by a monster (guess what it was! Pr... *spoilers*) which is very agile and quick. It leaves a hand print on the crime scene. Wanting to get more details, Re-L goes to her grand-father Donov Meyer to get answers but none is obtained. The story starts from here and quickly evolves into something unpredictable, after Vincent Law leaves the Romdeau for the Outside World. Excuse me if I introduced a number of spoilers, but it was required to make the scene clear.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very well presented, with a good pace, neither too fast, nor too slow. The action scenes, however, are fast-paced just as expected. There are no major loopholes, except for some later in the series. Refer to Conclusion for more details. The story is holds the viewer in suspense, and after watching an episode, it's difficult to resist watching the next. Until the end, the series maintained the suspense and mystery, spoon-feeding answers along the way as required. Nothing more to say here, I guess. It's a good plot-line, which kinda reminds me of George Orwell's 1984. Here too we got a seemingly perfect society but with severe flaws.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Characters ] -\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Ergo Proxy is what amazed me most! Every one of them and their backgrounds are well explained, leaving no details unexplained. Often, the characters have whole episodes to explain their past and their current self. This is awesome! I can't complain about lack of details regarding characters. with Ergo Proxy. They are all well developed into the story, and fade out as required. The main characters stay till the end, of course! What do you expect? If all main characters faded out, then there won't be any Ergo Proxy! :P\\n\\n\r\nThe characters each have well-defined emotional traits, strengths and weaknesses. Just to take an example, Re-L is very selfish at the beginning, caring only for her little self and not having any remorse regarding anything. She neglects everybody, included her Autorave Iggy and Vincent Law. However, as the series progresses, you can slowly see her change and evolve. Similarly, she is a very good fighter and observer, but fails to express feelings and be emotive enough, unlike Vincent Law, who is excessively emotive and weakling-like at first. Again, he'll develop his strengths as the story progresses. Amazing! Every character has his or her own motivations for what he/she's doing, whether good or evil. Sometimes, their actions seem wild or illogical, but it gives us an explanation of what the characters are actually feeling, whether it's love, hatred, duty or utter want for destruction.\\n\\n\r\nAs with series or movies that include robots and mechas, there is an emotion issue, that is human feel emotions and robots cannot. Here, even robots can feel after being infected by Cogito, but are in a way denied the right to feel emotions. That's what I was saying in the beginning, the stuff about philosophy. The Cogito virus introduces a very nice turn in the story, pushing the character development even furthur. Ergo Proxy explores such things as loyalty, denial of love, seeking acceptance, betrayal, friendship, companionship, split personalities, the good and evil side of oneself and such. It's pretty elaborate sometimes!\\n\\n\r\n- [ Value / Enjoyment ] -\\n\\n\r\nI'll keep this part short. There is not really enjoyment in Ergo Proxy since it's kinda dark and moody. However, it definitely has a good value for me and definitely earns a rewatch to clear up some points. Not much action, but if you want a good sc-fi type of suspence, mixed with action and spicy twists and turns, go watch Ergo Proxy. I definitely enjoyed Ergo Proxy which successfully maintained the suspense and surprises till the end. You won't be skipping episodes often here. However, the story can be kinda slow sometimes, which kinda annoys you.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Conclusion ] -\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really liked Ergo proxy. You don't find many series with such depth and with enough elaboration and complexity to keep you glued. However, as I mentioned earlier, there are some dark points that are not solved, the biggest one being the statement made by Vincent Law in the last episode. Maybe there will be an Ergo Proxy 2 or a second season. Maybe an OAV at least. If not, then it would have a very cheap ending! But I hope there will indeed be a good and proper ending to this marvellous series. Go watch it. It's definitely worth it, if you like the genre. Thanks for reading! Was kinda long this time.. Gomen! And I rarely give perfect mark 10! :P Ergo proxy may earn it however. It deserves it, but I am too miserly to see 10 given! :P",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy might just take the cake for being the most frustrating series that I've ever seen. Not only because of what it does wrong, but because of what it does right\u2014it's based on a great idea, and it features some great art and music, but unfortunately it doesn't know how to capitalize on any of these qualities.\r\nThe most immediately inviting aspects of Ergo Proxy are definitely the technical ones. It's set in a post-apocalyptic future in which mankind lives in self-contained cities (\u201cdomes\u201d). The main city of Romdo, portrayed as a maze of slummy apartment buildings and burned-out streets that contrast with the cleanand orderly buildings inhabited by the government, is a fitting setting that's clearly built with great care and deliberation. The use of shadows and atmospheric lighting is generally excellent. The outside world, an endless plane of ice and rock, isn't exactly a beautiful sight, but it's carefully rendered and features reasonably detailed background art. \\n\\n\r\nThe character and mecha designs are also eye-catching. Re-l, whose pale face and bright blue eye makeup form an essential contrast with the dark world, quickly became an icon of the series, and with good reason; it's a truly striking and unique design. Most of the cast is slightly more earthy and realistically depicted than the norm, with the character art generally steering clear of the round-faced round-body designs that have become typical. The vehicular and mechanical art is also of high caliber, with great models for the robotic companions (\u201cAutoReivs\u201d) that feature prominently in the series, as well as the flying airship on which a large part of the story takes place. There are occasional lapses in artistic quality, mostly noticeable in the form of inconsistent detailing on the faces and limbs of a few key characters, but for the most part, this is a visually strong production.\\n\\n\r\nFurther augmenting the technical side of the show is a superb soundtrack, ranging from low key electronic atmospheric noise to full-fledged techno rock that, while not always completely original sounding, is well-made and appropriate for the series. The tracks sometimes feature an element of chanted vocals that befit the slightly religious overtones of the series and the general feeling of impending apocalypse. The combination of the dystopian art and the solid musical score gives Ergo Proxy the kind of atmosphere that would make most entries in the \u201cdark sci-fi\u201d category jealous: It gives us the sense of a world on the edge, pushed to its limit, where something is about to break. It breeds suspense and curiosity.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is also possessed of a story that, on its own merits, isn't bad at all. Re-l, an investigator for Romdo's Intelligence Bureau, is pursuing a fugitive named Vincent Law, who is sought in connection with criminal activity. At the same time, she notices that high ranking members of the city's government are trying to cover up the existence of monsters called \u201cProxies,\u201d and decides to investigate the matter on her own authority. As the show wears on we eventually learn a bit more about the nature of Proxies and the nature of the world itself. A futuristic mystery that slowly leads to revelations about the world? Sounds like, with proper execution, this could be turned into an excellent story.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it's the \u201cproper execution\u201d part that can make the difference between great and not-so-great works of fiction, and it's for this reason that Ergo Proxy ends up comparable to a great athlete with a broken leg: Full of potential, but incapable of going anywhere. The first third or so of the series is promising. It moves along at a brisk pace, gradually raising questions and answering them where appropriate, advancing the mystery at a brisk speed. However, after this initial success, the story enters a slump from which it never recovers.\\n\\n\r\nThe most noticeable flaw in storytelling is the inclusion of several episodes that have little (if anything) to do with the plot. These episodes generally feature the characters in strange situations that are clearly meant to be mind-boggling or confusing, such as playing on a game show, having a chat in a hellish bookstore in the middle of nowhere, or interacting with strange creatures in a Disney Land-esque theme park. It's abundantly clear that these episodes are here only for the cheap thrill of making the audience think \u201cwhat the hell is going on?\u201d On rare occasions they give us pieces of information about the characters and the state of the world; however, that alone is not a sufficient reason for the existence of a large lump of material that is essentially irrelevant, and this information could have been conveyed through dialogue, discovery, or any other basic facet of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major flaw in Ergo Proxy's method of storytelling is the presence of an overwhelming amount of dialogue that strains to be philosophical but is ultimately repetitive and meaningless. Get ready to hear people say things like \u201cthis is the ultimate truth that all organisms strive to obtain through self-examination,\u201d or \u201cyou think, therefore I am\u201d on a regular basis. There seems to be an underlying theme of personal identity and finding one's reason for existence, and it's conveyed with all the subtlety of a ball-peen hammer to the face. Symbolism, simile, metaphor, repeated themes/motifs, and other standby elements that clever writers use when presenting an idea to the audience\u2014pretty much none of them are in play here, and they've been crudely replaced with line after line of inarticulate pseudointellectual drivel that gets an extremely disproportionate amount of screentime in the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, the series is split pretty evenly between duds and strong cast members. Re-l, the female lead, is the granddaughter of a government official. She's an interesting lead because she's emotionally detached, extremely competent and strong-willed...but at the same time, her privileged upbringing means that she's used to having others doting on her, giving her a bit of a spoiled side. Watching her develop as the series progresses is a rewarding experience. The male lead, Vincent Law, is of the dud variety; he doesn't really have a whole lot of character attributes other than \u201ckind,\u201d \u201coptimistic,\u201d and \u201cconfused,\u201d and while he does eventually learn a little bit more about himself, his personality remains pretty one-note. Perhaps the biggest example of wasted potential in the series is Pino, a young female robot who receives a soul due to a virus that affects robots (yes, that's really the explanation). She does have some strong character moments, but is mostly used as adorable comedic relief throughout the series. Now, imagine that: The show is supposed to be making a statement about identity and self-realization, and here they have a cast member who is both a robot that suddenly has emotions and the ability to think for herself, and a young girl who is coming of age and learning about life and death. It doesn't take a lot of thought to realize that she would be a PERFECT character to develop in order to convey these themes artfully and elegantly, but instead she ends up wearing a bunny suit and cracking jokes for a majority of the show. It's really too bad; they had the proper tool sitting right in front of them, but they didn't know how to use it.\\n\\n\r\nThe result of all of the aforementioned flaws is that Ergo Proxy pretty much writes the book on everything that's wrong with the recent trend of \u201cdeep\u201d (I use that word sarcastically) media directed at teens: It repeatedly uses dry and overly complicated dialogue to explain relatively simple concepts, repeatedly resorts to the use of plot contrivances like amnesia and multiple personality disorder to explain events, and repeatedly puts its characters into strange \u201cis-this-a-dream-is-this-not-a-dream\u201d situations, to the point where the whole thing becomes laughable, which I'm sure is not the intent of its writers. While not entirely devoid of strong attributes, Ergo Proxy is ultimately an example of a good idea gone to waste.",

            "content": "The Ancient Greeks created their own religion. Characters -- or rather, Gods -- were made based to human feelings as both: representation of what these feelings look like and what the characteristics and behaviors of these metaphors would be like. It didn't stop there. They created lore, past-stories and character potray to all of them, and decided that these Gods live on top of the Mount Olympus. And even today, 3000 years later, some geniuses go and ask \"why did they never bother to climb on Mount Olympus and check if the Gods are there?\" Because it wasn't the point of the story at all,and they knew it was just a made up story created by humans. Gods not being there was self-explanatory to all. That's why. \\n\\n\r\nWhat does this has to do with 'Ergo Proxy', then? 'Ergo Proxy' is made by, and made for these exact people who still keep wondering why Ancient Greeks never bothered to check if their Gods are real. This time it is about philosophical POV's which are apparently purposely misunderstood and misinterpreted by the creators of this work, and then further mistaken by its viewers for an actual anime series about these famous existential questions. I can agree that this work is thought-provoking, but the references in it are fallacies and every in-depth analysis over-analysing of not what is there, but what one believes is there. It chooses the same path as later Freudian literature which was altered by his daughter based to what she thought Freud meant rather than writing the exact thing Freud said. As a conclusion in case my point hasn't been made clear yet: 'Ergo Proxy' is not a work of philosophy, it is a work of its creators interpretations of famous philosophies. This series is not a study nor can it be seen as a reference, it is nothing but a preach by someone who thought they have understood what our great philosophers \"really\", I mean REALLY meant. To me, their interpretations are no different from those people who ask why Greeks didn't climb the goddamn mountain. \\n\\n\r\nTo actually talk about this anime outside is hideous content, it quite literally sucks ass. The directing is a mess, the pacing is so dreadfully slow one has to wonder why the fans of this series consider themselves smart for liking this spoon-fed \"deepness\". At least Anno, the creator of Evangelion admitted he just threw bunch of religious references in the mix to make it look smart and make people hyped for it being 2deep5anyone and everyone to understand. While I am not sure if the creators of 'Ergo Proxy' are lacking self-awareness or simply never cared to admit that their work is bunch of baloney: it surely is doing an impressive job convincing masses to think that it isn't. They went as far as put bunch of obscure references in the background art, such as faces of these philosophers they claim to imitate because apparently the point of their ideas and philosophies is the best captured by an AD HOMINEM.\"The essential part of what was said is what the face of the person who said it looks like.\"  Like really, how subtle and how well I can prove my intelligent by liking this.\\n\\n\r\nNow the second attempt to talk about content outside the philosophies. Real is the only interesting character in the series. Most of the others feel more of a try-hard attempts to capture something completely different than personalities, which alone is a respectable idea considering the nature of the series. Still, all of them come out rather uninteresting and content-lacking. If comparing to the same Greek Gods, our characters here are rather empty shells. One could say that this makes it great, other say they deliver as much as any harem girl. Pino, on the other hand, is simply annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe series does contain lot of good as well, they are mainly hidden and short scenes such as a quiz that leads to the OP song to play. Great ideas in not so great series. The opening itself is an everlasting meme. Real creates most of the other interesting scenes and situations in the series, but ultimately leave me wish she was a character inside a better anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion: Ergo Proxy is not a very good series for those who want something more from anime outside simply \"getting it.\" Getting Ergo Proxy is not by any means any harder than \"getting\" Sword Art Online. Both can be overanalyzed to the grave by anyone who doesn't know what occam's razor is. To those who are interested in philosophical anime, watch Serial Experiments Lain, GITS SAC, Digimon Tamers, Wolfs Rain, Kino no Tabi (1st season), even the first Pokemon movie (in Jap dub). Watch Ergo Proxy and find not much more than pretentiousness as the series target audience consist of people who saw the meme \"The door is red. The author uses the color red to express his anger.\" and thought this is what all symbolism should be like, regardless if it is intended by its creator or not.",

            "content": "There is some excellent production in this cyberpunk thriller/road trip set in an eerie utopian futurescape filled with robots and starring a female protagonist in the vein of Ghost in the Shell's Motoko.\r\nExcept Ergo Proxy's Re-l Mayer has sexy eyeshadow.  And she's petulant to a degree that she mirrors today's shallow socialites.  Ok, so she's absolutely nothing like the strong-willed, decisive and intelligent Motoko.  But hey Mayer's young, she's got makeup and dresses alternative style.  Yes, you can see where the animators' priority lay with this production.  Things get even more ridiculous when a girl in a pink bunny outfitappears and sticks around.\\n\\n\r\nThis feels like a more accessible version of TeXhnolyze, although unlike that excellent anime, Ergo Proxy falters too much and ultimately the story feels ponderous with its lack of pace, drive and purpose.  It has a po-face the entire time, trying to fool you into thinking its a serious grand epic vision with some amazing revelation that will shock you to your core and hail it as the toppler of all cyberpunk titles before it.  Needless to say it fails on all counts.  It falls flat on its mascara-ridden face.\\n\\n\r\nTeXhnolyze had the same face, lacking make-up, but backed it up with substance, it really did shock you with its revelations in the latter half of the series, and when the crap hits the fan for many characters, you feel something, because they're portrayed as humans.  In Ergo Proxy, everyone is seemingly made of wood and is as lively as a plank.  I do find it interesting how obnoxious the main protagonist Mayer is in this show though, its a refreshing change in a way, being that anime's main leads are usually goody two shoes, but instead of being an interesting character with a flawed personality, she's just plain obnoxious all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe series however does reach a particular zenith with episode 20 which revolves around the theme of multiple personality disorder, successfully mindhumping the viewer in an entertaining fashion.  There are meaty topics and ideas thrown around this show, I mean with a title like Ergo Proxy it would be a crime not to have characters spouting painfully obvious commentary on mainstream philosophical theories, but whats actually a crime is to have no one interesting or empaphetic and nothing compelling or engaging occuring on screen.  The show is lifeless, which is deeply ironic.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's end credits have Radiohead's Paranoid Android, it gets points for that at least.",

However very quickly the story begins to take an unfocused long path toward an ever weakening storyline, slowely revealing each character to have almost no depth beyond their basic neurosis. Even the art style weakens only a handful of episodes in.\r\nThis Anime includes some pretty painful filler, some full episodes but even more offensive are some of the episodes that contain one or two moments of \"main story\" plot, but are mainly filler in the formof characters rehashing old ideas or questions we the viewer has already figured out the answers to.\\n\\n\r\nThe show spends a lot of time dabbling in questions of existentialism and theology, this comes off as simplistic and childish as the characters indulging in these ideas are so one dimensional and unfleshed out that the viewer ends up with no interest as to what conclusion they come to.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of this anime, i found myself watching just to be able to say that i hadn't given up on it, i no longer cared about any of the characters, and i no longer cared about the out come.\\n\\n\r\nmy advice is to give this one a miss",

            "content": "\"In a world where humans and robots live together...\" \rSounds generic, no? This opening line to the description of the anime is rather misleading. I strongly advise you to take a second look at this before dismissing it out of hand as unoriginal. \rErgo Proxy stands out from among other stereotypical anime shows because of its ability of *not* resorting to these oft used plotlines. What this anime focuses on is the development of a few main characters in a world erupting into chaos. While the viewpoint of the show does not originally show it, a great deal of Ergo Proxy is centered around ayoung man's self discovery and acceptance of who he is, learning to interact with others, and to remain true to himself.\\n\\n\rThis show reminded me most of all of the anime Evangelion. If you, the reader, have ever seen Eva, you may recall the rather deep scenes near the end, wherein the main character attempts to resolve numerous internal conflicts, ultimately resulting in a moment of revelation. Now, as far as I understand it, the director of Ergo Proxy did *not* have a nervous breakdown like the director of Eva, but the depth of the introspective episodes were very similar.\\n\\n\rAs for the anime itself, I enjoyed the radical variance in the story of each episode. While the settings of the story remain very similar - a city, a shanty-town, and a wasteland are the preeminent landscapes \u2013 the actions in the episodes defy prediction. Whereas in some animes\u2019 episodes you seemingly have a cycle of events that repeat over and over again, Ergo Proxy remains unique every time. \\n\\n\rOn a slightly less approving note, I will say that some of the scenes were truly very, very random, and only upon serious retrospection will you note that they have anything to do with the core plot at all. No spoilers here, however.\\n\\n\rAlso, while in some episodes you will be given background history about the show in a natural, conversational manner, there are points where the show simply comes out and presents the information to you. The impact of this is that at those moments it seems less that you are watching a naturally unfolding story than that you are reading a fact sheet about the show.\\n\\n\rDespite these few setbacks however, the anime still stands at a strong \u20189\u2019 on my list. I enjoyed the viewing of the anime all the way to the end, which continues the suspense and unpredictability. The plot is written wonderfully here at the finish as well, leaving the future unresolved and unexplained, leaving it up to the viewer to imagine what happens.\\n\\n\rI will invite everyone who enjoys a thrilling, action-pack, and very emotionally and psychologically deep story to watch \u201cErgo Proxy.\u201d\\n\\n\rRating: 9/10",

            "content": "There is some spoilers into this, there is also me telling you that  watching this is not worth any of  your time.\r\nErgo Proxy is one of these promising series that your friends tell you to watch and declare as \"masterpiece.\"\r\nIt was one of the series i expected to love the most, i thought it was going to be consistently good, and the first episode kinda told me that my friends were right, it had a lot of potential to it, it was promising, it had a touch of atmospheric space that got you into it, but what made this series so appealing inthe first episode fastly changed for some The Room Avant-Garde crap. I mean, i compare The Room to this, but i can give the credits to Wiseau atleast, for even trying. \\n\\n\r\nTrying to immerse yourself into a toilet world where babies shit frootloops and babies give birth to adults, is more easy than to immerse yourself into that piece of crap that is Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2 First episode had structure, but it threw it fast away to try to be experimental, but you don't get experimental much with the biggest clich\u00e9s in mystery storytelling. Ergo Proxy makes you fall gradually into an abyss of boredom. Episode 16 is probably the most boring and monotonous episode i have ever seen in an anime. Period. Episode 4 and 5 were a boring redneck vibes, monotonous piece of audio visuals that made you think  more about what you're doing with your life than the child who just got killed, at this episode 4  i knew i f*cked up. Forever after come with what has already been done in the past, but way less ambitious and just... hahh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4 Ergo Proxy succeeded in being interesting until episode 3, where you could clearly see that the structure was collapsing, and that the universe stopped being rigid, complete, real, unique to itself. It just became some trashy decor you'll see in an amateur movie with no skills for backgrounds whatsoever. The background, the environment was lacking in realism, it was lacking in everything it had no wish to make you immerse into it. It made you feel like they were trying something, while trying nothing at all. The visuals in it kept degrading like everything else.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5 Sound was okay, sometimes it went off from what was happening on the screen, but i mean, this came out in 2006, and you can't expect the sound to save your background, your script, storytelling, you can't. Sound was probably the best thing about this show, it was mediocre but way better than the show itself, i would have listened to an album of the OSTs of Ergo Proxy instead of the show itself, if only i knew back then.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1 Characteristically speaking, Ergo Proxy had nothing to offer, neither Re-l or Vince had any depth, substance, or any characteric traits that made them interesting in the first place, nahh, it was the contrary, they never helped to try to keep that show alive and interesting, they were one of the core of why Ergo Proxy was painful to watch. Re-L could only complain and cute cute fanservice while being a complete dumbster while Vince was one of the most shallow and dense character in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1 Kill me, kill me please, it's probably what i was feeling deep inside. Why i am watching this while i could just rewatch Tokyo Ghoul first season, which is way more well executed and thoughtful  than this thing, which is just edgy in the irritating sense. Edgy to be edgy. It tells you a lot when you remember something for how bad it was. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4 This thing clearly has Velvet Underground and Lou Reed vibes to it, poor Lou Reed, i hope he is not associated with this, because it would only \\n\r\nbe a shame to link a legend with this stuff that was so bland and empty, \\n\r\nit was just like watching nothing at all. It would  just  be an utter insult to Lou and his works.  This show is a 4, first three episodes were watcheable, after it's just a downfall in a pool of  garbage crap that never ceased to smell. I really wished i could get back the time i spent on it, \\n\r\nbut it's too late, unfortunately.\\n",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy. Wow. This one\u2019s tough to review.\r\nErgo Proxy is not your typical cyberpunk anime. For more, it doesn\u2019t rely on heavy gun-fighting action scenes to grasp viewers\u2019 attentions instead it uses mind-break and a very intriguing strange and dark atmosphere in a post-apocalyptic world. Though a post-apocalyptic world is something that is not new or could even be said overused, Ergo Proxy\u2019s is fluid and very well thought out. \r\nErgo Proxy stands out among other cyberpunk anime as this one is a truly original and is very unique as it takes on Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 very famous philosophical statement which is \u201ccogito ergo sum\u201d andviews it on different perspectives. \u201cCogito ergo sum\u201d means \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d is basically the main theme of the anime. The whole world of Ergo Proxy itself is based on this theme while questioning and taunting the said philosophical statement. Everything was built along with those lines while the story revolves around the characters who were searching for self-actualization over the course of 23 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy has a very fast pacing which could indeed get you hooked for about 10minutes into the show. It started off with Re-l Mayer investigating cases of \u201cAutoReivs\u201d (Android-like companions) being infected with a virus called \u201ccogito.\u201d This \u201ccogito\u201d virus is a dangerous virus for humans as this \u201cAutoReivs\u201d once infected with the virus comes to a realization that they too have a heart thus leading to human-like emotions which could in turn lead to trouble as they now tend to act on how they feel but not on how their masters command them to. After some investigations, while at home, Re-l saw a word written in blood that stated \u201cawakening\u201d and was approached by an entity called a \u201cPROXY.\u201d A lot of these intriguing scenarios will be shed light upon as the story progresses. Interesting right? See episode 2 as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll instantly get hooked.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy presents different but very realistic problems including politics, ways of life, beliefs, and the search for one\u2019s true self. Treading along the anime, these issues will be faced with subtlety and precision without ever being dragging. Though its pacing is very fast, some might be surprised as at the middle of the anime, somewhere past around 13 episodes, it went to a complete halt as it now focused on the changes that are happening with the characters. We now see Pino\u2019s journey for self-actualization, Vincent\u2019s search for the truth, and Re-l\u2019s changing feelings for the ones around her. These episodes are not entirely focused on the characters though; some contains bags of clues about the reality of Ergo Proxy while some are just placed there to add to the length or simply called fillers. Though these episodes might be fillers, you wouldn\u2019t immediately recognize that they are, as these fillers have a knack of making your brain burst out leaving you thinking for hours about what really happened; but even if you\u2019ve managed to solve what was the episode about, it wouldn\u2019t change anything as these fillers were totally irrelevant to the main point of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some episodes that contain complete mindfuck which in turn made the story stagnant, Ergo Proxy now picks up on what it has left for the grand finale. If there was anything that I could really complain about Ergo Proxy, it would be the ending. For a total mind-breaking anime, I couldn\u2019t ignore that some loose ends were still loose and some missing links were still missing. It actually felt like the anime was saying that it\u2019s up to the viewers to figure out what happened about this or that; well for a total mindfuck anime, maybe it is really trying to do that. But still, it doesn\u2019t hinder the thrilling rollercoaster ride I got from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I absolutely find fascinating in Ergo Proxy is the gradual development of our three main characters. As I\u2019ve said, Pino is in a journey of self-actualization and being infected by the cogito virus, this slowly transforms Pino from an emotionless companion-type AutoReiv to something that is more if not, realistically human. Vincent on the other hand, is in search for his true self as it was stated that he was brainwashed and is now on his way looking for answers. At first, I honestly thought that Vincent was a major wimpy guy, but he turned out to be one of the coolest male leading characters out there. As the story goes along, he gradually changes as the truth about him are unveiled. Lastly, Re-l is not your typical bad-ass girl who wields dual pistols and can shoot anyone with her eyes closed. No, she is your normal snobbish lady who gets scared, weak and is worth protecting; only thing is she\u2019s really courageous or more like stubborn. After some realizations and some great revelations, you will notice her gradual change of heart regarding everyone around her. All of these traits make them look very real as humans which made me really admire Ergo Proxy as this is a hard one to pull off considering that the setting is in a post-apocalyptic world.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that the production value of this anime is high as the animation was fluid and the backgrounds were simply amazing. From the desolated wastelands to the deserted cities, all were done with accuracy. Sometimes though, I think the lighting is somewhat of a bother as it tends to be too dark that you\u2019ll have difficulty seeing what\u2019s really happening. Character designs however were very human-like and if you\u2019ve seen Witch Hunter Robin, it is very much the same. But there were also inconsistencies as sometimes, when looked from afar, the facial structure of the characters becomes distorted. Nevertheless, the animation was really good leaving you wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nPino\u2019s character design however was so adorable and lovely that no one could ever ignore her cuteness. Though this is not a comedy anime, sometimes you\u2019ll find yourself smiling and even touched for the cute things she does. Often too that Pino\u2019s character is matched with the dramatic scenes of this anime that you could even feel a small aching on your chest.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made this successful was Pino\u2019s seiyuu Akiko Yakima. She portrays her lines very well which fits the cute attitude of Pino. And I\u2019m not saying that Pino has the only voice acting that was good, in fact all of the voices behind the characters were astounding. Not to mention that the opening and ending song were very good which weren\u2019t J-pop but rather alternative English songs. The opening song (kiri) sets a thought-provoking environment while the ending song (PARANOID ANDROID) finishes what the opening has brought forth. The background music during scenes is good in setting the mood if it is meant to be thrilling or meant to be dramatic. And who could ignore the amazing use of background silence? Rarely could you see an anime that uses silence and be excellent with doing so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ergo Proxy is a very unique anime that could give you one hell of a ride all the way through. If it weren\u2019t for the unneeded fillers and a much clearer explanation of things, then this would be something phenomenal. It is a true brain-twister that will leave you puzzled for hours just because of some certain events. If you\u2019re into mentally challenging anime, then this is definitely for you. I certainly enjoyed it and much likely that you will too.\\n\\n\r\nJust to summarize things:\\n\r\nErgo Proxy = MINDFUCK.",

            "content": "Note: Spoilers for Ergo Proxy. Written for people who have watched the show and want an analytical review. You have been warned.\r\nAn echo, a heartbeat pounding in the eye of the storm, Centzontotochtin sails over the earth, and the pulse of the awakening signals the beginning of the end.\r\nErgo Proxy aired over ten years ago and to this day remains an enigma to many. Its creative thought experiments and questions about our purpose in life have been just as mesmerizing as they have been easily dismissed. But whether it\u2019s thoughtfully ambiguous or frustratingly obtuse, what\u2019s consistent is Ergo Proxy\u2019s mystique beneath its decrepit and artificiallandscape, a captivating blend of the real and the surreal that reveals how easy it has become for us to mistake the double for the authentic.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout, we are presented with illusions, smoke and mirrors, dream worlds, and nightmares, where reality and truth has been distorted by the agents of a lost civilization. Think of supple fingers curved in Shakespearean fashion or a bookstore of forgotten memories. As the Proxies roam their respective domed cities, searching endlessly to satisfy their raison d\u2019etre, what tethers us to reality are Vincent and Re-L. They are equally confounded by the mysteries they confront in their quest for answers about the Proxies.\\n\\n\r\nWe are led to believe that outside the dilapidated dome cities and noxious caves, aboard Centzontotochtin in a vast swath of desert and frozen seas is the real world in the aftermath of some environmental catastrophe. Here is where Re-L spends her time logging her experiences, taking dutiful care of personal hygiene, and complaining about an upright toilet seat. It\u2019s where Vincent and the AutoReiv companion Pino play in the snow and act unsuspectingly of the dangers ahead. Here, in the supposed real world, with nothing but dead landscape and a chilling wind on the horizon, is where our characters can introspect and consider the world as it is.\\n\\n\r\nYet, for all their artificial and mundane characteristics, the domes appear much closer to a tangible description of human reality. Be it Romdeau and its aristocratic bureaucracy, the empty residential fields populated by outdated AutoReivs still performing their quotidian responsibilities, or a commercial shopping mall home to a mad doppelganger, many of these domes symbolize and, more importantly, simulate some element of human culture. It is necessary to note that these are all images of what Earth used to look like, which systemically break apart without order. Still, these last vestiges of a biologically engineered society engender that moment in time; it precedes the reality of the outside world. The artificial, in other words, has become the real, and to the good citizens of Ergo Proxy, indistinguishable from reality. The outside world has become in, Jean Baudrillard\u2019s words, \u201cthe desert of the real itself.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn The Precession of a Simulacra, Baudrillard also references Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s \u201cOn Exactitude in Science.\u201d An empire, so attuned with the art of cartography, produces a map of exact size and scale of itself. Succeeding generations, less enthusiastic of the map, discards it to the west, where it now lays in tatters. In similar fashion, the Proxy Project begins with a mass engineering of a worldwide experiment, which recreates pockets of human civilization in its old image. Inevitably, however, the very creators of the domes, many of them unsatisfied or driven by madness and self-loathing, discard their own works, where they now decay against the harsh winds of the wasteland. And thus, much like Borges ingrains in our memory not the empire, but rather the bizarre and ruined map of its territory, the domes of Ergo Proxy in all their systemic imperfections occupy our understanding of the end of civilization. They are, quite literally, proxies for reality.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two things to draw from this interaction of the real and the double. The first is to see how Ergo Proxy merges conceptions of dreams and reality to one meaningful abstraction. The second is to see how this relationship drives the show\u2019s search for purpose and existence.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a pervasive motif about dreams or dreamlike sequences, where characters are ensnared by a Proxy\u2019s powers. Many of the dreams feel real, and their contents often translate to the real world, as seen by the books in Anamnesis aboard the Centzontotochtin and the dome holding the animated characters from Pino\u2019s dream. On one hand, Ergo Proxy uses these dreams to elucidate the consciousness of the characters. For Vincent, it\u2019s his ontological question of who he is and if he exists in the world. For Pino, it\u2019s whether she possesses a soul and a capacity for morality. For Re-L, it\u2019s her timidity to approach the truth, in fear that it will upset the balance of her orderly existence.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, these sequences attempt to break down the characters\u2019 tenuous relationship with reality. The experiences of their dreams can overcome the experiences of the real. Vincent\u2019s admission of his identity as a Proxy is only cemented after his ethereal travels through the misty City Lights Bookstore. Pino\u2019s intuition from her dream overrides her companions\u2019 needs to stop for supplies. In both cases, these dreams, initiated by Proxies, have merged the surreal with the real to become a new sort of reality. Many within the world of the Ergo Proxy do not see any meaningful distinction between reality and a simulation of it precisely because the two have become one.\\n\\n\r\nAn exception to this is Re-L, who identifies her own dream as such. In Ophelia, Vincent is in a seemingly never ending cycle with a Proxy taking on every appearance but its own. Vincent is grateful that in the end, Re-L is capable of telling apart the impostor from himself. However, he quickly discovers that Re-L manages to differentiate Vincent from his double because she identifies that the impostor does not possess a shadow. For Vincent, however, this lack of distinction highlights his inability to come to terms with his identity. This slippery grasp of reality is a central conflict in Vincent's mind and is culminated in the final dream of the series, where Vincent is able to identify a fake world from the real, thus confirming his existence and place on Earth.\\n\\n\r\nThis dynamic between the bizarre and the normal, the dream and the real, and how they merge and separate is what gives Ergo Proxy\u2019s search for a raison d\u2019etre such a powerful poignancy. The reason is because inevitably we discover each of our main characters are themselves doubles of an original. Vincent and Re-L are copies of Proxy One and Monad, respectively. Pino is an alternative for a child. In addition, all three are failures of their original intention. Vincent never lives up to his potential as a model citizen, Re-L rejects the boring order of her grandfather\u2019s city and is cast aside for another clone of herself, while Pino is replaced by a newborn child.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, each character transcends his or her original place and assumes an agency over their own destinies, which allows them to overcome the destruction of Romdeau. They reject the artificiality of the order, and in doing so, also reject the simulated reality forced upon them thousands of years ago, when the desert of the real first came into being.\\n\\n\r\nIt is therefore fitting that those who survive to face the progenitors of Old Earth are dysfunctional copies, never meant to survive in the original system of waste and good citizenry. In a world completely artificial, here we have three souls: an amnesiac, a clone of a goddess, and an orphaned child, all of whom abandon their original duties to discover their reason for existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe word ergo is Latin for \u201ctherefore,\u201d while proxy refers to one who may stand to represent something. As the dark clouds recede from the heavens, and the light of a never before seen sun scorches Daedaelus\u2019s crafted wings, Vincent Law looks up and remarks that \u201cthis is the world that faces us, a world called \u2018reality.'\u201d He declares himself Ergo Proxy, an Agent of Death, and therefore, a representative for a new humanity.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is basically another puzzling, post-apocalyptic view of the future, which had the potential of being a superb show but there was way too much talk in this dreary show.\r\nThe first couple of episodes have a \"Ghost in the Shell\" feel to them, where only the setting is explained and not much is given away, forcing you to figure it out yourself. This show does a terrible job in it's explanations as it force feeds the viewer with so much jargon and it's only the illegal fansub version that will help it all make sense, with their notes.\r\nBeyond this problem there is a brilliantstory that focuses on three main characters: Vincent (an immigrant with a hazy past and something special about him), Re-l (a detective in search of the truth) and Pino (an infected auto-rave). It isn't long before these three superb characters are thrown into a journey of self discovery and the stuff they discover is interesting and does a great job in revealing the link between Vincent and the title of this show &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot;. In the midst of all this there are some spectacular action sequences however this occurs so rare that the show tends to get boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality of the anime is way above average with animation so great you wouldn't want to blink. The artistry is amazing having a mix of 2D animation, 3D modeling and CG that go so well together. The action sequences are what show the full effect of the amazing animation where so much detail is put into every frame and what makes it even better is the slow motion effect. The only issue can be crowds, as the character models tend to degrade in quality when dealing with a lot of people.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is basically a compilation of alternative music that goes well with the eerie, moody atmosphere. For people who are fans of bands like Linkin Park will definitely like the opening and ending theme that will get you involuntarily humming the tune.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a great show which had so much potential but with the lack of action, the superb animation does feel a bit wasted, plus there's all the winding talk. The 1st half of the show was done well but it did go downhill a bit in the 2nd half, where times when it's hard to tell if something is real or some kind of dream. There were also some incredibly stupid and weird episodes that attempts to be original but fails miserably. The show ends with some very confusing three episodes, which require a lot of thought to make any sense. So this anime is really just for people smart enough to understand its very obscure story and doesn't expect much from the action department.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I want to state a few things up front. I'm a former philosophy major and I still enjoy learning about academic philosophy. Pretentious is my first, last and middle name. I'm more than willing to defend the likes of Metal Gear Solid 2, Finnegans Wake and Beyond the Black Rainbow. You can't reach my levels of pretension if you tried. The depths of my tepid intellectual masturbation and pseudo-intellectualism have very little if any bounds. My inner fedora can't be breached by mere mortals. In my head where I am already a massive intellectual superstar they call me \"the sophist with the most wits.\" IfI had enough courage to leave the house, I'd be one of those guys that puts on a suit with a bowtie and reads large non-fiction books at Starbucks and stares pensively at the air through my square frame glasses and I would order coffee with no accoutrements so it can be black like my soul. That's my level of pretension kids. So let me say up front my problem with this show isn't that I got confused, I'm not the kind of person who gets confused by big words and unneeded complication I live for it. I mean I've read books by Hegel and Heidegger. You can't get much more needlessly complicated than that. I'm also not averse to a little pretension in my media, I tend to be more forgiving of this than most people, especially if the art or media in question has other merits. I have a kinship with intellectual failures like myself and fake gotta recognize fake yo. I also didn't mind the so called \"experimentation\" in fact as you'll come to see it would be hard for me to dislike it as I never really \"found\" it to begin with. I like experimentation in media a lot, if I'm asked to choose between two musical acts for instance I tend to choose the one that takes more risks with experimenting and genre mixing as a rule. So if this show lived up to it's common perception, it should be 10/10 IGN for a chap like me self, but it's not really like the negative stereotype of what it is and it's not really what the fans think it is either. I'm going to argue in the rest of this review that this show is just a basic action show with a weak story. \\n\r\nFor those not in the know, Ergo Proxy (EP) is a show about a post-apocalyptic future where a woman gets in a tussle with her robotic protector and some guy, then they go on a journey to some ruins and the story ends after they come back for the final boss fight. This is exactly how it happens, don't dispute it, just compute it. Some philosophy and psychological stuff is thrown in that we will go over later and some action happens in between. \\n\\n\r\nLets talk about what people say they like about this show and first I will discuss experimentation. The first and most fundamental way a piece of media can be experimental is to fundamentally change the format of the story entirely. By format I mean the basic framework around the story and the way you present it, outside of it's actually story content. Well this show doesn't really do anything concerning experimentation with this, in fact it's a straight linear line A to B plot. A show \"experimenting\" might tell things out of order, it might go extremely minimalist, it might go the opposite, it might try to transcend it's own media and or genre etc. It's hard to describe the lack of something and the positive of something vague like experimentation. That is the thing about experimentation, it's hard to describe on it's own but it's one of those things that \"you know it when you see it.\" I gave tangible examples but I recognize that in some ways these are already mundane and limited in their own sense and might be a bit clich\u00e9d by now in their own right. The main point I want to make is that EP doesn't really do anything with it's plot or format that warrants calling it \"experimentation.\" \\n\r\nYou know what this entire show is exactly like down to mundane details of it's plot, the way the story is told and look of the characters? The Big O. Oh I mean \"BIG O, BIG O, BIG O, BIG OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!.\" Only I never heard anyone call that show \"experimental.\" You have a mysterious domed city, with an outside that's mostly pollution, garbage and Sword Art Online DVD's. A mysterious pale female character that looks and acts like a robot with la faux geisha makeup at the same time. A male character who is strong and mysterious in his own way. If you paint the butler in Big O silver you also have the robot character, they're both even servants by nature. It's Big O without the mech and a lot of exposition. I think the easiest way to explain how mundane the format is, if I told someone to give me a plot outline of the story the way they lay it out wouldn't be any different from how the actual show laid things out, showing how easily digestible all the information and lack of so called experimental barriers to entry there are here. To finally nail down this point lets compare this to another show that has been called experimental as well and deals with similar themes and ideas Serial Experiments Lain. \\n\r\nYou have two shows that talk about the good aspects and the potential dangers of technology and philosophical concepts. Both attempt to delve into psychology and peoples sense of self to varying degrees of success. I don't think Lain is a super deep show either, but what I can say about it that I can't say about EP is that by the end of the series the show hardly looks like the same show that is was from episode 1. At some point in the mid series things go way off the rails and the shows animation and editing attempt to reflect some of the concepts they're trying to get across here, without just stating them outright through exposition. The format changes a lot in Lain and I can't say they just told me an A-B story. It also leaves a lot more to interpretation, due in part to it's more heavy reliance on imagery rather than words but also just from the way it's told. EP by contrast looks, is edited and has the same mid paced action animation all throughout the show. It makes no attempt to tie it's animation to the concepts it's trying to get across, unless fists equal philosophical arguments. Well in fairness to Ergo, I did want to punch a few people upon hearing their philosophical beliefs, but I wouldn't say this translated into my own argument unless I was arguing might makes right. I guess Thrasymachus missed his calling as an Anime creator. So the editing isn't experimental, the animation isn't experimental, the way the story is told is not fundamentally different from most shows, so what is? I would like to know that myself. \\n\r\nYou wanna know a little secret that isn't that much of a secret about getting people to care about what you write? You include a little sex or violence. Totem and Taboo, Survival and reproduction. We instinctually feel an importance for this stuff because we're walking talking cell machines that feel the need to survive long enough to make copies of ourselves. So anything that involves danger or potentially doing the nasty makes us care because we want to learn to avoid one and get a lot of the other, I'll let you choose which. What If I didn't want to be cheap though, what if I wanted to engage people in intellectual ideas in a way that was new and yet still exciting? Well the first thing I wouldn't do is make it an action show, because we have seen that a million times before. I definitely wouldn't call a show that did things this way experimental in fact I would call it rudimentary for it's time and place.  There are two essential basic defaults for anime right now as I see it, la tranche de vie and le show d'action. These are the first person shooters of anime and by that I mean they're the type of thing made most because marketing trends and ease of understanding dictate that this is what consumers want you to give them to imbibe like drone bees circling the hive cluster. Action ticks off that survival part of our brain and makes us feel an immediate emotion, so it is easy to make and its easy to get people to feel good about it and engaged. I'm saying all this for two reasons one is to illustrate that making this show action oriented detracts from the idea that it is \"experimental\" by virtue of the fact that action is an extremely easy and common genre to appeal to mass audiences with and two, to set you up to ask a question. Strip away all supposed psychological and philosophical window dressing from this show for a second and ask yourself this: Is this show fundamentally different from just a plain action show without these pretenses? Can you find anything about it that really warrants you saying it is more \"experimental\" than other shows of this genre? For my part I saw these as fundamental questions for this review and my answer was \"no\" to both of them. There is nothing about EP that makes me think it's any different from the hundreds of other action shows out there.  Couple this with the fact that a lot of anime shows have similar post apocalyptic and science fiction leanings that are much better utilized. I would argue that this show and others would actually be more \"experimental\" if they went the more common route and made a slice of life anime about deep psychological and philosophical things. There have already been a lot of action shows that dip into these themes but the amount of slice of life shows that attempt to be experimental and thought provoking can be counted on one hand or less. At the end of the day most if not all of these shows are a product to sell figurines and make you feel good for an hour or so, but even when faced with the dichotomy of the two most common shows to appeal to the lowest common denominator viewer EP zagged hard and fast towards the easier more tread upon genre to do this with. So in going action it dilutes it's so called experimentation even that little bit much more. \\n\r\nPeople say this show mixes genres, but I don't really see it. It's essentially post apocalyptic sci-fi and in that genre its a pretty standard unimaginative use of the tropes and cliches therein. In it's slight defense it's kind of hard to mix genres when your baseline is post apocalyptic sci-fi, if you try to mix in any genre that isn't primarily about depressive atmospheric and heightened negative emotions you end up with a bad muted tone that nerfs what's appealing about this kind of fiction. In other words you wind up with a Bethesda Fallout, when I'm trying to make something serious like New Vegas. While we're on the subject of this show and it's genre, I would like to note that this show is pretty scant on the \"science\" in the science fiction equation. It doesn't really introduce any kind of cool technological innovations or ideas we haven't seen before and it doesn't have scientific concepts at the core of it's story telling. I mean I'm a philosophy fanboy but you have to have some of this in your Sci-Fi show kids.                            \\n\r\nSo maybe in lieu of that you're probably hoping the content of the story is experimental. Yeah... Not so much. Everything is pretty easy to understand. It's complicated the way things like \"Inception\" are complicated in that if you don't listen to every piece of stated exposition with a little bit of brain power you might get lost. If you don't listen to what the people say because you have your cellphone out or you're playing sex VN's in another window, you'll be confused. Everything in this show is so spelled out that I find it really hard to believe anyone actually had a hard time following this. I'd like to use this review as a soapbox and show my humongous epeen knowledge on philosophy and how this show gets it wrong with all of my \"ACTUUAAAALKLLKYS\" but the reality is that the references to philosophy are window dressing at best and just nonexistent for most of the show. Some talking statues are named after philosophers... I'm not exactly sure why, they never really do anything philosophical. I mean one scene where they do logic tables, have a Socratic debate or use hermeneutics would have done wonders and saved this show... Ok so in all seriousness. I didn't really expect them to do that kind of stuff. I think they were trying to imply these AI statues were like philosopher kings, but at least a few of the philosophers listed had no political thought to speak of and a lot of them would not advise the things done by the shows society. In some cases it would be much better and much worse. I'd like to see how a Late Wittgensteinian society would contrast with an early Wittgensteinian society. Yeah actually animators would just go the lazy route and make the early stuff all about an extreme rules governed society like Chinese Legalism but worse. Or how a Derridean society would look like prior to his later romance with Marx and after. One can only imagine such a glorious anomic end to the dialectic of \"free trade.\" I mean wouldn't we all like to see what a Foucauldian society would look like? I can just imagine the non-stop Bacchanalia and the glorious never ending bath houses. Power would truly be radiating out of my every pore and other bodily openings, now that's what I call bio-politics... Alas we get nothing close to this small amount of imagination. It's a standard futuristic society with some marble statues and stuff here and there. \\n\r\nLet's look at the characters and the perception that they have psychological depth. Psychological depth can mean a few things in fiction. The most obvious thing it can mean to me is that the creators are trying to emulate the findings in current or past psychological movements and infusing their works with them like Freudianism in Hitchcock films, Jungian in Kubrick, mild parodies of behaviorism in Kurt Vonnegut, Existential-psych in French New Wave films ETC. Maybe you want psychological realism in the actions of your characters like Yasujiro Ozu or maybe you like heightened fairy tale archetypes like Akira Kurosawa. Have I dropped enough names yet? Well anyway, the point of all these examples is that generally when I hear something has psychological depth I tend to think of examples like this where the creators gave their characters depth by having specific types of psychology or ideas in mind when making them, they may even include a mix of some of these things. Like maybe one character represents a classic Freudian outlook on life and the intrigue comes from them making contact with someone with a more modern take on psychologies outlook like through evolutionary psych or cognitive behavioral. I think I belabored the point enough on this definition and you can basically get what I'm saying now the characters can have or be used to represent these psychological ideas in their basic makeup. Ok, so good onto the next definition. The second definition is the more common one, that I assume most people praising this show think of when they talk about it and that definition is something akin to \"they have a long back story therefore I think them interesting.\" To be charitable to this definition it can also mean that they have interesting tidbits and tadbits to their characters shown in the past, like a linear psychological bread crumb trail of trauma, pain, good times and angry stuff here and there. I can like stories that engage in either definition and most literature is a combination of both, but I don't really think EP fits either well. I don't really find these characters interesting at all. They have about as much depth as a Naruto character, but with a heavy facade blanketed over them to give the appearance that they matter more. They go through formulaic arcs and commit clich\u00e9d action after clich\u00e9d action. I mean I have a whole section just dedicated to that right here:\\n\\n\r\nIf I'm allowed to make one bold assumption here about peoples high estimation of this anime and what I think is their false impression that this is an \"unorthodox\" show is that it seems like and this is where the assumption comes in friendos, that a lot of anime fans are insularly only into this one thing. Anime and mango seems to be an all encompassing hobby and in a lot of anime communities here and elsewhere I have noticed a tendency for people who are into it to not be into most other types of media. Some of this seems to be snobbery but there is also a basic fact of reality, not everyone is a loser like me who can sit and take in tons of different crap from different types of media, so people naturally stick with what they're interested in. If I can give this a generous spin I would say most of you are specialists and not generalists. Well I'm the opposite I'm the jack of no trades and I can't review things in isolation, I see things as so interconnected that I can't quite stop myself from thinking of other media in reference to each other ever. \\n\r\nFOR INSTANCE gals and guys, people like to play up this shows \"dream sequences,\" but having seen a lot of western shows and they seem pretty standard for television as a media. A lot of shows have an episode that essentially doesn't connect to the plot in a direct way but hints at it and points towards future developments within context of a dream. The most famous example I can think of is the ending of the 4th season of Buffy, a lot of episodes of Scrubs, a few Doctor Who's and countless Star Trek episodes where characters realize they were hung up on a dream. This isn't really experimental it's damn near a cliche that just hasn't been coined yet. How about \"dreamsposition?\" In fact this review is a dream sequence, a hallucination, brought on by drugs and your own self hatred. I'm your inner nagging doubts, now you just need to spout some vague exposition to me so we can move the plot and this review forward. \\n\r\nIn reading other reviews I saw one phrase over and over and over and that was \"this anime explores what it means to be human.\" I no joke heard a Hallmark movie described the same way in a commercial once, for those who don't live in the states Hallmark movies are just slightly above a soap opera in overall quality and I've said the phrase \"it's Hallmark tier\" to describe the low quality of a film before. I'm not surprised people use this phrase though, because exploring \"what it means to be human\" is one of the criterion of something being Literature. Which also means that like everything else in this section, it's been done before <History of writing here.> Yeah I really don't feel the need to cite single examples on this one as it is done so much that it would actually be easier to list things that tried not to do this while still telling a story in some way. I think what people specifically mean with this phrase in reference to this show is that the contrast between machine people and regular people is compared a bit here, but even when I narrow it down to that level the absolute deluge of stuff that exists also doing that and doing it better pours in hard and fast.  I just want to toot my own horn a bit that this review is an exploration of what it means to be human and by that I mean myself and through me all humanity. It is a mado to my psyche and further a fenetre to the worlds soul. \\n\r\nAnother way in which I think this plays out is in peoples constant citing of the \"you're your own worst enemy\" trope as some kind of deep revelation in this. I think the first time I ever saw this trope in action was in a really famous Manga called the Holy Bible. Not to be confused with the more popular anime adaption Bible Black. Jesus realizes on the cross that his own inherent selfish desires and sin are what might mire him in hell for all eternity if he can't escape his own predilection towards temptation. In other words he is his own worst enemy. Lilith is best girl by the way. In a little obscure film series called STAR WARS, a character named Luke in a galaxy far far away has to go through \"training\" by Yoda to learn about his force sensitivity. Some of this training involves a cave, at the end of his small journey in this cave one of the most famous scenes in cinematic history occurs and he realizes he is his own potential worst enemy. In the David Bowie song \"The Man Who Sold the World\" I gotta spoiler to lay flat on you here, he is the villain in his own song and the titular man who sold the world. He slowly realizes this after the years and years that he roamed and then it came as some surprise he is one and the same his savior and his own worst enemy. At least two Twilight Zone episodes, The Shelter and The Monsters are Due on Maple Street have this same message. In my own lifetime I remember seeing this idea as early as Zelda 2: An Adventure of Link. We have met the enemy ladies and gentlemen and it is us and are easy cliches. I think the Bowie example is the best illustration that this idea isn't that deep, but even in just a four minute song, he managed to do a lot more with than this show did with an entire television show. Thus was the power of the late great Ziggy Stardust. Like a neko from Japan, oh he could lick 'em by smiling. You know, I'm writing this when I could be doing more important things with my life, I eat all the wrong foods, I procrastinate at a level previously not believed possible by mere mortals and I never try to fix any of the major problems with my life. I just realized I am my own worst enemy, I was the villain all along. It was me who caused my own unhappiness all these years. My god how am I going to live with this revelation? I'm literally and figuratively hyperventilating right now, I think I might be having a heart attack. Someone call an ambulance.... OMG I... I-i close my eyes and seize it, I clench my fists and beat it, I light my torch and burn it, I am the beast I worship! \\n\\n\r\n.....\\n\\n\r\nActually, I already knew all this, back to the review. So the last clich\u00e9d arc is a character conveniently having amnesia and we have seen this a thousand times... Well I forgot what I was going to say so lets move on. \\n\r\nThis isn't really a cliche but... People like to cite this shows use of Blade Runner's ideas as ground breaking as well, but I also see this as pretty standard in eastern and western media. Pretty much everything science fiction tries to be Blade Runner and if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be 2001: A Space Odyssey. Pretty much everything tries to be Akira and if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be Neon Genesis Evangelion. Pretty much everything tries to be Ghost in the Shell if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be Serial Experiments Lain. Pretty much everything tries to be Bubble Gum Crisis if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be Paprika. Pretty much everything tries to be Snatcher if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be Xenogears. Pretty much everything tries to be Synthwave if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be IDM. Pretty much everything tries to be- Sorry I got stuck on a tape loop there for a second, but I'm sure you get the point. I think specifically in Akira's case you can argue it was trying to be both Blade Runner and 2001 at the same time, while juggling it's own themes, ideas and other influences. Much like how this review is a dream sequence, an exploration of humanity and I realized I'm my own worst enemy within it's confines, it is also a cyberpunk neo-noir thriller. The reviews soundtrack was made by Vangelis. I'm a special police officer that might be a cyborg who is sent to track down rogue replicant anime reviewers from the MAL corporation who escaped the offworld forums. We are tasked with capturing them and if necessary to execute them. This is not called execution, as they had no life to begin with. We call this special police unit knife sprinters. My robotic girlfriend looks like a sophisticated Bettie Page and I dream of My Little Pony unicorns and electric rams when I sleep. Wake up, time to cry. \\n\r\nYou may have got annoyed from me inserting all these cheap plot points haphazardly into this review and to that I say \"good,\" because that is how I felt the entire time watching EP. Absolutely sick of every bad cliche, lame plot point and cheap character arc being inserted into the wrong places limply like a shaky hand on a first date. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I move on here, I want to anticipate a potential defense of this show and the criticisms I have leveled at it so far. After reading all this someone might scream \"Simpsons did it\" implying I don't know that most ideas are not new and that everything has been done before. Every idea is a package of other ideas that already exists. Nothing is invariant or comes wholly out of nowhere. I don't believe in divine inspiration or intervention, so ideas can only come from already known human sources, filtered through our collective knowledge. This is all true, but my problem isn't just that this stuff has been done before, it's that it ultimately doesn't culminate into anything interesting or worth watching. This show is just a muddled mess of ideas and influences and far from doing something interesting with them it just kind of tosses them all into a vat without properly mixing it or wondering if any of the stuff should go together in the first place. The philosophy is badly strewn window dressing, the characters aren't that deep upon any kind of critical examination and there isn't really anything that distinguishes this from any other action anime. \\n\r\nI also bring all of the above up to slowly erode the idea that this show is more \"experimental\" or thought provoking than other shows like it.\\n\r\nI also want to consider something before moving on and explain how I really want to be fair to something like this even though it might not seem that way given my review. I can only really know my own enjoyment and level engagement with something, but I also try like most people to imagine a fairer third person viewpoint when possible. Maybe this isn't \"deep\" enough or whatever for me but is it a good slick entry level piece of fiction concerning the ideas for others? My answer to that is also no, it doesn't really engage or lay out the ideas in a way that would give the viewer a good idea of philosophy or psychology. I think even Full Metal Alchemist does a better job explaining the fictional practices of alchemy better than this show does the real life practice of philosophy. Let's consider for a moment though that this show was a good representation of Phil and Psych 101 ideas. I wouldn't write up a review like this for the anime equivalent of Sesame Street, Blue's Clues and Dora the Explorer and laugh about how people who watch these don't even know basic arithmetic and reading skills. I MEAN WHAT ARE THEY CHILDREN OR SOMETHING? A SONG ABOUT READING A MAP HOW DUMB ARE YOU? I'm cruel but I'm not unkind. If I thought this show was good for it's own sake and a fairly accurate depiction of the ideas within, I would simply say \"it's not for me\" and move on. I'd hope people learn from it and feel entertained and engaged enough to further research the ideas, but I wouldn't feel a need to review this my self. The problem is the show isn't billed as some introductory work to the subject nor is it aimed at lay watchers and it's defended by people as if it's one of the intellectual heights of anime. So that is why I feel a need to tear this down and also because I'm just a jerk with too much time on his hands. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just about average for it's time. It looks a lot like other shows of it's era only with more shadows and darkness/dark colors added in. To give it some credit the action is pretty good for what it is. The female lead is nicely designed and she is used well for what the show tries to get across. Her face in particular is nicely crafted and interesting for it's own sake, she shows more emotion than a lot of anime characters in shows like this, so her minimalist design wasn't completely without merit. I also like the robots unique design. I guess I can also say that this show doesn't go extremely cheap in the sex department at any point, all the characters look the way they should given the context they're in and there isn't any obvious cheap fanservice stuff I can remember. I think in general while it's animation isn't anything to write home about it has the highest peaks of quality out of all the shows assets. \\n\r\nThis is another show I'm reviewing where the music went in one ear and out the other and I don't really have anything of note to say about it or the voice acting. I'm always kind of amused at how much people seem to care about voice actors in anime and how they generally don't leave any impression on me at all. I'd like to say it's a cultural thing but I've seen a lot of Japanese films and I generally think they are tied with the UK for having the best live actors. So I'm not sure that's it. Hmmmmmmm, something i have to think about I guess. Anyway, I just don't really have anything to say about the sound in this show. \\n\\n\r\nYou know this show reminded me of a deeper disappointment I have with film as a media but animation in particular. I think animation could be employed well to illustrate some intellectual ideas that aren't well described with words. The closest I have seen to what I'm trying to describe are terrible movies like Baraka and Koyaanisqatsi, where images and music are employed to try and get across a bigger intellectual idea without words. The only problem is the few times this is attempted the ideas they get across are as shallow as a wading pool. OMG NATURE CONTRASTS WITH HUMAN CIVILIZATION? DATS CRAZY DEW... I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT LIKE DAT. If only I hadn't been spoiled with that incredibly deep message with Fern Gully when I was five. Granted these films have other merits like the moving forward of filming techniques, editing and cinematography. The point is I'd like experimentation and intellectual motifs to go much much further than what I have seen in most animation. Go really abstract and off the wall. I mean beyond FlatLand levels. Like the Talking Head's I want you to stop making sense and start making abstract and creative choices that go far beyond what we have today.  I didn't get any of this with EP, I got a bland action show. So I said this review was influenced by Blade Runner so here it's only fitting I end this like a true cyborg cut down before his time... *Rain falling everywhere.* I've imagined animation you people wouldn't believe. Anime warships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I've seen \"glistening\" figurines in a neckbeards estate. All these inane complaints about media will be lost in time now... Like poorly animated tears.. In the rain...\\n",

It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nErgo Proxy is a 23-episode series that was created by Studio Manglobe (also famous for their work on Samurai Champloo) and directed by Shukuo Murase (famous for his work on Witch Hunter Robin).  It ran on Japanese TV from February 26th to August 12th, 2006.  Ergo Proxy has been licensed Stateside by Geneon (nowdefunct), and its sixth and final volume was released Stateside on September 25th, 2007.\\n\\n\r\nStory: This is going to be a doozie.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy kicks off in the domed city of Romdeau (possibly Engrish for London?), a city-state whose citizens are under a system of complete micromanagement, focusing on Re-L (or Lil, or Real, it depends on who you talk to, really) Mayar, an inspector for the government, and her Autoreiv (more or less robot) partner, Iggy.  Re-L is tasked with investigating murder cases that have to do with the Autoreiv virus Cogito (which more or less makes them self-aware and has varying effects), which leads her to recent immigrant Vincent Law, and Pino, a companion-type Autoreiv.  At about the same time, she is attacked by an unknown, monstrous, humanoid-like creature called a Proxy, after she finds the word &quot;Awakening&quot; written in red on her bathroom wall.  All of this combines to draw her further into the case and further into the mysteries of Romdeau and the outside world.\\n\\n\r\n...Honestly, it's hard to write a review for this show.  I finished it at the end of last month, and I've been holding off on reviewing it, mainly because I've been struggling to find the right things to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story started out good.  The characters were intriguing and tolerable (except in the case of Re-L, who was something of a bitch, but still, you could stand her), and Pino was the cutest damn thing I've ever seen, and you wanted to see what was up with them.  There were mysteries and they were intriguing, and you kept watching to find out what the hell was going on, and things were revealed that only begat more mysteries that were intriguing that you wanted to know more about.  And it was all good and well.\\n\\n\r\nThen, after the halfway point, Ergo Proxy began to fall apart.  \\n\\n\r\nBefore this point, the writers decided to have many episodes take place in peoples' heads, so that you couldn't tell whether the entire episode had actually happened or not, or whether or not it actually had any bearing on what was going on.  I thought this was just a phase, but that turned out to not be the case.  You really couldn't tell what was going on during these episodes -- I had a friend who was, shall we say, not sober watching this with me, and even he couldn't figure out what the hell was going on (up till then, he had been able to do it).  It really frustrated me, because this felt like a waste of the show's amazing potential.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the show did what I always fear might happen in this situation, and pulled a Rozen Maiden, refusing to address any of the mysteries it had spent so much time building up, and kept on building up more and more mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the story was depressing enough already, but then it took turns into just plain creepy, and that didn't help its case at all.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of it all, it rivaled Rozen Maiden for the things it left untouched, and Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament for the way it rather clumsily concluded things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the second half of the show left a really bitter taste in my mouth.  And it hurts to say that, because this show had SO much potential, and came so highly recommended to me by people on here who I really respect, and mainly for the story, too.  \\n\\n\r\nLooking at my favorite episodes for this series is really telling, as of the eight that I really liked in this series, seven of them came before the halfway point (about episode fourteen or fifteen), and only one came from after that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it does win some points back for its use of obscure references to literature and mythology and several other things.  And for Pino, who is the cutest damn thing ever, without being annoying.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this series is absofuckinglutely beautiful.  The animation is amazingly smooth, and the 2D merges beautifully with the 3D, to the point where it's difficult to differentiate between the two.  The character designs are absolutely amazingly and beautifully done, especially (and for the record, I maintain that Re-L's design is based off of Amy Lee of Evanesence).  There's overwhelmingly darker, bleaker tones used here, but it works really well with the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, props for them getting the style right in a later episode, which is more or less a parody of Disney, and closely mimicks Disney's animation techniques.\\n\\n\r\nNo problems here.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: I honestly didn't notice the background music for this series.  I'm currently in the process of finding the two OSTs, so I may update this later.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm really happy with the OP and ED.  The OP was done by a Japanese rock group, sung in all English, and really good English, too.  The ED is Radiohead's &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;.  If you don't know this song, you are a failure to the human race and need to go and find it and listen to it.  NOW.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Sanae Kobayashi (Eleanor Campbell in Victorian Romance Emma and Lucy/Nyuu in Elfen Lied) has a role in this, which was really nice.  Otherwise, no other voices that I recognize, and good acting, all around.\\n\\n\r\nLength: I honestly think that Ergo Proxy could've done to cut out maybe four or five episodes.  Perhaps some of the mind-fucks that didn't really serve to do anything besides screw with your head.  Either that, or rework those episodes so that they at least take care of some of the mysteries.  \\n\\n\r\nAny longer and I probably would've dropped it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: An amazing story that starts out good, but falls apart by the time the end comes around, whose length probably could've been toyed with, but, to its credit, has beautiful animation, solid seiyuu and a good OP/ED.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9\\n\r\nLength: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 41/50; 82% (B )",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy, it's a darker show that makes you think. Don't fall asleep for a second watching this show or you'll miss something important. Every little detail matters in some way. You know what... I LOVE THIS SHOW! I will do my best to keep my fanboy attitude towards this show aside to make for a more professional review.\r\nSTORY:\r\nErgo Proxy takes place in a post apocalyptic setting where mankind must live inside domed cities. They are all assisted in their everyday lives by AuroReivs which are autonomous robots. In the city of Romdo there is a virus infecting the AutoReivs that cause them to becomeaware of their own existence. It is called the Cogito Virus. Re-l Mayer is the lead investigator of the infected AutoReivs. During her investigation she encounters a monster called a Proxy. Also in Romdo, a man named Vincent Law is running about and is suspected of having a connection with the Proxy. Re-l and Vincent then though a series of events begin to travel in in the outside world searching for answers. \\n\\n\r\nSound confusing? Good you should be confused, but it is also a great setup for a story. Right off the bat you are introduced to a new world, and in that world you see problems that need to be solved. The plot starts off right from the get go which I like. It grabs your attention; however, sometimes the pacing can get slowed down, but the amount of things you are learning about the world makes it seem like the writers aren't just writing filler even though that's exactly what it is. This story is a work of art. Ergo Proxy is the example of how to setup a world and maximize the potential that is in said world. It was also depressing as hell at sometimes and made me want to sit in my room and be sad. Now I mentioned confusing at the beginning, and it's true the story can be confusing, but I never felt lost during the show which is good and there was a reason for me not being lost...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nOur main Protagonists are Re-l Mayer, a police detective/inspector and Vincent Law, an immigrant/nobody. Oh and Pino who is an AutoReiv infected with the Cogito Virus. The characters are what make this show's story less of a nightmare to understand. They ask all the questions that you want to ask. Personally I think that Re-l is by far the best character in the whole show. Her world has be turned upside-down and she has to tag along to find answers with Vincent. Vincent to be honest has a crap life, he can't remember who he is and was run out of Romdo. He is searching for who he is. The chemistry between these two is what really makes them stand out as characters. They aren't all buddy buddy like many shows. Re-l didn't trust Vincent at all at the beginning and Vincent wanted to just be around Re-l. Pino is hard to talk about without spoiling some plot but her purpose to me is making the viewer ask \"What does it mean to truly be alive?\" \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art is good. Nothing that just blows you out of the water but it does a very good job at bringing you into the atmosphere of the show. I loved the character designs in this show too. Their aren't very many action scenes in the show but when their are they are done very well. I have no complaints about the animation. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nOHHH MY GOD THAT OPENING!!!! \"Kiri\" by Monoral is absolutly PERFECT for this shows opening! I've bought that song and no joke I listen to it every single day it is that good! I loved it. I'm also a fan of Radiohead so I liked the ending. The music during the show I actually didn't notice at all.... that's kinda bad but I also never remember the show being silent so that's good. The dub for this show is outstanding. I have no idea how Megan Hollingshead doesn't have more lead roles. She did an outstanding job as Re-l. Liam O'Brien also deserve high praise as well for his job as Vincent. At the beginning I actually thought he was Sam Riegel, but then Vincent got mad an I thought \"Yep that's Liam.\" His angry voice is very good as is his regular voice. I actually thought that Pino was voiced by a child, but nope it was Rachel Hirschfeld... yea never heard of her but DAMN is she good! I mean seriously GIVE HER MORE ROLES!!! This dub is one of the best I have ever heard, on par with that of Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nENDING:\\n\r\nIf you've seen my reviews you know what I do here. Does Ergo Proxy seal the deal at the end? Or does it leave massive plot holes? Nope. It ends perfectly in my opinion, I was very satisfied with the ending because it left the viewer with an idea of what the characters will do after the series, but it also makes sure to wrap everything up nicely. It ends well which is what I like to see anime do.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nErgo Proxy as of December 27, 2013, is the greatest anime that I have ever watched. If you have not seen Ergo Proxy, you have to see this anime. It truly is a masterpiece, a modern classic. Ergo Proxy is a show that can not be missed no matter what your preferred genre of anime is. Ergo Proxy is one of a kind. I give it a 100% recommendation. Ergo Proxy is a work of art.",

            "content": "Ambition in an audio-visual work can generally focus itself on artistical visual or sound-related features only, while the foundation in terms of plot is rather simple, or tries to define itself in terms of quality by touching upon more complex, indefinite questions about e.g. the human nature itself, not being covered in a lot of works, not being followed through that deeply regarding its core theme or not being covered in that big of a quantity of related questions/topics towards the main one the work tries to tackle. While it\u2019s hard to classify Ergo Proxy between example #2 and #3, I might have to makethe point that Proxy leans more towards the third than the second. Maybe even solely due to the reason, that it constructs severally different presentational approaches, ranging from character introspection in the said person\u2019s mind to cartoon-ish, dream-like sequences, merging it all into one bucket. And related to that, I simply can\u2019t get out of my way to say this: On several occasions, it feels more messy than anything else, especially in its middle section.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Proxy didn\u2019t set itself up the easiest task to begin with, as it has been making clear right from the beginning that it wants to cover a whole lot in a way that could\u2019ve required 13 episodes to fully follow-through a singular theme or start-off question that has been touched upon at the start. But concerning this, I\u2019m surprisingly not part of either \"go-to\" group for the title itself, which almost reaches the dust of controversy that has been dispersed by Evangelion in terms of split reception among the Anime community, while of course not being quite as popular. It\u2019s neither an Anime that use the group of elitist scoundrels \u00a9 to show their superiority while circle-jerking a show that basically offers nothing they preach about in the first place or an animated masterpiece that transcends the medium in terms of complexity and execution. It sure gets very entangled in its own ideas, judging by the sheer amount of topic it touches upon, but as good as the diversity in theme exploration and presentation might sound on paper, it gives off the overwhelming feeling of suffocating its initial strengths and start-up plotline the first episodes introduced. Expressing this might be a bit difficult, but I\u2019m trying to keep this as spoiler-free as possible and I\u2019ll try to add some general ideas about storytelling as a whole to support these statements. As a result bit more focused on the criticism than on the aspects the show actually gets right for the most part, since I think these have already been covered in way more detail than its negatives, however, I\u2019ll make sure to throw a reasonable amount of positive factors in during this write-up.\\n\\n\r\nWith Proxy\u2019s setup, there\u2019s almost nothing to not love as a fan of futuristically dystopian prospects, a category in which I\u2019d count me in for sure. In the forlorn city of Romdeau, we follow the story of the state-serving investigator Re-L and a man who recently immigrated to the city, Vincent Law, and how they\u2019re being confronted with the rising spread of a \u2018cogito virus\u2019, which seemingly infects Auto-Reivs, not even stopping at the personal assistants of a notable amount of citizens in Romdeau (Entourages), turning them against their owner, enforcing them to commit the final act of killing against human beings themselves. With mysterious beings, called \u201cProxies\u201d, said to be around the infected Auto-Reivs when these crimes are happening, Re-L, her Entourage Iggy and Vincent Law get entangled in a conspiracy, that shakes the foundation of Romdeau and those of the main characters to the core, as it is being made apparent by our investigator\u2019s virtually epiphanic encounter with the \u2018Ergo Proxy\u2019 at the end of episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nWhat might\u2019ve been made pretty obvious by my part, due to the last part of this rather vague summarization of Proxy\u2019s setup, is how the narrative focus shifts from a more political-emphasized lens, to straight up character/idealistic introspection with related ideas of breaking the invisible wall that cages one\u2019s individual ability to think. The initiation for the characters to take that pebbly way of \u201cself-discovery\u201d might have diverged a little for each person, willingly putting themselves in the unforgivingly dangerous world that surrounds Romdeau. For our main duo, they were set-up reasonably well and grounded and are deductible by the way their personas affect their behaviorism during the growing conflict between them and their environment. The significant repel from Romdeau towards Re-L and Vincent, be it either the inequity imposed by Romdeau, caused by seemingly supernatural events Vincent has to suffer through in the starting episodes, or the apathy and incomprehension showed by the apparatus of the state and her granddad, the regent himself, them joining up for a risky quest for answers got itself the right groundwork to be one of the amazing tales ever told in the medium. However, even if the episodic exploration of different themes and ideas is one of my favourite ways to elaborate upon them, Proxy left with a sour taste in that exact section after watching through it. It would be a long shot to call it inherently bad, very far from it, but I\u2019d much rather call it: indecisive. But more regarding that later.\\n\\n\r\nConnecting with Vincent semi-forcefully expel from Romdeau and Re-L\u2019s hunt for more leads and info regarding the mysterious and very confined matter surrounding \u2018Vincent Law\u2019, the show takes the unexpected episodic approach, which actually feels rather jarring from what we\u2019ve seen from the starting 3-4 episodes beforehand. It\u2019s a bit hard to get used to and hard to call very good either. Of course, with strictly referring to them as \u201cfiller-episodes\u201d and the more cohesively presented ones as the main-plot, missing the point is unavoidable, but that doesn\u2019t stop numerous of these to either feel a bit overdone and, surprisingly, pretty stale. Those two impressions don\u2019t go hand in hand all the time, counter-acting the believe that it\u2019s incompetent in what it\u2019s doing entirely, but there\u2019s a rarity of episodes I\u2019d call both, a lot of episodes I\u2019d call one of them and some episodes I\u2019d call neither.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the start-off for Re-L\u2019s journey is very reminiscent of bad political movie clich\u00e9s (\u201cYou\u2019re ignoring me because I get to the heart of the matter\u201d), got paced out a little too fast and showing too little hindrance for what she\u2019s trying to do, it still works and isn\u2019t shifted with much of a focus upon either, more of a mean to justify in what it will expand to. The plot progression is ridden by a summation of minor conveniences in the first quarter of it, which are not to be taken too lightly considering the serious and still coherently narrated route it set itself up. Opportunities presenting each other on a plate for Re-L, hacking a computer in 5 seconds while her interviewer makes no efforts to lock the confidential data in it while leaving shortly etc. Also, the rather one-sided affection Vincent develops in a total runtime of 60 minutes towards Re-L should have been developed of more apparently graspable moments, since it should be deductible in that short of runtime in the starting-phase to not feel a tad forced, especially since it doesn\u2019t get that much of a focus for a long period of time later. The concluding episodes did erase half of my initial complaints about this since it gave this aspect a somewhat satisfying conclusion, but from a watching-experience standpoint, it still does strike me as a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSuccessfully changing one's general approach of storytelling is a big risk with (more or less) great reward if executed right and while saying this, Proxy takes a turn for the more experimental in the early-mid section of it and in the same vein, sadly a turn for the worse initially. It constructs several approaches and a big variety on how to tackle it in terms of audiovisuals while giving further insight into its several ideas revolving about identity itself. In numerous episodes, it takes a turn for the surreal and usually follows them up with ones which ensure its \u201cusual recipe\u201d of the tried-and-tested storytelling, shown in the first couple of episodes. Additionally, we get episodes with a lot of expositional dialogue regarding one single matter, creating a lot of routes regarding presentation, but actually master none of them, as the contrast between two consecutive episodes can be mood-killing or actually responsible for one not coming up in the first place. While some of these are enjoyable as a standalone, the setup of Proxy doesn\u2019t allow such an eclectic way of mixing storytelling-techniques that easily, especially with it lacking a distinctive identity (pretty ironic) and more refined directing, making it to feel slightly devoid of life and simultaneously a tad insipid at the same time. Additionally, these constructed narrations do feel to feed the viewer a very different amount of information, contrary to the belief that people who dislike it just need to be taken by the hand through the story. No, the show switches from explaining already pretty evident facts in a very convoluted way that can even make up the runtime of a whole episode at points (episode #11), to hit you with hardly explained turns of events in the next one. Of course there\u2019s value in some of these lines which come from an overflow of dialogues that way, but there\u2019s this overarching feeling of they trying to ramble 20 minutes about and actually trying to waste your time when not trying to *insert meaning* in every line of this oversaturated dialogue. There\u2019s even a minor and easy to miss instance of a clear message of \u201cdeath of the author\u201d in episode #10 (the script writer's name on a tombstone), which actually is kinda infuriating, because the next episode is exactly the one which is obviously raising a question and follows up to answer it in an excessively long way.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to my rambling about episode 11 in particular, there are not that many episodes meeting that said criticism in such a strong way, but most of them only do so rudimentarily. In what almost all episodes do lack though is impressive directing, which actually could complement the well-planned scenes on paper, I more often than not thought to myself, that this was the primary reason of why I actually found the atmosphere not sparking over, even during good scene montages. The visuals have a distinctively dark tone and with more audio-visual competency, they could\u2019ve capitalized on that particular aspect of lifelessness greatly like Texhnolyze, but only came off as a decently pictured, dark Anime set in a dystopian future with cool \u201cDeus Ex\u201d-esque soundtracks playing in the background. Especially during action-scenes, the lack of distinctively cut-out audio-visual focus to create a thrilling composition and maybe a budget-restriction partly causing that is kind of detrimental, as there are some of those especially in the first half (people looking like matchsticks flying around during the Proxy chase in the shopping center). It gives me the feeling that Watanabe might have been the more appropriate choice for sound directing, as he has proofed himself to deliver there over and over again, as opposed to only him providing the storyboard.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I am not hailing the OPs/EDs of Anime greatly, especially not during reviews, but with Proxy I just can\u2019t ignore it, as it provided Top 10 worthy ones in both categories. The OP is eerily addicting song-wise and balanced absolutely superbly with the visuals touching the screen, which is absolutely amazing in its own right. They offer a colour palette and a scene-transitioning on a very high-level, which I wish that only the Anime itself had. And with incorporating Radiohead as the band who's providing the respective song for the ED, there\u2019s probably not much more I have to add, an absolutely amazing track with a melancholic atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nNearing the end of this review, the characters are what\u2019s left to be covered during this write-up and who are very good for the most part. And I say 'for the most part' because there is Pino. While the flames of despise have died out for me the longer the further the series progressed, there shouldn\u2019t have been an occasion where \u201cflares of hate being quenched\u201d is a thing while watching an anime in the first place. Considering I said that the switches in narrative construction from episode to episode are the most jarring aspect about Ergo Proxy, the Auto-Reiv Pino got through the finish line by .1sec late, actually almost satirically interrupting supposed to be very serious chasing scenes with her pretty obnoxious child-like attitude and seemingly lack of intelligence of her surroundings, she\u2019s the main reason why Vincent gets into so much trouble while trying to avoid being caught. Apart from her playing with her melodica in the background and her being slightly important in the main plot, having some minor addition of easily-digestible thematic exploration, she is more of a forgettable aspect of Proxy, which only gets kind of likable through habituation effect. I\u2019m still getting some PTSD from a girl in a bunny onesie in probably one of the top 3 darkest Anime of all time. Japan.\\n\\n\r\nWith Re-L, we have one of the best female protagonists I have seen in Anime, in both design and character. Her behaviorism is reflective on what she\u2019s facing right at the moment and in a constant state of flux, which doesn\u2019t come off as implausible throughout the anime and is very reflective on what she sets out to do in her relationship with Vincent Law. While the infamous episode of them doing exactly nothing an entire episode and drawing a conclusion that could\u2019ve been expected from a Shounen-Anime at the end of the episode, I especially enjoyed her and her dynamic relationship with Vincent, who is the most complex character in the show actually which I actually can\u2019t expand on too much without spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nSide character-wise, a good portion of the past gets a reasonable amount of screen time, while the most belongs to Raul and Daedalus respectively, as they also play an integral part in the story and mystery that unfolds in Romdeau. They share a very interesting dynamic, with Raul excelling in going through a very similar development as Re-L, when trying to unfold the truth opposed to the regent and the core of Romdeau, but takes a different conclusion and a different decision from it, which is not all that easy to figure out at first, as the context of his actions is very connected to Proxy\u2019s most bizarre episode, taking place in a \u201cgame show\u201d. Daedalus gets presented a bit too heavy-handed with his creepy obsession for Re-L, almost trying to crave attention a little too hard, but being backed up by the backstory/progression of the plot, just feeling a bit out of place in terms of characterization.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve already claimed in the beginning, I made a distinctive focus on why especially the presentational aspects of Ergo Proxy didn\u2019t quite succeed in making me feel engaged or drawing out the possible strengths of the show, it\u2019s scary how good the show could\u2019ve been with a set-up as interesting as that. Considering how it evolves into episodic-storytelling right in the middle, there\u2019s a difference on how these heaps of different (minor) problems did affect me while watching, but when it got into the \u201cright mode\u201d, it was almost like watching a lecture while it tries to (refraining the use of the p-word) hammer in info in a very blatant and hard to enjoy way. Still, it is a work with one of the most complex lores in all of Anime, has a good leading duo of main characters and a rather big variety of related ideas, adding to its thematic exploration. It\u2019s definitely not my raison d\u2019etre, as the presentation did come off as suboptimal on numerous occasions, but definitely worth a watch to form your own opinion on the show, as the concluding episodes are undoubtedly very good and won\u2019t waste your time.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nArt (8/10), Animation (6/10)\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)",

            "content": "Ergo proxy, for me, started off as a completely unknown story which I came across while randomly searching for interesting anime to watch. The anime remained on my PTW list for a while until someone mentioned how cool it was and they definitely would recommend watching it soon. So, of course, I had to check it out. My only thought when I began was, \u201cthe girl with the blue eyeshadow,\u201d but after watching the first episode, I was very intrigued, especially with the entrance of two strange beings known as Proxies.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nLike many anime, they throw you into the main story, introducing the main characterslike the female inspector, Re-l Mayer, who is the granddaughter of the Regent,  and Vincent Law, an immigrant from another city who is trying to gain citizenship in the \u201cparadise\u201d city, Romdeau. The people of Romdeau may strike you as strange but only because they are made to become ideal citizens and function by the city\u2019s schedule. The city exists within a dome, isolated from the outside world, a harsh world which was destroyed many years ago by a large scale chemical disaster. Within the city, a virus known as the cogito virus becomes an escalating problem. It is capable of infecting their personal robot assistants, Auto-Reivs, causing them to gain human-like traits and thought patterns. This becomes a problem as they begin rebelling against their masters, and in some cases, kill them. The being known as a Proxy, is shrouded in mystery as their exact purpose is kept hidden from society until one day, Re-l is attacked in her apartment by a masked Proxy. From then on, she develops a strange attraction and curiosity towards the Proxy and decides to investigate their reason for existence.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, the immigrant, Vincent Law, is accused of being involved with cogito virus after being attacked by another Proxy which has a strange attraction to him. He flees after being targeted by the Security Bureau of Romdeau and escapes from the dome and along with an infected child-like Auto-Reiv named Pino. Together, they discover that the outside world is not as desolate as they were led to believe\u2026 Anymore and this may just become spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThis story may not be for those who prefer simple and straight forward shounen. It is not about the \u2018power to protect\u2019 or \u2018loyalty to nakama\u2019. As it is a seinen anime (though not mentioned on MAL), it is much more serious and complex. The series is extremely psychological to a point where the thoughts of the main characters begin affect their reality and it requires the viewer to be capable of certain level of understanding. Once you understand it though, the story is amazing to watch unfold.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art can only be described as dark. Anything other than gray tones and deep, dark colours would detract from the story\u2019s theme. The world itself, in the story, is somewhat dark so the anime\u2019s art fits it perfectly. One note is that at some points, the facial features of the characters seem weirdly distorted. It make not affect the story but can but somewhat distracting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme used for the entire series was \"Kiri\" by MONORAL. In my opinion, I would say that it was well suited to the story. It created a mood which I still can\u2019t describe but nonetheless kept my interest in the anime. \"Paranoid Android\" by Radiohead was the ending. Both the instrumental and actual song was used to good effect also. The OSTs were neither corny nor overdramatic and helped set the mood for the anime\u2019s events.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI have to say that the main characters, who all seem so different, actually mesh well once they begin to interact. Each of them is very relatable in terms of how they deal with various events in the anime. Their abilities and personalities are not unrealistic to a point where they are so strong, that no one can stop them. Also, their designs do not scream 'fanservice' since anything of the sort would just ruin the show. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, there\u2019s Re-l Mayer, the strict, military-minded investigator. To her grandfather, as well as the Security Bureau, she is seen as a rebel. She goes out of her way to investigate anything she deems suspicious, even against advice of others. She considers Romdeau as a \u201cboring paradise\u201d until she is confronted by a Proxy. When she discovers the outside world, she becomes a bit obsessed with idea of people surviving outside the dome. At times, her vulnerability is evident but generally, she creates a wall between herself and those she interacts with. She comes off as a spoilt brat for most of the first part of series due to the fact that she is sort of royalty in Romdeau, with her grandfather being the Regent. After meeting and traveling with Vincent and Pino, her personality takes a turn for the better.\\n\\n\r\nVincent Law, the immigrant from another dome city, met with Re-l to get assistance on becoming a citizen of Romdeau. Their personalities clashed immediately. He, unlike Re-l, is caring and worries most of the time. This is due to the fact that he has amnesia and often finds himself in situations which he cannot explain. He is also infatuated by Re-l and seems kind of stalker like. Through his thoughtfulness, he is able to befriend others like Pino and eventually, Re-l. Most of his part in the show revolves around his journey to recover his memories.\\n\\n\r\nPino is a Companion-type Auto-Reiv designed to assist with household activities and was given to a rich family in Romdeau. After crossing paths with a Proxy who was in pursuit of Vincent, she became infected by the cogito virus. She developed an attraction to Vincent and followed him outside the city\u2019s dome. Just like her appearance, her personality after being infected, is that of a child. Initially, she acts by mimicking others around her. Later on, she does learn to think for herself and becomes more of an individual. She provides support to Vincent on his journey to his home city. Her actions intrigued Re-l when they meet and she spent much of her time observing Pino. Pino is usually the one who would instigate comedic moment within the story, causing Vincent to become involved, and Re-l to be annoyed.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Re-l\u2019s personal \u201centourage,\u201d the Auto-Reiv, Iggy, who takes care of her everyday needs but is also used to observe her actions when she goes on investigations. There is the young scientist, Daedalus Yumeno, who seems slightly obsessed with Re-l but is still her friend; Raul Creed, who is the appointed Director of Romdeau and the Regent, who is Re-l\u2019s grandfather and the man controlling Romdeau from behind the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also the Proxies of which little is known. They are strong beings and are associated with spreading the cogito virus.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis series became one of my definite favourites after completing it. Every aspect of the show had me interested. I watched this anime out in two days despite having exams. Yes, I know I should have been studying but it was that good. If you enjoy shows that tax the brain, then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nBeing one of my favourites, I give this a 8/10. I definitely recommend it as it has a bit of everything within the plot. It\u2019s a great ride with a satisfying ending though by the end, you\u2019ll be wishing there was a second season. Yes, there are many who would say that the anime\u2019s creators were trying too hard to come up with something unique and are pretentious. Others might have dropped the series because of its complex plot. To those, all I can say is that they may not have the ability to recognize a great story and are just out there to criticize anything unknown to them. Hopefully, this review will get you interested so that you will go watch it and become a fan like I did.

            "content": "So, the first thing that comes to my mind when asked to describe Ergo Proxy: ABSOLUTE MIND F*CK. But don't let that scare you away from this wonderful and though-provoking series--this is an anime definitely worth checking out for the more mature audiences out there.\r\nI guess the genre I'd put Ergo under would be scifi psychological thriller (oops, that's more like three genres, isn't it? -.-;). It's definitely a treat for those who want a break from the mainstream, with outstanding original story and character development that seems to be rarely seen in most popular series. Ergo certainly takes the normal robot-living-beside-human-turned-crisis to a wholenew level and turns it on its head with a unique plot full of more than enough plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is the plot that should make you wary of what you're getting yourself into when you decide to sit down with this series; it certainly is a lot to grasp, and more often than not you find your head swimming not only with questions at the end of an episode, but also with a general &quot;WTF?!&quot; kind of feeling.  To be honest, I was still feeling something to that effect even after the series concluded. Many episodes have a fragmented, lost tone to them, which fits the mood of the series but still gets tiring towards the end--and in the end, while most answers are given, there are still more than enough left for you yourself to discern. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and the characters of the series are amazing, though, and make up for the at times wayward plot. Taking much-done ideas--in this case, robots with a conscious, a post-apocalyptic world, a disillusioned, totalitarian civilization--and making them bad ass and fantastically fresh is no ordinary feat. Yet, the creators of Ergo Proxy seemed to have done it with ease. The story, revolving around the human psyche, the sin of god-like creatures, and purpose of life itself, delves deep and keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know and learn more the further into the series you get. The characters themselves all have their own charm about them, and only add to the story with the intense character development that hits each and every one of the characters seriously introduced. It would take a whole other review to go into the topic of and praise the characters and character development used in Ergo.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the art and music in this series are just as good as everything else--wouldn't want to distract from the already overwhelming plot, right? ;) Anyways, the fight scenes between the Proxies are amazing, as well as Vincent's transformations themselves, along with the battle scenes. While not for the extremely weak of heart, they are certainly not anything like Elfen Lied are something, so no worries. The opening and ending themes of the series are also noteworthy, and two of my favorites out of all the other anime opening and endings out there--the music used is haunting, yet befitting. And I could sing along because they're in English. :)\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing worthy of mention is the extensive Greek philosophy references, among other philosophical references, used throughout the series. I didn't feel all to guilty about devoted hours to watching this series, because I got some edumacation out of it too.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, I give Ergo Proxy two thumbs WAAAY up. Definitely on my favorite anime list now if it's not at the top, and I can't BELIEVE I hadn't watched it sooner...\\n\\n\r\n:D",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy\r\nAn anime that makes sense but at the same time it doesn't, even when answers are given in the last three eps. i was thinking of the things that are not answered and there are supernatural elements, a lot and Deus Ex explanations but still manages to be entertaining.\r\nStory\r\nThis anime has a very good story, since the beginning the story is thrown for ten episodes straight, fast paced with complexity, until when it takes a break to put filler episodes which were really good and had little pieces of the plot, especially the ''who wants to be a proxy'' episode where i was constantlyinteracting saying the answers just like Vincent, but how did they get there in the first place? ; The ''Disney World'' episode is another example, it was a filler but a really touching one, Pino became my favorite character of the anime with that episode, (dethroning Vincent from the first place) she is a hero; Every episode has a jump time, and with an annoying Re-i (really, she was bitchy) you never know how they reached some locations, like in ep. 21 where all of a sudden they are back, what, is this a dream?, i thought it was, because the anime in those filler eps. is constantly playing between reality and dreams, is cool because i was fooled on this ep. thinking ''plot twist, is a dream'' but no. There is lack of coherent explanation as to why this gaps between eps. or how some events happened. The ending is good but unsatisfaying for some reason, it has a conclusion but at the same time open for another story, i have a lot of thing to complain storywise but this is not a complaint thread, at the end Pino still is a Hero and she is an AuotoReiv with more emotions than Re-i.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nI was expecting something darker for this kind of setting, a much dense atmosphere, that way would be better for me, but for what we got is very good, sometimes feels lazy with some shots at the faces and lookig at how they suffer from strabismus, it was hilarious, almost always with Re-i, i don't like the constant changing on the faces while moving from one angle to another and i'm saying every 1 cm move is a different face, despite this inconveniences it was very good for that year.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMaybe the best element from the anime, the music is great when is played after the silent parts, it sets a great atmosphere, it fits the theme, the OP is really great, the video clip reminded me of the 90's movies and TV series (like Buffy, Angel and specially to Charmed and the song a lot to Smallville) it was great, better than those series too, more emotion in just four words ''Come and save me'' while Vincent is screamig, just great and the ED is ok i guess, Radiohead, you get it. The VA is great as well, really enjoyable even when Re-i acted like a spoiled Brat, that voice was fitting, so good portraying that personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty entertaining with the combination of really great voice acting, personalities and back stories for the characters, Re-i is the exception, she needed more background to get to know her more but she was ok.\\n\r\n-Vincent Law is great, he suffers a transition from a nerdy looking shy guy who likes Re-i to a good-normal looking shy guy looking for his identity who still likes Re-i and cares and protects for Pino, he is a badass too, you'll see.\\n\r\n-Re-I, Lilu or Real is a gal who can be emotionless at times, she acts like a brat later, really spoiled and that's because her AutoReiv does almost everything for her (love the part where he was ''arguing'' with her in the snow, the truth was spoken) but she kind of grows and even feels something for Vincent, she gets better, but not enough.\\n\r\n-Pino is the best character, she's simple the best, the one that makes you laugh in every situation, she is adorable, naive, she even has more emotions than Re-i or every human and is impressive because she's an AutoReiv, she is a hero, she saves people believe it or not, the best character, i was thinking if something bad happened to her (in those eps. that could go bad) i was going to give this a bad score just because of that, wouldn't be the same without her.\\n\r\nThe support characters are great too, Raul, Daedalus, Iggy, they all are great, there are a lot more that are interesting too. In general the characters were great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really had a very good enjoyment from this anime, i was expecting more tho, after everyone saying Ergo Proxy was better than Texhnolyzed, i was expecting something more darker and heavier, but i didn't felt that, maybe a little dense just at the last three eps. but i see that this has better art style and character development and has a ''happy'' ending while Tex. has a tragic one and has no filler eps. and is more slow paced but for me both are equally entertaining, both are must watch.",

            "content": "After watching Ergo Proxy completely and thoroughly, I must say that this is one of the most enjoyable series I've watched yet. The story is so complex and can at times be very agonizing because you are just so clueless as to what is going on. Then, usually, by the end of the episode or by the next episode all of your questions and doubts about what is going on will be answered.\r\nWhy did I enjoy this series so much? First, this series is a real psychological mind boggling experience. I haven't see too many series that make me question what is going on orgoing to happen until the very end, yet Ergo Proxy did it. Even during the last episode, I was still asking myself the same question as I had been throughout the entire series, \"what the hell is going on?!\" This kind of experience kept me wanting more and left me trying to fill holes myself, which is exactly the kind of thing that I enjoy. Something that makes me think for myself and makes me WANT to figure out whats going on or say, \"Hmm, I wonder what that meant...\"\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story is another thing that made me enjoy this so much, a post apocalyptic world where everyone is being kept in the dark and left wondering whats just beyond their grasp. Theres not much that I can say about this plus for me, it's just something that I enjoy. If you enjoy stories set in this kind of environment, you'll like this aspect of Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy makes use of a lot of different aspects of psychology and history, which is a good thing. I believe it was only the first fourteen episodes, but at the end of each respective episode there would be about two minutes when they would reflect back on things throughout what you had just seen. It was a very nice touch that I felt was something more series should do. It basically would tell you things that the author of the series/story used as a reference or what something that occurred in the episode was based on. I thoroughly enjoy history and psychology so this aspect of Ergo Proxy really appealed to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development didn't fall short of my expectations either. It was done quite nicely. I wish I could go into further detail about it, but apparently I'm not supposed to say anything to spoil the series and I'm not quite sure how to go about this aspect without doing just that.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was extremely well done. The way some of the faces are drawn may look a little odd at first, but I didn't mind it at all. It matches the show quite well and really compliments everything around it. Everything that was done in this series, animation wise, was completely believable. Sure, there are somethings that you just know can't be true/made from something real, but it just feels true/real with everything else about the series combined. \\n\\n\r\nOh, don't let me forget Real Mayer. She's one sexy woman. Not sexy in the stereotypical way with an out of proportion body and an annoying voice. She is more real (pun intended), she's not overdeveloped, her voice isn't annoying, she doesn't have any super human powers, she isn't a amazing when it comes to combat, and her feelings/emotions are that of a real woman/girl. It just makes her character so much more believable and real, which is why I love her so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ergo Proxy is the complete package in terms of story, animation, sound, character development, THE characters, and the enjoyment of everything put together. If you don't enjoy this show, then you either aren't human, don't like anime or are too stupid to understand the story.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review, this is the first one I've ever written. If you like it, then please leave an comment letting me know so I'll be more encouraged to write more. See ya kiddies.",

            "content": "As far as I know, there are no Spoilers or Summaries here.\r\n-There is one thing I need to point out about my scoring.  The enjoyment of a show is weighed heavily by me.  If I can't enjoy a show then what's the point of watching it? \r\nNow without further ado.\r\nStory:\r\nThe actual story and plot of the show isn&rsquo;t bad other then being a bit confusing.  It jumps into the plot right away for the first few episodes.  The story progresses rapidly at first before coming to almost a complete stop.  For about 7 or 8 of the episodes between 10-20,I felt like nothing happened nothing really changed and that the story and plot crawled by very slowly and in some cases made no progress at all.  And then at the end when I expected things to pick up and everything to come together like in the movie Fight Club or Donnie Darko.  It just didn&rsquo;t happen.  I felt like the ending was throwing answers at me that didn&rsquo;t add up, like a puzzle where the last 5 pieces don&rsquo;t fit at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn a general wholesome look the plot makes sense.  But on a detailed level I felt the story was just pulling ideas out of a hat and tried to make things work that really didn&rsquo;t.  The idea was good but it was executed poorly and fell short of its intention.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines.  The visuals in this show are easily some of the best I have ever seen.  Many of the visual angles used were unique, fresh, and quite artistic without taking away importance or detail from the scene.  The animation was very fluid and realistic.  The colors and lightning were also done well.  Scenes in bright places were done quite well almost in a blinding way.  While the darker scenes did a great job representing the destruction and despair throughout the rest of the world.  The art/animation is the best thing about this show.  Although there was a lot of dark scenes, so be prepared.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell I&rsquo;m not much of a Radiohead fan so the ending theme didn&rsquo;t do anything for me, I skipped it every time.  The opening theme didn&rsquo;t do much at first but it wore on me and near the end I actually started to enjoy it.  Although the OP didn&rsquo;t fit real well, it was to &ldquo;active&rdquo; to really relate with the show.  As for background music I can&rsquo;t really think of any of them specifically which I guess means it wasn&rsquo;t great but it wasn&rsquo;t bad either and did a good job of blending into the scenes.  The sound effects were good at doing what they were supposed to, adding to the scenes and the detail of the world.  The voice actors did fairly well I felt like for the most part the voices fit each character fairly well.  I didn&rsquo;t watch the English dub so I can&rsquo;t say too much about that.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOne of my biggest problems with Ergo Proxy which also greatly lowered the enjoyment as well as overall score was with the characters.  I simply did not care about them.  The two main characters Vincent and Re-l didn&rsquo;t do anything for me.  I wouldn&rsquo;t care if they died, or if they fell in love, or if they disappeared never to be seen again.  Maybe I might have liked them more if they turned into slugs or something.  Re-l&rsquo;s bright blue eye shadow/mascara whatever it is bothered the heck out of me the ENTIRE series as well.  All I wanted to do was wash it away.  Also there were a few instances where the producers wanted the viewer to care or get emotional over different things between the characters, all it made me do was yawn.  \\n\\n\r\nThe one and ONLY character I liked was Pino.  Pino was used many times as comic relief and did a decent job of it too.  When she dressed up in her costume, it was very cute as well.  Although even then, there were times when Pino just didn&rsquo;t evoke any emotion from me except boredom.  \\n\\n\r\nOn an objective level the characters were well developed.  You get a good understanding of their story.  You even occasionally get a good analysis of their psyche and mental stability.  They were fleshed out and felt like completed beings.  Some of the supporting characters were well done as well.  Although some of them were much more unstable than you originally think and act in ways you wouldn&rsquo;t have expected.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nTo be honest, I did not enjoy this show at all.  I frequently thought about dropping it but I told myself to get through it.  I was hoping that everything would click in the end and I&rsquo;d end up loving it, but that didn&rsquo;t happen.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply there were a few times that I&rsquo;d be watching and suddenly start nodding off in the middle of the episode.  The next day when I tried to watch the following episode I couldn&rsquo;t remember what happened and had to re-watch the previous episode a second time.  None of the episodes really grabbed me and held my attention like it could have.\\n\\n\r\nMy sleeping problem seemed to occur more frequently during some of the middle episodes, 10-20.  Some will disagree with this, but I felt many of these episodes were pointless filler episodes.  Yes some of them did give a little bit of back-story or history of the world but none of it really had any major impacts on the series as a whole.  They could have been reduced to 2 or 3 episodes that could have presented the same information in a better way.  Some of those episodes also felt extremely out of place.  Many times an episode would start off in a completely different totally unrelated location from anything else in previous episodes.  And at the end of the episode you are left scratching your head asking what the hell had just happened.  Many times I felt I had wasted 24 minutes of my life which could have been spent on an episode of a different show.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nFrom some of the other reviews and from the score, I had some decent expectations for this show.  I went in knowing that it will require some philosophical reasoning which is fine with me.  But nearly everything about the show seemed to fall completely short of what I anticipated.  Even after seeing the &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; near the end, I was left feeling uninterested, a &ldquo;So what&rdquo; expression hanging around me.  \\n\\n\r\nBecause it is highly regarded by some people I can&rsquo;t completely say you should stay away from this anime.  If you understand that this will be a confusing trip and don&rsquo;t mind experiences resembling the last two eps of Neon Genesis then it won&rsquo;t hurt to give this show a try.  But if you are like me, and by about eps 8 don&rsquo;t care about the characters or about the story, just stop before things get really ugly.  \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion if you don&rsquo;t see this show you aren&rsquo;t missing out either.  Although I do think if I re-watched it, I might respect it a little more.  But the first time through was miserable enough and I couldn&rsquo;t watch it again.  So if you do plan to watch this you probably should re-watch it to fully enjoy the show.  If you cant imagine yourself re-watching it then you should stop where you are and move onto a different show.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is a highly experimental show, and just like all shows of that kind it always divides the viewers into two camps: while the ones enjoy its complex story and thought-provoking symbolism, the others fiercely criticize it for \"pretentiousness\" or simply scratch their heads in perplexity, wondering what this whole thing is supposed to mean. \r\nAs for me, I firmly believe this is an amazing series with no exaggeration about it, and with this review I'll try to explain you why. Since the anime has a site description you can always read, allow me to skip further introductions and get straight to business.\r\n STORY\r\nObviously,the most contentious part of Ergo Proxy. The story and the method of storytelling this anime employs are highly unusual, and that is by far the main reason why quite a number of people dislike it. However, I think this story does not \"pretend\" to be clever - it is clever indeed. Moreover, it makes Ergo Proxy one of the most clever series I've ever watched.\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story at the core is a journey of self-discovery, hence the main idea is pretty simple yet great, at least as I comprehend it: you should find your own way instead of being somebody's follower or lower-rank copy (\"proxy\"); for that you should realize who you are, what you live for and how the real world looks. The anime certainly makes you ask important questions and reflect on your own life, and that always counts as a great quality in my book.\\n\r\nSecond, Ergo Proxy is a highly experimental show as it presents a diverse mix of genres: cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic, sci-fi, action, mystery, drama, psychological mindf*ck, road movie and even a bit of comedy, romance and slice of life. Consequently, it results in a very unorthodox narrative full of plot twists & genre switches that many viewers disliked as they felt trolled and confused while watching. Well, I do understand those complaints: it is indeed very unusual, confusing at times and probably not to everybody's liking. Besides, one may argue that the anime goes a little too far with experiments in episodes 15 and 19 which makes them too different from the rest in their style. Perhaps, the show could've done better without those two, as it would've also made the 2nd half of the series more compact to provide better pacing and better build-up for the ending. \\n\r\nAside from that fairly tolerable issue, the plot is very well-written & coherent despite its complexity, and the credit for that goes to Dai Sato - the author of the original story and one of the best Japanese scriptwriters who also participated in writing scripts for Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. In fact, it still makes me wonder how he and his team managed to weave all those genres and events into one logical & continuous plot. So, not only those swings & changes are very interesting and uncommon but they also don't exist there just for the sake of it - instead, they actually form the story, with each episode adding something brand new to the plot & character development, and that's amazing indeed.\\n\r\nHowever, the main reason why this anime seems unintelligible to so many people probably lies in its third peculiarity which is the astounding number of symbols & allegories employed: almost every single name & situation is allegoric and requires your interpretation to get the whole story. Moreover, not only those allegories turn out relevant & contributing to the plot but also extremely diverse, referring to Greek mythology, Descartes' philosophy and Shakespeare's plays among other things. No doubt, the high degree of symbolism is what makes the series quite a riddle at times; yet it is in fact a very entertaining and well-thought-out riddle where every element serves its purpose to convey the show's message, and I personally had lots of fun deciphering it.\\n\r\nWith all those complex aspects the story never turns into pretentious nonsense or something really incomprehensible because it actually answers most questions, though often in roundabout and not obvious ways. That means it just demands a little more attention than in your average series, and if you pay it, you get it. Well, I don't consider myself an intellectual and yet I understood almost everything from the first viewing. There were a couple of moments I didn't grasp but it took me 3 minutes (!) to use google, click the first link and read an insightful explanation that satisfied me.\\n\r\nAnd even if you don't get something it's not a reason to dislike the show - it is actually a great motivation for you because this anime is highly rewatchable, and during every viewing there will be new discoveries that will enrich you.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\r\nErgo Proxy's art style is easily recognizable for its omnipresent dark colors and realistic yet unusual character designs that give the series a westernized & very artistic look. The animation quality is great except for a considerable inconsistency in character drawing, and the style fits like a glove although some viewers may need time to get used to its murky appearance.\\n\r\nThe music is a number of ambient tracks by Ike Yoshihiro, a U2-esque opening theme by Monoral and an ending song by Radiohead. All the tracks are nicely composed to create the engrossing and mysterious atmosphere of the series, and even those who dislike the show agree that the soundtrack is simply amazing.\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is also very well-done as the voices perfectly fit the characters, and the seiyus did a very good job at conveying emotions. \\n\r\nTo sum up, the production values are impressive indeed, and the style is memorable & totally appropriate for the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nWell, Ergo Proxy is an anime about self-discovery, hence its primary focus lies on the characters and their development. The main difference from other shows of this kind is that the story for the most part doesn't emerge from characters' actions & choices - rather, the characters are put into an already crafted plot full of twists & symbols mirroring their inner conflicts, and they receive development while going through this labyrinthine plot & unraveling its mystery step by step. As a result, you get a story-driven series with strong emphasis on the characters, which looks paradoxical on paper yet works surprisingly well in reality, being one of the most original aspects of the show. \\n\r\nThe other interesting aspect is how the characters don't feel overblown in any way. Unlike many other series that endow each character with one or two exaggerated features (extreme cuteness, extreme coolness etc.), often at the cost of everything else, Ergo Proxy successfully avoids that common pattern by presenting a trio of very well-balanced protagonists in Re-l Mayer, Vincent Law and Pino:\\n\r\n- Re-l is a confident, no-nonsense investigator with very good analytical and shooting skills which, however, don't exceed the capabilities of a trained person and thus don't make her an invincible action hero or an omniscient genius. At first, she acts rather cold towards others (Vincent in particular) because she's a bit spoiled by her social position and because the circumstances demand her to be on guard all the time. However, as the show goes on Re-l changes quite a bit, and it becomes evident that she's a perfectly normal girl with normal human emotions. Also, she's very attractive but not oversexualized which is indeed an extreme rarity for this medium;\\n\r\n- Vincent lost his memories and a huge part of his identity with them, so he feels an obvious lack of confidence... and yet he knows how to repair things, how to hold a weapon and shoot, and  despite acting very shy at the beginning he embarks on a dangerous & often bewildering journey of self-discovery and gradually develops into a completely different person by the end of the series. So, he ain't some useless angsty teenager typical for anime - rather, he is a very kind and helpful guy who wants to learn the truth about himself. His angst never feels overblown to the point where it gets annoying, and his development throughout the story is truly one of the most fundamental I've ever seen;\\n\r\n- as for Pino, she's an autoreiv that accompanies Re-l & Vincent, providing some nice examples of man & machine interaction as well as some lightheartedness to compensate for the grim & serious setting. She is an awesome & very lovable character who at the same time never gets sickeningly moe because she acts like a normal girl of her age and not some typical loli you often see in anime.\\n\r\nAlso, the show has one more protagonist i.e. Ergo Proxy, but the identity & role of that guy is a huge spoiler so I can't tell you anything about him - you'll have to learn it yourself.\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that the right balance in characterization and the natural step-by-step development is what makes the protagonists very realistic, and while there may be people who don't like it because they find the characters \"boring\" (or not extreme enough in comparison to other series) I really enjoy this approach. What I enjoy no less is that the supporting cast receive a great share of development as well, with Raul Creed, Daedalus, Hoody and Iggy being the most outstanding examples. \\n\r\nSo, in general the characterization is great, and even if you don't find the cast that interesting at first, just give them some time and see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nPerhaps, the story could do better without a couple of questionable episodes, and the character drawings could be more consistent. Therefore, I can't really call this show a flawless masterpiece. However, I will easily give it an excellent rating and with lots of pleasure take it to my personal top-10.\\n\r\nMy final advice for possible newcomers is simple: if you look for some lighthearted entertainment with J-pop, sugoi, ganbatte, tomodachi, squealing voices and bright haircolors, stay away from this anime as you will only waste your time. The same is if you look for an action-driven series because action is not the focal point of Ergo Proxy.\\n\r\nHowever, if you look for a compelling story, if you are not afraid of a certain intellectual challenge, if you are open-minded and able to keep attention for 23 episodes, I highly encourage you to watch this show. Of course, I can't guarantee you will like it as much as I do, but I'm pretty sure you at least won't regret it.",

            "content": "- - - - [ Ergo Proxy :: Episodes - 26 ] - - - -\r\n[ Could contain minor spoilers. Sorry.. ]\r\nErgo Proxy. When I first saw that title, I was curious. I knew what a proxy was, on Internet and in real life. But I didn't know what Ergo was. So I got the series, mostly out of curiosity. I didn't expect much at first. The main female character, Re-L (Lil, Real, or any variant. Depends of fansub) has a freaky face with blue mascara, and wields a shotgun. I expect an all-out gun action series, with some mecha. But I was wrong! ErgoProxy is a great series, definitely worth seeing, and has even made it to my favourites list. Beware, there are not much humour or laughs in this series. It's a deep, dark and philosophical series. But trust me, definitely worth seeing.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Animation ] -\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that amazed me since the start of the series, till the very end is the quality of the animation. They combined modern and traditional to make a very good blend. The producers have been successful in creating a dark/moody atmosphere when needed. The light effects were amazing. They pointed out details wherever needed without flaw. The motion of the characters was very fluid, while maintaining the complexity of the backgrounds. If I may include a small spoiler here, the desolated lands pictured a bit later in the series are well made. You really get the feeling of sorrow and despair creeping in. However, although it may only be from my point of view, but in long-shots filmed from afar, you sometimes see the characters' features distort. Eg. an eye is above the other or toes seem strange. Can't expect much details from long-shots anyways but an eye above the other? Weird! Another dark point is that sometimes, the scenes are excessively...dark! You can't discern details easily. Apart from these, there are no major flaws in my opinion. Again, I should point out that the animators took some time to work on the scenes and have created beautiful and detailed backgrounds. Not overly detailed that you get the impression that you are in live-action, but just enough.. or just a bit not enough sometimes (dark scenes specially). Very little frame-reuse or even no frame-reuse if you ask me, just something nice to note.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Sound ] -\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I usually don't pay much attention to sound in animes. It's just there, nothing special. But here, it's different. The OP was great! The music suited my tastes entirely. Even the ED was very well made! The music really accompanied the moody and dark story. Just a side-tracking here, but I really like the way the ED credits is presented: A new, slanted type of presentation. Innovative if you ask me. The atmosphere sounds were well done, and did well in enhancing the moods and feelings of the Ergo Proxy. Not much in-series music available though. However, the OP and ED music don't seem to really fit in the quiet, dark and suspense-oriented Ergo Proxy. It's just too... lively. The music was great though!\\n\\n\r\n- [ Story ] -\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let me say it straight here itself: Ergo Proxy's story can be very very confusing and difficult to understand sometimes during some episodes, a bit Evangelion-like if you want i.e. Complex! But unlike Eva, most mysteries are eventually cleared, except for some. It's a series that you will want to go through once, get all the explanations, then go back and rewatch it just to appreciate the way the mysteries are introduced and pay particular attention to the minute details.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that adds confusion is that some episodes seem really out of place and do not seem to have any meaning at first. In fact, they are here to explain the details of Ergo Proxy in a non-intrusive and non-flagrant way. Be on the lookout for those and pay attention. They clear a lot of mysteries. Hint: Pay attention to the episode with the Quiz! :P Just like I said, some episodes seem out of place. Often, you are led on an episode with a very different story, only to find that one of the characters was dreaming or whatever like that. Sometimes, it's just too puzzling. You finish the episode and tell yourself \"What the hell just happened?\".\\n\\n\r\nNow, on with the main story which is about Re-L Meyer, grand-daughter of Donov Meyer - the administrator/head counciller of Romdeau Dome city and Vincent Law, an ordinary employee of the Autorave Division. At some point of time before the scene, Earth's environment became very polluted as a result of a Methane Hydrate layer combustion. This may be considered spoiler but it doesn't really affect the plot to know it. Anyways, 85% of Earth's population was wiped out as a result. The survivors now live in Dome Cities such as Romdeau, since the air outside the domes is nearly unbreathable. Later, you are explained the significance of WombSys and Amrita Cells. I can't reveal what these 2 things do without going into spoilers. However, Anikimeiski provided an elaborate explanation of Ergo Proxy's plot-line. If you require help after watching it, refer to his explanations. Google it to find out about the site.. (If you do not mind major spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nRe-L, working with her assistant Vincent Law, is investigating something known as Cogito (Cognito) Virus which allows Autoraves (robots that co-habit and help humans) to gain something with resembles emotion. So, they tend to become unpredictable and need to be eliminated. However, the real plot starts early as episode 2. During one of these investigations, Re-L is attacked by a monster (guess what it was! Pr... *spoilers*) which is very agile and quick. It leaves a hand print on the crime scene. Wanting to get more details, Re-L goes to her grand-father Donov Meyer to get answers but none is obtained. The story starts from here and quickly evolves into something unpredictable, after Vincent Law leaves the Romdeau for the Outside World. Excuse me if I introduced a number of spoilers, but it was required to make the scene clear.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very well presented, with a good pace, neither too fast, nor too slow. The action scenes, however, are fast-paced just as expected. There are no major loopholes, except for some later in the series. Refer to Conclusion for more details. The story is holds the viewer in suspense, and after watching an episode, it's difficult to resist watching the next. Until the end, the series maintained the suspense and mystery, spoon-feeding answers along the way as required. Nothing more to say here, I guess. It's a good plot-line, which kinda reminds me of George Orwell's 1984. Here too we got a seemingly perfect society but with severe flaws.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Characters ] -\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Ergo Proxy is what amazed me most! Every one of them and their backgrounds are well explained, leaving no details unexplained. Often, the characters have whole episodes to explain their past and their current self. This is awesome! I can't complain about lack of details regarding characters. with Ergo Proxy. They are all well developed into the story, and fade out as required. The main characters stay till the end, of course! What do you expect? If all main characters faded out, then there won't be any Ergo Proxy! :P\\n\\n\r\nThe characters each have well-defined emotional traits, strengths and weaknesses. Just to take an example, Re-L is very selfish at the beginning, caring only for her little self and not having any remorse regarding anything. She neglects everybody, included her Autorave Iggy and Vincent Law. However, as the series progresses, you can slowly see her change and evolve. Similarly, she is a very good fighter and observer, but fails to express feelings and be emotive enough, unlike Vincent Law, who is excessively emotive and weakling-like at first. Again, he'll develop his strengths as the story progresses. Amazing! Every character has his or her own motivations for what he/she's doing, whether good or evil. Sometimes, their actions seem wild or illogical, but it gives us an explanation of what the characters are actually feeling, whether it's love, hatred, duty or utter want for destruction.\\n\\n\r\nAs with series or movies that include robots and mechas, there is an emotion issue, that is human feel emotions and robots cannot. Here, even robots can feel after being infected by Cogito, but are in a way denied the right to feel emotions. That's what I was saying in the beginning, the stuff about philosophy. The Cogito virus introduces a very nice turn in the story, pushing the character development even furthur. Ergo Proxy explores such things as loyalty, denial of love, seeking acceptance, betrayal, friendship, companionship, split personalities, the good and evil side of oneself and such. It's pretty elaborate sometimes!\\n\\n\r\n- [ Value / Enjoyment ] -\\n\\n\r\nI'll keep this part short. There is not really enjoyment in Ergo Proxy since it's kinda dark and moody. However, it definitely has a good value for me and definitely earns a rewatch to clear up some points. Not much action, but if you want a good sc-fi type of suspence, mixed with action and spicy twists and turns, go watch Ergo Proxy. I definitely enjoyed Ergo Proxy which successfully maintained the suspense and surprises till the end. You won't be skipping episodes often here. However, the story can be kinda slow sometimes, which kinda annoys you.\\n\\n\r\n- [ Conclusion ] -\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really liked Ergo proxy. You don't find many series with such depth and with enough elaboration and complexity to keep you glued. However, as I mentioned earlier, there are some dark points that are not solved, the biggest one being the statement made by Vincent Law in the last episode. Maybe there will be an Ergo Proxy 2 or a second season. Maybe an OAV at least. If not, then it would have a very cheap ending! But I hope there will indeed be a good and proper ending to this marvellous series. Go watch it. It's definitely worth it, if you like the genre. Thanks for reading! Was kinda long this time.. Gomen! And I rarely give perfect mark 10! :P Ergo proxy may earn it however. It deserves it, but I am too miserly to see 10 given! :P",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy might just take the cake for being the most frustrating series that I've ever seen. Not only because of what it does wrong, but because of what it does right\u2014it's based on a great idea, and it features some great art and music, but unfortunately it doesn't know how to capitalize on any of these qualities.\r\nThe most immediately inviting aspects of Ergo Proxy are definitely the technical ones. It's set in a post-apocalyptic future in which mankind lives in self-contained cities (\u201cdomes\u201d). The main city of Romdo, portrayed as a maze of slummy apartment buildings and burned-out streets that contrast with the cleanand orderly buildings inhabited by the government, is a fitting setting that's clearly built with great care and deliberation. The use of shadows and atmospheric lighting is generally excellent. The outside world, an endless plane of ice and rock, isn't exactly a beautiful sight, but it's carefully rendered and features reasonably detailed background art. \\n\\n\r\nThe character and mecha designs are also eye-catching. Re-l, whose pale face and bright blue eye makeup form an essential contrast with the dark world, quickly became an icon of the series, and with good reason; it's a truly striking and unique design. Most of the cast is slightly more earthy and realistically depicted than the norm, with the character art generally steering clear of the round-faced round-body designs that have become typical. The vehicular and mechanical art is also of high caliber, with great models for the robotic companions (\u201cAutoReivs\u201d) that feature prominently in the series, as well as the flying airship on which a large part of the story takes place. There are occasional lapses in artistic quality, mostly noticeable in the form of inconsistent detailing on the faces and limbs of a few key characters, but for the most part, this is a visually strong production.\\n\\n\r\nFurther augmenting the technical side of the show is a superb soundtrack, ranging from low key electronic atmospheric noise to full-fledged techno rock that, while not always completely original sounding, is well-made and appropriate for the series. The tracks sometimes feature an element of chanted vocals that befit the slightly religious overtones of the series and the general feeling of impending apocalypse. The combination of the dystopian art and the solid musical score gives Ergo Proxy the kind of atmosphere that would make most entries in the \u201cdark sci-fi\u201d category jealous: It gives us the sense of a world on the edge, pushed to its limit, where something is about to break. It breeds suspense and curiosity.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is also possessed of a story that, on its own merits, isn't bad at all. Re-l, an investigator for Romdo's Intelligence Bureau, is pursuing a fugitive named Vincent Law, who is sought in connection with criminal activity. At the same time, she notices that high ranking members of the city's government are trying to cover up the existence of monsters called \u201cProxies,\u201d and decides to investigate the matter on her own authority. As the show wears on we eventually learn a bit more about the nature of Proxies and the nature of the world itself. A futuristic mystery that slowly leads to revelations about the world? Sounds like, with proper execution, this could be turned into an excellent story.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it's the \u201cproper execution\u201d part that can make the difference between great and not-so-great works of fiction, and it's for this reason that Ergo Proxy ends up comparable to a great athlete with a broken leg: Full of potential, but incapable of going anywhere. The first third or so of the series is promising. It moves along at a brisk pace, gradually raising questions and answering them where appropriate, advancing the mystery at a brisk speed. However, after this initial success, the story enters a slump from which it never recovers.\\n\\n\r\nThe most noticeable flaw in storytelling is the inclusion of several episodes that have little (if anything) to do with the plot. These episodes generally feature the characters in strange situations that are clearly meant to be mind-boggling or confusing, such as playing on a game show, having a chat in a hellish bookstore in the middle of nowhere, or interacting with strange creatures in a Disney Land-esque theme park. It's abundantly clear that these episodes are here only for the cheap thrill of making the audience think \u201cwhat the hell is going on?\u201d On rare occasions they give us pieces of information about the characters and the state of the world; however, that alone is not a sufficient reason for the existence of a large lump of material that is essentially irrelevant, and this information could have been conveyed through dialogue, discovery, or any other basic facet of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major flaw in Ergo Proxy's method of storytelling is the presence of an overwhelming amount of dialogue that strains to be philosophical but is ultimately repetitive and meaningless. Get ready to hear people say things like \u201cthis is the ultimate truth that all organisms strive to obtain through self-examination,\u201d or \u201cyou think, therefore I am\u201d on a regular basis. There seems to be an underlying theme of personal identity and finding one's reason for existence, and it's conveyed with all the subtlety of a ball-peen hammer to the face. Symbolism, simile, metaphor, repeated themes/motifs, and other standby elements that clever writers use when presenting an idea to the audience\u2014pretty much none of them are in play here, and they've been crudely replaced with line after line of inarticulate pseudointellectual drivel that gets an extremely disproportionate amount of screentime in the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, the series is split pretty evenly between duds and strong cast members. Re-l, the female lead, is the granddaughter of a government official. She's an interesting lead because she's emotionally detached, extremely competent and strong-willed...but at the same time, her privileged upbringing means that she's used to having others doting on her, giving her a bit of a spoiled side. Watching her develop as the series progresses is a rewarding experience. The male lead, Vincent Law, is of the dud variety; he doesn't really have a whole lot of character attributes other than \u201ckind,\u201d \u201coptimistic,\u201d and \u201cconfused,\u201d and while he does eventually learn a little bit more about himself, his personality remains pretty one-note. Perhaps the biggest example of wasted potential in the series is Pino, a young female robot who receives a soul due to a virus that affects robots (yes, that's really the explanation). She does have some strong character moments, but is mostly used as adorable comedic relief throughout the series. Now, imagine that: The show is supposed to be making a statement about identity and self-realization, and here they have a cast member who is both a robot that suddenly has emotions and the ability to think for herself, and a young girl who is coming of age and learning about life and death. It doesn't take a lot of thought to realize that she would be a PERFECT character to develop in order to convey these themes artfully and elegantly, but instead she ends up wearing a bunny suit and cracking jokes for a majority of the show. It's really too bad; they had the proper tool sitting right in front of them, but they didn't know how to use it.\\n\\n\r\nThe result of all of the aforementioned flaws is that Ergo Proxy pretty much writes the book on everything that's wrong with the recent trend of \u201cdeep\u201d (I use that word sarcastically) media directed at teens: It repeatedly uses dry and overly complicated dialogue to explain relatively simple concepts, repeatedly resorts to the use of plot contrivances like amnesia and multiple personality disorder to explain events, and repeatedly puts its characters into strange \u201cis-this-a-dream-is-this-not-a-dream\u201d situations, to the point where the whole thing becomes laughable, which I'm sure is not the intent of its writers. While not entirely devoid of strong attributes, Ergo Proxy is ultimately an example of a good idea gone to waste.",

            "content": "The Ancient Greeks created their own religion. Characters -- or rather, Gods -- were made based to human feelings as both: representation of what these feelings look like and what the characteristics and behaviors of these metaphors would be like. It didn't stop there. They created lore, past-stories and character potray to all of them, and decided that these Gods live on top of the Mount Olympus. And even today, 3000 years later, some geniuses go and ask \"why did they never bother to climb on Mount Olympus and check if the Gods are there?\" Because it wasn't the point of the story at all,and they knew it was just a made up story created by humans. Gods not being there was self-explanatory to all. That's why. \\n\\n\r\nWhat does this has to do with 'Ergo Proxy', then? 'Ergo Proxy' is made by, and made for these exact people who still keep wondering why Ancient Greeks never bothered to check if their Gods are real. This time it is about philosophical POV's which are apparently purposely misunderstood and misinterpreted by the creators of this work, and then further mistaken by its viewers for an actual anime series about these famous existential questions. I can agree that this work is thought-provoking, but the references in it are fallacies and every in-depth analysis over-analysing of not what is there, but what one believes is there. It chooses the same path as later Freudian literature which was altered by his daughter based to what she thought Freud meant rather than writing the exact thing Freud said. As a conclusion in case my point hasn't been made clear yet: 'Ergo Proxy' is not a work of philosophy, it is a work of its creators interpretations of famous philosophies. This series is not a study nor can it be seen as a reference, it is nothing but a preach by someone who thought they have understood what our great philosophers \"really\", I mean REALLY meant. To me, their interpretations are no different from those people who ask why Greeks didn't climb the goddamn mountain. \\n\\n\r\nTo actually talk about this anime outside is hideous content, it quite literally sucks ass. The directing is a mess, the pacing is so dreadfully slow one has to wonder why the fans of this series consider themselves smart for liking this spoon-fed \"deepness\". At least Anno, the creator of Evangelion admitted he just threw bunch of religious references in the mix to make it look smart and make people hyped for it being 2deep5anyone and everyone to understand. While I am not sure if the creators of 'Ergo Proxy' are lacking self-awareness or simply never cared to admit that their work is bunch of baloney: it surely is doing an impressive job convincing masses to think that it isn't. They went as far as put bunch of obscure references in the background art, such as faces of these philosophers they claim to imitate because apparently the point of their ideas and philosophies is the best captured by an AD HOMINEM.\"The essential part of what was said is what the face of the person who said it looks like.\"  Like really, how subtle and how well I can prove my intelligent by liking this.\\n\\n\r\nNow the second attempt to talk about content outside the philosophies. Real is the only interesting character in the series. Most of the others feel more of a try-hard attempts to capture something completely different than personalities, which alone is a respectable idea considering the nature of the series. Still, all of them come out rather uninteresting and content-lacking. If comparing to the same Greek Gods, our characters here are rather empty shells. One could say that this makes it great, other say they deliver as much as any harem girl. Pino, on the other hand, is simply annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe series does contain lot of good as well, they are mainly hidden and short scenes such as a quiz that leads to the OP song to play. Great ideas in not so great series. The opening itself is an everlasting meme. Real creates most of the other interesting scenes and situations in the series, but ultimately leave me wish she was a character inside a better anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion: Ergo Proxy is not a very good series for those who want something more from anime outside simply \"getting it.\" Getting Ergo Proxy is not by any means any harder than \"getting\" Sword Art Online. Both can be overanalyzed to the grave by anyone who doesn't know what occam's razor is. To those who are interested in philosophical anime, watch Serial Experiments Lain, GITS SAC, Digimon Tamers, Wolfs Rain, Kino no Tabi (1st season), even the first Pokemon movie (in Jap dub). Watch Ergo Proxy and find not much more than pretentiousness as the series target audience consist of people who saw the meme \"The door is red. The author uses the color red to express his anger.\" and thought this is what all symbolism should be like, regardless if it is intended by its creator or not.",

            "content": "There is some excellent production in this cyberpunk thriller/road trip set in an eerie utopian futurescape filled with robots and starring a female protagonist in the vein of Ghost in the Shell's Motoko.\r\nExcept Ergo Proxy's Re-l Mayer has sexy eyeshadow.  And she's petulant to a degree that she mirrors today's shallow socialites.  Ok, so she's absolutely nothing like the strong-willed, decisive and intelligent Motoko.  But hey Mayer's young, she's got makeup and dresses alternative style.  Yes, you can see where the animators' priority lay with this production.  Things get even more ridiculous when a girl in a pink bunny outfitappears and sticks around.\\n\\n\r\nThis feels like a more accessible version of TeXhnolyze, although unlike that excellent anime, Ergo Proxy falters too much and ultimately the story feels ponderous with its lack of pace, drive and purpose.  It has a po-face the entire time, trying to fool you into thinking its a serious grand epic vision with some amazing revelation that will shock you to your core and hail it as the toppler of all cyberpunk titles before it.  Needless to say it fails on all counts.  It falls flat on its mascara-ridden face.\\n\\n\r\nTeXhnolyze had the same face, lacking make-up, but backed it up with substance, it really did shock you with its revelations in the latter half of the series, and when the crap hits the fan for many characters, you feel something, because they're portrayed as humans.  In Ergo Proxy, everyone is seemingly made of wood and is as lively as a plank.  I do find it interesting how obnoxious the main protagonist Mayer is in this show though, its a refreshing change in a way, being that anime's main leads are usually goody two shoes, but instead of being an interesting character with a flawed personality, she's just plain obnoxious all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe series however does reach a particular zenith with episode 20 which revolves around the theme of multiple personality disorder, successfully mindhumping the viewer in an entertaining fashion.  There are meaty topics and ideas thrown around this show, I mean with a title like Ergo Proxy it would be a crime not to have characters spouting painfully obvious commentary on mainstream philosophical theories, but whats actually a crime is to have no one interesting or empaphetic and nothing compelling or engaging occuring on screen.  The show is lifeless, which is deeply ironic.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's end credits have Radiohead's Paranoid Android, it gets points for that at least.",

However very quickly the story begins to take an unfocused long path toward an ever weakening storyline, slowely revealing each character to have almost no depth beyond their basic neurosis. Even the art style weakens only a handful of episodes in.\r\nThis Anime includes some pretty painful filler, some full episodes but even more offensive are some of the episodes that contain one or two moments of \"main story\" plot, but are mainly filler in the formof characters rehashing old ideas or questions we the viewer has already figured out the answers to.\\n\\n\r\nThe show spends a lot of time dabbling in questions of existentialism and theology, this comes off as simplistic and childish as the characters indulging in these ideas are so one dimensional and unfleshed out that the viewer ends up with no interest as to what conclusion they come to.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of this anime, i found myself watching just to be able to say that i hadn't given up on it, i no longer cared about any of the characters, and i no longer cared about the out come.\\n\\n\r\nmy advice is to give this one a miss",

            "content": "\"In a world where humans and robots live together...\" \rSounds generic, no? This opening line to the description of the anime is rather misleading. I strongly advise you to take a second look at this before dismissing it out of hand as unoriginal. \rErgo Proxy stands out from among other stereotypical anime shows because of its ability of *not* resorting to these oft used plotlines. What this anime focuses on is the development of a few main characters in a world erupting into chaos. While the viewpoint of the show does not originally show it, a great deal of Ergo Proxy is centered around ayoung man's self discovery and acceptance of who he is, learning to interact with others, and to remain true to himself.\\n\\n\rThis show reminded me most of all of the anime Evangelion. If you, the reader, have ever seen Eva, you may recall the rather deep scenes near the end, wherein the main character attempts to resolve numerous internal conflicts, ultimately resulting in a moment of revelation. Now, as far as I understand it, the director of Ergo Proxy did *not* have a nervous breakdown like the director of Eva, but the depth of the introspective episodes were very similar.\\n\\n\rAs for the anime itself, I enjoyed the radical variance in the story of each episode. While the settings of the story remain very similar - a city, a shanty-town, and a wasteland are the preeminent landscapes \u2013 the actions in the episodes defy prediction. Whereas in some animes\u2019 episodes you seemingly have a cycle of events that repeat over and over again, Ergo Proxy remains unique every time. \\n\\n\rOn a slightly less approving note, I will say that some of the scenes were truly very, very random, and only upon serious retrospection will you note that they have anything to do with the core plot at all. No spoilers here, however.\\n\\n\rAlso, while in some episodes you will be given background history about the show in a natural, conversational manner, there are points where the show simply comes out and presents the information to you. The impact of this is that at those moments it seems less that you are watching a naturally unfolding story than that you are reading a fact sheet about the show.\\n\\n\rDespite these few setbacks however, the anime still stands at a strong \u20189\u2019 on my list. I enjoyed the viewing of the anime all the way to the end, which continues the suspense and unpredictability. The plot is written wonderfully here at the finish as well, leaving the future unresolved and unexplained, leaving it up to the viewer to imagine what happens.\\n\\n\rI will invite everyone who enjoys a thrilling, action-pack, and very emotionally and psychologically deep story to watch \u201cErgo Proxy.\u201d\\n\\n\rRating: 9/10",

            "content": "There is some spoilers into this, there is also me telling you that  watching this is not worth any of  your time.\r\nErgo Proxy is one of these promising series that your friends tell you to watch and declare as \"masterpiece.\"\r\nIt was one of the series i expected to love the most, i thought it was going to be consistently good, and the first episode kinda told me that my friends were right, it had a lot of potential to it, it was promising, it had a touch of atmospheric space that got you into it, but what made this series so appealing inthe first episode fastly changed for some The Room Avant-Garde crap. I mean, i compare The Room to this, but i can give the credits to Wiseau atleast, for even trying. \\n\\n\r\nTrying to immerse yourself into a toilet world where babies shit frootloops and babies give birth to adults, is more easy than to immerse yourself into that piece of crap that is Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2 First episode had structure, but it threw it fast away to try to be experimental, but you don't get experimental much with the biggest clich\u00e9s in mystery storytelling. Ergo Proxy makes you fall gradually into an abyss of boredom. Episode 16 is probably the most boring and monotonous episode i have ever seen in an anime. Period. Episode 4 and 5 were a boring redneck vibes, monotonous piece of audio visuals that made you think  more about what you're doing with your life than the child who just got killed, at this episode 4  i knew i f*cked up. Forever after come with what has already been done in the past, but way less ambitious and just... hahh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4 Ergo Proxy succeeded in being interesting until episode 3, where you could clearly see that the structure was collapsing, and that the universe stopped being rigid, complete, real, unique to itself. It just became some trashy decor you'll see in an amateur movie with no skills for backgrounds whatsoever. The background, the environment was lacking in realism, it was lacking in everything it had no wish to make you immerse into it. It made you feel like they were trying something, while trying nothing at all. The visuals in it kept degrading like everything else.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5 Sound was okay, sometimes it went off from what was happening on the screen, but i mean, this came out in 2006, and you can't expect the sound to save your background, your script, storytelling, you can't. Sound was probably the best thing about this show, it was mediocre but way better than the show itself, i would have listened to an album of the OSTs of Ergo Proxy instead of the show itself, if only i knew back then.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1 Characteristically speaking, Ergo Proxy had nothing to offer, neither Re-l or Vince had any depth, substance, or any characteric traits that made them interesting in the first place, nahh, it was the contrary, they never helped to try to keep that show alive and interesting, they were one of the core of why Ergo Proxy was painful to watch. Re-L could only complain and cute cute fanservice while being a complete dumbster while Vince was one of the most shallow and dense character in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1 Kill me, kill me please, it's probably what i was feeling deep inside. Why i am watching this while i could just rewatch Tokyo Ghoul first season, which is way more well executed and thoughtful  than this thing, which is just edgy in the irritating sense. Edgy to be edgy. It tells you a lot when you remember something for how bad it was. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4 This thing clearly has Velvet Underground and Lou Reed vibes to it, poor Lou Reed, i hope he is not associated with this, because it would only \\n\r\nbe a shame to link a legend with this stuff that was so bland and empty, \\n\r\nit was just like watching nothing at all. It would  just  be an utter insult to Lou and his works.  This show is a 4, first three episodes were watcheable, after it's just a downfall in a pool of  garbage crap that never ceased to smell. I really wished i could get back the time i spent on it, \\n\r\nbut it's too late, unfortunately.\\n",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy. Wow. This one\u2019s tough to review.\r\nErgo Proxy is not your typical cyberpunk anime. For more, it doesn\u2019t rely on heavy gun-fighting action scenes to grasp viewers\u2019 attentions instead it uses mind-break and a very intriguing strange and dark atmosphere in a post-apocalyptic world. Though a post-apocalyptic world is something that is not new or could even be said overused, Ergo Proxy\u2019s is fluid and very well thought out. \r\nErgo Proxy stands out among other cyberpunk anime as this one is a truly original and is very unique as it takes on Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 very famous philosophical statement which is \u201ccogito ergo sum\u201d andviews it on different perspectives. \u201cCogito ergo sum\u201d means \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d is basically the main theme of the anime. The whole world of Ergo Proxy itself is based on this theme while questioning and taunting the said philosophical statement. Everything was built along with those lines while the story revolves around the characters who were searching for self-actualization over the course of 23 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy has a very fast pacing which could indeed get you hooked for about 10minutes into the show. It started off with Re-l Mayer investigating cases of \u201cAutoReivs\u201d (Android-like companions) being infected with a virus called \u201ccogito.\u201d This \u201ccogito\u201d virus is a dangerous virus for humans as this \u201cAutoReivs\u201d once infected with the virus comes to a realization that they too have a heart thus leading to human-like emotions which could in turn lead to trouble as they now tend to act on how they feel but not on how their masters command them to. After some investigations, while at home, Re-l saw a word written in blood that stated \u201cawakening\u201d and was approached by an entity called a \u201cPROXY.\u201d A lot of these intriguing scenarios will be shed light upon as the story progresses. Interesting right? See episode 2 as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll instantly get hooked.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy presents different but very realistic problems including politics, ways of life, beliefs, and the search for one\u2019s true self. Treading along the anime, these issues will be faced with subtlety and precision without ever being dragging. Though its pacing is very fast, some might be surprised as at the middle of the anime, somewhere past around 13 episodes, it went to a complete halt as it now focused on the changes that are happening with the characters. We now see Pino\u2019s journey for self-actualization, Vincent\u2019s search for the truth, and Re-l\u2019s changing feelings for the ones around her. These episodes are not entirely focused on the characters though; some contains bags of clues about the reality of Ergo Proxy while some are just placed there to add to the length or simply called fillers. Though these episodes might be fillers, you wouldn\u2019t immediately recognize that they are, as these fillers have a knack of making your brain burst out leaving you thinking for hours about what really happened; but even if you\u2019ve managed to solve what was the episode about, it wouldn\u2019t change anything as these fillers were totally irrelevant to the main point of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some episodes that contain complete mindfuck which in turn made the story stagnant, Ergo Proxy now picks up on what it has left for the grand finale. If there was anything that I could really complain about Ergo Proxy, it would be the ending. For a total mind-breaking anime, I couldn\u2019t ignore that some loose ends were still loose and some missing links were still missing. It actually felt like the anime was saying that it\u2019s up to the viewers to figure out what happened about this or that; well for a total mindfuck anime, maybe it is really trying to do that. But still, it doesn\u2019t hinder the thrilling rollercoaster ride I got from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I absolutely find fascinating in Ergo Proxy is the gradual development of our three main characters. As I\u2019ve said, Pino is in a journey of self-actualization and being infected by the cogito virus, this slowly transforms Pino from an emotionless companion-type AutoReiv to something that is more if not, realistically human. Vincent on the other hand, is in search for his true self as it was stated that he was brainwashed and is now on his way looking for answers. At first, I honestly thought that Vincent was a major wimpy guy, but he turned out to be one of the coolest male leading characters out there. As the story goes along, he gradually changes as the truth about him are unveiled. Lastly, Re-l is not your typical bad-ass girl who wields dual pistols and can shoot anyone with her eyes closed. No, she is your normal snobbish lady who gets scared, weak and is worth protecting; only thing is she\u2019s really courageous or more like stubborn. After some realizations and some great revelations, you will notice her gradual change of heart regarding everyone around her. All of these traits make them look very real as humans which made me really admire Ergo Proxy as this is a hard one to pull off considering that the setting is in a post-apocalyptic world.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that the production value of this anime is high as the animation was fluid and the backgrounds were simply amazing. From the desolated wastelands to the deserted cities, all were done with accuracy. Sometimes though, I think the lighting is somewhat of a bother as it tends to be too dark that you\u2019ll have difficulty seeing what\u2019s really happening. Character designs however were very human-like and if you\u2019ve seen Witch Hunter Robin, it is very much the same. But there were also inconsistencies as sometimes, when looked from afar, the facial structure of the characters becomes distorted. Nevertheless, the animation was really good leaving you wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nPino\u2019s character design however was so adorable and lovely that no one could ever ignore her cuteness. Though this is not a comedy anime, sometimes you\u2019ll find yourself smiling and even touched for the cute things she does. Often too that Pino\u2019s character is matched with the dramatic scenes of this anime that you could even feel a small aching on your chest.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made this successful was Pino\u2019s seiyuu Akiko Yakima. She portrays her lines very well which fits the cute attitude of Pino. And I\u2019m not saying that Pino has the only voice acting that was good, in fact all of the voices behind the characters were astounding. Not to mention that the opening and ending song were very good which weren\u2019t J-pop but rather alternative English songs. The opening song (kiri) sets a thought-provoking environment while the ending song (PARANOID ANDROID) finishes what the opening has brought forth. The background music during scenes is good in setting the mood if it is meant to be thrilling or meant to be dramatic. And who could ignore the amazing use of background silence? Rarely could you see an anime that uses silence and be excellent with doing so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ergo Proxy is a very unique anime that could give you one hell of a ride all the way through. If it weren\u2019t for the unneeded fillers and a much clearer explanation of things, then this would be something phenomenal. It is a true brain-twister that will leave you puzzled for hours just because of some certain events. If you\u2019re into mentally challenging anime, then this is definitely for you. I certainly enjoyed it and much likely that you will too.\\n\\n\r\nJust to summarize things:\\n\r\nErgo Proxy = MINDFUCK.",

            "content": "Note: Spoilers for Ergo Proxy. Written for people who have watched the show and want an analytical review. You have been warned.\r\nAn echo, a heartbeat pounding in the eye of the storm, Centzontotochtin sails over the earth, and the pulse of the awakening signals the beginning of the end.\r\nErgo Proxy aired over ten years ago and to this day remains an enigma to many. Its creative thought experiments and questions about our purpose in life have been just as mesmerizing as they have been easily dismissed. But whether it\u2019s thoughtfully ambiguous or frustratingly obtuse, what\u2019s consistent is Ergo Proxy\u2019s mystique beneath its decrepit and artificiallandscape, a captivating blend of the real and the surreal that reveals how easy it has become for us to mistake the double for the authentic.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout, we are presented with illusions, smoke and mirrors, dream worlds, and nightmares, where reality and truth has been distorted by the agents of a lost civilization. Think of supple fingers curved in Shakespearean fashion or a bookstore of forgotten memories. As the Proxies roam their respective domed cities, searching endlessly to satisfy their raison d\u2019etre, what tethers us to reality are Vincent and Re-L. They are equally confounded by the mysteries they confront in their quest for answers about the Proxies.\\n\\n\r\nWe are led to believe that outside the dilapidated dome cities and noxious caves, aboard Centzontotochtin in a vast swath of desert and frozen seas is the real world in the aftermath of some environmental catastrophe. Here is where Re-L spends her time logging her experiences, taking dutiful care of personal hygiene, and complaining about an upright toilet seat. It\u2019s where Vincent and the AutoReiv companion Pino play in the snow and act unsuspectingly of the dangers ahead. Here, in the supposed real world, with nothing but dead landscape and a chilling wind on the horizon, is where our characters can introspect and consider the world as it is.\\n\\n\r\nYet, for all their artificial and mundane characteristics, the domes appear much closer to a tangible description of human reality. Be it Romdeau and its aristocratic bureaucracy, the empty residential fields populated by outdated AutoReivs still performing their quotidian responsibilities, or a commercial shopping mall home to a mad doppelganger, many of these domes symbolize and, more importantly, simulate some element of human culture. It is necessary to note that these are all images of what Earth used to look like, which systemically break apart without order. Still, these last vestiges of a biologically engineered society engender that moment in time; it precedes the reality of the outside world. The artificial, in other words, has become the real, and to the good citizens of Ergo Proxy, indistinguishable from reality. The outside world has become in, Jean Baudrillard\u2019s words, \u201cthe desert of the real itself.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn The Precession of a Simulacra, Baudrillard also references Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s \u201cOn Exactitude in Science.\u201d An empire, so attuned with the art of cartography, produces a map of exact size and scale of itself. Succeeding generations, less enthusiastic of the map, discards it to the west, where it now lays in tatters. In similar fashion, the Proxy Project begins with a mass engineering of a worldwide experiment, which recreates pockets of human civilization in its old image. Inevitably, however, the very creators of the domes, many of them unsatisfied or driven by madness and self-loathing, discard their own works, where they now decay against the harsh winds of the wasteland. And thus, much like Borges ingrains in our memory not the empire, but rather the bizarre and ruined map of its territory, the domes of Ergo Proxy in all their systemic imperfections occupy our understanding of the end of civilization. They are, quite literally, proxies for reality.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two things to draw from this interaction of the real and the double. The first is to see how Ergo Proxy merges conceptions of dreams and reality to one meaningful abstraction. The second is to see how this relationship drives the show\u2019s search for purpose and existence.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a pervasive motif about dreams or dreamlike sequences, where characters are ensnared by a Proxy\u2019s powers. Many of the dreams feel real, and their contents often translate to the real world, as seen by the books in Anamnesis aboard the Centzontotochtin and the dome holding the animated characters from Pino\u2019s dream. On one hand, Ergo Proxy uses these dreams to elucidate the consciousness of the characters. For Vincent, it\u2019s his ontological question of who he is and if he exists in the world. For Pino, it\u2019s whether she possesses a soul and a capacity for morality. For Re-L, it\u2019s her timidity to approach the truth, in fear that it will upset the balance of her orderly existence.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, these sequences attempt to break down the characters\u2019 tenuous relationship with reality. The experiences of their dreams can overcome the experiences of the real. Vincent\u2019s admission of his identity as a Proxy is only cemented after his ethereal travels through the misty City Lights Bookstore. Pino\u2019s intuition from her dream overrides her companions\u2019 needs to stop for supplies. In both cases, these dreams, initiated by Proxies, have merged the surreal with the real to become a new sort of reality. Many within the world of the Ergo Proxy do not see any meaningful distinction between reality and a simulation of it precisely because the two have become one.\\n\\n\r\nAn exception to this is Re-L, who identifies her own dream as such. In Ophelia, Vincent is in a seemingly never ending cycle with a Proxy taking on every appearance but its own. Vincent is grateful that in the end, Re-L is capable of telling apart the impostor from himself. However, he quickly discovers that Re-L manages to differentiate Vincent from his double because she identifies that the impostor does not possess a shadow. For Vincent, however, this lack of distinction highlights his inability to come to terms with his identity. This slippery grasp of reality is a central conflict in Vincent's mind and is culminated in the final dream of the series, where Vincent is able to identify a fake world from the real, thus confirming his existence and place on Earth.\\n\\n\r\nThis dynamic between the bizarre and the normal, the dream and the real, and how they merge and separate is what gives Ergo Proxy\u2019s search for a raison d\u2019etre such a powerful poignancy. The reason is because inevitably we discover each of our main characters are themselves doubles of an original. Vincent and Re-L are copies of Proxy One and Monad, respectively. Pino is an alternative for a child. In addition, all three are failures of their original intention. Vincent never lives up to his potential as a model citizen, Re-L rejects the boring order of her grandfather\u2019s city and is cast aside for another clone of herself, while Pino is replaced by a newborn child.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, each character transcends his or her original place and assumes an agency over their own destinies, which allows them to overcome the destruction of Romdeau. They reject the artificiality of the order, and in doing so, also reject the simulated reality forced upon them thousands of years ago, when the desert of the real first came into being.\\n\\n\r\nIt is therefore fitting that those who survive to face the progenitors of Old Earth are dysfunctional copies, never meant to survive in the original system of waste and good citizenry. In a world completely artificial, here we have three souls: an amnesiac, a clone of a goddess, and an orphaned child, all of whom abandon their original duties to discover their reason for existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe word ergo is Latin for \u201ctherefore,\u201d while proxy refers to one who may stand to represent something. As the dark clouds recede from the heavens, and the light of a never before seen sun scorches Daedaelus\u2019s crafted wings, Vincent Law looks up and remarks that \u201cthis is the world that faces us, a world called \u2018reality.'\u201d He declares himself Ergo Proxy, an Agent of Death, and therefore, a representative for a new humanity.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is basically another puzzling, post-apocalyptic view of the future, which had the potential of being a superb show but there was way too much talk in this dreary show.\r\nThe first couple of episodes have a \"Ghost in the Shell\" feel to them, where only the setting is explained and not much is given away, forcing you to figure it out yourself. This show does a terrible job in it's explanations as it force feeds the viewer with so much jargon and it's only the illegal fansub version that will help it all make sense, with their notes.\r\nBeyond this problem there is a brilliantstory that focuses on three main characters: Vincent (an immigrant with a hazy past and something special about him), Re-l (a detective in search of the truth) and Pino (an infected auto-rave). It isn't long before these three superb characters are thrown into a journey of self discovery and the stuff they discover is interesting and does a great job in revealing the link between Vincent and the title of this show &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot;. In the midst of all this there are some spectacular action sequences however this occurs so rare that the show tends to get boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality of the anime is way above average with animation so great you wouldn't want to blink. The artistry is amazing having a mix of 2D animation, 3D modeling and CG that go so well together. The action sequences are what show the full effect of the amazing animation where so much detail is put into every frame and what makes it even better is the slow motion effect. The only issue can be crowds, as the character models tend to degrade in quality when dealing with a lot of people.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is basically a compilation of alternative music that goes well with the eerie, moody atmosphere. For people who are fans of bands like Linkin Park will definitely like the opening and ending theme that will get you involuntarily humming the tune.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a great show which had so much potential but with the lack of action, the superb animation does feel a bit wasted, plus there's all the winding talk. The 1st half of the show was done well but it did go downhill a bit in the 2nd half, where times when it's hard to tell if something is real or some kind of dream. There were also some incredibly stupid and weird episodes that attempts to be original but fails miserably. The show ends with some very confusing three episodes, which require a lot of thought to make any sense. So this anime is really just for people smart enough to understand its very obscure story and doesn't expect much from the action department.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I want to state a few things up front. I'm a former philosophy major and I still enjoy learning about academic philosophy. Pretentious is my first, last and middle name. I'm more than willing to defend the likes of Metal Gear Solid 2, Finnegans Wake and Beyond the Black Rainbow. You can't reach my levels of pretension if you tried. The depths of my tepid intellectual masturbation and pseudo-intellectualism have very little if any bounds. My inner fedora can't be breached by mere mortals. In my head where I am already a massive intellectual superstar they call me \"the sophist with the most wits.\" IfI had enough courage to leave the house, I'd be one of those guys that puts on a suit with a bowtie and reads large non-fiction books at Starbucks and stares pensively at the air through my square frame glasses and I would order coffee with no accoutrements so it can be black like my soul. That's my level of pretension kids. So let me say up front my problem with this show isn't that I got confused, I'm not the kind of person who gets confused by big words and unneeded complication I live for it. I mean I've read books by Hegel and Heidegger. You can't get much more needlessly complicated than that. I'm also not averse to a little pretension in my media, I tend to be more forgiving of this than most people, especially if the art or media in question has other merits. I have a kinship with intellectual failures like myself and fake gotta recognize fake yo. I also didn't mind the so called \"experimentation\" in fact as you'll come to see it would be hard for me to dislike it as I never really \"found\" it to begin with. I like experimentation in media a lot, if I'm asked to choose between two musical acts for instance I tend to choose the one that takes more risks with experimenting and genre mixing as a rule. So if this show lived up to it's common perception, it should be 10/10 IGN for a chap like me self, but it's not really like the negative stereotype of what it is and it's not really what the fans think it is either. I'm going to argue in the rest of this review that this show is just a basic action show with a weak story. \\n\r\nFor those not in the know, Ergo Proxy (EP) is a show about a post-apocalyptic future where a woman gets in a tussle with her robotic protector and some guy, then they go on a journey to some ruins and the story ends after they come back for the final boss fight. This is exactly how it happens, don't dispute it, just compute it. Some philosophy and psychological stuff is thrown in that we will go over later and some action happens in between. \\n\\n\r\nLets talk about what people say they like about this show and first I will discuss experimentation. The first and most fundamental way a piece of media can be experimental is to fundamentally change the format of the story entirely. By format I mean the basic framework around the story and the way you present it, outside of it's actually story content. Well this show doesn't really do anything concerning experimentation with this, in fact it's a straight linear line A to B plot. A show \"experimenting\" might tell things out of order, it might go extremely minimalist, it might go the opposite, it might try to transcend it's own media and or genre etc. It's hard to describe the lack of something and the positive of something vague like experimentation. That is the thing about experimentation, it's hard to describe on it's own but it's one of those things that \"you know it when you see it.\" I gave tangible examples but I recognize that in some ways these are already mundane and limited in their own sense and might be a bit clich\u00e9d by now in their own right. The main point I want to make is that EP doesn't really do anything with it's plot or format that warrants calling it \"experimentation.\" \\n\r\nYou know what this entire show is exactly like down to mundane details of it's plot, the way the story is told and look of the characters? The Big O. Oh I mean \"BIG O, BIG O, BIG O, BIG OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!.\" Only I never heard anyone call that show \"experimental.\" You have a mysterious domed city, with an outside that's mostly pollution, garbage and Sword Art Online DVD's. A mysterious pale female character that looks and acts like a robot with la faux geisha makeup at the same time. A male character who is strong and mysterious in his own way. If you paint the butler in Big O silver you also have the robot character, they're both even servants by nature. It's Big O without the mech and a lot of exposition. I think the easiest way to explain how mundane the format is, if I told someone to give me a plot outline of the story the way they lay it out wouldn't be any different from how the actual show laid things out, showing how easily digestible all the information and lack of so called experimental barriers to entry there are here. To finally nail down this point lets compare this to another show that has been called experimental as well and deals with similar themes and ideas Serial Experiments Lain. \\n\r\nYou have two shows that talk about the good aspects and the potential dangers of technology and philosophical concepts. Both attempt to delve into psychology and peoples sense of self to varying degrees of success. I don't think Lain is a super deep show either, but what I can say about it that I can't say about EP is that by the end of the series the show hardly looks like the same show that is was from episode 1. At some point in the mid series things go way off the rails and the shows animation and editing attempt to reflect some of the concepts they're trying to get across here, without just stating them outright through exposition. The format changes a lot in Lain and I can't say they just told me an A-B story. It also leaves a lot more to interpretation, due in part to it's more heavy reliance on imagery rather than words but also just from the way it's told. EP by contrast looks, is edited and has the same mid paced action animation all throughout the show. It makes no attempt to tie it's animation to the concepts it's trying to get across, unless fists equal philosophical arguments. Well in fairness to Ergo, I did want to punch a few people upon hearing their philosophical beliefs, but I wouldn't say this translated into my own argument unless I was arguing might makes right. I guess Thrasymachus missed his calling as an Anime creator. So the editing isn't experimental, the animation isn't experimental, the way the story is told is not fundamentally different from most shows, so what is? I would like to know that myself. \\n\r\nYou wanna know a little secret that isn't that much of a secret about getting people to care about what you write? You include a little sex or violence. Totem and Taboo, Survival and reproduction. We instinctually feel an importance for this stuff because we're walking talking cell machines that feel the need to survive long enough to make copies of ourselves. So anything that involves danger or potentially doing the nasty makes us care because we want to learn to avoid one and get a lot of the other, I'll let you choose which. What If I didn't want to be cheap though, what if I wanted to engage people in intellectual ideas in a way that was new and yet still exciting? Well the first thing I wouldn't do is make it an action show, because we have seen that a million times before. I definitely wouldn't call a show that did things this way experimental in fact I would call it rudimentary for it's time and place.  There are two essential basic defaults for anime right now as I see it, la tranche de vie and le show d'action. These are the first person shooters of anime and by that I mean they're the type of thing made most because marketing trends and ease of understanding dictate that this is what consumers want you to give them to imbibe like drone bees circling the hive cluster. Action ticks off that survival part of our brain and makes us feel an immediate emotion, so it is easy to make and its easy to get people to feel good about it and engaged. I'm saying all this for two reasons one is to illustrate that making this show action oriented detracts from the idea that it is \"experimental\" by virtue of the fact that action is an extremely easy and common genre to appeal to mass audiences with and two, to set you up to ask a question. Strip away all supposed psychological and philosophical window dressing from this show for a second and ask yourself this: Is this show fundamentally different from just a plain action show without these pretenses? Can you find anything about it that really warrants you saying it is more \"experimental\" than other shows of this genre? For my part I saw these as fundamental questions for this review and my answer was \"no\" to both of them. There is nothing about EP that makes me think it's any different from the hundreds of other action shows out there.  Couple this with the fact that a lot of anime shows have similar post apocalyptic and science fiction leanings that are much better utilized. I would argue that this show and others would actually be more \"experimental\" if they went the more common route and made a slice of life anime about deep psychological and philosophical things. There have already been a lot of action shows that dip into these themes but the amount of slice of life shows that attempt to be experimental and thought provoking can be counted on one hand or less. At the end of the day most if not all of these shows are a product to sell figurines and make you feel good for an hour or so, but even when faced with the dichotomy of the two most common shows to appeal to the lowest common denominator viewer EP zagged hard and fast towards the easier more tread upon genre to do this with. So in going action it dilutes it's so called experimentation even that little bit much more. \\n\r\nPeople say this show mixes genres, but I don't really see it. It's essentially post apocalyptic sci-fi and in that genre its a pretty standard unimaginative use of the tropes and cliches therein. In it's slight defense it's kind of hard to mix genres when your baseline is post apocalyptic sci-fi, if you try to mix in any genre that isn't primarily about depressive atmospheric and heightened negative emotions you end up with a bad muted tone that nerfs what's appealing about this kind of fiction. In other words you wind up with a Bethesda Fallout, when I'm trying to make something serious like New Vegas. While we're on the subject of this show and it's genre, I would like to note that this show is pretty scant on the \"science\" in the science fiction equation. It doesn't really introduce any kind of cool technological innovations or ideas we haven't seen before and it doesn't have scientific concepts at the core of it's story telling. I mean I'm a philosophy fanboy but you have to have some of this in your Sci-Fi show kids.                            \\n\r\nSo maybe in lieu of that you're probably hoping the content of the story is experimental. Yeah... Not so much. Everything is pretty easy to understand. It's complicated the way things like \"Inception\" are complicated in that if you don't listen to every piece of stated exposition with a little bit of brain power you might get lost. If you don't listen to what the people say because you have your cellphone out or you're playing sex VN's in another window, you'll be confused. Everything in this show is so spelled out that I find it really hard to believe anyone actually had a hard time following this. I'd like to use this review as a soapbox and show my humongous epeen knowledge on philosophy and how this show gets it wrong with all of my \"ACTUUAAAALKLLKYS\" but the reality is that the references to philosophy are window dressing at best and just nonexistent for most of the show. Some talking statues are named after philosophers... I'm not exactly sure why, they never really do anything philosophical. I mean one scene where they do logic tables, have a Socratic debate or use hermeneutics would have done wonders and saved this show... Ok so in all seriousness. I didn't really expect them to do that kind of stuff. I think they were trying to imply these AI statues were like philosopher kings, but at least a few of the philosophers listed had no political thought to speak of and a lot of them would not advise the things done by the shows society. In some cases it would be much better and much worse. I'd like to see how a Late Wittgensteinian society would contrast with an early Wittgensteinian society. Yeah actually animators would just go the lazy route and make the early stuff all about an extreme rules governed society like Chinese Legalism but worse. Or how a Derridean society would look like prior to his later romance with Marx and after. One can only imagine such a glorious anomic end to the dialectic of \"free trade.\" I mean wouldn't we all like to see what a Foucauldian society would look like? I can just imagine the non-stop Bacchanalia and the glorious never ending bath houses. Power would truly be radiating out of my every pore and other bodily openings, now that's what I call bio-politics... Alas we get nothing close to this small amount of imagination. It's a standard futuristic society with some marble statues and stuff here and there. \\n\r\nLet's look at the characters and the perception that they have psychological depth. Psychological depth can mean a few things in fiction. The most obvious thing it can mean to me is that the creators are trying to emulate the findings in current or past psychological movements and infusing their works with them like Freudianism in Hitchcock films, Jungian in Kubrick, mild parodies of behaviorism in Kurt Vonnegut, Existential-psych in French New Wave films ETC. Maybe you want psychological realism in the actions of your characters like Yasujiro Ozu or maybe you like heightened fairy tale archetypes like Akira Kurosawa. Have I dropped enough names yet? Well anyway, the point of all these examples is that generally when I hear something has psychological depth I tend to think of examples like this where the creators gave their characters depth by having specific types of psychology or ideas in mind when making them, they may even include a mix of some of these things. Like maybe one character represents a classic Freudian outlook on life and the intrigue comes from them making contact with someone with a more modern take on psychologies outlook like through evolutionary psych or cognitive behavioral. I think I belabored the point enough on this definition and you can basically get what I'm saying now the characters can have or be used to represent these psychological ideas in their basic makeup. Ok, so good onto the next definition. The second definition is the more common one, that I assume most people praising this show think of when they talk about it and that definition is something akin to \"they have a long back story therefore I think them interesting.\" To be charitable to this definition it can also mean that they have interesting tidbits and tadbits to their characters shown in the past, like a linear psychological bread crumb trail of trauma, pain, good times and angry stuff here and there. I can like stories that engage in either definition and most literature is a combination of both, but I don't really think EP fits either well. I don't really find these characters interesting at all. They have about as much depth as a Naruto character, but with a heavy facade blanketed over them to give the appearance that they matter more. They go through formulaic arcs and commit clich\u00e9d action after clich\u00e9d action. I mean I have a whole section just dedicated to that right here:\\n\\n\r\nIf I'm allowed to make one bold assumption here about peoples high estimation of this anime and what I think is their false impression that this is an \"unorthodox\" show is that it seems like and this is where the assumption comes in friendos, that a lot of anime fans are insularly only into this one thing. Anime and mango seems to be an all encompassing hobby and in a lot of anime communities here and elsewhere I have noticed a tendency for people who are into it to not be into most other types of media. Some of this seems to be snobbery but there is also a basic fact of reality, not everyone is a loser like me who can sit and take in tons of different crap from different types of media, so people naturally stick with what they're interested in. If I can give this a generous spin I would say most of you are specialists and not generalists. Well I'm the opposite I'm the jack of no trades and I can't review things in isolation, I see things as so interconnected that I can't quite stop myself from thinking of other media in reference to each other ever. \\n\r\nFOR INSTANCE gals and guys, people like to play up this shows \"dream sequences,\" but having seen a lot of western shows and they seem pretty standard for television as a media. A lot of shows have an episode that essentially doesn't connect to the plot in a direct way but hints at it and points towards future developments within context of a dream. The most famous example I can think of is the ending of the 4th season of Buffy, a lot of episodes of Scrubs, a few Doctor Who's and countless Star Trek episodes where characters realize they were hung up on a dream. This isn't really experimental it's damn near a cliche that just hasn't been coined yet. How about \"dreamsposition?\" In fact this review is a dream sequence, a hallucination, brought on by drugs and your own self hatred. I'm your inner nagging doubts, now you just need to spout some vague exposition to me so we can move the plot and this review forward. \\n\r\nIn reading other reviews I saw one phrase over and over and over and that was \"this anime explores what it means to be human.\" I no joke heard a Hallmark movie described the same way in a commercial once, for those who don't live in the states Hallmark movies are just slightly above a soap opera in overall quality and I've said the phrase \"it's Hallmark tier\" to describe the low quality of a film before. I'm not surprised people use this phrase though, because exploring \"what it means to be human\" is one of the criterion of something being Literature. Which also means that like everything else in this section, it's been done before <History of writing here.> Yeah I really don't feel the need to cite single examples on this one as it is done so much that it would actually be easier to list things that tried not to do this while still telling a story in some way. I think what people specifically mean with this phrase in reference to this show is that the contrast between machine people and regular people is compared a bit here, but even when I narrow it down to that level the absolute deluge of stuff that exists also doing that and doing it better pours in hard and fast.  I just want to toot my own horn a bit that this review is an exploration of what it means to be human and by that I mean myself and through me all humanity. It is a mado to my psyche and further a fenetre to the worlds soul. \\n\r\nAnother way in which I think this plays out is in peoples constant citing of the \"you're your own worst enemy\" trope as some kind of deep revelation in this. I think the first time I ever saw this trope in action was in a really famous Manga called the Holy Bible. Not to be confused with the more popular anime adaption Bible Black. Jesus realizes on the cross that his own inherent selfish desires and sin are what might mire him in hell for all eternity if he can't escape his own predilection towards temptation. In other words he is his own worst enemy. Lilith is best girl by the way. In a little obscure film series called STAR WARS, a character named Luke in a galaxy far far away has to go through \"training\" by Yoda to learn about his force sensitivity. Some of this training involves a cave, at the end of his small journey in this cave one of the most famous scenes in cinematic history occurs and he realizes he is his own potential worst enemy. In the David Bowie song \"The Man Who Sold the World\" I gotta spoiler to lay flat on you here, he is the villain in his own song and the titular man who sold the world. He slowly realizes this after the years and years that he roamed and then it came as some surprise he is one and the same his savior and his own worst enemy. At least two Twilight Zone episodes, The Shelter and The Monsters are Due on Maple Street have this same message. In my own lifetime I remember seeing this idea as early as Zelda 2: An Adventure of Link. We have met the enemy ladies and gentlemen and it is us and are easy cliches. I think the Bowie example is the best illustration that this idea isn't that deep, but even in just a four minute song, he managed to do a lot more with than this show did with an entire television show. Thus was the power of the late great Ziggy Stardust. Like a neko from Japan, oh he could lick 'em by smiling. You know, I'm writing this when I could be doing more important things with my life, I eat all the wrong foods, I procrastinate at a level previously not believed possible by mere mortals and I never try to fix any of the major problems with my life. I just realized I am my own worst enemy, I was the villain all along. It was me who caused my own unhappiness all these years. My god how am I going to live with this revelation? I'm literally and figuratively hyperventilating right now, I think I might be having a heart attack. Someone call an ambulance.... OMG I... I-i close my eyes and seize it, I clench my fists and beat it, I light my torch and burn it, I am the beast I worship! \\n\\n\r\n.....\\n\\n\r\nActually, I already knew all this, back to the review. So the last clich\u00e9d arc is a character conveniently having amnesia and we have seen this a thousand times... Well I forgot what I was going to say so lets move on. \\n\r\nThis isn't really a cliche but... People like to cite this shows use of Blade Runner's ideas as ground breaking as well, but I also see this as pretty standard in eastern and western media. Pretty much everything science fiction tries to be Blade Runner and if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be 2001: A Space Odyssey. Pretty much everything tries to be Akira and if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be Neon Genesis Evangelion. Pretty much everything tries to be Ghost in the Shell if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be Serial Experiments Lain. Pretty much everything tries to be Bubble Gum Crisis if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be Paprika. Pretty much everything tries to be Snatcher if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be Xenogears. Pretty much everything tries to be Synthwave if they aren't it's probably because they're trying to be IDM. Pretty much everything tries to be- Sorry I got stuck on a tape loop there for a second, but I'm sure you get the point. I think specifically in Akira's case you can argue it was trying to be both Blade Runner and 2001 at the same time, while juggling it's own themes, ideas and other influences. Much like how this review is a dream sequence, an exploration of humanity and I realized I'm my own worst enemy within it's confines, it is also a cyberpunk neo-noir thriller. The reviews soundtrack was made by Vangelis. I'm a special police officer that might be a cyborg who is sent to track down rogue replicant anime reviewers from the MAL corporation who escaped the offworld forums. We are tasked with capturing them and if necessary to execute them. This is not called execution, as they had no life to begin with. We call this special police unit knife sprinters. My robotic girlfriend looks like a sophisticated Bettie Page and I dream of My Little Pony unicorns and electric rams when I sleep. Wake up, time to cry. \\n\r\nYou may have got annoyed from me inserting all these cheap plot points haphazardly into this review and to that I say \"good,\" because that is how I felt the entire time watching EP. Absolutely sick of every bad cliche, lame plot point and cheap character arc being inserted into the wrong places limply like a shaky hand on a first date. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I move on here, I want to anticipate a potential defense of this show and the criticisms I have leveled at it so far. After reading all this someone might scream \"Simpsons did it\" implying I don't know that most ideas are not new and that everything has been done before. Every idea is a package of other ideas that already exists. Nothing is invariant or comes wholly out of nowhere. I don't believe in divine inspiration or intervention, so ideas can only come from already known human sources, filtered through our collective knowledge. This is all true, but my problem isn't just that this stuff has been done before, it's that it ultimately doesn't culminate into anything interesting or worth watching. This show is just a muddled mess of ideas and influences and far from doing something interesting with them it just kind of tosses them all into a vat without properly mixing it or wondering if any of the stuff should go together in the first place. The philosophy is badly strewn window dressing, the characters aren't that deep upon any kind of critical examination and there isn't really anything that distinguishes this from any other action anime. \\n\r\nI also bring all of the above up to slowly erode the idea that this show is more \"experimental\" or thought provoking than other shows like it.\\n\r\nI also want to consider something before moving on and explain how I really want to be fair to something like this even though it might not seem that way given my review. I can only really know my own enjoyment and level engagement with something, but I also try like most people to imagine a fairer third person viewpoint when possible. Maybe this isn't \"deep\" enough or whatever for me but is it a good slick entry level piece of fiction concerning the ideas for others? My answer to that is also no, it doesn't really engage or lay out the ideas in a way that would give the viewer a good idea of philosophy or psychology. I think even Full Metal Alchemist does a better job explaining the fictional practices of alchemy better than this show does the real life practice of philosophy. Let's consider for a moment though that this show was a good representation of Phil and Psych 101 ideas. I wouldn't write up a review like this for the anime equivalent of Sesame Street, Blue's Clues and Dora the Explorer and laugh about how people who watch these don't even know basic arithmetic and reading skills. I MEAN WHAT ARE THEY CHILDREN OR SOMETHING? A SONG ABOUT READING A MAP HOW DUMB ARE YOU? I'm cruel but I'm not unkind. If I thought this show was good for it's own sake and a fairly accurate depiction of the ideas within, I would simply say \"it's not for me\" and move on. I'd hope people learn from it and feel entertained and engaged enough to further research the ideas, but I wouldn't feel a need to review this my self. The problem is the show isn't billed as some introductory work to the subject nor is it aimed at lay watchers and it's defended by people as if it's one of the intellectual heights of anime. So that is why I feel a need to tear this down and also because I'm just a jerk with too much time on his hands. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just about average for it's time. It looks a lot like other shows of it's era only with more shadows and darkness/dark colors added in. To give it some credit the action is pretty good for what it is. The female lead is nicely designed and she is used well for what the show tries to get across. Her face in particular is nicely crafted and interesting for it's own sake, she shows more emotion than a lot of anime characters in shows like this, so her minimalist design wasn't completely without merit. I also like the robots unique design. I guess I can also say that this show doesn't go extremely cheap in the sex department at any point, all the characters look the way they should given the context they're in and there isn't any obvious cheap fanservice stuff I can remember. I think in general while it's animation isn't anything to write home about it has the highest peaks of quality out of all the shows assets. \\n\r\nThis is another show I'm reviewing where the music went in one ear and out the other and I don't really have anything of note to say about it or the voice acting. I'm always kind of amused at how much people seem to care about voice actors in anime and how they generally don't leave any impression on me at all. I'd like to say it's a cultural thing but I've seen a lot of Japanese films and I generally think they are tied with the UK for having the best live actors. So I'm not sure that's it. Hmmmmmmm, something i have to think about I guess. Anyway, I just don't really have anything to say about the sound in this show. \\n\\n\r\nYou know this show reminded me of a deeper disappointment I have with film as a media but animation in particular. I think animation could be employed well to illustrate some intellectual ideas that aren't well described with words. The closest I have seen to what I'm trying to describe are terrible movies like Baraka and Koyaanisqatsi, where images and music are employed to try and get across a bigger intellectual idea without words. The only problem is the few times this is attempted the ideas they get across are as shallow as a wading pool. OMG NATURE CONTRASTS WITH HUMAN CIVILIZATION? DATS CRAZY DEW... I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT LIKE DAT. If only I hadn't been spoiled with that incredibly deep message with Fern Gully when I was five. Granted these films have other merits like the moving forward of filming techniques, editing and cinematography. The point is I'd like experimentation and intellectual motifs to go much much further than what I have seen in most animation. Go really abstract and off the wall. I mean beyond FlatLand levels. Like the Talking Head's I want you to stop making sense and start making abstract and creative choices that go far beyond what we have today.  I didn't get any of this with EP, I got a bland action show. So I said this review was influenced by Blade Runner so here it's only fitting I end this like a true cyborg cut down before his time... *Rain falling everywhere.* I've imagined animation you people wouldn't believe. Anime warships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I've seen \"glistening\" figurines in a neckbeards estate. All these inane complaints about media will be lost in time now... Like poorly animated tears.. In the rain...\\n",

            "content": "Title: Ergo Proxy\r\nManga, Anime: Ergo Proxy does have a two-volume spinoff illustrated by Yumiko Harao, the final volume of which was released on February 19th, 2007.  What it's about, I'm not sure, as there's not a lot of information about it.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nErgo Proxy is a 23-episode series that was created by Studio Manglobe (also famous for their work on Samurai Champloo) and directed by Shukuo Murase (famous for his work on Witch Hunter Robin).  It ran on Japanese TV from February 26th to August 12th, 2006.  Ergo Proxy has been licensed Stateside by Geneon (nowdefunct), and its sixth and final volume was released Stateside on September 25th, 2007.\\n\\n\r\nStory: This is going to be a doozie.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy kicks off in the domed city of Romdeau (possibly Engrish for London?), a city-state whose citizens are under a system of complete micromanagement, focusing on Re-L (or Lil, or Real, it depends on who you talk to, really) Mayar, an inspector for the government, and her Autoreiv (more or less robot) partner, Iggy.  Re-L is tasked with investigating murder cases that have to do with the Autoreiv virus Cogito (which more or less makes them self-aware and has varying effects), which leads her to recent immigrant Vincent Law, and Pino, a companion-type Autoreiv.  At about the same time, she is attacked by an unknown, monstrous, humanoid-like creature called a Proxy, after she finds the word &quot;Awakening&quot; written in red on her bathroom wall.  All of this combines to draw her further into the case and further into the mysteries of Romdeau and the outside world.\\n\\n\r\n...Honestly, it's hard to write a review for this show.  I finished it at the end of last month, and I've been holding off on reviewing it, mainly because I've been struggling to find the right things to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story started out good.  The characters were intriguing and tolerable (except in the case of Re-L, who was something of a bitch, but still, you could stand her), and Pino was the cutest damn thing I've ever seen, and you wanted to see what was up with them.  There were mysteries and they were intriguing, and you kept watching to find out what the hell was going on, and things were revealed that only begat more mysteries that were intriguing that you wanted to know more about.  And it was all good and well.\\n\\n\r\nThen, after the halfway point, Ergo Proxy began to fall apart.  \\n\\n\r\nBefore this point, the writers decided to have many episodes take place in peoples' heads, so that you couldn't tell whether the entire episode had actually happened or not, or whether or not it actually had any bearing on what was going on.  I thought this was just a phase, but that turned out to not be the case.  You really couldn't tell what was going on during these episodes -- I had a friend who was, shall we say, not sober watching this with me, and even he couldn't figure out what the hell was going on (up till then, he had been able to do it).  It really frustrated me, because this felt like a waste of the show's amazing potential.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the show did what I always fear might happen in this situation, and pulled a Rozen Maiden, refusing to address any of the mysteries it had spent so much time building up, and kept on building up more and more mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the story was depressing enough already, but then it took turns into just plain creepy, and that didn't help its case at all.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of it all, it rivaled Rozen Maiden for the things it left untouched, and Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament for the way it rather clumsily concluded things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the second half of the show left a really bitter taste in my mouth.  And it hurts to say that, because this show had SO much potential, and came so highly recommended to me by people on here who I really respect, and mainly for the story, too.  \\n\\n\r\nLooking at my favorite episodes for this series is really telling, as of the eight that I really liked in this series, seven of them came before the halfway point (about episode fourteen or fifteen), and only one came from after that.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it does win some points back for its use of obscure references to literature and mythology and several other things.  And for Pino, who is the cutest damn thing ever, without being annoying.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this series is absofuckinglutely beautiful.  The animation is amazingly smooth, and the 2D merges beautifully with the 3D, to the point where it's difficult to differentiate between the two.  The character designs are absolutely amazingly and beautifully done, especially (and for the record, I maintain that Re-L's design is based off of Amy Lee of Evanesence).  There's overwhelmingly darker, bleaker tones used here, but it works really well with the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, props for them getting the style right in a later episode, which is more or less a parody of Disney, and closely mimicks Disney's animation techniques.\\n\\n\r\nNo problems here.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: I honestly didn't notice the background music for this series.  I'm currently in the process of finding the two OSTs, so I may update this later.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm really happy with the OP and ED.  The OP was done by a Japanese rock group, sung in all English, and really good English, too.  The ED is Radiohead's &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;.  If you don't know this song, you are a failure to the human race and need to go and find it and listen to it.  NOW.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Sanae Kobayashi (Eleanor Campbell in Victorian Romance Emma and Lucy/Nyuu in Elfen Lied) has a role in this, which was really nice.  Otherwise, no other voices that I recognize, and good acting, all around.\\n\\n\r\nLength: I honestly think that Ergo Proxy could've done to cut out maybe four or five episodes.  Perhaps some of the mind-fucks that didn't really serve to do anything besides screw with your head.  Either that, or rework those episodes so that they at least take care of some of the mysteries.  \\n\\n\r\nAny longer and I probably would've dropped it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: An amazing story that starts out good, but falls apart by the time the end comes around, whose length probably could've been toyed with, but, to its credit, has beautiful animation, solid seiyuu and a good OP/ED.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9\\n\r\nLength: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 41/50; 82% (B )",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy, it's a darker show that makes you think. Don't fall asleep for a second watching this show or you'll miss something important. Every little detail matters in some way. You know what... I LOVE THIS SHOW! I will do my best to keep my fanboy attitude towards this show aside to make for a more professional review.\r\nSTORY:\r\nErgo Proxy takes place in a post apocalyptic setting where mankind must live inside domed cities. They are all assisted in their everyday lives by AuroReivs which are autonomous robots. In the city of Romdo there is a virus infecting the AutoReivs that cause them to becomeaware of their own existence. It is called the Cogito Virus. Re-l Mayer is the lead investigator of the infected AutoReivs. During her investigation she encounters a monster called a Proxy. Also in Romdo, a man named Vincent Law is running about and is suspected of having a connection with the Proxy. Re-l and Vincent then though a series of events begin to travel in in the outside world searching for answers. \\n\\n\r\nSound confusing? Good you should be confused, but it is also a great setup for a story. Right off the bat you are introduced to a new world, and in that world you see problems that need to be solved. The plot starts off right from the get go which I like. It grabs your attention; however, sometimes the pacing can get slowed down, but the amount of things you are learning about the world makes it seem like the writers aren't just writing filler even though that's exactly what it is. This story is a work of art. Ergo Proxy is the example of how to setup a world and maximize the potential that is in said world. It was also depressing as hell at sometimes and made me want to sit in my room and be sad. Now I mentioned confusing at the beginning, and it's true the story can be confusing, but I never felt lost during the show which is good and there was a reason for me not being lost...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nOur main Protagonists are Re-l Mayer, a police detective/inspector and Vincent Law, an immigrant/nobody. Oh and Pino who is an AutoReiv infected with the Cogito Virus. The characters are what make this show's story less of a nightmare to understand. They ask all the questions that you want to ask. Personally I think that Re-l is by far the best character in the whole show. Her world has be turned upside-down and she has to tag along to find answers with Vincent. Vincent to be honest has a crap life, he can't remember who he is and was run out of Romdo. He is searching for who he is. The chemistry between these two is what really makes them stand out as characters. They aren't all buddy buddy like many shows. Re-l didn't trust Vincent at all at the beginning and Vincent wanted to just be around Re-l. Pino is hard to talk about without spoiling some plot but her purpose to me is making the viewer ask \"What does it mean to truly be alive?\" \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art is good. Nothing that just blows you out of the water but it does a very good job at bringing you into the atmosphere of the show. I loved the character designs in this show too. Their aren't very many action scenes in the show but when their are they are done very well. I have no complaints about the animation. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nOHHH MY GOD THAT OPENING!!!! \"Kiri\" by Monoral is absolutly PERFECT for this shows opening! I've bought that song and no joke I listen to it every single day it is that good! I loved it. I'm also a fan of Radiohead so I liked the ending. The music during the show I actually didn't notice at all.... that's kinda bad but I also never remember the show being silent so that's good. The dub for this show is outstanding. I have no idea how Megan Hollingshead doesn't have more lead roles. She did an outstanding job as Re-l. Liam O'Brien also deserve high praise as well for his job as Vincent. At the beginning I actually thought he was Sam Riegel, but then Vincent got mad an I thought \"Yep that's Liam.\" His angry voice is very good as is his regular voice. I actually thought that Pino was voiced by a child, but nope it was Rachel Hirschfeld... yea never heard of her but DAMN is she good! I mean seriously GIVE HER MORE ROLES!!! This dub is one of the best I have ever heard, on par with that of Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nENDING:\\n\r\nIf you've seen my reviews you know what I do here. Does Ergo Proxy seal the deal at the end? Or does it leave massive plot holes? Nope. It ends perfectly in my opinion, I was very satisfied with the ending because it left the viewer with an idea of what the characters will do after the series, but it also makes sure to wrap everything up nicely. It ends well which is what I like to see anime do.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nErgo Proxy as of December 27, 2013, is the greatest anime that I have ever watched. If you have not seen Ergo Proxy, you have to see this anime. It truly is a masterpiece, a modern classic. Ergo Proxy is a show that can not be missed no matter what your preferred genre of anime is. Ergo Proxy is one of a kind. I give it a 100% recommendation. Ergo Proxy is a work of art.",

            "content": "Ambition in an audio-visual work can generally focus itself on artistical visual or sound-related features only, while the foundation in terms of plot is rather simple, or tries to define itself in terms of quality by touching upon more complex, indefinite questions about e.g. the human nature itself, not being covered in a lot of works, not being followed through that deeply regarding its core theme or not being covered in that big of a quantity of related questions/topics towards the main one the work tries to tackle. While it\u2019s hard to classify Ergo Proxy between example #2 and #3, I might have to makethe point that Proxy leans more towards the third than the second. Maybe even solely due to the reason, that it constructs severally different presentational approaches, ranging from character introspection in the said person\u2019s mind to cartoon-ish, dream-like sequences, merging it all into one bucket. And related to that, I simply can\u2019t get out of my way to say this: On several occasions, it feels more messy than anything else, especially in its middle section.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Proxy didn\u2019t set itself up the easiest task to begin with, as it has been making clear right from the beginning that it wants to cover a whole lot in a way that could\u2019ve required 13 episodes to fully follow-through a singular theme or start-off question that has been touched upon at the start. But concerning this, I\u2019m surprisingly not part of either \"go-to\" group for the title itself, which almost reaches the dust of controversy that has been dispersed by Evangelion in terms of split reception among the Anime community, while of course not being quite as popular. It\u2019s neither an Anime that use the group of elitist scoundrels \u00a9 to show their superiority while circle-jerking a show that basically offers nothing they preach about in the first place or an animated masterpiece that transcends the medium in terms of complexity and execution. It sure gets very entangled in its own ideas, judging by the sheer amount of topic it touches upon, but as good as the diversity in theme exploration and presentation might sound on paper, it gives off the overwhelming feeling of suffocating its initial strengths and start-up plotline the first episodes introduced. Expressing this might be a bit difficult, but I\u2019m trying to keep this as spoiler-free as possible and I\u2019ll try to add some general ideas about storytelling as a whole to support these statements. As a result bit more focused on the criticism than on the aspects the show actually gets right for the most part, since I think these have already been covered in way more detail than its negatives, however, I\u2019ll make sure to throw a reasonable amount of positive factors in during this write-up.\\n\\n\r\nWith Proxy\u2019s setup, there\u2019s almost nothing to not love as a fan of futuristically dystopian prospects, a category in which I\u2019d count me in for sure. In the forlorn city of Romdeau, we follow the story of the state-serving investigator Re-L and a man who recently immigrated to the city, Vincent Law, and how they\u2019re being confronted with the rising spread of a \u2018cogito virus\u2019, which seemingly infects Auto-Reivs, not even stopping at the personal assistants of a notable amount of citizens in Romdeau (Entourages), turning them against their owner, enforcing them to commit the final act of killing against human beings themselves. With mysterious beings, called \u201cProxies\u201d, said to be around the infected Auto-Reivs when these crimes are happening, Re-L, her Entourage Iggy and Vincent Law get entangled in a conspiracy, that shakes the foundation of Romdeau and those of the main characters to the core, as it is being made apparent by our investigator\u2019s virtually epiphanic encounter with the \u2018Ergo Proxy\u2019 at the end of episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nWhat might\u2019ve been made pretty obvious by my part, due to the last part of this rather vague summarization of Proxy\u2019s setup, is how the narrative focus shifts from a more political-emphasized lens, to straight up character/idealistic introspection with related ideas of breaking the invisible wall that cages one\u2019s individual ability to think. The initiation for the characters to take that pebbly way of \u201cself-discovery\u201d might have diverged a little for each person, willingly putting themselves in the unforgivingly dangerous world that surrounds Romdeau. For our main duo, they were set-up reasonably well and grounded and are deductible by the way their personas affect their behaviorism during the growing conflict between them and their environment. The significant repel from Romdeau towards Re-L and Vincent, be it either the inequity imposed by Romdeau, caused by seemingly supernatural events Vincent has to suffer through in the starting episodes, or the apathy and incomprehension showed by the apparatus of the state and her granddad, the regent himself, them joining up for a risky quest for answers got itself the right groundwork to be one of the amazing tales ever told in the medium. However, even if the episodic exploration of different themes and ideas is one of my favourite ways to elaborate upon them, Proxy left with a sour taste in that exact section after watching through it. It would be a long shot to call it inherently bad, very far from it, but I\u2019d much rather call it: indecisive. But more regarding that later.\\n\\n\r\nConnecting with Vincent semi-forcefully expel from Romdeau and Re-L\u2019s hunt for more leads and info regarding the mysterious and very confined matter surrounding \u2018Vincent Law\u2019, the show takes the unexpected episodic approach, which actually feels rather jarring from what we\u2019ve seen from the starting 3-4 episodes beforehand. It\u2019s a bit hard to get used to and hard to call very good either. Of course, with strictly referring to them as \u201cfiller-episodes\u201d and the more cohesively presented ones as the main-plot, missing the point is unavoidable, but that doesn\u2019t stop numerous of these to either feel a bit overdone and, surprisingly, pretty stale. Those two impressions don\u2019t go hand in hand all the time, counter-acting the believe that it\u2019s incompetent in what it\u2019s doing entirely, but there\u2019s a rarity of episodes I\u2019d call both, a lot of episodes I\u2019d call one of them and some episodes I\u2019d call neither.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the start-off for Re-L\u2019s journey is very reminiscent of bad political movie clich\u00e9s (\u201cYou\u2019re ignoring me because I get to the heart of the matter\u201d), got paced out a little too fast and showing too little hindrance for what she\u2019s trying to do, it still works and isn\u2019t shifted with much of a focus upon either, more of a mean to justify in what it will expand to. The plot progression is ridden by a summation of minor conveniences in the first quarter of it, which are not to be taken too lightly considering the serious and still coherently narrated route it set itself up. Opportunities presenting each other on a plate for Re-L, hacking a computer in 5 seconds while her interviewer makes no efforts to lock the confidential data in it while leaving shortly etc. Also, the rather one-sided affection Vincent develops in a total runtime of 60 minutes towards Re-L should have been developed of more apparently graspable moments, since it should be deductible in that short of runtime in the starting-phase to not feel a tad forced, especially since it doesn\u2019t get that much of a focus for a long period of time later. The concluding episodes did erase half of my initial complaints about this since it gave this aspect a somewhat satisfying conclusion, but from a watching-experience standpoint, it still does strike me as a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSuccessfully changing one's general approach of storytelling is a big risk with (more or less) great reward if executed right and while saying this, Proxy takes a turn for the more experimental in the early-mid section of it and in the same vein, sadly a turn for the worse initially. It constructs several approaches and a big variety on how to tackle it in terms of audiovisuals while giving further insight into its several ideas revolving about identity itself. In numerous episodes, it takes a turn for the surreal and usually follows them up with ones which ensure its \u201cusual recipe\u201d of the tried-and-tested storytelling, shown in the first couple of episodes. Additionally, we get episodes with a lot of expositional dialogue regarding one single matter, creating a lot of routes regarding presentation, but actually master none of them, as the contrast between two consecutive episodes can be mood-killing or actually responsible for one not coming up in the first place. While some of these are enjoyable as a standalone, the setup of Proxy doesn\u2019t allow such an eclectic way of mixing storytelling-techniques that easily, especially with it lacking a distinctive identity (pretty ironic) and more refined directing, making it to feel slightly devoid of life and simultaneously a tad insipid at the same time. Additionally, these constructed narrations do feel to feed the viewer a very different amount of information, contrary to the belief that people who dislike it just need to be taken by the hand through the story. No, the show switches from explaining already pretty evident facts in a very convoluted way that can even make up the runtime of a whole episode at points (episode #11), to hit you with hardly explained turns of events in the next one. Of course there\u2019s value in some of these lines which come from an overflow of dialogues that way, but there\u2019s this overarching feeling of they trying to ramble 20 minutes about and actually trying to waste your time when not trying to *insert meaning* in every line of this oversaturated dialogue. There\u2019s even a minor and easy to miss instance of a clear message of \u201cdeath of the author\u201d in episode #10 (the script writer's name on a tombstone), which actually is kinda infuriating, because the next episode is exactly the one which is obviously raising a question and follows up to answer it in an excessively long way.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to my rambling about episode 11 in particular, there are not that many episodes meeting that said criticism in such a strong way, but most of them only do so rudimentarily. In what almost all episodes do lack though is impressive directing, which actually could complement the well-planned scenes on paper, I more often than not thought to myself, that this was the primary reason of why I actually found the atmosphere not sparking over, even during good scene montages. The visuals have a distinctively dark tone and with more audio-visual competency, they could\u2019ve capitalized on that particular aspect of lifelessness greatly like Texhnolyze, but only came off as a decently pictured, dark Anime set in a dystopian future with cool \u201cDeus Ex\u201d-esque soundtracks playing in the background. Especially during action-scenes, the lack of distinctively cut-out audio-visual focus to create a thrilling composition and maybe a budget-restriction partly causing that is kind of detrimental, as there are some of those especially in the first half (people looking like matchsticks flying around during the Proxy chase in the shopping center). It gives me the feeling that Watanabe might have been the more appropriate choice for sound directing, as he has proofed himself to deliver there over and over again, as opposed to only him providing the storyboard.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I am not hailing the OPs/EDs of Anime greatly, especially not during reviews, but with Proxy I just can\u2019t ignore it, as it provided Top 10 worthy ones in both categories. The OP is eerily addicting song-wise and balanced absolutely superbly with the visuals touching the screen, which is absolutely amazing in its own right. They offer a colour palette and a scene-transitioning on a very high-level, which I wish that only the Anime itself had. And with incorporating Radiohead as the band who's providing the respective song for the ED, there\u2019s probably not much more I have to add, an absolutely amazing track with a melancholic atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nNearing the end of this review, the characters are what\u2019s left to be covered during this write-up and who are very good for the most part. And I say 'for the most part' because there is Pino. While the flames of despise have died out for me the longer the further the series progressed, there shouldn\u2019t have been an occasion where \u201cflares of hate being quenched\u201d is a thing while watching an anime in the first place. Considering I said that the switches in narrative construction from episode to episode are the most jarring aspect about Ergo Proxy, the Auto-Reiv Pino got through the finish line by .1sec late, actually almost satirically interrupting supposed to be very serious chasing scenes with her pretty obnoxious child-like attitude and seemingly lack of intelligence of her surroundings, she\u2019s the main reason why Vincent gets into so much trouble while trying to avoid being caught. Apart from her playing with her melodica in the background and her being slightly important in the main plot, having some minor addition of easily-digestible thematic exploration, she is more of a forgettable aspect of Proxy, which only gets kind of likable through habituation effect. I\u2019m still getting some PTSD from a girl in a bunny onesie in probably one of the top 3 darkest Anime of all time. Japan.\\n\\n\r\nWith Re-L, we have one of the best female protagonists I have seen in Anime, in both design and character. Her behaviorism is reflective on what she\u2019s facing right at the moment and in a constant state of flux, which doesn\u2019t come off as implausible throughout the anime and is very reflective on what she sets out to do in her relationship with Vincent Law. While the infamous episode of them doing exactly nothing an entire episode and drawing a conclusion that could\u2019ve been expected from a Shounen-Anime at the end of the episode, I especially enjoyed her and her dynamic relationship with Vincent, who is the most complex character in the show actually which I actually can\u2019t expand on too much without spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nSide character-wise, a good portion of the past gets a reasonable amount of screen time, while the most belongs to Raul and Daedalus respectively, as they also play an integral part in the story and mystery that unfolds in Romdeau. They share a very interesting dynamic, with Raul excelling in going through a very similar development as Re-L, when trying to unfold the truth opposed to the regent and the core of Romdeau, but takes a different conclusion and a different decision from it, which is not all that easy to figure out at first, as the context of his actions is very connected to Proxy\u2019s most bizarre episode, taking place in a \u201cgame show\u201d. Daedalus gets presented a bit too heavy-handed with his creepy obsession for Re-L, almost trying to crave attention a little too hard, but being backed up by the backstory/progression of the plot, just feeling a bit out of place in terms of characterization.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve already claimed in the beginning, I made a distinctive focus on why especially the presentational aspects of Ergo Proxy didn\u2019t quite succeed in making me feel engaged or drawing out the possible strengths of the show, it\u2019s scary how good the show could\u2019ve been with a set-up as interesting as that. Considering how it evolves into episodic-storytelling right in the middle, there\u2019s a difference on how these heaps of different (minor) problems did affect me while watching, but when it got into the \u201cright mode\u201d, it was almost like watching a lecture while it tries to (refraining the use of the p-word) hammer in info in a very blatant and hard to enjoy way. Still, it is a work with one of the most complex lores in all of Anime, has a good leading duo of main characters and a rather big variety of related ideas, adding to its thematic exploration. It\u2019s definitely not my raison d\u2019etre, as the presentation did come off as suboptimal on numerous occasions, but definitely worth a watch to form your own opinion on the show, as the concluding episodes are undoubtedly very good and won\u2019t waste your time.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nArt (8/10), Animation (6/10)\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)",

            "content": "Ergo proxy, for me, started off as a completely unknown story which I came across while randomly searching for interesting anime to watch. The anime remained on my PTW list for a while until someone mentioned how cool it was and they definitely would recommend watching it soon. So, of course, I had to check it out. My only thought when I began was, \u201cthe girl with the blue eyeshadow,\u201d but after watching the first episode, I was very intrigued, especially with the entrance of two strange beings known as Proxies.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nLike many anime, they throw you into the main story, introducing the main characterslike the female inspector, Re-l Mayer, who is the granddaughter of the Regent,  and Vincent Law, an immigrant from another city who is trying to gain citizenship in the \u201cparadise\u201d city, Romdeau. The people of Romdeau may strike you as strange but only because they are made to become ideal citizens and function by the city\u2019s schedule. The city exists within a dome, isolated from the outside world, a harsh world which was destroyed many years ago by a large scale chemical disaster. Within the city, a virus known as the cogito virus becomes an escalating problem. It is capable of infecting their personal robot assistants, Auto-Reivs, causing them to gain human-like traits and thought patterns. This becomes a problem as they begin rebelling against their masters, and in some cases, kill them. The being known as a Proxy, is shrouded in mystery as their exact purpose is kept hidden from society until one day, Re-l is attacked in her apartment by a masked Proxy. From then on, she develops a strange attraction and curiosity towards the Proxy and decides to investigate their reason for existence.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, the immigrant, Vincent Law, is accused of being involved with cogito virus after being attacked by another Proxy which has a strange attraction to him. He flees after being targeted by the Security Bureau of Romdeau and escapes from the dome and along with an infected child-like Auto-Reiv named Pino. Together, they discover that the outside world is not as desolate as they were led to believe\u2026 Anymore and this may just become spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThis story may not be for those who prefer simple and straight forward shounen. It is not about the \u2018power to protect\u2019 or \u2018loyalty to nakama\u2019. As it is a seinen anime (though not mentioned on MAL), it is much more serious and complex. The series is extremely psychological to a point where the thoughts of the main characters begin affect their reality and it requires the viewer to be capable of certain level of understanding. Once you understand it though, the story is amazing to watch unfold.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art can only be described as dark. Anything other than gray tones and deep, dark colours would detract from the story\u2019s theme. The world itself, in the story, is somewhat dark so the anime\u2019s art fits it perfectly. One note is that at some points, the facial features of the characters seem weirdly distorted. It make not affect the story but can but somewhat distracting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme used for the entire series was \"Kiri\" by MONORAL. In my opinion, I would say that it was well suited to the story. It created a mood which I still can\u2019t describe but nonetheless kept my interest in the anime. \"Paranoid Android\" by Radiohead was the ending. Both the instrumental and actual song was used to good effect also. The OSTs were neither corny nor overdramatic and helped set the mood for the anime\u2019s events.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI have to say that the main characters, who all seem so different, actually mesh well once they begin to interact. Each of them is very relatable in terms of how they deal with various events in the anime. Their abilities and personalities are not unrealistic to a point where they are so strong, that no one can stop them. Also, their designs do not scream 'fanservice' since anything of the sort would just ruin the show. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, there\u2019s Re-l Mayer, the strict, military-minded investigator. To her grandfather, as well as the Security Bureau, she is seen as a rebel. She goes out of her way to investigate anything she deems suspicious, even against advice of others. She considers Romdeau as a \u201cboring paradise\u201d until she is confronted by a Proxy. When she discovers the outside world, she becomes a bit obsessed with idea of people surviving outside the dome. At times, her vulnerability is evident but generally, she creates a wall between herself and those she interacts with. She comes off as a spoilt brat for most of the first part of series due to the fact that she is sort of royalty in Romdeau, with her grandfather being the Regent. After meeting and traveling with Vincent and Pino, her personality takes a turn for the better.\\n\\n\r\nVincent Law, the immigrant from another dome city, met with Re-l to get assistance on becoming a citizen of Romdeau. Their personalities clashed immediately. He, unlike Re-l, is caring and worries most of the time. This is due to the fact that he has amnesia and often finds himself in situations which he cannot explain. He is also infatuated by Re-l and seems kind of stalker like. Through his thoughtfulness, he is able to befriend others like Pino and eventually, Re-l. Most of his part in the show revolves around his journey to recover his memories.\\n\\n\r\nPino is a Companion-type Auto-Reiv designed to assist with household activities and was given to a rich family in Romdeau. After crossing paths with a Proxy who was in pursuit of Vincent, she became infected by the cogito virus. She developed an attraction to Vincent and followed him outside the city\u2019s dome. Just like her appearance, her personality after being infected, is that of a child. Initially, she acts by mimicking others around her. Later on, she does learn to think for herself and becomes more of an individual. She provides support to Vincent on his journey to his home city. Her actions intrigued Re-l when they meet and she spent much of her time observing Pino. Pino is usually the one who would instigate comedic moment within the story, causing Vincent to become involved, and Re-l to be annoyed.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Re-l\u2019s personal \u201centourage,\u201d the Auto-Reiv, Iggy, who takes care of her everyday needs but is also used to observe her actions when she goes on investigations. There is the young scientist, Daedalus Yumeno, who seems slightly obsessed with Re-l but is still her friend; Raul Creed, who is the appointed Director of Romdeau and the Regent, who is Re-l\u2019s grandfather and the man controlling Romdeau from behind the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also the Proxies of which little is known. They are strong beings and are associated with spreading the cogito virus.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis series became one of my definite favourites after completing it. Every aspect of the show had me interested. I watched this anime out in two days despite having exams. Yes, I know I should have been studying but it was that good. If you enjoy shows that tax the brain, then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nBeing one of my favourites, I give this a 8/10. I definitely recommend it as it has a bit of everything within the plot. It\u2019s a great ride with a satisfying ending though by the end, you\u2019ll be wishing there was a second season. Yes, there are many who would say that the anime\u2019s creators were trying too hard to come up with something unique and are pretentious. Others might have dropped the series because of its complex plot. To those, all I can say is that they may not have the ability to recognize a great story and are just out there to criticize anything unknown to them. Hopefully, this review will get you interested so that you will go watch it and become a fan like I did.

            "content": "So, the first thing that comes to my mind when asked to describe Ergo Proxy: ABSOLUTE MIND F*CK. But don't let that scare you away from this wonderful and though-provoking series--this is an anime definitely worth checking out for the more mature audiences out there.\r\nI guess the genre I'd put Ergo under would be scifi psychological thriller (oops, that's more like three genres, isn't it? -.-;). It's definitely a treat for those who want a break from the mainstream, with outstanding original story and character development that seems to be rarely seen in most popular series. Ergo certainly takes the normal robot-living-beside-human-turned-crisis to a wholenew level and turns it on its head with a unique plot full of more than enough plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is the plot that should make you wary of what you're getting yourself into when you decide to sit down with this series; it certainly is a lot to grasp, and more often than not you find your head swimming not only with questions at the end of an episode, but also with a general &quot;WTF?!&quot; kind of feeling.  To be honest, I was still feeling something to that effect even after the series concluded. Many episodes have a fragmented, lost tone to them, which fits the mood of the series but still gets tiring towards the end--and in the end, while most answers are given, there are still more than enough left for you yourself to discern. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and the characters of the series are amazing, though, and make up for the at times wayward plot. Taking much-done ideas--in this case, robots with a conscious, a post-apocalyptic world, a disillusioned, totalitarian civilization--and making them bad ass and fantastically fresh is no ordinary feat. Yet, the creators of Ergo Proxy seemed to have done it with ease. The story, revolving around the human psyche, the sin of god-like creatures, and purpose of life itself, delves deep and keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know and learn more the further into the series you get. The characters themselves all have their own charm about them, and only add to the story with the intense character development that hits each and every one of the characters seriously introduced. It would take a whole other review to go into the topic of and praise the characters and character development used in Ergo.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the art and music in this series are just as good as everything else--wouldn't want to distract from the already overwhelming plot, right? ;) Anyways, the fight scenes between the Proxies are amazing, as well as Vincent's transformations themselves, along with the battle scenes. While not for the extremely weak of heart, they are certainly not anything like Elfen Lied are something, so no worries. The opening and ending themes of the series are also noteworthy, and two of my favorites out of all the other anime opening and endings out there--the music used is haunting, yet befitting. And I could sing along because they're in English. :)\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing worthy of mention is the extensive Greek philosophy references, among other philosophical references, used throughout the series. I didn't feel all to guilty about devoted hours to watching this series, because I got some edumacation out of it too.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, I give Ergo Proxy two thumbs WAAAY up. Definitely on my favorite anime list now if it's not at the top, and I can't BELIEVE I hadn't watched it sooner...\\n\\n\r\n:D",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy\r\nAn anime that makes sense but at the same time it doesn't, even when answers are given in the last three eps. i was thinking of the things that are not answered and there are supernatural elements, a lot and Deus Ex explanations but still manages to be entertaining.\r\nStory\r\nThis anime has a very good story, since the beginning the story is thrown for ten episodes straight, fast paced with complexity, until when it takes a break to put filler episodes which were really good and had little pieces of the plot, especially the ''who wants to be a proxy'' episode where i was constantlyinteracting saying the answers just like Vincent, but how did they get there in the first place? ; The ''Disney World'' episode is another example, it was a filler but a really touching one, Pino became my favorite character of the anime with that episode, (dethroning Vincent from the first place) she is a hero; Every episode has a jump time, and with an annoying Re-i (really, she was bitchy) you never know how they reached some locations, like in ep. 21 where all of a sudden they are back, what, is this a dream?, i thought it was, because the anime in those filler eps. is constantly playing between reality and dreams, is cool because i was fooled on this ep. thinking ''plot twist, is a dream'' but no. There is lack of coherent explanation as to why this gaps between eps. or how some events happened. The ending is good but unsatisfaying for some reason, it has a conclusion but at the same time open for another story, i have a lot of thing to complain storywise but this is not a complaint thread, at the end Pino still is a Hero and she is an AuotoReiv with more emotions than Re-i.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nI was expecting something darker for this kind of setting, a much dense atmosphere, that way would be better for me, but for what we got is very good, sometimes feels lazy with some shots at the faces and lookig at how they suffer from strabismus, it was hilarious, almost always with Re-i, i don't like the constant changing on the faces while moving from one angle to another and i'm saying every 1 cm move is a different face, despite this inconveniences it was very good for that year.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMaybe the best element from the anime, the music is great when is played after the silent parts, it sets a great atmosphere, it fits the theme, the OP is really great, the video clip reminded me of the 90's movies and TV series (like Buffy, Angel and specially to Charmed and the song a lot to Smallville) it was great, better than those series too, more emotion in just four words ''Come and save me'' while Vincent is screamig, just great and the ED is ok i guess, Radiohead, you get it. The VA is great as well, really enjoyable even when Re-i acted like a spoiled Brat, that voice was fitting, so good portraying that personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty entertaining with the combination of really great voice acting, personalities and back stories for the characters, Re-i is the exception, she needed more background to get to know her more but she was ok.\\n\r\n-Vincent Law is great, he suffers a transition from a nerdy looking shy guy who likes Re-i to a good-normal looking shy guy looking for his identity who still likes Re-i and cares and protects for Pino, he is a badass too, you'll see.\\n\r\n-Re-I, Lilu or Real is a gal who can be emotionless at times, she acts like a brat later, really spoiled and that's because her AutoReiv does almost everything for her (love the part where he was ''arguing'' with her in the snow, the truth was spoken) but she kind of grows and even feels something for Vincent, she gets better, but not enough.\\n\r\n-Pino is the best character, she's simple the best, the one that makes you laugh in every situation, she is adorable, naive, she even has more emotions than Re-i or every human and is impressive because she's an AutoReiv, she is a hero, she saves people believe it or not, the best character, i was thinking if something bad happened to her (in those eps. that could go bad) i was going to give this a bad score just because of that, wouldn't be the same without her.\\n\r\nThe support characters are great too, Raul, Daedalus, Iggy, they all are great, there are a lot more that are interesting too. In general the characters were great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really had a very good enjoyment from this anime, i was expecting more tho, after everyone saying Ergo Proxy was better than Texhnolyzed, i was expecting something more darker and heavier, but i didn't felt that, maybe a little dense just at the last three eps. but i see that this has better art style and character development and has a ''happy'' ending while Tex. has a tragic one and has no filler eps. and is more slow paced but for me both are equally entertaining, both are must watch.",

            "content": "Ah, Ergo Proxy - an anime so promising, the only thing greater than its potential was its downfall. Anime that could have been among those few elite series that just leave you stunned with their superb quality and sophistication, turned out to be just... \"good\". And if there's a thing about a show that I can't stand more than poor quality, it's a waste of potential. But enough of this preface, let's dive into \"Ergo Proxy\" \r\nP.S. I feel I should warn you that if you don't like reading long reviews, you should drop this one right now. As a very pedantic and analytical person,I tend to write almost obnoxiously long reviews. \\n\r\nP.P.S. I shall also write several spoilers, for its hard for me to thoroughly review the story without giving some things away, especially when discussing the plot. But I promise I will warn you each time a significant spoiler is incoming.\\n\\n\r\n\"Ergo\"'s greatest potential turned out to be its greatest weakness. You must have already read the synopsis, so I won't repeat it here. \\n\r\nI came across Ergo Proxy on this very site, and the premise of the show had me so intrigued, so much interested, that I downloaded all 23 episodes immediately, impatient to see more of it. And the very first episode had me hooked up completely. The quality of the art and music, the interestingly designed characters and the environment, the show's dark and stylish visuals, and most of all, its on-the-edge-of-your-seat plot brimming with mystery and suspense... I couldn't wait to start the next episode. The second and the third episode were just as brilliant, as the story brought more and more ( but still not too much ) mysteries, and the plot captivated me completely. And it continued to be good, albeit paced a bit slower, until episode 7. This is where the show lost it, and even though it tried from time to time, never managed to find it again. \\n\r\nApparently, the Manglobe's producers of the show approached the director Shukou Murase with \"bare-bones vision for a futuristic detective thriller, which included the title, a plot outline for episodes 1-3 and a design concept for Romdeau.\" And, unfortunately, they allowed him to do as he pleases from there.\\n\r\nWhat did Murase do? He threw the concept of a \"futuristic detective thriller\", that could have challenged Death Note for the title of the best suspense series, and decided to make it a more \"philosophical\" show. This forfeiting of the already established genre and plot, and opting for something else altogether would be disastrous in itself, but the story might have survived, had the replacement been better ( or, a cynic inside me would say, good at all ).\\n\r\nNow, many people who have reviewed this show praise it for its \"philosophical issues\" and its \"depth\", and good for them if they see any depth in this series, but I, and I flatter myself to be a very rational and objective person, can see none. Make no mistake, Ergo Proxy is no \"Ghost in the Shell\" ( and I'm talking about Mamoru Oshii's feature film, not the S.A.C. series ). The philosophical \"questions\" are neither new, well presented or debated, or have any real depth. We have Vincent's search for his memories and finding his real self, but apart from ( SPOILER ALERT ) his nature as both a human and a Proxy, it's nothing new or particularly mind-stimulating. ( END OF SPOILER ).\\n\r\nThe director also tried with the symbolism and metaphors about Romdeau's slow decay and final demise, but it ends up more confusing than though-provoking, and is not built upon enough. There are many more \"metaphors\" and shallow symbolism present throughout the series, but the problems with them is that they aren't elaborated enough and that the show tries too hard to show you how \"deep\" it is, whereas the golden rule is that the depth is in subtlety, and this show doesn't have as much as it should, given all the questions and issues it tries to address.\\n\r\nProbably the only highlight of the \"philosophical aspect\" of the show is  Re-L's search for the truth; her determination to seek and face the truth no matter how ugly it might be adds a lot to her character, and she does advance the \"plot\" more than most other characters, and I give the show the credit where it's due. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to save the overall story.\\n\r\nAfter episode 7, the plot became incoherent and confusing, with the show refusing to ( at least partially ) solve its already established mysteries, instead piling up more and more of them, and had neglected its existing plot lines ( like the origin and spreading of the Cogito virus ).\\n\r\nThere were also several completely unnecessary mind-fuck episodes that did nothing to advance the plot or develop the characters, as well as a couple of episodes that went beyond conventional mind-fuck, and just left you asking: \"What the hell is going on? I mean, what the hell is going on?!!\" I'm talking, of course, about the ( SPOILER ALERT ) episode no. 15, the \"Quiz-show episode\", and the ep. no 19, the \"Disney episode\" ( END OF SPOILER )\\n\r\nIn the end, the show tried to redeem itself by pulling a Deus-ex-machina that was supposed to tie up all the loose ends, but ended up opening more questions than it answered. The ending scene(s)  is epic, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find Ergo Proxy's cast of characters satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nRe-L Mayer, one of the two main characters, is the granddaughter of Donov Mayer, the regent ( or, as his official title is, Administrator ) of Romdeau. She's bored with the sterile utopia that the city is, and sometimes wishes for the city to come to an end, just for the sake of breaking the routine of her life as an inspector for the city's Intelligence Department. \\n\r\nShe's portrayed as somewhat of a loner, barely communicating with anyone except her Entourage, Iggy. Hand in hand with this comes her independence, individualism and strong will. She also possesses great emotional strength, displayed in her determination not to run from the reality, no matter how harsh or dark it might be. On the other hand, as a granddaughter of the regent, she's quite spoiled and arrogant, and has little concern for the emotions or the needs of the others. She's also something of a badass, being quite handy with guns, especially the shotgun, her trademark weapon.\\n\\n\r\nVincent Law is also quite a good character, albeit not as interesting as the Gothic princess Re-L. He's much more realistic in that regard, having very little impressive skills or extraordinary psychological traits. He's inner struggle to come to terms with his past and ( SPOILER ALERT ) double identity as both Vincent and Ergo is psychologically convincing and interesting, but could have been less drawn out. ( END OF SPOILER )\\n\r\nHis character changes a lot over the course of the series, from being a timid man ( and, if I may say, a bit of a coward ), always bowing his head down and obeying, to become a determined individual that comes to terms with his nature and realises that it's who he is now, and not who he had been prior to losing his memories, that defines him. \\n\\n\r\nPino, a self-conscious Autoreiv and arguably one of the cutest anime characters ever ( especially considering the realistic style and animation of the series, with no chibi ) could have been way better developed, and used to explore the concept of a machine gaining a heart much deeper. She does little for the plot after episode 3 when she helps Vincent escape from Romdeau, and is basically there only for the cuteness and keeping Vincent company on his journey.\\n\\n\r\nRaul Creed is one of the most interesting characters in the story, and the one that changes the most over the course of the series. A law abiding model citizen of Romdeau, he's the new Chief of Public Security at the beginning of the series. Pino was his surrogate daughter, and his wife was also given a human baby by the city's authorities. ( SPOILER ALERT ) In the ep. 2 both his wife and baby are killed in the shopping mall by Monad Proxy while chasing Vincent Law, and Pino is infected with the Cogito Virus. ( END OF SPOILER ) After that, he gradually becomes obsessed with Vincent and the Proxies, and simultaneously becomes destructive and strives to break the humanity's shackles of dependance on the Proxies. He wants to see humanity free of any gods determining their fates, and conspires with doctor Dedalus Yumeno in order to biologically enhance humans in Romdeau so that they can survive in the outside world, thus no longer being dependent on the Dome created and sustained by the Proxy. \\n\\n\r\nDedalus Yumeno is the Chief of the city's medical center and Re-L's personal physician. He's supposedly a child genius, appearing to be only 14-16 years old, but already a renowned doctor and scientist. It is gradually revealed that he's obsessed with Re-L, and wishes to posses her. He's also quite a schemer, changing sides when it suits him best and repeatedly withholding information from people if it doesn't serve his interests. He's also revealed to be psychologically unstable and destructive, and is ( SPOILER ALERT ) later manipulated by Proxy One into destroying the dome protecting Romdeau ( END OF SPOILER )\\n\\n\r\nThere are three categories that, combined, give a final score for the visual aspect of any animated series: style, graphics and animation.\\n\r\nThe style alone gets a full score of 10. The beautiful style is one of Ergo Proxy's highlights, and its mostly thanks to great character designs and, most of all, interesting and meticulously drawn post-apocalyptic environments and cities. \\n\r\nCharacter designs were clearly given much thought and work, and all of them are unique and memorable, especially Re-L, with her resemblance to Evanescence's leading singer Amy Lee.\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics don't get the same high score as style. While they are top quality for most of the time, especially for the show that was only meant to be released on DVD, every now and then the graphics are strikingly sloppy and cheap, lowering the otherwise high visual quality of the show. Normally highly detailed characters and backgrounds can get downgraded to being painfully simplified and plain, with most of their features and clothes barred to the bones, not to mention getting anatomically incorrect and/or inconsistent ( mostly it's the angle and the length of the nose, shape of the face etc. ) So the graphics get 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is somewhat better than the graphics, but still not worthy of a straight \"A\" like the style. Again, it's fluid and high-quality for the most part, but the motions occasionally get a bit weird or unrealistic. The show is a bit static, but seeing as it's a suspend, and not an action series, it's not relevant to the animation's final score of 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. The opening for this series is one of the best ones I've ever seen, combining the staggeringly detailed images with well-chosen music in what can only be called visual art.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very good, serving its relatively limited purpose of setting the mood, due to the lack of more epic scenes. It achieves this with a combination of haunting vocals and modern instruments to paint the both grim and sterile world of Romdeau and desolate wastelands outside of it. Combined with stylish and dark visuals, the music delivers the almost sublime feel that really gets you immersed with the post apocalyptic world of Ergo Proxy.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme songs are both great; the OP is \"Kiri\", a song in English performed by the Japanese band \"Monorail\". I was surprised to find out that the band is Japanese - the singer's English is that good ( far from your typical \"Engrish\" ). The ending theme is a popular song \"Paranoid Android\" by \"Radiohead\". Both songs suit the opening and ending, as well as the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting is very good in both the Japanese and English version. Both the seiyu and the voice actors in English do a great job and each voice feels like it's made for the character. The greatest achievement of the voice acting, though, is Pino, who manages to be cute without having the annoying high-pitched voice those types of characters are usually graced with.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on with each category ( and add some more ) and go into more detail, but that would require lots of spoiling and besides, I think the review is long enough as it is. So I'll wrap it up. Ergo Proxy had the misfortune to be assigned a director that was probably high for the whole time the series was made, and screwed the story that could have propelled it the prestigious club of anime classics. Instead, much of the show was pure  mindfuck that left me almost angry at it for wasting my time. Does that mean Ergo Proxy is a bad anime? Of course not. There was still enough good bits of the plot ( mostly in the first 7-13 episodes ) for viewers to get some top-rate suspense, as well as high-quality visuals ( for most of the time ) and a number of great characters who just had the misfortune to finding themselves in such a shit-storm of a plot. Overall, Ergo Proxy gets a median rating of 6,4. \\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime to you? Not really, at least not watching all of the episodes, because if you're a reasonable person with a capacity for critical thinking ( unlike the people who gave his show 10/10 ) you won't enjoy the show because of the awful plot. Sci-fi and cyberpunk fans could like it ( to a degree ) and should give it a try, and as for everyone else, stay away from it.",

            "content": "OK, I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;ve looked at this series for quite some time before actually picking it up. The reason being I didn&rsquo;t feel quite comfortable with the apparent darkness the pictures of it seemed. Also the plot didn&rsquo;t seem to interest me, as it appeared at first glance by wiki to be a bit bland. Then something changed, I prodded myself to go try it. And then,&hellip;I became trapped in the dark and phantastical post-apocalyptic world of Ergo Proxy, where anything might happen. And you could not trust anyone, anywhere.\r\n-Animation-\r\nErgo Proxy has some of the best animation that I&rsquo;ve seen in an anime. It setsthe tone right away in the beginning for being dark and absolutely suspenseful. From the very first beginning where you are immediately shown an apparent medical containment lab where a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; is being restrained. However, it awakens. This sort of beginning sort of reminded me of Elfen Lied, however for those of you who have seen Elfen Lied, there is not quite near the amount of gore in Ergo Proxy. The animators did a splendid job of controlling the lighting; it was absolutely perfect when it switches between the sorrowful, painful, post-apocalyptic backgrounds of the &ldquo;outside world&rdquo; and the somehow even more sinister &ldquo;ecological domes&rdquo; in which most of the populace resides. There is very little frame reuse, no repeated mecha equipment cut scenes; this anime is meant to be dramatic and dark, and its animation does its purpose amazingly.\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nCaveat emptor. Let me warn you first. Ergo Proxy isn&rsquo;t meant to be seen as a side show. It&rsquo;s not meant to be watched when you need to lighten up. It&rsquo;s story is dark and convoluted and it&rsquo;ll take those brain cells of ours to puzzle it out, even after the directors puts almost all the pieces in place. The story begins in a futuristic domed city called Romdo, built to protect its citizens after a global ecological disaster. In this utopia, humans and androids (AutoReivs) coexist with each other peacefully under a total management system. A series of murders committed by berserk robots (infected with the Cogito virus which enables them to have a conscious mind) starts to jeopardize the delicate balance of the social order. Behind the scenes, the government is conducting secret experiments on a mysterious humanoid lifeform called Proxy, which is believed to hold the key to the survival of mankind or maybe its destruction.\\n\\n\r\nRe-l Mayer is assigned to investigate some of the murders with her AutoReiv partner Iggy. She encounters a Cogito-infected AutoReiv and a fast and flexible monster. She later learns that the monster was a Proxy, the mysterious humanoid lifeform only the top bureaucratic officials even know the existence of. Here is where an immigrant by the name of Vincent Law is introduced. Having mysterious connections to the Proxies, Vincent is on the run from authorities after failing his citizen test. After being hunted down, Vincent leaves Romdo, and Re-l tags along to discover the truth behind the Proxies and the domes.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has a nicely developed fully fleshed out plot, not too fast, nor too slow, but the major dialogues are important to understanding the story as it goes on.\\n\\n\r\n-Music and Sound-\\n\\n\r\nThe in-series music is good enough for this type of series, but nothing really sticks out that much, unlike Heroic Age and series it. But since this series focuses mainly on a story and characters, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter really. However, the OP threw me off guard, it suited the series in a weird ironic dark way. The song is performed by a Japanese, however, he speaks fluent English. See for yourself and you&rsquo;ll know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nThis is the gluing point of the series. In addition to its complex plot, its characters suit the series extremely well. All the characters develop emotionally through the course of the series and since this isn&rsquo;t technically an action series, Ergo Proxy focuses on the psychological mentality of its protagonists. The main character, Re-I Mayer is an enigma. Her personality and demeanor suggests of a haughty princess, but she is acutely observational and analytical and amazingly intriguing. Introduced as a selfish character in the beginning with little regard to other beings including her own autoreiv Iggy and her later partner Vincent, Re-I Mayer (Lil) poses a curious change as the series goes on. Vincent too, introduced, as a bit timid and cowardly in the beginning changes into a true man as Ergo Proxy goes on.\\n\\n\r\nNot just them, but the other characters, the Proxies, the Security Bureau&rsquo;s chief, the different autoreivs, and the host of other characters, mainly supporting, are painstakingly portrayed and realistically displayed. Plainly put, it&rsquo;s a series that will draw you in with its characters and plot alike.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nWell, can&rsquo;t really say much about it. I can&rsquo;t say I was left happy by it. But I can say I enjoyed it. It&rsquo;s not something I would like to rewatch, however, and most likely it&rsquo;ll stay on my list as one of the most brooding series ever created.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy was a terrific disappointment to me; from the initial episode, as well as promotional material, the how I expected and the show I received were on two completely different wavelengths. Rather than a post-apocalyptic science fiction thriller, I was instead given a very slow paced, dialogue heavy series that approached a genre one could call psychological or philosophical, and did so in a way that kept your interest, as well as avoided the pretentious nature of similarly designed shows such as Evangelion. It is also noteworthy that this series develops in a bizarre way, one which cannot be compared to any other seriesI've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nStory; 10. The overarching plot of Ergo Proxy is surprisingly thin. A very great portion of the series, in fact, develops this plot in little to no way; it's pretty much outlined at the beginning, thrown aside, and only touched back upon at the series very end. Much like your typical slice of life series, it survives only off of the character interactions and episodic adventures more often than not, drawn out conversations, monologues, and soliloquies. When I previously mentioned a heavy dosage of spoken word in Ergo Proxy, I may not have properly elaborated as to the extent of it; It would be no great exaggeration to say that at least 3/4 of the series is spent in conversation, possibly a bit more. However, the dialogue is rich in a way I won't bother to explain, but it all manages to flow and intertwine in a way that almost just keeps you watching. Each episode somehow ends with a renewed anticipation to see the next until it's suddenly over. Also, sparing as many spoilers as possible, this series undoubtedly has one of the most well executed and satisfyingly cool ending sequences I have ever seen. I didn't see it coming at all, not how they did it anyways, and I was rather pleased with it when all was said and done.\\n\\n\r\nArt; 8. Not much to say here. I personally loved the dark, muddy color pallet; the domed city and it's barren outskirts were made ten times more believably by this. There were too frequently, however, poorly/quickly drawn characters, usually Re-L, I noticed. Just sloppy, but the art that was handled well was excellent, especially the designs for the proxies. The art played a huge role in making the journey in this series seem believable, and in a good way at times, drawn out. I can't really explain it, but it was definitely a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound; 8. The opening theme and closing theme both are stellar songs; I've known of them prior to viewing this, however they both fit perfectly with the shows atmosphere and content, and were nice additions to the soundtrack undoubtedly. The shows tracks themselves, were few and far between. The ones that were included, however, fit very well; numerous battle themes and eerie sound clips were some of the best I've ever heard; but, like I said, I rarely heard them. It's a shame to see them create a soundtrack that I would happily give a ten...if they only used it as much as they should have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 10. This cast really grew on me, and from characters I didn't really care about to ones I even hated, each character was developed as in depth as possible; I've only ever seen one show with characters I was more in touch with than this, and that is a huge compliment. I have had many series ruined for me by characters I couldn't stand, and Ergo Proxy was the great, positive opposite. Each character is fleshed out at whatever point, and this is usually done through interactions with other characters, story and otherwise. This was another high point in characterization, a seemingly small step that really took the series miles in terms of it's overall impact; episodic characters. You know the crew they tossed into a single episode arc and killed at it's end of \"show x,\" never fleshing them out past names and expecting you to care when they died? But, you didn't, and who the hell would? We only knew their names. Ergo Proxy even gave the proper amount of depth to it's episodic cast members, so there was always a clincher even for those many stand alone arcs. This alone, while working with everything else, allowed them to cover pretty much every issue and thought process humanly possible, which in turn allowed the series to reach a philosophical high ground no other show has achieved without becoming an annoying mess. Stellar job here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall; 9. In it's own way, Ergo Proxy succeeds where it should fail; Slow, slow pacing, and pointlessness, that feeling of nothing happening. Instead that is the beauty of it. Because half the time, nothing at all really is happening. In fact there was an entire episode devoted to Re-L's observance of all the nothing she was experiencing. And that was one of my favorite episodes. All in all, Ergo Proxy is a very bizarre bird, a specific show that a select group of fans will enjoy monumentally. But my advice is to give this a try, and see it through; even if you can't really dig the molasses-paced plot, the ending twist is so next and well executed that you'll be glad you watched just that.",

            "content": "This is damn well near perfect, and one of my favorite anime.\r\nIt's quite ambitious as an \"abstract\" anime, and for the most part pulls it off thanks to well developed and likeable characters.\r\nThe premise is superficially simple, the remnants of humanity live in domed cities where their entire lives are orchestrated, carefully regulated, controlled, scrutinized, and more or less worthless. They are a remnant of those who fled the planet after a massive disaster rendered it mostly uninhabitable and live on in a wretched purgatory of an existence where they aren't even considered alive. They are tended to by humanoid robots called Autoraves, who haveslowly begun to grow self-aware and unpredictable by a mysterious Cogito virus. Less known, and more central to the show are mysterious deities, Proxies, that serve as guardians, shadow gods of each dome city--and like all gods are both a creator and construct of humanity, the two being unable to live without each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on three odd characters--each a representative of the life remaining on the earth. This is set both to a backdrop similar of the Epic of Gilgamesh/the Great Flood where wanderers search a devastated world, frozen in time, on an ark (or in this case a beat up wind skiff), finding domes where reality has been twisted by the hand of the godlike proxies into strange perversions of pop psychology.\\n\\n\r\nThere are three main characters, something which makes the anime move smoothly along. Re-L Mayer, privileged daughter of an administrator of her dome, Romdo, who encounters a Proxy face to face and awakens from the dream of the other dome dwellers to follow a strange immigrant Vincent Law who was implicated in a recent string of murders and seeks to escape this artificial world. She is conflicted by the stark nature of the life outside and the comfort yet stagnation within.\\n\\n\r\nVincent Law is goofy, innocent, calculating. He is the slovenly foil to Re-L's fastiduousness, often driving her insane as she is both frustrated and fascinated by him. He is the motivating force for her running away from Romdo and travel the wastelands and witness the last moments of humanity. His outward singlemindedness hides something far darker and more evil inside...\\n\\n\r\nPino is an Autorave that became infected with the Cogito virus. Instead of becoming unpredictable and homicidal, she slowly assumes the personality and mannerisms of a child--becoming increasingly human, despite her outside perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThe fate of humanity, the purpose of the Autoraves and Proxies is told in an episodic fashion as the three travel the domes. The experiences range from corporeal--mindless destruction bestowed upon man by gods, to absurd: a dream world clearly meant to parody Disney's vision, to a Millionaire style game show, to literally a mirror world.\\n\\n\r\nOver time the Proxies have grown tired, warped, lonely--lost in their own purpose and created their own worlds, many of which are a hell for the humans that remain. A sleeping, disturbed world awating for the return of the \"creators:\" humans who set all of this in motion who are awating for the Earth to live again, unaware or uncaring of the farce they left behind.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is witnessed by the three travelers, who have their own take on events, each becoming more and more human in their own way...\\n\\n\r\nThe anime remains fresh by not dwelling on any theme or story arc for too long, has a scant few characters that it develops and presents quite well and actually makes us care about them, and only falls short in its lofty ambitions to embrace too many psychological and religious themes--but this is offset by the fact that ultimately it refuses to take itself too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, hey, it has Paranoid Android as the ED.",

            "content": "When a show is touted as deep or intelligent, I often fear what makes a good story will be neglected. Maybe it\u2019s no secret a show can be praised solely for its profundity while failing in storytelling. But hey, \u2018intelligence\u2019 is good armor for a show to have. Why bother with authentic storytelling when a show can show-off its psychology knowledge?\r\nBut instead of ranting, let\u2019s look at Ergo Proxy.\r\nThe future, probably. Technology has advanced to where it\u2019s created AutoReivs, androids who act as servants to people. But in the city of Romdo, a bug called the Cogito Virus is spreading through the AutoReivs. They gaina will of their own, often to destructive results. Detective Re-l Mayer is tasked with investigating the Cogito Virus, but is attacked by a monster called a Proxy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Proxy had escaped from a research lab under Daedalus\u2019 watch, and is strangely drawn to the immigrant Vincent Law. After another incident, Security Bureau Chief Raul Creed tries to capture Vincent and the Proxy. But the former, joined by the child-like AutoReiv Pino, escapes Romdo out to the wasteland world. And thus begins Re-l\u2019s mission to discover what the Proxy is, Vincent\u2019s journey in the wasteland, and the proverbial chess game between Daedalus and Raul.\\n\\n\r\nFor Daedalus, it\u2019s his reason for living at stake. He has strong feelings for Re-l, willing to use his authority to let her break rules when she needs to. Or assist her in killing the Proxy despite Raul\u2019s mission to capture it. A smooth talker and an even smoother schemer, Daedalus is defined by his feelings for Re-l without much else to his person. He\u2019s an empty man, whose reason for living touches on a crucial point for Romdo\u2019s citizens. And that point ups the urgency for Raul to capture Vincent and the Proxy alive.\\n\\n\r\nRaul himself starts as the antagonist\u2014antagonist, not villain\u2014for all the characters. But as he learns more about the Proxy and Vincent, the more he questions why they must be captured alive. His character arc deals with authority, and how far someone will follow orders without question. Early scenes also make a connection between Raul and Pino, to hint at another side to him. Unfortunately, this connection and that other side aren\u2019t explored until the final act. It\u2019s too bad, because fully realized, the connection between Raul and Pino would round out the former.\\n\\n\r\nPino is the classic tale of an innocent child learning about the real world, but tainted by unnerving implications from her \u2018age\u2019 and the Cogito Virus. From her lack of grasping death to adventurous curiosity, it\u2019s unclear whether her actions are more from her programming or her \u2018will.\u2019 She\u2019s supposed to be infected, but doesn\u2019t show the destructive actions as other AutoReivs do. Then again, she\u2019s a child at heart. And regardless of why she learns about the world, what matters is she does. Her empathy grows with her fondness toward Vincent, and her tact sharpens under Re-l\u2019s demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because Re-l ends up joining Vincent. She pursues him to bring him back to Romdo, but decides to join his journey after certain events, to learn more about the Proxy. Re-l herself is the picture of professional, maintaining her gun\u2019s aim the way she maintains her eyeliner; perfectly. Because for how cold she can be on the job, she\u2019s also a bit frivolous. She apparently spends every morning fixing her make-up, shows fear against the Proxy, and gets angry when things don\u2019t go as planned. My goodness, it\u2019s like she\u2019s lived a sheltered life as the granddaughter of Romdo\u2019s leader.\\n\\n\r\nCorrection: she IS the sheltered granddaughter of Romdo\u2019s leader. Re-l is often in over her head despite her demeanor, like she was mismatched to her job. This isn\u2019t unbelievable though, as early on much of her work is done through her AutoReiv Iggy. But after certain events, her character arc becomes one of growing independence, and knowing when to relax in the company of others. Re-l might be hard to like\u2014though Vincent would disagree\u2014but at least she\u2019s compelling to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Vincent, his journey is a quest of self-discovery. He\u2019s an immigrant from the city of Mosque, but the threat from the Proxy and Raul forces him to escape. But, he realizes he has no memory of his time in Mosque. So he decides to travel there, hoping to find the answers to his memory. Vincent himself often thinks about who he is, almost to the point where it\u2019s all that defines him (and because of his role in the story, can\u2019t get away with it like Daedalus).\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it\u2019s not. Vincent\u2019s journey changes him bit by bit, going from a boy depressed by events and hesitant to face the truth, to a man who can smile despite the odds and can deal with the wind being taken out of his sails (metaphorically, and...literally). Unfortunately, his progress cracks in the final act, when it moves at near breakneck speed to advance the story. The story itself moves brisk and quick during the first and final acts, but it\u2019s the middle act that can be a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe better part of the show\u2019s middle act is punishingly slow, doing nearly nothing to advance the story. People expecting a quick trip to the final act should exercise patience, and take time to admire the setting and characters along the way. Because unlike some shows where a five minute event takes five episodes to unfold, Ergo Proxy moves along a time span of weeks and maybe months. It\u2019s a long journey, but it always has something to show for it.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it peeks into a future for Romdo, like the abandoned city occupied by a single man whose circumstances mirror Vincent\u2019s. Or the closed-off amusement park that subscribes to ignorance and bliss before its eventual downfall. At other times, it\u2019s a character study to test the bonds between Re-l, Vincent, and Pino. From trusting each other with food and water supplies, to saving each other from new and familiar faces, to placing their fates in each other\u2019s hands (literally and metaphorically).\\n\\n\r\nGoing further, one episode strongly hints to the answer of Vincent\u2019s memory, while another episode explores consciousness where there normally isn\u2019t consciousness. It also looks into some of the minor characters. There\u2019s one person whose sense of want and duty blur together as he feels emotions he\u2019s never felt, while a military unit fights against destructive AutoReivs.\\n\\n\r\nOops, I stayed on the road of storytelling but it went into a jungle of existential and societal metaphors anyway. Whether stated or implied, the show is filled with the kind of intelligence I described earlier, but doesn\u2019t hinge itself on profundity thanks to its compelling characters. They\u2019re rounded enough to make the psychology a part of them instead of the other way around. The show is a story first, a display\u2014display, not show-off\u2014of psychology second, and that\u2019s the way it should be. Save for the awful episode 15 that says nothing new, the show is great about being meaningful without crossing the line into nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nBut to give episode 15 credit, it displays the show\u2019s perfectly fitting morbid sense of humor. It\u2019s hard not to gawk at someone who\u2019s literally making a game gravely serious despite his cheerfulness. Another episode shows two people who joke about their own uselessness. And another person threatens Re-l to no effect, as the camera goes back and forth between his increasingly scared face and her unmoving scowl.\\n\\n\r\nThe camera work is otherwise unremarkable, standard, except when it decides to throw in Re-l fanservice when it\u2019s not needed. Because a glance of her naked body covered by two towels as she\u2019s stretchered away, doesn\u2019t have the weight of a slow look at her body that mirrors Vincent\u2019s attraction to her when they\u2019re close together. But hey, at least the visuals have the decency to give Re-l unassuming white underwear instead of an accentuating black.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals themselves give the world a bleak look, from the unnaturally spotless Romdo, to the crack-lined, rust-littered structures of the wasteland world. Special mention goes to the character designs, particularly the AutoReivs. Save for Pino, every AutoReiv is identified by mask-like faces where glowing red eyes are the only hint of any expression. Most close-ups of the AutoReivs don\u2019t reveal anything, but it adds tension in guessing whether they\u2019re destructive or not.\\n\\n\r\nBut when they ARE destructive, there\u2019s sometimes a firefight following close behind, like when a military group goes against them. Yes, I\u2019m surprised the show has action scenes too. They move fluidly but without crazy choreography, which would look ridiculous in this fairly grounded show anyway. Except for the Proxy. The Proxy\u2019s fights move with supernatural grace, but aren\u2019t louder than the normal action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nBecause even in the action scenes, most of the music tracks are atmospheric ambiance instead of distinct pieces; the only noticeable track being the operatic \u2018Fellow Citizens.\u2019 The overall score works where it\u2019s used, setting the mood but never distracting from the dialog. And there\u2019s a lot of it. Nearly every moment of the show is charged with talking or thinking, and it demands a certain amount of attention.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to another point.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy isn\u2019t an easy show to watch. There\u2019s action, but people who watch it for the action can quickly get bored. The first and final acts are fast, but the middle act will drive away the impatient even faster. It\u2019s held together by compelling characters, but \u2018compelling\u2019 isn\u2019t \u2018likable.\u2019 It does most things right, but demands patience. So while the destination is far away, the journey is always here.",

I guess I'll just briefly talk about itand hopefully it helps :) Suggestions and Criticism are welcomed and appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two types of animes, one goes from point A to point B straightforward, (fate series) another goes randomly so that it's okay to watch episode 12 before episode 11. (darker than black).\\n\\n\r\nErgo proxy belongs to neither category, which makes it very controversial. \\n\r\nOn one hand, it is a journey, a journey to find the meaning of living. on the other hand, random episodes pop out once in a while, though look like fillers, they actually contribute to the thesis and the story. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY (8/10) \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to talk about the concept since I think it's better for you to feel yourself. And don't be fooled by the first line of the description, it has nothing to do with the thesis of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show is rather interesting. To be honest, I put my progress on hold after watching the first four episodes. Not that they were bad, but they are just way too confusing. However, in the middle of the series, the story opens out the goals and ideas begin to come together. As the story progress further, it becomes random and confusing again, but this time with background information, the confusing plot becomes slightly more understandable. \\n\\n\r\nI really don't know how to describe it better. The story proposes many philosophical questions regarding what it means to be human. Which is really my piece of cake since these questions make me think. If you are not a thinker, I suppose you would not like the story as much since nothing shocking or exciting or engaging happen until the very end. \\n\\n\r\nFor some reasons I had a strong motivation of going to the next episode without knowing exactly why. There really aren't any cliffhanger, they are simply good episodes that makes you wonder what will happen next. By the way, the ending is good. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I personally like the story A LOT. Though I do appreciate the new approach the artists attempted, to put it objectively, the story is not that well executed. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere are three main characters. Vincent Law, Re-L and Pino. \\n\\n\r\nVincent, for a lack of better reference, is a sci-fi, future, overpowered version of Hamlet. He narrates his thoughts 99% of the time when he is on the screen. He thinks a lot. Over time, he slowly but surely discovered his past and realized the purpose of his existence. I like this character, it has decent development and many interesting aspects. The story also does a great job showing his personality and background. \\n\\n\r\nRe-L. My favorite female character ever. She is strong, independent (well her  robot servant would probably disagree with me..), fit, clever and good looking (come on, am I the only one finding her make up amazing?). I really don't want to spoil her too much, but she did change greatly from the beginning of the show to the end. If Vincent is the protagonist, she would be the observer or interpreter/helper of Vincent's final determination. \\n\\n\r\nPino. Cute. Too cute. She is childish, but not stupid. She acts as the clear eye when both Re-L and Vincent can't find their way. She gets lost all the time, but it is her discoveries that helped Vincent to find his answers. She also acts as the plot relief when sh*t gets real and audience are terrified or nervous. Damn she's just too cute to dislike. \\n\\n\r\nAll the supporting characters received decent background and development. With good screen time, they all serve their purpose well. \\n\\n\r\nI loved these characters. I think they are very well designed and really I can't find a way to make them better. (Unless you are easily annoyed by their dialogues...)\\n\\n\r\nART (4/5) ANIMATION (4/5) OVERALL (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is beautiful. Despite the fact that most of the sceneries are shot in wasteland and plain colors of dark, white grey, it appeals to the eye and fits the environment perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nPeople's face and body proportions are very close to the real life humans'. Except Pino. Well she is a Robot. \\n\\n\r\nMy only problem with the art is that when characters are far away from the camera, they become blurry. The outlines get very thick and the shapes are deformed. I suppose that's old technology's limit. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good. There are very little action scenes, but when there are, they are great. The objects and characters move little. Maybe the objects are also very symbolic and the people think too much? But the animation does it job, tho could be much better. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is an excellent song. Although I personally would not listen to it in the car. It fits the entire series with dark and gloom feel yet still expressive. The ending is fairly generic. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST tho, are not memorable. By that I mean I do not recognize and OST by itself. They don't stand on their own. Now it's difficult to say if it's a good thing of a bad thing, because the OST should not stand out too much to a point where it becomes a distraction. It blends in the anime awesomely. I don't have any complaint. They are great they way they fit in the series, but when I try to listen to the OST on its own, they are... meh. \\n\\n\r\nI watched Dub. I'd say the dub is very good. Vincent has its concerns, Re-L has the feel of mature and Pino is, well just being pino. It is one of the better dubs I've heard, so I would actually recommend it. The setting is not in Japan anyways. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI love stories that makes me think. It has an engaging and unique plot, interesting and likable characters, decent sound and art. Nothing much to talk about here, I enjoy it very much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that I love this series to a point that I want to rate it a masterpiece, it certainly has its problems. These problems can be seen differently by different people. If you want to watch this show, you need to commit about 6 or 7 episodes in cuz that's where I got hooked on. If you feel frustrated after that, well, 2deep4you. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

Ergo Proxy is absolutely fantastic!\r\nThe characters are superbly detailed, each having completely different personalities which you keep on discovering throughout the episodes. The soundtrack and art are amazing, though it is a very dark show. You\\'ll find yourself painstakingly searching for the right angle to look at your screen so that you get what\\'s going on, and jump back, blinded, when those few rare moments of light come sneaking through...\r\nThe plotline is splendid. You start out in a post apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear war. Most humans havefled to other planets, though a few survivors stayed on Earth and are now living in cities widely spread out in Domes, which are a sort of protective sheild against the now dangerous outer atmosphere. The main city is Romdeau and is ruled by a strict dictatorial regime. Also, humans now have auto raves, which are machines that become personal companions. Real Mayar, a detective, is one night attacked by a creature who is neither human nor machine, and she finds out about the mysterious &quot;Awakening&quot;. Throughout the episodes, Real will delve deeper into the mystery of these beings and find only one man can help reveal it: Vincent Law. \\n\r\nSurprising twists and turns leave you dying for more, and the show has good comic touches. In fact you don\\'t really know what\\'s hapening AT ALL until the last episode!!",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy\r\nMany already said about its cyberpunk elements and such.\r\nI will say that in regards of Science Fiction, plot development, execution and characterization, this anime is a True Masterpiece!\r\nThe very concept of why it all happened in the planet is a true concern some scientists have, about the methane hydrate layer and the possible consequences if it went volatile. Many power and fuel industries have already shown interest in extrating and using it to produce energy, as the tihng is really powerful...but one of its characteristics is its volaticity, and if by mistake a chain reaction was iniitated and the existing layer went into combustion...thelife on the planet would be decimated. Take a look about what exist about the matter. It is intersting.\\n\\n\r\nWell, thus it is based on solid science extrapolation. Then the story goes with really intellingent plot developments without loosing to pure psychological drama, as there is enough action woven in the series to satisfy any action lover without loosing the story to those action-oriented, boring plots.\\n\\n\r\nIt is intelligent and every episode lays another hit as to what is really happening...and in the end you finally discover everything, being presented to a really surprising truth, and a turn of events that is both pleasing and really surprising. \\n\\n\r\nThe nature of the Proxys is really explained, so the story is not left without a closure...but at the same time it ends in a cliffhanger, actually yelling that a sequel may be produced one day, though if that does not happen, the end is closure enough to the present story, leaving the rest for the imagination of the ones watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole concept was magistrally layered and the whole truth is only fully disclosed in the last episode, making the series grip you until the last minute, until the last, thrilling image, where in the last panel we have the realization that the end was possibly far from happening to that story.\\n\\n\r\nAbout art, needless to say, it is beautiful and well done, imparting an air of dreamlike reality to the characters, which is true given the truth behind the planet and everything happening there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFantastic Science Fiction, artfully executed!\\n\\n\r\nI just hope they really go for a sequel on this, as we surelly know after the last image we see that things were not resolved with the truth revealed, but it was just beginning, especially remembering what Vincent saw when he first left Rondeau...\\n\\n\r\nRemember...there was a child there...son of an exiled...and that implied something crucial to the whole story and that was  not there without a reason...\\n\\n\r\nMasterpiece from beginning to the end",

            "content": "This won't be a review of characters, of art, of sound, or other bs that has been repeated in 12 reviews already. This is one for those wondering \"Why the hell is this worth a 10?\" \"What's going on, what is so great here?!\" or just.. \"another 2c down the piggy's back\" Oh and yeah, it's as SPOILER FREE as you can get.\r\nI used to think, until the last few episodes, that they named dropped just for the sake of it but that's not true. What you need to understand is this: The series is humanity and its struggle metamorphosised. Probably the most important mentionhere is that of C.G. Jung. Keep in mind the following quote from him: \"When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate.\" Just think of that in relation to the journey of Vincent. The characters even realize (well not really they, obviously) in the last episodes that the journey is one they can only complete alone because you aren't going anywhere except inside yourself. This exactly the ''journey to the underworld\", which is just the repressed content, it's the unconcious. This is where you'll meet the shadow and \"come out the other side\" (give Tool - 46 & 2 a listen!) changed as a self-aware being.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole last 3-4 episodes are full of questions relevant to humanity as ever, whether it be the nature of reality, existence or the meaning of it all. You even have the glorious questioning of the status quo, parallels to past revolutions and the pointless struggle (of Real, in the last episode; but of humans in general) against the unchangeable path before her (them) - you always see it, whether it's in some anime where the main protagonist, usually ignorant of his \"potential\", tries to fight the big bad villain before he's ready just to be tossed aside and laughed at; or in real life where you have few people trying to fight against corruption, greed and cruelty, only to be found dead or intimidated into submission. It's the meaningless struggle I see people near me go through, they want to believe they can make a difference, they give it their all in spite of the simple fact that your efforts are useless. And what makes the series great isn't just the fact that it raises such issues (as well as many others) but that it manages to portray them so beautifully, so naturally... that's where you can see the gem shine because it has been polished and made into a gorgeous jewel.\\n\\n\r\nLike Dostoevsky said, \"Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult than to understand him.\" Likewise, nothing is easier than to say \"I don't like this because I don't relate to the characters or don't like their makeup, and wah wah wah\" and nothing harder than to try and understand it because that would require you to *gasp* read a book or something similarly dreadful. It would require you to acquire knowledge, to assimilate, analyze and synthesis it. It requires you to go outside of your comfort zone. And I'm sure it's much more easy to go watch some slice-of-life anime and go \"kawaiiiiiiiii\" than go the extra mile for this one.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the same thing as people reading mythology and thinking all the gods were just some sex and violence-crazy incestuous wackos when they don't even know the 101 of symbology. This is the blind man looking for the light; good luck pal, good luck! You'll get there one day, in another life, maybe as a cat.\\n\\n\r\nThese are by no means all the references present in the series, it's just the tip of it, the cherry on top. The series is still worth a view just for the splendid artwork but if you are the type of person that hears but doesn't listen then don't expect to get much more out of it.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else then at the very least you'll have your general culture level raised a notch by the explanations at the end of (almost) each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOver and out.",

            "content": "The future of humanity is an aspect that has always been pondered about in many epoch's and mediums, especially as of late with the ever-growing available technology. However, with the destructive and greedy nature of mankind, the annihilation of it is certainly an aspect to consider. This is the essence of a dystopian setting, which concerns in this specific case Ergo Proxy. It is a well crafted anime which provides viewers with a variety of themes throughout its duration, such as the coexistence between AI and society, or the acceptance of oneself, through the setting. With that being said, there where some issues that ultimatelydid hinder the immersion in its story and characters, leading to a less enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Ergo Proxy revolves around Re-I Meyer, the granddaughter of the regent of an isolated city dome, which protects its citizens from the inhospitable planet Earth has become. This society is in fact considered a Utopia, with the inclusion of highly intelligent robots called \"AutoRaves\", which of late seemingly are getting infected with the Cogito virus that drives these mad. It is up to inspector Meyer to investigate this occurrences, which somehow seem related with the immigrant Vincent Law - in addition to her coming in contact with the \"monsters\" called \"Proxy\". Curiosity awoken with such encounter, they set out on a journey to reveal this elusive subject.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime manages to encompass the scope of what is the barren and monotonous city its habitants live in, conveying what is wrong with that specific Utopia. It shows the viewer the disadvantages of having a desired, near to \"perfect\" lifestyle; it could be said that bad things are necessary to fully appreciate the good, a compensation process. This is combined with satisfactory world building, which is subtly relaid to the viewer through numerous events that occur in conjunction with story progression. Speaking of which, the pacing can feel \"off\" at times; this mainly concerns the intermission between the introductory events and the conclusion. These were sometimes a bit too slow-paced, whereas the conclusion was the exact opposite, and thus a what slower progression would have been desirable to fully grasp the information that is relaid.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Ergo Proxy touches upon several themes, one of the most intriguing ones the meaning of being human, or indirectly, the possession of a soul. This done through the representation of the AutoReivs and humanity - both of which contrast human emotions, the former seemingly more human than the latter, as these are basically stripped from feelings to be able to maintain the peace of the city. In addition, the anime displays to the audience the acceptance of oneself throughout the course of the story by representing the relationships and hardships the cast undergoes. However, in several occasions the show went around circles with some of its themes, several events being unnecessarily convoluted that didn't really add anything significant to the comprehension of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother to thing to note is that information about the world and its underlying mysteries are subtly shown to audiences through either the character's personalities and their interactions, besides its respective art style. There are however several problems at times with the approach on it, as viewers are suddenly introduced in situations without any prior knowledge on how or why the characters are there. The positive aspect to note is the fact that a great deal of information is relaid to the viewer, instead of infodumping through a simple narration. The problem in this lies that it breaks with the immersion in the narrative, and felt that could have been done in another manner. Surely enough, it helps to magnify the mystery surrounding the \"Proxy's\" and their respective actions and motives. This mainly affects two episodes in the anime, the quiz and smile episodes being of importance; thus I'd recommend paying attention to these instead. What was however lacking in my eyes, was ultimately the conclusion on the explanation of Proxy's and their origination, which was a thing I was eager to discover, assuming it was something somewhat plausible.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nConcerning its cast of characters, these were by no means vast, yet sufficient to properly convey the story. These were for the major part well presented, yet some characters either suffered shortcomings or were simply poorly done. There is the main protagonist Re-I Meyer, who basically represents how human nature has evolved - or devolved for the matter - being basically an emotionless being. Surely enough, the different situations she encounters herself in manages to change and reveal her \"humanity\" as story progresses. However, although some change is appreciated throughout the story, her character remains basically the same, as opposed as the viewer might expect. She remains the arrogant, egoistic person, yet with some human touch to it; as a whole, I found her to be uninteresting and boring as a character.\\n\\n\r\nOther character of interest is Vincent, a seemingly helpless and clumsy man always followed by bad luck; the fact that he has some sort of amnesia isn't helping either. In addition, he undergoes significant character development whilst discovering and exploring himself in his journey for the search of the truth, the Proxy. Naturally, anyone may ponder why these two main characters are together considering said personalities - said issues are mainly alleviated with their common goal and individual problems they face, in addition to the other character of importance, Pino. She, or \"that\", is an autoreiv who acts surprisingly human, contrasting with human society itself. Through her the anime manages to represents diverse themes Ergo Proxy has to offer, such as the meaning of being human. However, this character is ultimately a plot device, consequently not being of interest to the eyes of some.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the secondary characters, these were in general rather dull, yet often befitting of the narrative, especially in the case of the government officials. One character that stood out in this whole affair was Raul Creed, where audiences observe his struggles and changes in character due to the different mysteries he is exposed with because of his position. This could not be said of the other secondary character Daedalus, whose only purpose was so justify several flow of events; after those, he had no real relevance in the story. Naturally, other aspect to consider are the Proxy's themselves. These are crucial, and the motives behind these are well relaid to the viewer by contrasting the personalities of these with the world and humanity; furthermore, although not immediately apparent, it gives viewers insight in the story behind the devastation and their origins. However, I might point out that the power these possess is very dubious, which affects a bit the conclusion of the story - nevertheless, as centrepoints of the story, these are well executed and intriguing.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Ergo Proxy is well executed, especially in some instances; yet as a whole, it was inconsistent. Audiences observe at times some stunning backgrounds with great animation, whereas in other cases it had poor animation quality, in addition to some of its backgrounds. Other thing to note are the character designs; these are varied, yet felt at times \"off\" in some occasions, especially when viewed in different angles. I might want to add the bunny costume of Pino felt unnecessary, not befitting of its setting. In addition, the anime was at times too dark, where there was little to no contrast with all the different things in it, which hindered the viewing experience. However, it must be said that the colour palette used for the art style fits magnificently in the atmosphere the anime is trying to portray.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music score, all the different compositions used in matched wonderfully with the atmosphere of the anime, utilizing a great variety of these for each different situation; it is simply outstanding. It manages to pull in and immerse audiences in the story and its setting magnificently, each depending on the tone the series tries to employ at a given time. As for the voice actors, these performed their roles well (both japanese and english), matching with the different personalities, especially in the case of Pino. The opening and ending themes were well done, with Radiohead and their song \"Paranoid Android\" as the ending theme, which was very much to my liking.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy was overall a good anime, with a fascinating premise, its themes, and soundtrack; what however made me not fully enjoy this work were all the little gripes that I had with it. There were several times when the anime was more convoluted than necessary, the conclusion was a bit lacking considering the high quality of the beginning of the show; also some of the characters were not interesting at a personal level, which further minimized my enjoyment. This is not to say that it is overall lacking; no, for some the earlier mentioned points could be easily ignored and thus not regarded as \"issues\". I might want to mention that it is necessary to pay attention to the little details the show offers through its setting, characters and story, as these are not spoon-fed to the audience. So do I recommend Ergo Proxy? I certainly do, yet be warned, attention is necessary to fully appreciate this piece.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is a bit of a difficult show to review. There's many positive elements, and at the same time many negative elements. At times I loved the show, and other times I was bored with it.\r\nThe story tends to be the biggest reason for my mixed opinion. It starts off very strong, painting a very interesting picture of the world, the main cast, and their relation to each other. Yet, it also introduces some mysterious plot elements. Now, these mysterious elements didn't bother me the first time they were introduced. However, halfway through the series, most of the questions get answered. I was hopingthat the clandestine nature of the plot would end there, but they kept introducing more vague questions, episode after episode, creating an overly complex plot that really wasn't necessary. All of these questions get wrapped up during the final three episodes, but they just seemed completely un-necessary in the first place. It seems like the show uses an overly complex plot as a crutch, to prop up a story that doesn't need to be. However, the show doesn't know how to properly use a crutch, and it takes that crutch and essentially beats the story over the head... ruining what would have otherwise been a perfectly fine tale.\\n\\n\r\nYet, between all of that, there's still some really nice storytelling to be had, and some really great character moments. Many of the characters were well developed and managed to grow over the course of the series as well. Pino is my personal favorite. Yet, despite that growth, they also seemed to end up at the same point as where they started. In fact, by the end, it seemed like the series was eating it's own tail in terms of it's characters.\\n\\n\r\nAside from all that, the art seemed good for the most part. There were certainly times where it looked better than others. All of the art stays pretty consistent in terms of style, of course... it's just the quality that fluctuates. At times it was breathtaking, and other times I thought it looked kind of middling and standard.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio mix is well done, creating a nice, futuristic atmosphere... while not feeling too crazy or overdone. The soundtrack is your pretty standard fare. It didn't stand out, but worked nicely to set the tone. I watched the English dub of the show, and thought most of the voice actors were great. The main cast, and much of the supporting cast did a great job of bringing life to these characters, making them feel like real people. I also thought it was a really nice touch that the voice actors for the androids all sounded appropriately robotic. The delivery on those lines all sounded like robots trying to evoke emotion, and while that doesn't sound like a compliment, the actors really sold it, and it worked incredibly well within the context of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ergo Proxy is a series that I enjoyed, but had a few elements that really brought it down. If the story was less convoluted, and the art was tightened up in spots, I may have given this series a higher score. Hell, some of the episodes even feel like they deserve a higher score, divorced from the rest of the series' over-arching plot. Yet, as a whole, Ergo Proxy comes off as a mixed bag, and in that sense it's disappointing. However, I still recommend fans of the genre to check it out, if only for the handful of moments where it really shines and becomes something special.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nHave you ever seen an art house film? Perhaps a film by David Lynch or Cronenberg? Perhaps you have heard of the film Solaris by Tarkovsky (not that garbage remake)? Solaris combines an interesting science fiction plot with realistic characters, existentialist themes, and of course mind bending WTF moments. What if you brought Tarkovsky back from the dead, flew his ass to Japan, and made him direct an anime? The result would be Ergo Proxy!\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story takes place in what appears at first to be a utopian future, but soon we see the truth is somewhat darker. Everyone is born with a given purpose.People are artificially grown and have long lost the ability to reproduce naturally through sex. People are ruled very closely by a council of intelligent super computers and their decisions are made for them. Androids act as servants for mankind, but are beginning to gain artificial intelligence due to the \"cognito\" computer virus and starting to rebel. The Earth's environment has been so completely destroyed that people are forced to live in domed cities, that they are born in and will almost certainly die in without ever knowing what's outside. It is unknown in the main city how many other domed cities are left out there, but it is said that a war took place a few years before the start of the story between 2 of them. The most mysterious creatures of this world are the Proxy, which have immortality like Gods due to having cells with no Hayflick limit that can divide infinitely without telomere shortening or other problems. The Proxy also have superhuman strength, speed, and powers, but little is known about them. Most denizens of the dome called Romdeau are unaware that Proxy even exist. A police investigator named Re-L pronounced \"real\" (did I mention this was an existentialist series), is sent to investigate a mysterious murder and encounters 2 Proxies. She then meets an unusual man named Vincent Law who claims to have come from another dome city, but has lost much of his memory. Together the 2 must find the secrets of this twisted world and most importantly, what are the proxies and why do they exist?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nRe-L is a no nonsense, strong female protagonist and a highly competent  detective. Although she can act spoiled at times, and can be quite unintentionally funny. Re-L seems cold and heartless at first, but she learns to care for Vincent and the adorable Pinako and does actually have a strong sense of justice. Vincent is about the 5,000th anime main character to suffer from amnesia, but we will cut him a bit of slack. He is actually a fairly interesting character the more we learn about him and his past. Pinako is an android in the form of a little girl. She provides much the comedy in this series and pretty much all of the awww how adorable moments. I'm surprised Rena from Higurashi didn't invade out of left screen and run off carrying Pinako. There are other characters too including the fabulously gay Raoul, and the ever creepy scientist Daedalus. Is Daedalus a man or a woman? I'm not sure we will ever know. Even Freeza was less gender ambiguous.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy looks great in its character designs, backgrounds, and animation. The often haunting and surreal visuals are a huge part of this series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nRadiohead FTW!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nRemember in the overview when I compared it to Solaris? That was a movie where the director intentionally made the first 20 minutes as boring as possible so in his own words: \"all the stupid people will leave the theater\". Ergo Proxy is kind of like that. It has some VERY slow portions and you will also HATE this series if you demand everything make sense right away. Ergo Proxy loves above all else to fuck with the viewer's mind. Your brain will probably explode at least a dozen times watching Ergo Proxy, so I am not sure if its healthy to watch in one binge. This anime has more mind fuck moments than any anime I have ever seen. It makes Eraser Head look like a normal everyday popcorn flick.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a VERY different and unique series that I would highly recommend checking out. I mentioned in my Mushishi review that Ergo Proxy is more similar to Mushishi than anything else I have seen, but distinctly different at the same time. Mushishi doesn't want to mess with your mind so badly and each episode actually makes sense the first time you watch it. However, the artsy, serious, somber, and philosophical nature of both shows so far removed from fan service, harems, and other anime cliche's are quite similar. I personally liked Ergo Proxy more than Mushishi, but I am aware that I am in the minority on that one. Ergo Proxy doesn't have any characters quite as charismatic and popular as Ginko. What it does have is more of plot with a lot more to tease your brain and make you think.\\n\\n\r\nPS. you can also play the Ergo Proxy drinking game. Every time someone name drops a famous philosopher take a drink. Every time a scene references a famous movie take a drink. (take 3 vodka shots if its Battleship Potemkin). Every time Raoul appears on screen dressed fabulous take a sip. (you don't want to die of cirrhosis). Every time you here someone scream VINCENTO RAW take a sip. Every time something bizarre and totally random happens take a drink. You thought the \"Withnail and I\" drinking game was bad? You haven't played this one.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I decided to rewatch Ergo Proxy, seeing as I just didn't remember anything about it from the last time I watched, aside that it was a massive mindfuck and a very entertaining series. The rewatch really did remind me again why I thought so. It really doesn't do anything half assed.\r\nFrom the very start, the style of the series strikes true for the dystopian society of a post apocalyptic future it shows, both with the stunning art that is combined with excellent animation, and chilling music. There's just something strangely alluring about the contrast of light and dark present everywhere in the art, even asit never shows a hint of simplicity. And of course, I personally absolutely love the design of Re-l (which is showed by my avatar, as usual), one of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs contrast to the explosive start, the series progressed at a very calm pace at many points, and even seemingly went off the rails at times. On one hand, I feel the pacing is perhaps the biggest weakness of the entire show, but on the other hand I never felt bored for a long amount of time. In fact, it was very much welcome when I had a moment to calm down, because even at its slower points the series kept me very tense most of the time. The feeling of a completely uncertain world was very impressively depicted by the story, and I was afraid to feel affection towards any single character in the show with the knowledge that the world really didn't care much about what happened to them.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, I appreciated every single character in the show for what they provided. Perhaps it managed to go even deeper than that. Despite the chaotic setting, the story itself was in truth quite straightforward and meticulously constructed. The pre-planned purpose of every character in the story was not just a matter of their parts in the story, but also dealt with as a theme throughout the series. In fact, the series showed wonderful self awareness in dealing with this, rather than the usual the curious contradiction of praising human free will while ignoring the fact that every expression of the was in truth constructed by the creator of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSuch self awareness and introspection from the view point of the creator of the story was present throughout the series, in many different ways. This lead to another aspect of the show that could be considered a weakness. Aside the pacing being strange, the story also wasn't presented in as straightforward fashion as it seemingly travelled. At times there was seemingly huge differences between where the last episode left off and where the new one started, in a couple of cases completely jarring. The couple of the more extreme cases I do believe were poorly handled, but the way the series was structured in itself wasn't necessarily bad. In most cases, every episode dealt with a different theme, most of which were both very philosophical and deeply psychological, and they did so very well. What was really jarring was that the writer seemingly saw it purposeful to interject the view points of both themselves and the watchers directly into the story. While I understand the purpose of this, especially in such an experimental show, I do think it wasn't worth it in every case.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of philosophical and psychological... I think this is a prime example of what a lot of people would call pretentious. I personally disagree on that. When I originally watched the series years ago, neither my brain nor my understanding of philosophy were nearly enough developed to really grasp most of it, but even then I don't think I ever dismissed it as just being nonsense. I'm glad about that, because on this rewatch I feel like I was actually able to keep up very well, even through the less elegant twists of the story. There each case there was some real thought put into it, but the really impressive part was that all of these ideas were able to be delivered without the attempt to insert conclusions into them. One of the key things in succesfully writing something like this is the ability to keep in mind one's own fallibility, which I think was achieved in this case.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the story and the characters managed to enthrall me quite well. Even as it dealt with complex themes, the story managed to keep a certain necessary simplicity to it. For the most part, actual unnecessary elements were eliminated, thus keeping the story well on its track until the very end. Where it sadly stumbled a little bit, as often is. The conclusion was satisfactory in a manner, so I feel there is no need to harp on it too much, but it didn't reach quite the potential such a show had. Perhaps it was because there was actually in the end a certain unnecessary element, brought into it in an attempt to reach the excellence the ending deserved, but departing from the solid progression of the story in a harmful way. It's also entirely possible that there really actually just wasn't enough to the story in its simplicity, though I personally do find that complications added for the sake of it aren't necessary for a grand conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think this anime is possibly one of the best things ever. It's also entirely possible that I'm just a pretentious prick that enjoyed it simply because I felt I understood something complicated that perhaps wasn't fully there in the first place.",

            "content": "The thing that drew me to anime in the first place besides style , it was that writers weren't afraid to raise big questions and make the answers interpretable so that the viewer could have a say.It was the philosophic and psychological elements that made me realize that this medium was to be taken seriously.Ergo proxy is a show that celebrates al those elements, and it does it in style.\r\nStory-9/10\r\nIf i could sum up the story of Ergo Proxy in one word it would be EPIC.The show starts as a generic cyber-punk anime only to evolve into more of a dark fantasy set in adistopian and apocalyptic world. The story is more about perception of ones self, and the journey of understanding ones self. Now the story is very character driven and one can argue that as far as plot progress goes mostly 90% of episodes are fillers. The show because of this becomes very complex as viewers sometimes cant tell whats real and whats happening in the characters heads . But i personally enjoyed this but someone else might not.the story manages to explain every hole and does have a somewhat satisfying conclusion and a highly climatic one.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8/10\\n\r\nThe backrounds for the show are very beautiful and detailed , also the characters desing are good. The proxy desings are amazing and the last episode has some of the most beautiful images in the anime world. But characters looks and movements were inconsistent and sometimes they looked plain auwful. And I didn't think that it was due to budget cuts or anything but due to laziness , cause ergo proxy looked beautiful when it had to.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtract for the show is amazing. The oppening is one of the best I have ever heard and the ending is paranoid android by radiohead, you can't go wrong with that. The soundtrack consists mostly of suthing and beautiful music that fit the show perfectly.The dub is one of the best around and it just sounds right, it was really amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-9/10\\n\r\nErgo Proxy has some of the most emotionally and mentally broken characters I have ever seen. Wether it is a spoiled detective, a man who seeks answers for his past, robots who acknowledge themselfs and a lot of others. Now i don't want to go to them specifically cause to explain the correctly i would have to spoil a lot and there is nothing in this world i hate mote than spoilers. But i have to say that Pino is one of the cutest and most likeable characters in anime . She ROCKS.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9/10\\n\r\nAs much as the show had some minor flaws i really did enjoy this show from start to finish for the most part. Some information is dumped sometimes which i didn't like. The ending is sometimes confusing but is really legendary. The show has substance and is highly intellectual  and I really do recommend this show to anyone who is looking for something mind bending.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall i give this show an \\n\r\n9 out of 10.\\n\r\n( I hope you liked this review, i am hoping for some feed back because this is my first review)\\n",

            "content": "My Opinion: \r\nErgo Proxy is a successful blend of numerous genres, a show that contains many hidden meanings and symbologies, employing a complex yet solid plot and featuring strong but delicate characters.\r\nSeeing Proxy felt like watching a mix of the movies Oblivion, Automata and Equilibrium with the execution of Alien, once I finished watching Ergo Proxy I was left feeling empty and pondering about the messages and themes the show portrayed and ultimately contemplating what living and being alive actually mean. \r\nErgo Proxy is the one show I would have rated 10/10 if it weren\u2019t for episodes 15 and 19 which did not fit thetone of the show and disturbed the pacing, and another few flaws, the series would have been better off without those 2 episodes even though they did have a purpose of giving some information and answering some questions.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story is successfully merging numerous symbologies, themes and genres being original, deep, clever and is one of the most brilliantly executed and paced stories I have ever seen, leaving almost no room for improvement, attempting to reach perfection. \\n\r\nI praise the creators of Ergo Proxy for being able to join all those genres and events into one logical and continuous flowing storyline. The plot twists, unexpected events and scenes that seem to make no sense are fused together and form a coherent story, with each episode adding something new and further developing the plot in a subtle and yet clear manner.\\n\\n\r\nOn a fundamental level the story is a journey of self-discovery, teaching people to create and follow their own path rather than pursuing or imitating others, which requires that you must first discover who you really are and understand the world that surrounds you before creating your own path.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy employes an astonishing number of symbols and allegories that require the viewer\u2019s interpretation for the story to make sense and be comprehended. These allegories and symbols are various, referring to Descartes' philosophy (I am, therefore I think), Greek mythology(Icarus), the origin of life paradox and religion among many other things which can be very confusing to some viewers on the other hand, the abundance of symbols and allegories is what makes the series so intriguing and engaging.\\n\r\nThere are some odd things like the robot being able to use that air musical instrument even though it had no lungs but those things in no way influence the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nSince this show is about self-discovery it is only logical that the characters would be one of the factors the show focuses most on therefore resulting in a story-driven show that puts much weight and attention on the characters, including the support ones.\\n\r\nErgo Proxy has original incredibly well developed, characterized and round/well-balanced characters that are highly interesting, never ending to amaze me and never exceeding or exaggerating their limits and skills, which separates Proxy from other shows of the same genre.\\n\\n\r\nVincent Law is a man who lost most of his memories therefore he is not very confident of himself and yet he is strong in his own way. Vincent\u2019s character started off as a lower member of the society and throughout the series he develops into a completely different man and even a different being if I may say so. Vincent\u2019s main goal is to find his true self/ego thus his journey of self-discovery begins.\\n\\n\r\nRe-l Mayer is an intelligent, confident and highly skilled \u201cinvestigator\u201d that acts cold and superior due to her high social status as the \u201cRegent\u2019s\u201d grandchild and important job she performs. At first she acts very cold (especially towards Vincent) but as the story progresses so does her character and their relationship, making clear that Re-l is a normal girl who has normal natural emotions and needs.\\n\\n\r\nPino is a child robot designed to keep others company, her main purpose in the show is playing the role of a stress-reliever in order to compensate for the dark and serious tone of the series. Pino is a lovely character that never gets annoying, she acts exactly how she is supposed to act, like a child, playing and fooling around and constantly experimenting new things.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid and the art is great but it has some flaws regarding the character design (mostly Vincent and Re-l) which I did not find to be too disturbing. The colors mostly tend to have a dark/grey tone which perfectly fits the style of the show and give an immersive and suggestive experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nErgo Proxy has an amazing opening theme, a good ending theme and engaging background music. Although I wished for a bit more background music I found the existing sound to be more than sufficient, the voice actors did a great job as well (especially the Eng. dub actors).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI honestly loved this show, it is very complex and yet so entertaining, it features great characters and a great story resulting in, of course, a great show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is an amazing show that employs a complex but coherent plot with strong characters and conveys numerous messages and ideologies, all done in an impeccable manner. I highly recommend watching this show.",

This is my first and only review since it is the only show I will acknowledge as an absolute in every aspect of humanity, knowledge, art, imagination and nature.\r\nRarely do you see a show that attempts to cover a huge part of history and reality itself within this art style. And when they usually try, most of the time it ends failing in certain aspects because of the lack of connection between particular things in set show, or the lack of information and effort put into set show. I have given arating of 10 for 6 shows that are made on another level compared to anything else I have experienced in any kind of media. And if you go and see my list, I am sure that each and every one of them deserve it, regardless of what they were portraying. But never in my life did I think that I would find a show that can successfully adapt every aspect of those amazing shows. Never did I think that a show can portray so much in such a breathtaking manner as Ergo Proxy did.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nThe story of this show is written in a mysterious manner that takes you on a journey of discovery from the first to the last episode. Every episode is written so that it has a metaphor to some aspect of human history of philosophy, psychology, literature, art and/or science. Every second of the plot is twisting into an unknown future where you question everything that comes to the thinking mind. It challenges the viewer to try to comprehend it's seemingly unending and confusing storytelling within storytelling. It is written to the upmost level of excellency that not everyone can comprehend. Watching as the story progresses I found myself more and more driven inside of my mind, trying (and thankfully succeeding most of the time) to understand and cherish its brilliance. Set in a melancholic, dystopian earth, it manages to portray the past, present and future in a truly awe-inspiring, dark, psychological, demented relationship of humankind and the ideas and realities behind divine deities.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThe dark, misty and sad tone of the world depicted is nigh irreplaceable. Every location has it's own unique way of expressing what the story is trying to tell. Every dome uniquely crafted to represent different parts of the world. Every molecule shivering in the shadows, casting the dark glare of despair upon everything. And as far as the character's designs go, well, they are not only memorable and beautifully drawn, they all manage to pull of the exact look they need to have for the role they play. Especially Ergo Proxy and Re-l Mayer.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThe music director on the board is Ueda Yasuyuki, and as he has proven himself previously, he managed to create one of the best possible playlists that continually provide the show with it's necessary tone and fuels the characters forward. The ending theme is yet another fantastic song by Radiohead - Paranoid Android, reminding you of the character's behaviour in the show every time you hear it. And then there is the opening theme,  with the song Kiri by Monoral. And I can only describe it as the single most breathtaking, dark, desperate, melancholic, artistically challenging, mind-blowing, goosebumps-giving, nostalgic and beautiful opening I have ever heard and experienced...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nI can't say much about the characters of the show without spoiling any of them, but I will try my best. Each character (whether main or not) has a singular purpose that he/she/it will fulfill. They all represent different forms of human emotions, though collections, behaviour, relationships and most important of all - forever questioning intelligent beings capable of creating the most bizarre, provoking and rule-bending stories that seem ceaseless throughout time and space. Although it might seem that their build up is slow from the start, every moment they exist is of great significance. They way they unravel different truths throughout the story shapes them in ways that are simply put human, making the evaluations and principles of humans which are regarded as universally valid, not applicable, or at least questioned with doubt. Also the conversations and interactions led between characters are sure to make you feel the millennia of human evolution.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nThey way that all of the previous elements interact with each other gives a sensation while watching that is yet to be rivaled from anything that I have ever experienced. The pacing of the show is excellent, the character development is astonishing, the animation and music are gonna make you remember them for as long as you live. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, all I can say is that this show is even beyond the \"not-everyday,not for everyone\" anime that I know of. It was an experience that will not be replaced by anything, at least for me. The entangled story will meet it's final form at the end, and it will surely leave you speechless, enjoying the silence after the Ultimo.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was pumped to watch this anime as I know it's generally highly regarded and the box art and back of box description seemed very cool and right up my alley. Furthermore, it had one of the very best opening episodes I've ever seen in any anime, so I quickly had sky high expectations. In the end, I watched a hard to follow, convoluted, disjointed mess with huge pacing issues and a bigger picture message repeatedly force-fed down my throat.\r\nArt-\r\nI'd give the art high praise. The direction of this anime was solid with numerous professionally executed camera tricks. The dark, bleak art style perfectly suitsthe tone and message of the anime and the animation is smooth throughout. No qualms here.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nSolid voice acting, believable sound effects and a solid, though not overly memorable after the fact, soundtrack. I liked the opening and closing songs for sure and there were some creepy and tense background songs too at appropriate moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and the story are where this anime craps the bed. The plot is absolutely all over the place, convoluted, disjointed, confusing, hard to follow and has major pacing issues. It felt like the anime was divided as follows- 3-4 \"beginning\" episodes, 16+ \"middle\" episodes and 3 \"ending\" episodes. The middle part felt like it really dragged on for a long time. Also, there were random episodes where completely out of nowhere the characters were on a game show or in an amusement park, which definitely didn't do it for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot has a bigger picture message or two it wants to give you and it's not remotely subtle about it. It's absolutely shoved down your throat over and over again, especially near the end.  Throughout this anime, and even after its conclusion, I found it really difficult to follow what was going on and to connect all the dots. I felt the story, though it tried to go for something deep, was largely just a mess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nIf we're being honest, I didn't particularly enjoy this anime. I didn't hate it, but the middle section felt overly drawn out and at times boring- there were more than one \"do nothing\" episodes- and it was really hard to truly get into it and get invested when I spent most of my viewing experience confused and not knowing what was going on. As stated above, while I think the CONCEPT of the plot was solid, I think the execution was quite poor and it ended up a convoluted mess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like it and I was super hyped after the first episode, but ultimately I felt wildly let down and disappointed and felt the execution of its concept was done rather poorly.\\n\\n\r\n+Deep concept\\n\r\n+Solid direction and voice acting throughout\\n\r\n+Visually nice\\n\\n\r\n-Pacing issues\\n\r\n-Convoluted, disjointed, confusing, hard to follow plot\\n\r\n-\"Bigger picture message\"/\"Moral of the story\" absolutely shoved down the viewer's throat\\n\\n\r\nOverrated and meh...\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 5 Very average in all honesty\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- Strong 4 Weak 5",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nBefore start i will not include spoilers in this review (or at least keep it at minimum possible).\r\nYou know in every piece of entertainment,  especially in fiction, there are always  \r\nexamples of works, that try, to entertain/please   the viewer in 2 ways. \r\nBy either trying to appeal to as much different groups of consumers,\r\n as possible  with mix of various themes, that specially strike not to say pander to certain people which can be done in quality way by putting thoughts\r\ninto it thinking about consumers needs, or just for the profit which can be hit or miss. \r\nAndother way to reach viewer, would be more dangerous, but potentially more impactful as well, by narrowing down themes presented,\\n\r\nkeeping way of directing purely for needs of author, and vision of end result without much safe thinking no matter how unusual it may sound.\\n\r\nErgo Proxy fits into second category perfectly now to explain why.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSetting and Direction :  \\n\r\nErgo Proxy is set in a world, that at first, may seem as deja-vu post apocalypse ruined earth in not so  far anymore future.\\n\\n\r\nWith technology outburst and humans, being less and less of humans we know at present and non humanoid beings Auto Reivs doing large chunk of dutties for us  .\\n\\n\r\nRemainings of the earth cities go, into special system that tries to make the most of what is left both from resources and population standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nWe all probably watched quite a few, or many post apocalyptic movies with flicks about natural disasters caused by either \\n\r\nforce of nature or full on action scenarios, with bulky robots destroying everything up.\\n\r\nDont get me wrong Ergo Proxy setting was used before but not so much in a way EP did it .\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very start this series, gives you quite obvious signals that it will not be about just resolving present problems, pure survival, recovery  or giant explosions everywhere this is not Terminator.\\n\\n\r\nIt is more about layered Mystery, and  realizing what is real and what is just desperation and routine playing with our minds espect large analyze of mind in specific situations and philosophical themes . \\n\\n\r\nAdd cryptic dusty nature of series, and  way of directing with giving just enough side clues for one to start putting individual puzzles along with watching what actually happens.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you are into that kind off story telling, where problems must be identified to be even considered as problems this is anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nThink of Evangelion and Ghost in Shell  as refference since i cant resist but to notice combined elements of them everywhere in this anime since you can ask 5 persons to say their image of it after completing it and get 5 different answers for what this anime was about. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory & Pacing :\\n\\n\r\nStory can be described with words commonly reffered, in this anime  as raison d'etre is a term used to signify one's own existence purpose of life. Since it is so difficult doing non spoiler review for this show.\\n\\n\r\nOpening parts start with showing 1 of remaining cities,  of romdeau being monitored and controlled in most literal sense of word possible. \\n\\n\r\nBy Intelligence Bureau which is only source of law and direction for remaining population of city. Despite being monitored constantly and equiped with only the most nessesary life resources and without \\n\r\nalmost any freedom, ever since birth, i cant explain why exactly without spoiling. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPeople agree too survive and reach recovery someday not surprising, except nothing is as it seems remmember this when you watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nAll that soon changes when suddenly mysterious being appears from the shadows and spokes these words Everything became so clear we must punish them, followed by can you hear  Pulse of Awakening?\\n\\n\r\nNext you see false sense of security, is shattered and city becomes disrupted. By both Disappearance of precious  Proxy that was keeped in romdeu and Auto Reivs robots going wild against commands all that combined unleashed chaos .  \\n\\n\r\n Re-L Mayer investigator in inteligense Bureau is sent to investigate the case but in the process is attacked by another mysterious being. \\n\\n\r\nSince that moment she gets uncontrollable curiousity, which leads her to discovering  more about 1  particular man named Vincent Law. \\n\r\nWho on first look looks nothing like someone, that could be source of events that occured prior. \\n\\n\r\nBut without important spoiling i can say that Vincent and Re-L are core reasons for many themes in ergo proxy.\\n\\n\r\nThemes like living under glass bell, god complex, narcissism, identity crisis, reconstruction  of reasons behind human empathy and patterns in living and ruling and so on.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways 1 of major points for about series, story besides revealing all mysteries behind chaos,infected auto reivs,  relations between proxies humans and events prior to start of everything nasty  on earth . \\n\\n\\n\r\nIs  in reaching self awareness and self understanding people lost it ages ago but somehow both Vincent and Re-L are pushing on oposite sides trying to reach different but at same time same goals. \\n\r\nVery much like actual people we so much try to explain ourselves to others while not keeping attention of what other side think about it. What human is what heading towards idealism leads to?\\n\\n\r\nThat road is not so fast and pacing in first 6 or so episodes can seem quite slow but it is nessesary for questions to accumulate and world build, when things actually start to open they never stop.\\n\\n\r\nAside from mentioned stuff story makes you think about just how much can humans be self destructive assholes to both themselfs and world and really adds  more fears for the future sine taking that much for granted is fastest way to oblivion basic powerfull truth .\\n\\n\r\nWhen roads unite things get even more complicated and during the course of series you will constanly wonder who is the real culpit in whole story.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not all about destination it is about experience and that can be said in so many ways in case of EP and depending of how you connected you may draw much different conclusion then i am . \\n\r\nThat is beaty of mysteries isnt it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & animation\\n\r\nArt is beautiful done mostly in dark pitch black tone and modest quite   realistic lines in shapes of characters eyes,arms and bodies.  \\n\\n\r\nWhich may seem weird if you are too used to oversized moe blobs which in this case is  1 of big signs that you are better avoiding this series. \\n\\n\r\nCgi for fights and movements of robotic parts, helicopters and so on range from very good to semi choppy in case of rail shooting scenes for example.\\n\r\nRocks falling, surface cracking, body detaching are all examples of overall pretty consistent animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\\n\r\nOST-s in ergo proxy are mixed with cyber punk and more of techno industrial vibe. It fits nicely to whole theme behind it and all no problems at all silent moments are never ruined by it and intense moments have proper background bgms. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nRe-L is as i pointed out quite open minded, and extremely curious and righteous about world in comparison, to others to the point of looking unnatural for envirmoment she is in.\\n\\n\r\nBut can be quite demanding,awkward and unreasonably arogant towards others esp vincent which keeps her from being 1 sided character and gives her depth.\\n\\n\r\nPino is in show mostly for keeping at least bit of light tone, in otherwise very intense depressive atmosfere by being adorable.\\n\\n\r\nShe also adds theme of human superiority complex, over other forms of life and not even system when it comes to recognizing what can and what can not have emotion.\\n\\n\r\nVincent  is self conflicting character, who suffers from major case of lower worth issue and cant seem to know how to express himself well but knows how to listen and obbey orders. \\n\\n\r\nAs oposite  to hot tempered RL which listens only when Grandpa tells her. His  character growing is simetric with growth of the anime itself the more he opens up the worse and better situation gets.\\n\\n\r\nRaul is type of character that listens to what he wants to hear, and closes on what he is not interested in.\\n\\n\r\nHe is only character that seems to resemble real politicians, and like them he is character you are supposed to hate at first but understand his pov after you know those close  to him.\\n\\n\r\nAlso he is only 1 besides 1 other person that i cant mention that has his clear vision of system that he would apply to people.\\n\r\nBut since he is not in position to be at the top, he instead gets disorted from following commands from  above.\\n\\n\r\nDaedalus his role is quite big but for me to tell you, i would need to go into major spoilers.\\n\r\nInstead i will tell you this imagine what blind love, can do to person now amplify that with facts that source for that blind love cant be reached without major violations.\\n\\n\r\nWell thats him in nutshell creepy obsessed little lab weirdo, who sets his goals above any immoral means or tools needed to achieve it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall most of characters in this show can be considered as real characters instead of placeholders, they all create synergy and very much contribute to the world. \\n\r\nUnlike type of series that fokus on creating 1 or memorable protagonists while neglecting side cast largely to make protagonist i wont argue which way is better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion Ergo Proxy is not anime for everyone,  people should not change themselves but adapt if they are not sure\\n\r\n to really have patience, high enough attention to pull through rough start.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If to be great is to be misunderstood, then Ergo Proxy is truly one of the greatest anime ever. It\u2019s second only to Future Diary in how everyone misinterprets it, both the fans and the haters. Some of what you heard is true. It\u2019s experimental, bizarre and sometimes a little too vague. Yet no one talks about how it\u2019s not experimental in the conventional, silly way. No one mentions how human the story is, or how traditional it is at the same time.\r\nSomewhere at its heart is a very traditional story. It starts off with a mystery and later becomes a journey of self-discovery, awild adventure with stand-alone set-pieces. Being experimental isn\u2019t denying common structures but creating your own. The weirdest anime have a familiar side. They distort common tropes and structures and build something new out of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime makes its intentions very clear at the beginning. You know this is a deep sci-fi story because there\u2019s no info dumps. Techno-babble is common in sci-fi and its antithesis. Sci-fi is about exploring the implications of technologies and possibles futures. How exactly a technology will work is work for scientists. The purpose of storytellers is to try to predict how it will effect us psychologically and philosophically.\\n\\n\r\nHuman relying on intelligent robots is familiar, but the anime is more focused on what it means. Machines are just advanced tools. Humanoid robots aren\u2019t meant to be actual humans, but serve various factions. How far does a tool advance before it stops being a tool? The companion model is important. Tools are supposed to solve technical problems \u2013 they help us build, repair and cook. Yet here\u2019s a tool whose purpose is to address a psychological problem.\\n\\n\r\nPsychological problems are bigger than technical problems. The toaster is either broken or fixed and, in general, doesn\u2019t have a will of its own. Psychology leads to wants and needs. Psychology is dynamic and is constantly changing. A tool that cannot solve a psychological problem without having long-term effects.\\n\\n\r\nIntelligence is also important for the development of psychology. The more complex the problem, the more complex the tool has to be. Eventually we develop intelligent tools, but intelligence leads to psychology, to asking questions. But the AutoReives don\u2019t have to ask too much. The main philosophical question \u2013 why live? \u2013 has been answered inside their programming. The designer of the tool decides its purpose. It designs the tool for a specific problem.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, this is the argument for the non-existence of a God or for an indifferent God. Human beings don\u2019t have their reasons of existence written in their code. The only humans who do are humans born in artificial wombs. Vincent is the prime example of the Absurd Man. If you\u2019re confused over what happens to him, that\u2019s okay. He\u2019s just as confused like most people are. Unlike the AutoReives, he has to put conscious effort, to break out of his comfort zones to find meaning.\\n\\n\r\nEven the pre-programmed people aren\u2019t safe from the nature of reality. Intelligence is only useful if it\u2019s able to develop on its own. An intelligent tool has to continue to learn, or else it\u2019s not intelligent at all and can\u2019t deal with the most complex problems. Either reality shifts and make us question our purpose, or our intelligence develops and leads us to these questions. That\u2019s what the Cogito virus really is, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s Pino\u2019s arc. She starts off pre-programmed with a clear purpose. As she gathers experience, she develops a worldview, wants and needs. The line isn\u2019t between men and machine. It\u2019s between men and tools.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is mostly about the search for meaning. It\u2019s appropriate because the anime sometimes can\u2019t hold on to that. The conclusion it reaches is a familiar one, but I don\u2019t think anyone has yet to supply a better answer. We cannot stop the search. Romdeau may be sealed and ordered, but the Cogito virus still exploded. People still wondered what\u2019s going on, and Lil Mayar found a purpose of her own besides merely existing. Human connection is also important. When everything falls, there are still people to hold on to.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime mirrors the characters and humanity in general. It bumbles from style to style. The atmosphere is fairly consistent with the anime mainly borrowing from genres rather than jumping into them. Still, the theme is either pushed too upfront with name-dropping of philosophers or hidden in episodes that don\u2019t relate to this. That\u2019s why being aware of traditional storytelling is useful. Merely rejecting them is silly when they\u2019re a useful crutch.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, falling back on tropes is a bad sign. Cliches without verve are offensively boring. Ergo Proxy\u2018s case isn\u2019t giving up. Rather, it focuses on having a surface as attractive as its depths. There\u2019s no reason to cover up a deep story with a boring surface, anyway. The mystery and the adventure are just as intriguing. While the tonal shifts aren\u2019t huge with few moments of lighthearted fun, there\u2019s variety in the set-pieces. It especially improves when the anime slides into its adventure arc. The set-pieces are varied and often bizarre. Episodes are told in different ways, and are often self-contained.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it feels like you missed episodes, but only because the focus is on making the episode an individual creation. The connection to past events is made later. The focus is more on the story. That\u2019s another thing people miss about the anime. For all its talk about philosophy, Ergo Proxy isn\u2019t a collection of weird images and stoic phases. It\u2019s heavy on storytelling, on characters interacting and things happening. It rarely, if ever, stops to inform the audience on its philosophical nature. When the AutoReives cry for their \u2018raison d\u2019etre\u2019, it\u2019s more because this term is common in the world rather than trying to impress the viewer with jargon.\\n\\n\r\nIts only flaw is its messy nature, but that\u2019s forgivable. Any time that explores its themes so well, that plays both the philosophical angle and the storytelling angle is bound to be messy. It\u2019s not even lying big themes on a traditional story. Ergo Proxy constantly breaks, constantly bounces from one thing to the next. The verve is engrossing, but the anime is also confused. Since it\u2019s not a complete experimental work and not an adventure with psychological portait, it should be in the middle. A anime that\u2019s at once traditional and experimental should be brilliant, but that\u2019s too much to ask for. Still, it doesn\u2019t matter if Icarus burned when he flew to the sun. The wings still worked.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no reason to pass off on this anime. It\u2019s bizarre, messy, intelligent, emotionally engrossing and accessible. It\u2019s far-out, so I can imagine plenty disliking this. Still, this isn\u2019t the impenetrable Texhnolyze or Serial Experiments Lain. In fact, its awareness of traditions actually makes it more bizarre. It\u2019s truly unusual in a way that few fictional works are. If I have to present anime to an outsider, this is one of the first I\u2019ll think of.\\n\\n\r\n4.5 autoraves out of 5",

I didn't know what to expect from this series going in, but the art really captured my attention from the very start.  This is good because like most great animes, you pretty much don't have any idea what is going on or what to expect after the end of the first episode.  You are shown just enough that curiosity takes you to the next episode and every episode after that.  Oddly enough, even after watching this entire anime I was still kind ofconfused as far as the story went but I had so many great memories of the journey that I was prompted to share the experience again with friends.  Upon watching everything for a second time, I found the story much easier to follow and I could easily answer questions for the people I was watching it with that would get lost in the same plot points I did the first time through.  Needing to see the anime twice to take everything in is the only reason I didn't give the story a 10, but at the same time I'm grateful because I enjoyed the experience so much more the second time through.  Also I would like to point out this series has my favorite Intro song ever.  It's title Kiri by Monoral.  I absolutely had to import this CD from Japan the moment I could.",

If you are someone who likes very much to read into things, to analyse them and pull them apart, I have no doubt that this anime is already or is soon to be in your favourites.\r\nAnd the series presents us with two likeable, believeable charecters in the gorgeous Real and the naiive Pino, who are well-voiced and in the case of comedy relief Pino, givenall the best lines.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as unpopular as it may make this review, I couldn't possibly overlook the huge plot holes and \"unfinished\" feel to the series. Charecters are poorly developed, the animation starts to cut corners as the series goes on.\\n\r\nWithout revealing too much, the last episode is called \"Deus ex machina\" - lit. \"God from a machine\" - a latin phrase describing a plot device used to turn hopeless situations into happy endings.\\n\r\nAfter remaining faithful for 23 episodes, the viewer is left feeling several things - confused, unsatisfied and betrayed among them.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is poorly paced, and many episodes seem... worse than out of place. Completely unnecessary. I drew the conclusion that when the original script was written, the producers thought they'd have 2 seasons, or at least a normal 26-ep run. This was not so, and the anime suddenly jumps from a drawn-out journeying arc, full of semi-filler eps, to its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the sheer beauty of the series keeps your eyes on the screen. The graphics are far from the anime conventions, and ultimately, the impression made on you by them is what will remain with you after watching.",

So with that said, here is my first ever review of something.\r\nStory (10) - The storyline is captivating from the very start of this anime, it does really draw you in and make you wonder how and why everything is the way it is.  That alone is a very broad description, I wish not to spoil it for any or hopeful watchers.\r\nArt (10) - The artwork regarding all of the different techniques used for this is a feat IMO,an absolute work of brillance to get all these different styles to fit into one anime, resulting in the beautiful breathtaking alustriousness that is Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10) - Impressive.  And that's being modest.  Not spoiling anything, each character serves a purpose and it's made clear before the ending to clear up any confusion the watcher may have during the episodes.  The dynamic ways the main characters play off each other are simply perfect, like a match made by fate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - Not having watched much anime cartoons as of yet, besides that of the faire on Adult Swim, I would have to say this is the best of the best to what I've experienced so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10) - If you are into the darker more serious types of anime cartoons, even when the child-ish type of character isn't annoying this is for you.   Perfection in all aspects.  Yes even, Q-Q-Q.... be it odd, was still something that made the series all the more richer.  This series left me wondering if anything as good, \"see above ratings\" was available, and I am sure there is.  It also left me wanting more of Re-L, Vincent Law & Pino. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is one of those anime you will either get sucked into and wanting more or just get bored and drop after a couple of episodes.\r\nStory~\r\nEP takes place in a post apocalyptic future where humans and autoreives (robots) co-exist. In the safe orderly domed city of Romdo, lives the main protagonist, Re-L Mayer. She works for the Intelligence Bureau as an investigator with her entourage-type autoreiv, Iggy. There's a virus called the Cogito Virus that's been effecting autoreivs that once infected, an autoreiv gets a \"soul\" and usually rebels it's master in an attempt to assert it's free will. Re-L's life takes a hugeturn when she gets involved in solving the mystery of the monster known as \"Proxy\". Unable to let her curiosity go, she sets off on a journey with an immigrant named Vincent Law, (who is the key) and the little girl companion-type autoreiv, Pino to find answers. The story doesn't rely heavily on action and flashy badass fight scenes(although there's just the right amount of action, and when it does happen, it has your attention!) but instead wants you to use your brain and interpret things in different ways. This is probably why some people either love how it makes them think and want to solve the mysteries, or they may find it boring and uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very dark and gloomy and goes well with a post apocalyptic theme. The anime uses both 2D and CGI animation that works well to get the full effect of the world, without it being distracting. The characters are all unique and have a certain charm to them, and are more on the \"realistic\" side (besides Pino). Albeit the characters themselves can be inconsistent at times, e.g. Re-L's eye brows or face can look thick or it just looks sloppy. The art is very beautiful overall, and  mature. You won't see chibis or over exaggerated facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~\\n\\n\r\nEvery character  has a different and interesting backstory to them. They all have their goals and motives and It's hard to dislike any of the characters, even if they're the \"bad guy\".\\n\r\n Re-L Mayer is a serious edgy 19 year old woman who doesn't like playing around and is seen as stuck up and mean. Her appearance is very unique and refreshing from the usual big breasted, high-pitched voice, overly sexualized \"badass\" trope. She's strong and very beautiful and can take care of herself. \\n\r\nIggy is Re-L's loyal entourage and does basically everything for Re-L. \\n\r\nVincent Law is an immigrant who works for the autoreiv disposal unit. He lacks self confidence and seems very timid at frist. It isn't until he (literally) opens his eyes that he becomes stronger and determined. He also claims to be in love with Re-L.\\n\r\nPino is a high end companion-type autoreiv who looks and acts like a real little girl. She's very smart and knows things that even Vincent can't figure out! She also insists on wearing a ridiculous (but so cute!) pink bunny outfit. \\n\r\nDaedalus Yumeno is Re-L's doctor and sort of protector of the captive proxy, Monad. He has a weird obsession with Re-L and will even risk his job for her.\\n\r\nRaul Creed is the cheif of security bureau who is also the father of Pino. He can seem somewhat cold and vindictive, but you can't help but feel sorry for him in later episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music,  The opening is in English and is an alternative rock song called \"Kiri\" by Monoral. The ending is \"Paranoid Android\" by Radiohead. In the show is full of ambiance and serious tones that keep you engaged in what's going on.  It's a nice change from high pitched fast and colorful openings/endings. As for the voices, the English dub is very fitting due to their Western names, Western appearance, and Western theme of the show. I have yet to watch it in Japanese, I just can't bring myself to watch it in their original voices because to me it just looks odd (specifically Daedalus).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nI can't help but make this anime my number one all time favorite. This is really the only anime I can score a perfect ten in all categories, because I really can't find anything wrong with it. So it has some sloppy animation at times, but even the fillers are entertaining! A part of me wishes it had a second season, but I also want it to be nice and preserved for all of time. This is an anime that can be serious, funny, and very sad. Not many anime can make me feel all of these emotions!\\n\\n\r\nConclusion~\\n\\n\r\nIf you like post apocalyptic scifi philosophical dark anime with really good music and have patience, I highly recommend you watch Ergo Proxy from beginning to end. It also has a very high re watch value and I even recommend you watch it several times to really absorb all the little things it has to offer! \\n",

            "content": "As a fan of the sci-fi and psychological genre, I was super excited to watch Ergo Proxy--I had heard of its similarities to Psycho Pass, Darker than Black, Ghost in the Shell to name a few, all great animes. However, while I did enjoy the characters and story, it did feel like the plot was getting out of hand, increasingly so as the series neared the end. \r\nOne of the first things I noticed about Ergo Proxy was its art style, particularly how the characters were drawn rather realistically in comparison to current anime. The muted tones and intense expressions suited the mood of ErgoProxy well and at times made for some really badass wallpapers. Plus, normal proportions is always something I look for in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recall the sound of Ergo Proxy too well which might as well say it wasn't all that memorable to me. However, the English opening and ending (Kiri by Monoral and Paranoid Android by Radiohead) are both awesome songs that suit the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the main characters of Ergo Proxy: Lil Mayer, Vincent Law, and Pino of course. The instant friendship between Vincent and Pino was adorable and how they broke down Lil's walls throughout the series was honestly heartwarming. The character development in the series I felt was pretty natural and not too sudden. It was interesting to see how some characters opened up and grew as a person while others went more and more off the rails. I did feel like there was a definite lack of depth and background overall but that ties into the show's general vagueness...\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to say that Ergo Proxy has got to be one of the most confusing animes I've ever seen. While I generally appreciate plots open to interpretation, this show took that idea and ran with it. (I know I watched episode 14 at least three times before I got it and that was with reading several different explanations.) Half the time I was lost. It certainly doesn't help how some episodes seemed like single episode stories instead of following the overall storyline. It felt like there were gaps in the story that too often left me confused on how they got there or who that person was. Ergo Proxy never really gives direct answers (well, rarely) and most of the time I had to go by the assumptions and interpretations of other watchers. Thankfully some of our fellow viewers are smart cookies and their explanations make sense; it's because of them that I can appreciate the genius, albeit confusing as heck, plot. Even so, there were frequent differences in explanations and honestly? at some point, it takes away some enjoyment of the anime when you have to do extensive research to understand it. Despite all the confusion, you can tell that the writers did their homework in creating Ergo Proxy and I think it's a pretty smart show. They pepper allusions and foreshadowing all over the place and even though yes I have complained I must admit I did learn things from watching this show. But only after completion of the show and reading my fair share of analyses do I kinda get what's going on. Just gotta say... if you really want to fully appreciate Ergo Proxy, you're in for a rewatch.",

            "content": "Brilliant dystopian anime that is not made to please. Because a dystopia shouldn't be. The only 10/10/10/10/10/10 i will probably ever give.\r\nWell this is, in my opinion, the best anime I have ever seen because it is like no anime I have ever seen.  It is not made to please you or present you a simple story with likeable characters. It is made to make you think, to confuse you and you probably won't get it's meaning if you don't sink your teeth deep inside every single scene to suck out every little drop of imagery and hidden message. This anime is a masterpieceon it's own.\\n\\n\r\nIt's major strength that makes it shine above any other anime is that it's concept is so daring. No other anime dares to walk away so far from the mainstream even though you can clearly see that it's production wasn't cheap at all. No funny moments, no likeable characters, no \"feel good moments\" no easy plot, only a few actual cliffhangers.\\n\r\nBeing probably the most polarizing work among AAA titles, this one will not present you a story that is easy to digest. It will shove a bunch of stones in your stomach just to see if you can carry their weight.\\n\r\nIn fact most parts of the story are happening in the protagonist's mind. And it as a whole is a metaphore. You can't review on Ergo Proxy without starting to interpret it. \\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nSo let's say this anime is about finding one's own identity in a system where everyone is supposed to be the same. Our character needs to clear his mind from the brainwashing he experienced. The system and it's ways of surpressing the individuality of people makes it hard for our main character to understand what he himself truly is: powerful. He needs to destroy society to heal mankind and the earth from it's wounds. \\n\\n\r\nThe earth is completely destroyed. The air outside is toxic and people only live in protected areas, artificial cities where everyone is put in line and is supposed to behave just like the system wants him to.\\n\r\nMost work is done by androids. People who want to migrate to the city have to prove their worth and their will to abandon their own self to fit into society. And then suddenly a mysterious creature starts murdering people.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of Ergo Proxy certainly are not easy and this is not an anime to watch just to kill a little time and be done with it.  Most scenes are only dreams and metaphors and sometimes you won't be able to tell what the \"reality\" is. Have fun... or not.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nErgo Proxy looks terrific. It has it's own style that can't be compared to anything i've seen so far. The characters look more human, each emotion is conveyed by their facial expression. But it's unique style is also meant to polarize. Nearly every image creates a cold, hopeless, dark and uneasy atmosphere. \\n\r\nI loved that weird aesthetic to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nThe sound is minimalistic and absolutely on point. It helps the art to create that grim and dark atmosphere. The sound of a little android girl playing melodica in a ghosttown in a dark wasteland with only the wind blowing dust through the alleys. That's how you tell a story with a few images and few sounds.High quality production in every way.\\n\r\nThe voice-talents are outstanding. Especially Re-l sounds icecold at the beginning and then her voice changes in tone according to her development.\\n\r\nAnother point to mention: the soundtrack. Oh my god they put a Radiohead song in the credits. And it even sounds like it was written for the show (even though Paranoid Android was released years before Ergo Proxy was). Radiohead only gave their approval after watching the show (and they obviously liked it). I loved it as much as I loved the Opening theme by Monoral. It's weird though to hear some perfect english when listening to an anime opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nWhile Vincent is somewhat likeable because he is the typical loser at the beginning of the show, Re-l isn't likeable at all. She is a dick, cold and heartless with no visible emotion and therefore perfect for this anime.\\n\r\nThe only thing that makes her appealing at the beginning is her curiosity and intelligence. \\n\r\nBut Ergo Proxy is all about character development so there is much to see here in the course of events.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nIf you like sophisticated stuff like me, this one is a must see. It will make you think and reflect about freedom, identity, the system you live in, right and wrong, the future, emotions, life. \\n\r\nI recommend to watch all the episodes without pausing for too long to completely comprehend what is going on. Even if you do you should probably watch the anime twice or more in your lifetime to get everything.\\n\\n\r\nEither you love or hate this anime but that's what art is about. What this anime clearly does is making you feel. It makes you feel terrible in a way you can enjoy.  Have fun.",

            "content": "First of all, I want to state my bias for strong female heroines and dystopic sci-fi settings.\r\n--- Story - 8/10 ---\r\nThe story starts out rather strong in episode one, though one of the main characters is sidelined till the end and so much attention is paid to the autoraves (androids) that it seems at first glance like an action-against-androids anime, a la Ghost in the Shell. Just wanna tell you, it's not. The ubiquitousness of the autoraves just serves to show you how dependent the people are on the technology they don't really understand in Romdeau.\r\nWhile the plot keeps a lot from you, it doesgive you a lot of information. The pacing of the first dozen or so episodes loads information on you, then quickly jumps into the action. Then there are 5-ish slow episodes, in which nothing happens except fleshing out the world and characters. This is where the character development happens, and a lot of people think it's boring. Even though I don't like slice-of-life anime, and these episodes vaguely resembles that, I didn't find it boring. Vince, Re-l and Pino are dynamic characters who carry the show. I have to say, though, there were two episodes that it was really a chore to sit through (15 and 19). Then in the last few episodes, the plot quickly wraps itself up, and gives you vague hints as to what happens at the end.\\n\\n\r\nFor lack of clarity as to what happened in the last episode (I found out some things happened that I didn't even notice while browsing forums), and the sporadic pacing, I took two points off the story section. I found the end very satisfying and true to the feel of the rest of the anime though, and the mystery of the Proxies are very sufficiently explained.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Art - 10/10 ---\\n\r\nI found the art and character designs to be a huge strong point for Ergo Proxy. With Re-l's trademark eyeshadow and weird horn things that she puts in her hair, and Vince's strange red jumpsuit very weird at first, but attractive and visually interesting nonetheless. You get used to it. The backgrounds and futuristic machinery and gadgetry are well-designed and animated, and the action scenes are quick but are directed so that it flows easily. The backgrounds are painted gorgeously, and there are very few moments in the anime where I actually think, \"Wow, Vincent doesn't look good from this angle\" or so on. There is a part where a character is pushing aside some moss, and the painted graphic suddenly turns to just a green glob, then back into painted again. It's pretty weird. \\n\\n\r\nFor the opening, they do a weird newspaper-lettering over grainy, sporadically shaky projector-esque noir-y visuals. I can't say that it really appealed to me, but it didn't dispel me, either. The ending is similarly artsy and experimental. It works with the setting, but again, didn't really take to it.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, the art is consistently excellent, and whenever a far shot would be taken of Romdeau or other scenery, it was striking.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Sound - 10/10 ---\\n\r\nThe sound effects are crisp, the voice acting is good enough that I didn't notice anything about it (a high recommendation, really), and the opening theme song is so catchy that I would watch it through the entire time. The second song is from Radiohead, and if you've even dabbled in alternative rock, you've heard some of their stuff. It was a pretty old song for me, and while I liked it, I usually skipped it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Character - 9/10 ---\\n\r\nRe-l is a sort of typical stoic, arrogant character, but she often shows little cracks in her facade. She seems to be very mature, as when I found out from a profile in episode 7 that she's 19, I was pretty shocked. I thought her in her late twenties.\\n\\n\r\nVince is a sheepish guy who's really quick to say sorry, but at weird times he comes across as being kind of crazy. In a yakuza way.\\n\\n\r\nPino is the token cute loli character who provides comic relief and the \"oh, how cute\" part of the show. It's not overbearing, so the dark, oppressive feel is maintained, but she pushes Vince around to get stuff done, which is adorable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, nothing groundbreaking, but solid characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Enjoyment - 10/10 ---\\n\r\nI really liked this anime. It was practically a recipe for what I like in anime: kickass female heroine set in a sci-fi dystopia, with psychological wtf moments as well as the occasional heartwarming. It had a hint of romance, just enough so that the shipping fangirl in me was satisfied. There was a lot of action, a lot of world-exploring, a lot of mysterious moments, and it starts and ends with a bang. I'd definitely recommend it to fans of the sci-fi, psychological, and surreal genres, and for people looking for something that emulates other anime but still manages to be unique.",

The first moment this show started on the first episode I knew I would be in for a hell of a ride. Although I do have to give a bit of credit to ZephSilver for suggesting this anime on account of us both being huge fans of Monster and anything mind blowing. I was curious to see what Ergo Proxywould make me feel. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nMy high hopes for this was immortal throughout this entire show. After the first episode I was hooked on a rod. The suspense and thrilling rush it gave me, made my nights almost sleepless. The dark, looming atmosphere gave the show it's own unique quality and pulled in the psychological theme and horrific genre into play. Although a few episodes threw up fillers, it didn't leave my vision for this show to be on of the best. These 'fillers' did tie into the plot more than I thought, and even brought in a bit of comedic relief we all love once and a while. The setting was toxic to the point where the geographer in me came out, wondering if our world would ever turn into this. It may not be a perfect 10, but in my eyes, this anime was too beautiful and inspiring not to give the story a 100%. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nDark and otherwise eerie, the animators didn't hold back to make this gothic anime one of the best. The background style doesn't do justice to mix in with the plot to make the anime even more mind-blowing. The soft, dark tones of the scenes with a hint of a steam-punk  sub-genre style really was a cherry on the top. The character designs were absolutely beautiful. Never have I seen such gorgeous styles. Why anime can't be more like this, I will never know. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nNot only does MONORAL's Kiri set up the anime with an ENGLISH SONG from an ENGLISH BAND, but it creates the uniqueness to the whole thing. I don't think I've ever seen an anime ending and starting with an English song. In fact I was very surprised when I heard Radiohead at the end. Man, was that ever a great thing to hear. But these two songs just set up everything. It gave the watcher an exciting and anxious rush at the beginning and chilling feeling at the end. I never skipped them and fell in love with them both. The voice acting rolls (and yes I watched in dubbed) were prefect! Not only did my favourite VA play the roll of one of my favourite characters, but the other voice were just a barrel in the hole. Absolutely beautiful sounds. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of this show I was sitting on the ground contemplating life for around...an hour or so. If I wasn't rescued by my friend, I would've sat there longer wondering why they didn't make more of this! I can easily say I went through a heavy withdrawal and had to be resolved by a bottle of wine and a medium pepperoni pizza, watching My Sister's Keeper with Cameron Diaz. I needed to cry. As much as I was content with the ending of the anime, the sense of loss was clearly visible. I love shows like these that play with your mind so much that make you bang it against your wall wondering what the difference is between imaginary and reality. This was incredible and I would watch it over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a brilliant 100% on the Proxy scale.",

It isn't straightforward or dumbed down. It is true for the curious mind that would want to uncover the secrets of a seemingly utopic society. The art is also amazing and fully sets the mood right throughout the show. This Anime is truly a masterpiece. It si unique in its nature. It is unlikely that you find another story like it. And for those how bash on it for being I don't know hard tofollow, you just need to pay closer attention to the details and watch it for the plot. Not all animes have to be action-packed and over-sexualized to be good. In fact, the dark anime that explores the human condition are usually the best.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is a dark, gray-tinted anime with more misses than hits, but with enough digging into it, the concept can leave a shockingly good impression.\r\nStory & Writing: 7.5/10\r\nCharacters: 6/10\r\nArt: 3/5\r\nSound: 3/5\r\nAvg: 6.5/10\r\nThis is a tough show to recommend. As the story and writing goes, it starts off strong, albeit jagged and disheveled, but then gets totally lost in the middle, for about 10 episodes in my opinion, including an inexplicable info dump as a crutch for the convoluted plot. Thankfully, it scrapes together a very memorable conclusion. Many episodes are conceptual, and they don't piece together until you look back at their journey asa whole. It's a show that would bring much more clarity on a rewatch, but due to its slow and melancholy nature, I would have a hard time doing that. I had to read a critical analysis to understand the ending, which was fine I suppose. You'll want to watch the episodes very closely, as they don't always connect cohesively or explain themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were ok. Re-L is a good main, but can be very moody and fussy. Pino provides childlike innocence through the lens of an android, with some great highlights. Vincent Law is one of the toughest main characters I've watched. He is supposed to be, but it's hard to really connect with anyone in this show. Maybe that's the point.\\n\\n\r\nArt wasn't special -- I remember lots of gray and typical animation. The sound was fine. I really like the OP as it captures the nearly metaphysical themes of the show, but other than that.. voice acting was ok, and I don't remember much in terms of music. The ambience was good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler commentary this paragraph:\\n\r\nI will say that I love some of the concepts of this show. Early on, Vincent in my opinion showed an amazing metaphor for how we can give up what makes us personal and unique and brings us passion, in order to fit into whatever community, society, religion, job, family, or circumstances that we think we have to, with the key moment when he leaves the city and opens his brilliant green eyes. And to imagine that this painstakingly mild-mannered, bashful individual had another side of himself designed for killing, is a great dichotomy to the duality we all have, and can learn to understand and direct, rather than being hidden and shamed and manipulated for it. Anyways, just a couple personal inferences that I grabbed and held onto.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, if you commit to the end, it can stick with you. I have to go with a 6, barely, because so much of it felt like a slog. But, I occasionally still think about it and, months removed from it, I'm glad I watched it. While Ergo Proxy is remarkably ambitious telling the elaborate juxtaposed story of Vincent Law, it doesn't always execute well, which is a shame, but is still admirable in its own way.",

            "content": "It is becoming increasingly clear to me that a person falls into one of two categories: either you like the stuff from the producers of Ghost in the Shell, or you don\u2019t. I\u2019m slowly finding myself falling in to the latter category. At the risk of sounding like a heretic, labeled a pariah by the MAL community, and being burned at the stake, I\u2019m going to say: Ergo Proxy is overrated. This is not to say that it isn\u2019t a good anime. But it\u2019s definitely no masterpiece.  Why?\r\nErgo Proxy poses as intellectual, but comes off irritatingly confused. In its defense, there are 2-3 episodesthat are illuminatingly lucid. But 20+ episodes leave you feeling alone, helpless, and my case, stupid. I\u2019d ask myself, \u201cDoes everyone get it but me? What did I miss? Am I that dense?\u201d My insecurities were put to rest when I read reviews of Ergo Proxy (such as the Examiner) that essentially called the show a disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6. Without saying too much, the story is ultimately a mystery that involves learning about humanity\u2019s \"plan\" to ensure the survival of the human race \u2013 and the \"plan\" consisted of multiple contingencies. All of this wont be revealed until episode 26. Of course there are other nuances, relationships, and developments along the \u201c26 episode\u201d way, but much of them are tertiary to the story line. \\n\\n\r\nReviewers have called Ergo Proxy the ultimate MindF$ck. At first, I was so excited! Because, who doesn't like to get F%cked? Alas, upon watching Ergo, I\u2019m sad to report that my mind is still virgin territory.  In fact, the story was so slow, it put me to sleep a few times. And anime almost NEVER puts me to sleep! \\n\\n\r\nThe lion\u2019s share of the dialogue in Ergo is boring techno/philosophic babble. There were however moments of fresh respite along the way that provided the viewer with a clearer understanding of the story. (the jeopardy show episode was by far the most helpful/enjoyable episode). But the periods of repose were not strong enough to repair the painfully drawn out narrative. I feel like the series could have just as easily (if not for the better) been abridged to 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Music: 8. I think the animation and music are redeeming qualities of the show. Animation is set in a very flat/grayish palate to nicely pair with the bleak landscape of the post-apocalyptic world. The ending sequence has Radiohead! I think enough has been said about the anime and music already. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7. I like Re-L and Vincent. They are likable characters. However, the anime isn\u2019t really a study of character development as it is a study of the character's enlightenment. But one of the joys of a story where the characters come to an epiphany, is to see how their lives are changed as a result. Remember the Matrix, and how, after realizing he was the One, Neo went all uberSayen? Yeah! Unfortunately, we aren\u2019t really given much time to spend with both Re-L and Vincent after the \u201crevelation.\u201d It would be really cool if they made an Ergo Proxy 2, to show Re-L and Vincent do with this newly acquired knowledge. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5. There were some memorable moments in Ergo Proxy. However, they were often overshadowed by longer moments of insipid, overly emotional, and BORING episodes. Honestly, after watching all 26 episodes, I want my 600+ minutes back. The last episode is quickly becoming the most flat climax of all time for me. \\n",

            "content": "After hearing many, many good reviews on Ergo Proxy, I finally broke down and watched it, to find myself plastered the the screen with each episode. This is one anime no one should pass up.\r\nStory - 10\r\nI figured I'd start with the most important topic, the story. I found this story quite hard to follow, and no doubt in my mind, you will too.\r\nWith filling in almost every gap in the story line (I found a few parts unexplained, but they weren't important to the plot), the plot is laid out to you slowly. Not slow to where it is boring, but the kind ofslow where you will be confused on the situations going on, until they finally reveal it... And sometimes reveal it several, several, episodes later.\\n\r\nThis is a constant thing through out the series. Down to the very last minutes of the series you will still be asking \"What is going on here?!?\"\\n\r\nThe plot line I have found very unique, not to say there isn't another like it, but this one is most likely the best. To sum it up, to me, I find the plot basically to be a \"Self Identity Adventure\", a theme that sounds boring, but Ergo Proxy pulls it off well.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic, so much detail and effort is put into the environments. They did a wonderful job with that. Characters themselves are drawn really well also. No complaints over any of it. This anime also takes it one step further and adds in 3D animation, which they pull off and use quite efficiently. My only complaint, is that I found the series dark. I had to mess with brightness settings on the screen to be able to see it. Most likely my monitor, so take this as a heads up that you may have to adjust your settings.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nAll the sounds were great, none of those \"Generic\" sounds were used in the series. Great quality sound effects. \\n\r\nThe music is amazing. I did find the ending theme a little \"Eh\" it me. It did not phase me much. Perhaps its just me. \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really good, I found it, for the most part, enjoyable.\\n\r\nFor voice acting, I watched the \"Dubs\". The voice acting in the dubs were great. No issues with them. Then again, I rarely have issues with voice actors. Everyone fits the character perfectly, and the voices used in the Autoraivs were really well made. I was impressed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nThe characters in the series are really thought out well. The background history on all the characters are phenomenal. They too, tie in the with the story, and will leave you asking questions. Every characters back history is covered with no questions left.\\n\r\nThe characters known as \"Autoraivs\" in the series are human like androids. With the voice acting and overall quality of how they delivered them out was excellent. Every character in the series was very believable. The overall performance from the characters are some of the best character designs I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. It's one that made me wanna watch it a second time, several days after finishing it the first time. \\n\r\nThis anime made its way to my favorite anime list in a blink of an eye.\\n\r\nIf you are into \"Cyber punk\", Dark plots, or Mystery and suspense. Watch this. Even if you aren't into them, watch this. You WON'T regret it.",

            "content": "Oh Ergo Proxy, how to begin? First off I think I should say this is opinion based (mine) so of course this is subject to different interpretations. \r\n1. Story: the story is complicated, but not in a horrible mind boggling way (sometimes). Oh yes you will be confused at parts as you try to piece the entire series together to get the full picture, but at the end it made me want to re-watch since I knew more of the world this takes place in and how the characters are apart of it. There are episodes in this series where I swear the writers wheretrying to get a philosophy edge really in there. The philosophy to be fair does take a look at characters issues they are dealing with, but it doesn't fully connect to the rest of the story. I can understand this not being everyone's cup of tea, but if you don't mind a slight detour into a philosophy class you probably won't have too many complaints about this story.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art: The artwork is beautiful I must admit. The clean desolate future that gives great atmosphere to the story is a wonderful touch. The character designs fit in the backgrounds, once in awhile I'll see an anime where the backgrounds and characters look like they don't match up well, not the case here. And I will give props to the females design, hey sometimes its nice not to see a female character with boob concentration. This makes the girls all the more lovely to me.\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound: I thought it was nicely done, it doesn't override the story or distract you from it. It matches so good I had to re-watch some scenes to see if there really was any sound at all. There are only two scenes I thought annoying and they had to do with an instrument a character was playing (we'll get to that in a moment.)\\n\\n\r\n4. Characters: They do have depth, and there are reasons shown for most of them why the are the way they are if you sit and think about it. The only character I disliked is Pino, I think she was mostly there to be cute and I can't stand that sometimes. Hint *she played the instrument that annoyed me. -_-'\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I do wish they had kept the darker tone of the begining of the anime, it seemed to start out as more of a horror sci fi and ended up as just sci fi. I still liked it but I see a lot of potential in the first episode for a scarier tone that unfortunately went away. I still enjoyed it though, it had interesting characters, a quest that did make sense, and a culture within it I do find interesting to discuss. So if your in the mood for a more serious anime with action and mystery and a touch of philosophy give it a try, just don't base the atmosphere of the whole series by the first episode.",

            "content": "The best way to describe this anime is that, it's a disasterous waste of a potentially epic plot.\r\nIn my opinion, the main problem with this show is its continuing struggle to make ideological attitudes that are really just out of its scope. Truly, this's one hell of a freaking philosophical anime. When I say 'philosophical' I don't mean it has got complicated plot or that it's hard to understand for me (as many fans like to assume), rather, I mean that it simply aims to deliver/discuss supposedly-divine ideas instead of actually entertaining you as a viewer.\r\nWhen I started this series, I'd really great hopes aboutit. I mean, for the whole time of the first 20 episodes you'll get tons of continuous questions asked by the main characters about stuff in their world (like proxies, lands outside the domed city, and their own self). Those questions have been asked for 20 episodes non-stopping, while we as viewers go absolutely 0 answers for any of them. Personally, I'd started to build hopes of an epic twisted ending (e.g. as in, say, FullMetalAlchmiest). How possibly could we have all those great questions awaiting for answers this whole time, without getting a truly astonishing ending at last?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I would be lying if I claimed that you won't get anything in the end. There IS actually a twisted ending for this series, however, it goes in a totally different direction that what I would've had hoped for. Actually, 'most' of the questions asked  throughout the series will either be left open for your own thought, or they'll be explained by extremely boring and absolutely non-satisfying philosophical dialogues. I think the author of ''Ergo proxy'' had some cool ideas about the life, the world, and god, however, this anime definitely was not the right way to deliver them.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to all of that, I'll also have to mention one popular criticism that's often stated by reviews; which is the terrible fillers. Ergo proxy have really some of the craziest fillers I've ever encountered. Since it's action/mystery genre series with very serious attitude, I was kind of paralyzed at the amount of the unnecessary stupidity in ep 15 and 19 fillers.\\n\\n\r\nI should be clear that after all, I am not saying this's trash or anything. It's actually a good anime with amazing action, good characters, and unique plot. That's why I am giving it an overall score of 6, however, I am really sad that, with little improvement to the plot, this could have been one of the greatest animes I've ever watched.",

            "content": "~ STORY ~\r\n        The storyline of Ergo Proxy is pretty complex, and filled with mysteries that hook you and make you feel like watching it to the end so that all questions can be answered. Somehow I found that there is a parallel between the setting of Ergo Proxy and the Matrix. Both evolves around a world that seems to be a utopia but actually is controlled by something else. Both questions their worlds and talks about the existence of an \"outside\" world. Just like the Matrix, Ergo Proxy explores a lot on existence, and the meaning ofit, and that set people thinking as well.\\n\\n\r\n~ ART ~\\n\r\n        Even though the series do not have many bright colours (most of the time it will be grey), the graphics are beautifully drawn and presented. Of course, considering that this series is filled with mysteries, I would think that the choice of colours are rather good, as it suits the overall atmosphere of the series. The way the characters are designed are compelling as well. The autoraves are depicted in a manner that I have never seen before (I mean, they look different from other AI in other series or movies, correct me if I am wrong). One thing I like most is the depiction of Romudo. This city looks totally awesome, and is really a utopia kind of state. Of course, the contrast between Romudo and the \"Outside\" world is huge as well, and the manner both places are portrayed matches the storyline.\\n\\n\r\n~ SOUND ~\\n\r\n        The opening and ending songs of Ergo Proxy suits the series a lot, especially the lyrics. The lyrics are mostly depicting a troubled mind, with words like \"come and saaaave meeee\". This exactly describes Vincent Law, and his state of mind. Voices of characters are good as well, as the tone used are mostly what we use in daily life (a bit darker, though) and it makes the series even more realistic. Ergo Proxy does not have much background music, mostly it's just wind howling away or machine making noise when the characters are talking. However, the natural background noise makes the series seem more eerie and mystified, and is certainly better than unnecessary background music. Overall, the sound suits the genre of Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\n~ CHARACTER ~\\n\r\n        The characters of Ergo Proxy are very realistic. Each of the characters are very unique individuals, they have their own strengths and weaknesses, and what each of them are thinking is not easy to understand, and even if you understand, you won't be able to understand fully just like the real world. This makes the story even more engrossing as you will then try hard to figure out the characters.\\n\\n\r\n         Overall Ergo Proxy is a perfect case of a series living up to its potential. The stories and concepts in each episode are clearly and dramatically ( in a good way ) executed, leaving no impression of schizophrenia or lack of focus. It is like watching an intricate play, in the beginning, you are somewhat lost but you feel as if your'e supposed to be lost at first, and find your way in the journey leading up to the tale's conclusion.",

            "content": "I picked this from my dropped list while making some \"cleaning\". I remembered a friend of mine who was very hyped back in 2008 and made me take a look but I dropped it after 5 or 6 episodes because it simply didn't cath my attention. Unfortunately this anime in specific needs exactly that - to jump the 5-episodes barrier. ;) So lately I've read some stuff here and there and decided to give Ergo Proxy a second chance.\r\nOK, I'll be honest - once again, I can't say I fully liked it. I'll try to explain why in short because the series are not newand there are a lot of reviews already. \\n\r\nFirst of all I think you have to be a bit older if you want to enjoy fully this anime. I'm not sayng young viewers are not smart enough or something but this is definitely not your tipycal series - actually it was (and still is) very experimental back in 2006. What I'm trying to say is that one shoud have more... life experience to understand some of the references in it, which are actually great and I did like that part of the show. \\n\r\nSecond, you really, really have to watch beyond episode 5! It doesn't matter if you are hyped to watch it or just giving it a try - it just starts VERY SLOW!! Not to mention very confusing and I think this is what will make a lot of people to drop it (like I did at my first try). Actually a lot of things remain unexplained till the end so don't be surprised if you feel lost at times. That's another weak point of the series.\\n\r\nIn fact the middle of the anime is very cool, I liked it. It successfuly combines funny and tragic elements, a bit of action and romance, the character development is fluent and understandable and what is happening is actually interesting. And again, the last few episodes seemed hasty and I didn't like how rash all of it ended.\\n\r\nSo I wll say it once againg - this anime is not for everybody. It is dark. Very dark. The art itself is in minor colors. And you have to pay a lot of attention all the time, maybe check a few things in Google... I'm still trying to understand why so much people liked it but maybe the problem is in me. But that must not stop you from trying it - it's a mind challenger and they don't make stuff like this nowadays. In fact I can't compare it to anything new. Also the soundtrack is great.",

I believe if you believe something, you have to be strong in your beliefs before you watch it. It does test some boundaries. And I recommend re-watching it once you finish it.

            "content": "I probably don't have a bunch to add that hasn't already been said of this series, but I still would like to give my opinion. Ergo Proxy is easily one of my top 10 favorite anime. I went into it thinking it was going to be another really hard to understand and ambiguous series like Serial Experiments Lain (which was excellent, don't get me wrong). This series is rather deep, dark and mysterious like Lain, and there are some things that are not too easy to comprehend. Still it is still very entertaining and thought-provoking. It's much easier to understand than Lain, too. Anyway, enoughcomparing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nIt's pretty hard to give a synopsis of the story in a few sentences, but basically (no spoilers), it is about Re-L Mayer, granddaughter of the Regent Donov Mayer (who is in charge of the domed city of Romdeau that they live in) who is searching for a man named Vincent Law who has a connection to a mysterious entity known as Ergo Proxy. The series takes place in a futuristic world, which almost looks post-apocalyptic. Everything is rather bleak. However, in this story, which is full of action/adventure, drama, science fiction, and [most of all] mystery/suspense, there are also some moments of comedy and romance mixed in, although the romance isn't the main part. So if you're not into lovey dovey scenes, then don't worry.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very well developed and fascinating, and also shrouded in enigma, which pulled me in. Each episode presents sub-mysteries on top of the main one, said main one being what Vincent's connection to Ergo Proxy may be. I won't give anything about that away. In any case, the story has many twists and many jarring turns, which may confuse you at the beginning but will be explained later. Sometimes the abrupt shifts in the story disconcerted me, and I had to review parts of the episode some times before understanding what was happening. It all has a purpose though. A deeper meaning.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the ending of this anime was amazing, but that's me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is very good. I love the character designs and the art style. It's very fitting for this anime series considering its mysterious and sometimes creepy themes. The art is much more realistic here than in other anime, which gives the series a more serious and mature appearance. The character designs all suit the respective characters' personalities, too. The animation is very good also, but at times it can be a bit off. Also some of the character designs seem a bit different in certain scenes (a tad bit off-model). But these mentioned problems aren't too bad. They don't really take away from the series at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music is very good. This series has a wonderful soundtrack, mainly composed of ambient music and some rock, too, such as the opening theme, Kiri, by MONORAL and the ending theme, Paranoid Android by Radiohead. The bgms suit the scenes they are in perfectly. The voice-acting is very good, too, both sub and dub. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are the best part of this series. Every character is developed, and the main characters are the most interesting ones. They are very layered and all have interesting stories to share. The supporting characters are also very well developed and intriguing. Even the antagonists are given their own backstories and are expanded on to the point where you can actually sympathize with them in some episodes. Re-L and Vincent are, without a doubt, the best and most engrossing characters in this show. They are very dynamic. The Proxies are also very cool and fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a great deal. It is slow-paced at times, and other times, extremely fast-paced. But it is still very enjoyable. Each episode went by quicker than I thought for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis is a wonderful and smart series that deserves all the praise it receives. I'm not guaranteeing you will love this anime; I'm just giving my view on it. However, if you are into sci-fi, mystery, psychological thrillers, and some action, (with a deep and intelligent plot to boot) then this series should be given a try. I know I enjoyed it, and I wasn't even too certain of what I was getting into when I went into the first episode. But it was worthwhile in the end.",

I must say that i honestly regret not watching this series immediately and leaving it for a whole 8 months.\r\nThe story starts out following a girl living in a futuristic city with robotic help (AutoReivs) andsome other postapocalyptic features such as humanity nearly wiped out and the remnants living in a domed city. The 1st episode brings you into a world of intrigue and mystery concerning a strange city which seems to be a paradise of sort...but the paradise doesn't last with a strange beast loose and a virus roaming about. Though the beginning wasn't as brilliant as the rest, and maybe even boring to some we judge the story as both the exposition and the plot progression.\\n\r\n[story: 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe art was near perfect with each character having individual traits and being pretty well-drawn, near the end of the series i started noticing some mistakes in the animation itself - so the score isn't perfect.\\n\r\n[art: 8]\\n\\n\r\nWhat actually moves this series away from the majority of what we have had in the past years is the sound. Instead of j-rock\\j-pop we have some different rock both in the opening and in the ending. Apart from those, we have a good score, which also seems to be very fitting to the series.\\n\r\n[sound: 8]\\n\\n\r\nAs to not give any spoilers it will be hard to give a detailed review on the characters, but i can say that apart from the characters being very individual - they all seem to have a very special role in the meaning that the series gives out. Not only is every character unique, but they also have the traits that are required to give the series the deep thoughtful feeling it gives.\\n\r\n[characters: 9]\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this series not only because of the rare but noticeable and bright action scenes but also for the philosophical part that is given closer to the end - concerning the meaning of life and other aspects related to humans themselves.\\n\r\n[enjoyment: 9]\\n\\n\r\nOverall: i recommend this series to those who look for something with good action scenes AND some meaning to all the actions that take place. The ending added even more to the enjoyment - it was worth it.\\n\r\n[overall: 9]",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy has been highly appreciated by people whom I respect very much, so I decided to give it a try. Besides, it is often compared to Neon Genesis Evangelion in terms of mind-fuck, pardon my language, and as I think Eva is a masterpiece, I just had to watch Ergo Proxy.\r\nNot that I regret my decision, but it wasn't worth it. Sorry, I don't get the hype around it. It is so mediocre for me, I can't even say.\r\nThe series' plot jumps at you right away from the very beginning, which leaves you a little bit astonished. Although as the series progresses, you getthe overall picture, bit I think Ergo Proxy tried to do too much at a time. There are too many things it wants to talk about, too many matter it wants to address. Besides, despite all the struggle, the plot is very banal. There is nothing original in it, not for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the series is the art. The sceneries, the characters - everything is well-adjusted to show the atmosphere of the world. Even thought it is done in very dark colours, which sometimes makes it difficult to watch it, it just feels right. I did notice a few problems with long-sots, such as eyes, which are on different levels, etc, but I think it's okay considering the overall beauty of the art.\\n\r\nAnother point for the opening sequence, which is really-really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound did nothing to me. Radiohead as the ED is cool and all, but does it really suit the subject and the mood? OP was decent, I've let it play a couple of times, but it's nothing like Mushishi opening or Elfen Lied's opening or Mononoke's opening.\\n\r\nThe background music...was it there? It did literally nothing to me, which still makes it good, as it means it suited well the sequence.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strong side of the anime as well. They are complex, they have their reasons and they develop.\\n\r\nReal is the girl-with-the-gun in the beginning. She is emotionless, she can't express her feelings, she loves to fight. She is a bit of bitch, if you ask me, in the beginning. But as the story develops, so does her character, and in the end we see a completely different Real, who \"believes\".\\n\r\nVincent is actually a much more complex character, who has several layers, pun intended. At first we see a stupid-looking guy, whose eyes are always closed. I, for one, couldn't not wonder WHY THE HELL HE LOVES REAL? Thank God, at least that part of the plot was revealed later.\\n\r\nI absolutely loved Raul Creed. His character is unexpectedly human and has some surprises, which I can't talk about without spoiling everything.\\n\r\nDeadalus is another example of a background, but still a complex character. Pino is more of a child than any other human child in anime.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning enjoyment - sorry, not at all. At first it was frankly boring, then it became average, but in the end it became boring again. I don't know why it turned out like this, because having such a plot and characters, it should have been so much better, but it wasn't.\\n\r\nThe last few episodes seemed like they tried to cram a huge story in just a couple hours. It was an overload of information, which still seemed to say boring.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Ergo Proxy disappointed me greatly. No way I'm ever going to advice someone to watch it.",

            "content": "If I had to describe Ergo Proxy in the shortest way possible, I would call it the crowning jewel of my anime exploration thus far. It's a transcendent piece of art which needs to be viewed from a specific angle, else its glory cannot be grasped to the fullest - and this is by no means your typical rated-not-for-everyone statement or what not, a concept which I consider to be utterly ridiculous, simply because a universally accepted piece in the world of art doesn't exist. All of ye who proceed, do yourself a favor and abandon all objectivity.\r\nFirst of all, Ergo Proxy falls into thecategory of more engaging shows, so if you're the type of person that dips into anime to alleviate stress caused by a hectic daily curriculum, this one will not yield satisfactory results for you. The plot is not easy to follow and lack of focus and/or wrong mindset will hamper your ability to observe its true motion, consequentially making it apparently lacking in substance, or even being non-existent. \\n\\n\r\nBefore going into detail about various aspects of the show, I will try to describe it with tags or very short sentences that would get me hooked, to attract new potential fans, and at the same time save some time for the viewers that would probably end up disappointed with it. Obvious tags like cyberpunk, dystopia or sci-fi are obvious, hence excluded.\\n\\n\r\n\t- Dark, gloomy, implicit and often symbolic/metaphorical in expression, moderately slow progression\\n\r\n\t- simple and not flashy art (sepia much?), ambiental soundtrack\\n\r\n\t- emphasis on character development, philosophical content consistent to its own logic, sharp dialogue, exceptional and unique plot\\n\r\n\t- almost completely void of action and humor\\n\r\n\t- has a subtle and non-vulgar sense of beauty,  no conventional love stories or sexual expression to be found \\n\r\n\t- will likely require to be watched a second time to make perfect sense out of it\\n\\n\r\nAudio and visual  \\n\\n\r\n\u2026 blend in quite well with the story and enhance the atmosphere, but actually are one of the weaker points of the show individually. Personally I wouldn't mind if the animation was executed in greater detail. The art itself is undoubtedly creative and imaginative, heck, I had a Monad wallpaper on my phone for a while after I'd seen it the first time, but it's just that the technical aspect is a tad bit lackluster.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, there's a lot of sepia, dark colours, bleak tones, in both the environment and character design. Pink or turquoise haired / high pitch voiced girls all died in the methane layer explosion's blast so they're nowhere to be found in the material presented to us. Regardless, such gimmicks were completely unnecessary in making each character's portrayal unique in their own way; whether they're Proxies, humans or AutoReivs.\\n\r\nThe main protagonists are both beautiful, on the first glance Vince looks as if he suffered from the \"Brock\" syndrome (yes, Pokemon's, to clear any doubt), but soon enough the situation is rendered self-explanatory. \\n\r\nThe technology is skillfully conceptualized and consequentially the sekai it forms,  it all works out great unquestionably, but I'd like to point out just one more thing in this section that really stood out for me. I'm a big sucker for clothing and I really liked the style here - personally I found it to be Marc Jacobs kind of, with a Tom Ford note here and there.\\n\r\nAs for the auditory aspect, I did like a couple of pieces and the ambiental background music was generally good, very seldom out of place. I just had a problem on a personal level - every mention of the name \"Radiohead\" brings about the memory of the Scott Tennorman incident so it cracks me up a bit. If not for that I might be able to take them seriously. Anyway, no points deducted for that because there's no harm in skipping the intros/outros or even muting them and synching whatever the hell you like with the video. \\n\\n\r\nThe story and its characters\\n\\n\r\nWhen I say might not be for you because the content is engaging or demanding, I'm not trying to make myself feel better thinking I possess some great intellectual capabilities or calling anyone out for their supposed lack thereof. Preferences aside, everyday living tempo differs for each individual at given time, and sometimes we all just need well.. Rest. Obviously, the question is not only what, but also when.\\n\r\nThere's not a whole lot of yatta yatta, don't expect that at all. And to be honest, I prefer pausing to reflect upon the dialogue's meaning and its implications, to pausing just because I need more time to read the whole damn thing. I remember watching Tatami Galaxy and averaging around 30 pauses per episode. Frankly it adds zero value to the show, watching an arbitrarily sped-up version of what a show is supposed to be (30 mins of material shrunk to fit a 20 min frame) makes the whole experience an incoherent mess, i.e. a pauseful nuisance. How about switching the subtitles off and trying to figure out Japanese? Or even playing it backwards with 8-bit sound, the video off, while kneeling in a pile of bolts and nuts? Now that would be extreme.\\n\r\nApologies for the rant but I just find it too sad seeing good stuff ruined by pretentious ideas. With that said, you won't find pretentiousness or pretense here, the story is told in a very subtle manner. Going into details about the fabula would quickly create openings for spoilers.\\n\r\nLong story short, you will be presented a vision of the future with a spice of a few premises on the edge of what we could label as \"realistic\". The way the concept of artificial intelligence has been dealt with is not revolutionary, but it's smart and at times, dare I say it, charming. Even some of the AutoReivs are more established as characters than a lot of shows' protagonists. In case of humans, for instance, you get to know the Regent pretty well, albeit he never said a damn word. Some characters were arguably more likeable than the other, but of course it all depends on your personal dose of neutrality. Ultimately they all served their purpose just the way they were. For the most part, humans and \"cogito virus\"-infected AutoReivs' \"Raison d'etre\" was shrouded in strong emotions, and every single one of them was memorable. \\n\r\nDaedalus' possessiveness toward Re-l (Real) and envy toward Vincent for everything being centered around him led him to a fate he had anticipated. Re-l's curious and rebellious, nature, as well as an inexplicable attraction to Vincent pushed her out of the bubble of self-absorption she'd created, and ultimately shattered the barrier of his denial.\\n\r\nThe power-hungry chief Raul and his forever devoted entourage Kristeva also formed an interesting and meaningful relationship. Actually, all of them were in a way, but for a reason I ought not to share here. Omnes viae \"Ergo\" ferrunt is as far as I can go before being obliged to hoist the infamous Spoilerian flag.\\n\r\nOne of the show's most commonly mentioned descriptions is the one of a self-discovering journey, as it is quite obvious to the viewer from its early stages. In my opinion this was masterfully executed as well. The pacing, the variety in the source of information and modorum they're conveyed.. \\n\r\nThis analogy might sound out of place but I could go on and compare the whole thing to a catwalk-striptease with an acrobatic flick at the end of the runway (the latter referring to the \"quiz episode\" halfway through the show. Props for the brave effort, I didn't think it was brilliant but it came as a surprise that's for sure. \\n\r\nErgo Proxy does not attempt to fool you with cheap tricks like misleading clues or ambiguous information, luring you to jump to wrong conclusions then dumps a bucket of cold truth on your face like some silly police thriller perhaps would. Just enjoy yourselves as the grand Proxy design unravels before you, but keep in mind that stopping to ponder might result in being left behind.\\n",

            "content": "(Do not read this review if you have not watched Ergo Proxy yet, all kind of spoilers are contained)\r\nHey guys! Before getting any further, I want to highlight from the very beginning that this is purely my opinion after finishing the show, not a summary or analysis.\r\nDuring and after finishing Ergo Proxy (will be mentioned as EP), one thing kept popping up in my head: \u201cTHINK, till you manage your own answers to the following question: What is the meaning beyond your existence?\u201d Although the best description of EP is (bleak), yet EP indeed left me with a smile! In other words, it made methink, and deeper think, until I got some hints to answer this question. This is one of the things that makes EP a pure perfection! \\n\\n\r\nStory (10\\10)\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a decayed world, abandoned by its creator, dehumanized by the corrupt authority, populated by robots with few humans who have no capacity to engender. All this make the perfect setting for Vincent and Re-l mental and empirical journey. The plot is strongly consistent, full of twists, and stimulates suspense to its highest levels. Deep characters are presented in a fragmentary way, having no more than the poor choice of moving forward to their unknown \"for both characters and audience\" fate. What makes the story even greater is the outstanding open ending, leaving you contemplating on the endless multiplicity of meanings. Most other open-ended shows rather end in a vague and dull manner. However, EP somehow tried to make a balance in this regard. In the final episode, it gave us solid glimpses about all characters' final act, but depending on the twists we witnessed in the story, you will never trust a final fixed answer! This multiplicity of meaning in EP is really exceptional and makes the story impressively splendid! The story axiomatically deserves a (10).\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization (10\\10):\\n\r\nI dare say That EP has the best \u201ccharacter development\u201d among all other shows I have ever watched. \\n\r\n- Although (Vincent) has two split and distinct personalities, he is one of the most profound characters I've seen in a while, and it is his schizophrenic identity which makes him more interesting and enjoyable to observe. Dai Sat\u014d managed to show the deep inner development of the two personalities he has and this makes the characterization even greater. Moreover, Vincent raises the opaque existential questions that anyone might ask him\\herself; all his psychological problems could face anyone of us. Even when he restored his memories as a Proxy, he became more mysterious - especially in his last sentence - and raised more questions instead of solving them. This portrays the curiosity of human nature for truth, yet Vincent somehow has found his peace of both soul and mind, and tranquil his inner struggle most marvelously. He was able to shock us with the paradox he is living. Despite all the hardships he lived, his weakness, his eagerness for truth, his psychological trauma and split identity, he was able to reconcile with these facts and to accepte his other side! He is nothing less than a spectacular character indeed.\\n\r\n- (Re-l), despite being annoying and a pain-in-the-ass at times, she proved somehow to be a genius character. Throughout the story, she proved how profound and strong she is by getting rid of the personality forced over her by society; also, She was able to change and move forward despite losing all her loved ones. By the end of the story, she succeeded not only in finding her own ultimate truth, but also in solving all dilemmas in the society she lives in. Re-l eventually triumphed over all her doubts and adversities, and that in fact transformed Re-l into a character that is more likeable. \\n\r\n- (Ergo and the other Proxies), I will not say much about them. However, I think they are the aesthetic side of EP. Every one of us can define the meaning, function, essence of Proxy in his\\her own way based on one\u2019s beliefs, views, culture, values and way of thinking. There is a whole philosophy represented in them and I could write pages discussing about them, but I'm certain that they will not be nailed down to a definition that easily. The more you contemplate about the proxies, the more meaning they will have. This elusive concept in EP is something you cannot find anywhere. What else could a great anime have!\\n\r\n- (Pino), the humanized robot or \u201cAutoReiv.\u201d When comparing Pino with any other human in the show, she was able to sympathize with any other creature no matter how different it might be, which is something most humans in the real world cannot do, or maybe refuse to do. However, she was able to do this by having the \u201chuman feelings\u201d after she has been infected with a soul. Therefore, does she highlight the value of human soul, or point out the degradation of our human feelings and sympathy? \\n\r\n- (Raul and Daedalus) were also very interesting. Both of them immersed in a great despair, but they faced it each by his own way. Daedlaus surrendered while Raul kept fighting. Deadlaus, at the final act, showed signs of his diseased mentality as a kind of a tax of his genius, preferred to die by the side of his illusion, embodied by fake Re-l. Whereas, Raul chooses to die human, and fight the mighty proxy. Even after he failed, he kept moving, wounded and bleeding in search for Pino, symbolizing his insistence to remain human and transcend his hatred, defending his humanity though instinctively. Both were surprisingly thoughtful, and added different undertones on the show.\\n\r\nThe rest characters were all well shaped and enjoyable, namely Iggy, Queen and Hoody.\\n\\n\r\nProduction (8\\10)\\n\r\nManglobe's animating in EP is sometimes tacky; characters do not look the same in different situations. Vincent is an exception of course; his variety of appearances served his identity disorder fabulously, but as for Re-l and other characters, their facial features might look very different from a scene to another. However, the animating of the ever-darkening sky, frozen sea, the barren environment and dreary landscape have done the fascinating job in making EP\u2019s surreal atmosphere. The soundtracks were also magnificent, Yoshihiro successfuly created the nightmarish tone that EP induces. Every single piece of music in EP was a pure perfection. MONORAL\u2019s Kiri is the most memorable opening song of all time. The voice acting is also bewitching, particularly the AutoReives and how they were able to sound like human and robot simultaneously. Iggy is the best example in this regard, especially when he has been infected with a free will.  \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Ergo Proxy is one of those anime that deserves your full score, your constant admiring. Indeed, I have never approached an anime more surrealistic and bizarre, yet tackles the psychological problems of ours most craftily. In every single re-watch you will discover something valuable and new. EP is the best embodiment of abundance of meaning.\\n\\n\r\nHope you find this helpful and thank you so much for reading!  \\n",

            "content": "Before we go to review you should know that i am not a generous viewer. I rated this 4 but for someone who is new to watching anime, this score should be something like 7. But first a quick synopsis.\r\nThere is an Isolated, self-sufficent utopian city-state where nearly all inhabitants have their own android servant. Life is easy. Then a freaky dude starting to killing some inhabitants of the city. While that dude doing this he also spread a virus to android servants that turns them into self awareness machines. And our female protagonist ''Real'' (she is a detective) investigate this cases to find thecreature after these murders. Then she met with our male protagonist ''Vincent'' the handyman. He is also a stalker which stalks Real time to time. Platonic love for Real. Then murderer goes after our male protagonist and events are delevoping.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a mystery anime. (well it tries to be more than that but mostly mystery) Theme is good actually. City-state, humanity advanced in technology so that they made android servants. NICE. I liked it. Then it turns into a story about journey. Cool cool.\\n\\n\r\nStory is good, dialogues are good, art is good, sound is good. Anime has its own unique sytle.\\n\\n\r\nNow stop reading right here and watch this show if you like the theme because this anime's score is 7.99, this can't be bad right. Wrong. There are 2 reasons why this anime does not deserve a score of almost 8 points. Because of these reasons quality is getting less and less as you watch further episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, filler episodes. Common right. Most animes have filler episodes where nearly nothing happens. But this one makes you say ''oh my gawd, when this will be over.'' 23 episodes and probably 10 episodes are there just for extending the show. \\n\\n\r\nAnd secondly, cliche ending. I will not give any spoilers but think about the most common conclusion given by people when they does not explain something mysterious. Really cliche. I have never seen this much cliche before. Writer sucked at ending.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand why this anime have this high score. These issues doesn't bother everyone. If cliches and filler episodes doesn't bother you then you gonna love this show. Because, yeah, with the score of 7.99 already speaks for itself. Like i said, everything is good, story, art, sound, theme,... but producers messed this up by extending it too much. With the help of writer ofcourse. They both killed the show. A huge potential dramatically wasted. What a shame.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show to everyone except for veteran viewers. New anime lovers gonna like this but veteran viewers will be like ''meh''. After watching this show you can say ''I am an intellectual anime viewer, i watched Ergo Proxy.'' Basicly you can watch this show just for look more intellectual though. It will improve your taste of quality, i am sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i rated 4(i am not generous). The anime that has the most cliche ending ever i seen, Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\n(English is not my native tongue, sorry if i made a mistake.) \\n\\n\r\nEdit: Now that i think, this anime is like shitty TED talks. Too much extended nonsense. And i dropped its score by 1 point. (august 5, 2018)\\n\r\nEdit 2: Review revised to be more useful for readers. (august 6, 2018)",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: January 26, 2015. Review #92: Ergo Proxy\r\nWhen someone forms an opinion on something, They think therefore they are. I have reviewed a number of anime because I think therefore I am. Regardless if this sounds pretentious or not. Here is Ergo Proxy\r\nThe world has become largely uninhabitable over the course of time and now what remains of humanity exists inside large dome-like cities. When androids known as AutoReivs begin committing crimes and displaying a semblance of free will, Re-L Mayer begins investigating the cause. This takes her on an adventure that encourages her to ask deep philosophical questions aboutherself, her companions Vincent and Pino, as well as the world they live in.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is a Manglobe production and I have been enjoying some of their work as a studio. Samurai Champloo was pretty cool and nice to look at for the most part and Deadman Wonderland looked great. Ergo Proxy is a show worth mentioning in regards to Manglobe as a studio. This show looks great from start to finish. It does have its hiccups and inconsistencies  along the way but at least the shortcuts were at a minimal. Ergo Proxy just looks wonderful when it hits the right notes.  the opening visuals on the other hand are amazing. It is personally one of my Top 10 favorite openings. Really, I mean it. That is how much I liked this opening. With all due respect, the opening of this show is really worth looking at from episode to episode. The animation as a whole does stand out among the thousands out there. You wanna know something even more remarkable. The show has a blend of 2D animation for the character designs and some 3D CG Animation for like vehicles and other designs, and blended in just right unlike Studio GONZO whom are infamous for having their 3D animation stick out like a sore thumb for most of their shows. This is by far one of Manglobe\u2019s best looking Animes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Yoshihiro Ike is kind of noteworthy because it does fit the show very well. The show is dark, dystopian, and desolate. The soundtrack fits the bill on this one. The soundtrack sounds like it would fit any film with a dystopian setting but I guess that would depend on the settings as well. It\u2019s a shame that this is the only soundtrack I think Ike-san shines on. I have not seen Kuroko\u2019s Basketball and I am now aware he does the soundtrack for that show. This is by far the best soundtrack I\u2019ve heard from Yoshihiro Ike. The soundtrack knows when to hit the right notes and I\u2019m glad it did its job just right. Now the intro and outro of Ergo Proxy is a rather fascinating topic on its own but some of you probably know where this is going but allow me to indulge in this moment because I share opinions on many aspects in a show and intros and outros are part of that too. The intro \u201cKiri\u201d by Monoral is mind-blowing. Well\u2026 To an extent it can be seen as such. I did say the visuals looked amazing but the song itself was a surprise by looking up Monoral. Now the lyrics were in English and not Japanese as you can tell by the opening if you have seen it and heard the song. Monoral is not from America or any other country other than Japan. Monoral is a Japanese alternative rock band. Now the lead singer\u2019s origins kind of explain why the song is in English with no instances of Engrish in it. Anis Shimada, the lead singer is Japanese-Moroccan and can speak Japanese, English, French, and Arabic. The other member, Ali Morizumi is Japanese-American. And yet in 2006, they belt out this song and it is just a rare treat when it comes to Japanese music and anime intros. The visuals and the intro song kick ass and I have good reason why it\u2019s one of my favorite openings. Then there is the Closing theme. \"Paranoid Android\" by Radiohead. Before I got into this anime, I never heard Radiohead or the song Paranoid Android and I know, I should be ashamed of myself. You know what? It isn't my fault that I had lack of exposure to Radiohead. This I blame on radio stations for its lack of radio publicity. Thanks to Ergo Proxy, I have been enjoying Radiohead's work. The visuals in the Closing may not show much but that\u2019s fine because the song fits the show. Ergo Proxy had interesting choices concerning its Opening and Closing and it succeeds. The soundtrack is great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith Voice acting, the Japanese cast is mostly alright. Rie Saito is great as Re-L and I had no problem with her voice in this one. Koji Yusa is a bit of a down-note for me. I did not like parts of his performance as Vincent. Akiko Yajima is what I would expect with a character like Pino but she plays the role just fine. I don\u2019t have much to say about the Japanese casting because the English Dub is very good in this show. Megan Hollingshead is great as Re-L. Liam O\u2019Brien is a surprise as Vincent. Rachel Hircshfeld\u2019s portrayal of Pino is also good too. Also, Travis Willingham, Patrick Seitz, and even Yuri Lowenthal are pretty good in the dub. Now the dub\u2019s highlight without a doubt is Dameon Clarke who you may recognize so well as Scar from the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime. Dameon Clarke was fantastic in this one and it may be my favorite role of his.  I actually strongly prefer the dub when it comes to Ergo Proxy. The overall performance is outstanding, and Jonathan Klein is responsible for this dub and he also was ADR director for outstanding dubs such as Hellsing (even though that show was a bloody mess, but still had a great dub) and Paranoia Agent. Ergo Proxy is without a doubt one of his best ADR directions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow Ergo Proxy does sport some interesting characters if you are patient enough. Re-L and Vincent are fine in their own right and Pino is a nice character even if she\u2019s pretty much there for the ride. Iggy was an interesting case, Daedelus also brought an interesting contribution to the plot, Raul is actually the only recurring character I have mixed feelings for. I hope you\u2019ve at least seen the first 3 episodes for this show. Raul\u2019s reaction to his wife and child\u2019s...demise  was poorly executed. Raul was somewhat interesting but I had a difficult time believing his turmoil early on in the show. This was my only nitpick with the characters. The majority of how the characters are played out were excellent. I will give Ergo Proxy credit for this. The unique thing about Ergo Proxy is how Re-L seemed to be the main character when Vincent is really the most vital character of the show since he too is treated the same way Re-L is concerning the brightest spotlight. For the most part. The characters do not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nNow the overall story of Ergo Proxy is a completely different matter. I liked the mystery aspect early on in the show and I can say that I was not disappointed with the outcome of where the show was going. You know, the resolution. That was all fine and dandy. Now I just have one burning question for Dai Sato (the writer) and Shukou Murase (the director). What was the fucking point of the quiz show episode? I have no idea what was on Dai Sato and Shuko Murase\u2019s minds when that bafflingly questionable quiz-show episode came into play. I should mention the director of Ergo Proxy. Shuko Murase was an interesting case. For those who don\u2019t know, he was the character designer for Final Fantasy IX, a really good game and one of my favorite Final Fantasy games. It was his only video game contribution.  Check it out if you have the means to. Ergo Proxy is also his most recent directorial role in an anime followed by his first directorial debut, Witch Hunter ROBIN. He is not much of an Anime director but he has contributed for years as animation director, But his resume isn\u2019t too big. I would consider Ergo Proxy to be ambitious at best because the dystopian settings, the philosophy, and character development were fascinating. Now I would have had a huge fondness of this anime if it didn\u2019t have an open-ended conclusion. Just when things seemed like it was leading into more, the show just ends. Here\u2019s an idea\u2026 If going back in time were possible. It would be nice if that bullshit game show episode never existed and have a solid final episode instead of rushing things in and leave it open in the end. Also, the pacing did suffer a bit in the middle with how slow it was going. It speeds up near the end where I went from intrigued by this show to scratching my head at the end. Having its loose ends left open made the final destination of Ergo Proxy underwhelming. Like I said before, I found Ergo Proxy to be ambitious whereas some people claim it to be pretentious. I can see where they are coming from but the reason I find it ambitious is because for an anime with a dystopian setting. This was a unique anime to sit through. When the ending was all said and done, I just felt like the whole thing became underwhelming. If there is one thing pretentious about Ergo Proxy, it is that it attempts to be smart and deep. At times, it did succeed. Where Ergo Proxy falls flat is that it could have had a central plot but it wanders off by exploring other concepts which some were promising and some were just...questionable. As for the Raison d\u2019etre of Ergo Proxy...I will say it one last time for this review. I think it is an ambitious anime that actually succeeds in getting the viewer intrigued in what Ergo Proxy offers without it being very pretentious. The viewer is likely to accept that Ergo Proxy is not perfect yet anything made by human hands is not perfect. We think therefore we are. The creators of Ergo Proxy put some thought in this one because they think therefore they are. I will say that the experience of this anime by other people than me will differ due to the nature of this anime. I say it because I think therefore I am\u2026. Okay, that\u2019s enough with my pretentious in-joke because it doesn\u2019t add up and  that\u2019s all I got for this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy was originally available by Geneon and the show did go out of print but don\u2019t you worry. It was made available once more when Funimation came along, rescued it from being out of print and it is now available by Funimation. A manga called \u201cErgo Proxy: Centzon Hitchers and Undertaker\u201d by Yumiko Haro was never brought in stateside.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way\u2026 Ergo Proxy is a unique series with its dark, desolate, dystopian settings. It does explore the human condition to a degree but does explore other concepts which some hit well and some miss. It does have a great utilization in its soundtrack and it does have great characterization even though I had some mixed feelings with a certain supporting character early on. Where it does have its issues is its inconsistent animation at times even though it looks fantastic during big moments. It still had ambition and it tried its damnedest without falling flat on its face and giving up halfway or even at the end. It was underwhelming with its conclusion but there are far worse conclusions. Some I\u2019ve already witnessed. A little bit more would be nice with Ergo Proxy, but it is what it is therefore, it exists.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith everything said and done, I give Ergo Proxy a 8 out of 10, it is VERY GOOD!\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment",

            "content": "(OVERALL REVEIW \u2013 mainly about my concerns with the anime): \r\nI was honestly very unsure as to whether I could write an \"intellectual\" review that Ergo Proxy deserves, so I have to apologise beforehand if my analysis is lacking in depth and understanding of this anime. Having debated between rating this an eight or a seven for about ten minutes after finishing the last episode, I finally settled on the latter purely based on my own biases. The skepticism about this show is understandable \u2013 it is an engaging, thought-provoking show which reminded me why I love this medium of entertainment (cyberpunk mysteries, not justtsundere cat girls, unnatural hair colours, or child soldiers in a post-apocalyptic setting). \\n\\n\r\nYet at the same time Ergo Proxy is disjointed, doubtable, and, most of the time, downright weird. Many reviews on MAL has already broken down the anime nicely, so I will just discuss primarily my main concern with this show, which was the execution of events. Some episodic events were done to engage the audience with a backstory told completely differently from the norm (i.e. almost \"breaking their own 4th wall\", in a sense). However, while diverging from clich\u00e9s of anime has a healthy tick of approval from me, I acknowledge that I, as an individual, have an average intelligence, and found it difficult to grasp the fundamental basics of half the dialogue the characters engaged in. Most philosophical questions asked seemed repetitive and said solely for the purpose of sounding \"deep\" \u2013 for example, \"Cogito, Ergo Sum\" (I think, therefore I am) is the basis and said dominant philosophical debate for the entirety of the show \u2013 but I fear the primary fault lies with the English subtitles, which may have lacked the intellect to express the colourful language of Japanese spoken.\\n\\n\r\nI find the plot itself questionable. The show is very experimental, indulging in many different kinds of genres which they pull off surprisingly effortlessly. However, I must point out a plot hole with the robots (\"the AutoReivs\"), more so with the ones that are infected with a virus that gives them a \"soul\", allowing them to experience emotions. This is neither explained nor fully explored in detail: the explanation is vague, and inconsistent with scientific reasoning.\\n\\n\r\nIt was rather incomprehensible to follow their thought and logic, constantly asking myself questions such as \"How is it possible for a man-made machine to suddenly posses a 'soul'? Where does it come from?\" When one watches Ergo Proxy, one must remember that this show also falls under the category \"sic-fi\", i.e. Science Fiction. Therefore, I must also point out that I am one person: my argument is not a theory or proven but an opinion, rather than truth.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, simply put, are brilliant. Not perfect, of course, but brilliant nonetheless. That does not necessarily mean you will like them straight of the bat. Re-L (Lil is a fansub mistake), is one badass female lead, but spoilt by her social status and is seemingly detached from experiencing emotions. Vincent Law appears to be a disappointment for a male lead \u2013 a faceless, generic man with a submissive personality. However, both undergo major character development, which is actually shown to the audience rather than done off screen (i.e. they do not somehow miraculously become formidably impressive persons in the middle of the series for no particular reasons). \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is very unique, and as mentioned before, unrealistic for our generation but thought-inspiring. As for music: one does not simply skip the OP of Ergo Proxy (it's sung in English and I didn't skip over it once during all 23 episodes). \\n\\n\r\nPersonal note: I highly recommend solely shoujo/harem/shounen/ecchi genre watchers (and the like) to stray away from this. You may not necessarily like it nor understand it, and I myself admit this is not an anime for everyone, including myself. Despite being a fan of the likes of cyberpunk/psychological/dark fantasy genres, I found that for the majority of the time I was feeling \"dafuq\" or \"hahahahhaahha ok \u00bf\u00bf\u00bf\" and alas, did not come to fully embrace this hidden gem in the anime world, Ergo Proxy. But if you find the first episode engaging, then please stick with it to the bitter end \u2013 it is simply one hell of a ride.",

            "content": "I actually began watching EP over a year ago and stopped after the 6th episode.  Since I recently finished and thoroughly enjoyed Michiko to Hatchin, I thought I\u2019d give Manglobe another chance and thus returned to Ergo and finally completed the series.\r\nI come away with the same frustrations I had when I entered this world so long ago.  Not only is the plot drenched in philosophy but the gaps in resolution and misguided episodes continue to way heavy after viewing.  I\u2019ll begin with the positives.  The atmosphere and mood of this series is beyond exceptional.  The muted color palette workswell with the sterile \u201ccity\u201d landscapes, which contrast well with the more \u201cdeconstructed\u201d environments.  The character designs are distinct and beautiful.  Re-l Mayer (the lead) deserves iconic status in the realm of cyberpunk Goth.  And the Proxy\u2019s are a wonderful reminder of Alberto Giacometti\u2019s work.  Both beautiful yet disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nThe easiest way to categorize it is: Bladerunner meets film noir meets GitS.  You\u2019re instantly thrown into the mystery and introduced to all the main characters by the end of the first 20 minutes.  The pacing, music, and plot moves well into the 3rd episode but that\u2019s where the trouble begins to rear its ugly head.   \\n\\n\r\nBy the 4th episode, the pacing comes to a crawl and during this second viewing, I realized what was missing for me: a sense of humor.  I don\u2019t expect or need slapstick but for such a dark story, I expect some levity to help ease some of the more depressing stuff.  And EP has some pretty depressing stuff going on.  If you\u2019re willing to move on (like I did the 2nd time around) the \u201cwho done it\u201d mystery turns into a literal journey across the Earth to find the answers and back again.   Midway through, the serial turns episodic and you get these 20 minute 1 timers that are there to help the viewer discover bits of the truth.  Some are more successful than others and without spoiling anything, the infamous \u201cgame show\u201d episode is obviously vital in understanding more about the history and depth of the story.  But what can easily be credited as \u201cinventive\u201d can also come across as self-indulgent.  They walk a very thin line before coming back to the main story arc.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy has been described as a \u201cmind f**k\u201d and I often wondered if I would have been better off stoned while watching some of the more eccentric episodes.  But the truth is, the series made a conscious decision in prioritizing theme over character.  That sense of humor I was looking for comes about mid-season.  So do some more personal story lines, but it\u2019s a little too late and the conclusion is packed into the last 2 episodes.  So after the crawl, I was rushed into an ending that still left a lot of answers unresolved.  \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not one of those people that needs everything wrapped up in a pretty bow.   The philosophizing doesn\u2019t bother me (as I do prefer stories that demand me to think) and there are some truly memorable scenes sprinkled throughout the series, but when very specific and sometimes important plot points are either ignored or unanswered, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Although I have to recommend Ergo Proxy as a ground breaking series in terms of design, mood, and execution, it\u2019s ultimate failure is when it demands the audience's absolute attention to follow every crumb and trail.  And unfortunately, some of those trails lead you to an incomplete story. \\n",

            "content": "This Review Is My Masterpiece, My Design, Gaze Upon My Mona Lisa . . . \r\nTHE BEGINNING:\r\nWatching Ergo Proxy is like picking up your 'to-go' order from your favorite Asian food restaurant, getting back to the privacy of your own home so you can gobble it down without any unnecessary onlookers quickly becomes your first priority as soon as the bag is put in your hand. Much like the way I demolished Ergo Proxy in one sitting (literally one sitting, I didn't even get up once to go pee) \r\nNow you've finished your meal and you pull out your fortune cookie from the bag, .. . . . you're excited because this is the good fortune cookie brand, not the one that tastes like a stale tortilla chip dragged through honey. You crack open your cookie, but alas you see no fortune. You feel betrayed and lied too. You grew up knowing that when you crack the cookie you get the little piece of paper that eventually becomes pocket lint after 3 washes in your jeans. But today your lord has forsaken you, NO FUTURE POCKET LINT FOR YOU!\\n\\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE TO ENDING:\\n\r\nThis same feeling of utter betrayal and loss is the basic premises for Proxy, the anime version of an empty fortune cookie. Where what you grew up knowing to be true is turned upside down, growing fears and subconscious suspicions are revealed to be true. Emptiness, destruction, Isolation, endless cycles of pain and loss, all because of someone else's decision to not do their job correctly.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERY END:\\n\r\nYou pop the whole cursed fortune cookie in your mouth and begin to chew, making a mental note that this is what broken dreams taste like, and never to forget that taste . . . .BUT WAIT!!!! You realize the cookie actually does taste funny and you spit out something with a funny texture . . . . . . . .\\n\r\nYOUR MISSING FORTUNE!! Right when you were about to give up all hope, you open the microscopic, now soggy paper to take a look, it says;\\n\r\n\"You Will . . . \" but the rest of the sentence is illegible sue to smearing ink. You are about to fall again and sadden over what you could have had if things were done differently, but then you stop yourself, and remember how worse the feeling of no fortune was. You look at your \"You Will\" fortune and realize it's better than any other fortune in the world, because it is left open to your interpretation, it is whatever you want it to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe act of creation through observation . . . .I am not even remotely exaggerating or embellishing facts, that internal emotional roller coaster journey you and I just went through is pretty much EXACTLY what it is like to watch Ergo Proxy. Sure to someone only watching me on the surface I look like a hungry idiot who almost ate a piece of paper, But to you, . . . . who observed beneath the surface and saw a  whole array of emotions, realizations, and a sort of Revolution and/or Revelation take place.\\n\r\n You know, therefore you are. . . . . . . going to check fortune cookies twice from now on!",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS VAGUELY PRESENTED SPOILERS**\r\nThis is the show that dethroned Cowboy Bebop as my favorite anime and show of all time, but it is absolutely not a show that everyone will be able to stomach. As for me, I adore nearly every single bit of Ergo Proxy to bits.\r\nStory:\r\nThis is a story that does not hold your hand, if that wasn't obvious enough. A better description would be that it appears as a figure in the shadows that you can barely see and must follow along. And for that exact reason, this is a show that you can only appreciate for its entire beingon a rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nEasily the most divisive part of the reception to this show, the story of Ergo Proxy is misleading, often unpredictable, filled with foreshadowing, symbolism, techniques that will bend your mind for better or worse depending on your taste, symbolism, philosophy, mystery and symbolism. Did I mention there's a lot of symbolism in this show?\\n\\n\r\nEach episode flows into the next with rare occasions of episodes that primarily serve as a standalone story on the main group's journey, for examples episodes 14 and 19. While neither of these episodes are necessarily important to the overall story and goals of the characters, all of the episodes do serve some purpose, in character development or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story may leave something to be desired for some, as the first few episodes tend to not move much of a plot outside of the driving question Re-l is looking to answer. After episode 3, the real story and main setting of the story is put into play. I personally loved the first three episodes, as they give an introspective look at just how the society of Romdeau is, thought not why, which gives another driving question to the story, as well as how Re-l's mind works and how that aspect of her character plays into the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a mystery anime, this entire show revolves around questions. Questions, questions, questions. What are the proxies? Who is Vincent Law? Why is Romdeau the way it is? Most of the questions asked by this show and in turn by the viewer are answered directly, some more so in the viewer's own thoughts, as well as implications that may not be as easy to catch onto as one may think. In that respect it may be easy to call it something of an Evangelion, or a Lain.\\n\\n\r\nThe only minor complaint that I have for the ending of this show is that it feels like it could have a few minor fixes to prevent the one thing that I would say is the least common tone in the entirety of the series - cheesiness. Some of the line delivery in the last four or so minutes leaves something to be desired, at least in the dub, and the ending itself is left vague. \"What does the last shot mean?\" \"What's that character going to do?\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give the story a 10/10. It is not without flaw, nothing can be, but the flaws I saw were almost all in the presence of my first watch only, as I was left almost angry at the fact that there were so many confusing parts of the presentation of the ideas, scenes, and lines. But as I said earlier, this show is phenomenally better on rewatch - and I had already given the show a 10/10 on first watch anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nAnother well-known aspect of Ergo Proxy is the consistent quality of the art and animation shown throughout. Nearly every episode has fluid, well-drawn shots with some exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design is something that Ergo Proxy excels at. Every character, even minor background characters, feel unique and realistic. Re-l Mayer shows off a goth look befitting of her attitude, and a properly stern face to fit. Vincent Law's outfit is a normal worker's set of clothing for AutoReiv disposal, but as the story progresses he becomes more and more disheveled and less like he's trying to impress someone and more like he's just trying to survive. Pino is the one thing keeping the show from drifting too heavily into grim-darkness and her cute, childlike attire fits perfectly, as well as some (excusably) unrealistically adorable facial features. Raul Creed's attitude shifting throughout the story shows that the professional, stoic outfit of a security chief can fit just as well on a man hellbent on revenge. Daedalus Yumeno's boyish appearance befits the unsuspecting development he ensues.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue with the animation of Ergo Proxy is that it shows off some things -too- well, and that makes the less than greatly animated episodes rather glaring. If one were to compare episode 9, an episode rife with beauty, to episode 16, which shows absolutely no major plot developments outside of character development for Re-l, they would find that there's little comparison in quality, for obvious reasons. The animation is consistently great, but not consistent enough, and is why it gets a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice actors, I can only say my opinions on the English dub, as that is all I have presently seen. And boy, are they fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nLiam O'Brien as Vincent portrays a man who pushes himself to continue surviving and searching, and the gravelly voice put on contrasts the way he originally shows himself as an earnest and shy man beautifully. Megan Hollingshead delivers the bitter and cold tone that Re-l uses to show her attitude perfectly. And as her icy shell defrosts, it slowly becomes more and more casual and less, for lack of a better word, bitchy. Rachel Hirschfeld's part as Pino is the only member of the main cast who doesn't consistently shine as brightly as the other two voice actors, but nonetheless performs in a stellar way. The faults mostly stem from scenes where Pino is yelling as she runs away or falls, as they tend to fall flat on their face instead of showing the fear and worry you'd want from a suspenseful, dangerous scene. Otherwise, however, the tone of a precocious little girl is nailed right in the head by Pino's voice.\\n\\n\r\nPatrick Seitz' range of emotions from smugness to disdain to fear to rage shows especially well in Raul Creed's tenacious, unpredictable character. Yuri Lowenthal's typecasting as a kid hero comes in handy in the performance of Daedalus Yumeno, subverting the well-intentioned tone he begins the series with as well as complimenting the character's design.\\n\\n\r\nMinor characters often get varying voices, typically average at least, though some characters also stand out as either very high quality or... embarrassing. This shows well in the commune's Quinn and Timothy. Quinn's voice actress delivers the somewhat snarky, independent personality across to the viewer in spades. Her son, Timothy, on the other hand, stands out from every other voice in the entire show as awkward, flat, and even laughable. Luckily, he's the outlier.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the show conveys the mysterious, dark tone of Ergo Proxy  incredibly well, primarily via ambient tracks that instill a primal sense of fear, discomfort even. Easily one of the standout aspects of the show for some. And to make matters plenty better, the opening theme is an alternative slow jam that not only stands out from the rest of the soundtrack but fits alongside it perfectly. And if you're a Radiohead fan like I am, you'd be delighted to know that Paranoid Android is the ending theme, and there is no other song that fits more.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result of the undeniably amazing soundtrack and consistently well-voiced characters, I can only give the sound a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in this show has massive development intertwined with the events of the story, and it shows in spades with flying colors - easily the best part of the show in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a show with a clear villain outside of the main cast's own curiosity, though nearly everyone does some morally questionable things along the way, the cast in Romdeau particularly. It'd be hard to talk about any of the characters and their development without spoiling every part of the plot, so I will leave it at the fact that the characters are a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAs I've mentioned before, this is a mystery anime comparable to Evangelion and Lain. Very little will be clear at first, and that is, in my experience, what drives many people to decide that the odd taste in their mouth after watching this show was bad. And that's fine, not everyone wants their shows to be complicated. But if one is the type of watcher who tries their hardest to think on and think back on every event that happened in the show, they would probably find a lot of enjoyment in a show like this. This especially goes for rewatchers. \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to bring special attention to my father, who has only ever seen four anime in his life, those being Speed Racer (Mach GoGoGo) as a child, Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, and Ergo Proxy, the latter three still not being shows he has completed watching. All of those shows are top-notch according to him, and he isn't the type to care much for anime. This is a show mature and universally enjoyable enough that you can show it to anybody who likes to search for the answers to questions.\\n\\n\r\nBecause I was in the shoes of the people who were confused and bitter about said confusion for multiple points during the series, especially episodes 11 and 20, I can't give Ergo Proxy a 10 for enjoyment. It's not a show for everyone, obviously. But because I adored it so much eventually, I'll settle for a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis is show is easily one of the most underrated pieces of media I've ever had the luck to watch. Every facet of the show imaginable is outstanding to me and I can only give it a 10/10.",

            "content": "I just finished Ergo Proxy, and it's one of the most mediocre psychological thrillers I've ever seen. There have been so many other shows that do this formula better since Ergo Proxy has aired and I have no idea why so many people hold this series in such a high regard. Perhaps they don't know what else is out there...\r\n~Story~\r\nErgo Proxy's story is a tale of length, such length that it drags out into this array of hogwash that equates to pigeon poop on your car's mirrors. AKA, you don't have a clue what's going on. Which in turn is fine, a show that makesyou think is perfect. However, the formula is extremely disappointing. \\n\r\nGoing into this show I was excited, it looked very Cyberpunk(esk) to me, a perfect society, robots called AutoReivs, it seemed to have me fully engaged by episode 3. Then everything changed.\\n\r\n What I thought was going to be a cyberpunk crime psychological thriller turned into something that perhaps The Chronicles of Riddick fans would enjoy instead.\\n\r\n Ergo Proxy had taken a horrible turn, as if it had just given up. It provided so much action within those first few episodes and then it decided \"this is enough time to slow down\", which was completely unnecessary. After this it began to drag on, and on, and on...until I was completely disinterested, put the show on hold for a few months and watched it on and off. It was torture to watch, but I couldn't look away; one can't look away from a plane crash.\\n\r\nAfter episode 12 the show's plot tried to get a little deeper in the psychological department. One episode, (the first about the multiple Lil's and Vincent's) really had me engaged. This is what I wanted to see, not this previous predictable shell of everything I had seen before. However, this formula stayed the same until the conclusion of the series, which was extremely disappointing. So many other shows have done this better, Serial Experiments Lain for example, even Madoka Magica.\\n\r\n Ergo Proxy went on for far too long, it could have been made into a better show with a limit of 12 or 13 episodes. Instead we got too long of a show, not enough explanation, and a lackluster ending.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~\\n\r\nNot much to say here.\\n\r\nThe animation seemed very 'stilted' and hard to relate to from a human perspective. During episode 19 I confirmed this due to the animals being drawn better than humans and AutoReivs in every aspect possible!\\n\r\nThe 'domed' city is hardly ever shown, all but a simple shopping mall or a road. If I don't know where I am how do I to relate to the situation? Also, the dead world outside the dome was meek and depressing, never changing, boring.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\nThe OP was wonderful, the music matched the foreshadowing of the show in a great way.\\n\r\nThe ED, I personally think they should have picked Karma Police as a Radiohead song and not Paranoid Android.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\r\nErgo Proxy tried to develop characters but failed miserably. There is no indication of emotion other than either distress, whining or sadness emitted from themselves.\\n\r\nVincent is a whiny confused Shinji-clone who doesn't know what's going on the entire show until the last episode.\\n\r\nLil is an extremely hard character to relate to and one I do not feel exists in the real world. No 19 year old has that level of maturity.\\n\r\nPino is just there for the ride, not really needed.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\nForced, sake in hand, forced myself to finish it so I could dismantle it properly. \\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\nIt's been done better than this, much better.\\n\r\nStream it, instead of buying it.",

            "content": "\"All those who wander in the darkness seek the light, but when they reach the light, they turn away their eyes from the blinding glare.\"-Kazkis proxy\r\nErgo Proxy is a cyberpunk, suspense, sci-fiction anime show with LOTS of deeper philosophical dialogues and scenes. Featuring robots that kill, a government nobody recognizes, and romance between a commoner and a princess, Ergo Proxy leaves you confused and enlightened at the same time.\r\nStory : \r\nThe themes in this anime raise important, self reflecting questions which we ordinarily wouldn't even think about. The story is full of cliffhangers, and that is what makes this anime so interesting. It allows usto fill in the gaps using our own imagination. The story begins with Re-L mayer, the daughter of Romdeau's regent and her entourage - an AutoReiv called Iggy- investigating a virus called cogito virus that infects AutoReiv, essentially giving them human-like awareness. But all this changes when she comes across a deeper conspiracy involving beings called Proxies. This is where the anime completely grips the viewer. Throughout the show, we are left dumbfounded about these proxies. Humanoid figures with god like powers is a strange addition to a sci-fiction story, and yet that is what makes the twist so interesting. Oh, and how can I forget! Our main hero isn't Re-L Mayer. Its an immigrant mechanic by the name of Vincent Law who suffers from split personalities. One is our vincent, and the other is, well, find out for yourself. This series does involve some boring parts including a filler or two, but reflecting upon them after watching the series makes you realize that they were essential parts of the plot. Psychological anime generally focus on the mental state of the protagonist. However, Ergo Proxy takes a different turn, focusing instead on every character realizing his/her Raison d'\u00eatre - or, reason for existence. The story is straightforward, yet twisted. Philosophy aside, the plot itself is entertaining and beautifully executed. Every episode arouses our curiosity, and when this curiosity is satiated, it creates even more questions. Sometimes, we are left at the edge of our seats, biting our nails and sweating all over, and other times, we are yawning with boredom. It get frustrating when a boring scene is dragged on and on, but these mundane episodes create a thirst for action and more intense scenes, and Ergo Proxy immediately obliges, which made watching this anime a delightful  experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound And Animation : \\n\\n\r\nThis anime consists of two soundtracks, both by Yoshihiro Ike, The opening theme leaves a beautiful, mysterious impression on the mind, making the story quiet fascinating. The ending leaves an enigmatic impression, helping you retrospect about everything you have just seen/heard. Yoshihiro Iks's music brings out Ergo Proxy's dark theme in light-toned music and the contradiction helps deepen this anime's psychological impact even more. The art always justifies the story as whole and not individual characters. As I said, viewers are totally dumbfounded about the true nature of the proxies. Every time Re-l encounters a proxy, the face of the proxy isn't clearly shown. The head is often hidden in the darkness of the proxy's hair, and this artistic style helps mystify the proxy's persona. As long as the true nature of proxies are hidden, they are shrouded in sloppy art that does no justice to their characters. However, when the answers regarding the proxies have been satisfactorily answered, their faces are clearly unveiled. Re-l is depicted as a beautiful and fiercely independent woman and her gorgeous eyes makes her character even more charismatic. The proxy vs proxy fight scenes are always intense and fast, and instead of focusing on prodigious moves and surprising blows, they serve mainly to show the Ergo proxy's true strength. The plot twists are full of suspense as they are, the animation intensifies these twists, making your heart beat run.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have been bought out beautifully. Re-l is the beautiful, proud, arrogant and nosy grand daughter of Romdeau's ruler. In spite of being an excellent officer, she is always frozen with fear whenever she encounters a proxy. Its confusing, yet, in Re-l's words, she finds herself \"strangely drawn to the proxies\". The reason isn't revealed until the very end, but when it is, it makes an interesting twist. \\n\r\nVincent Law is a poor immigrant, who falls in love with Re-l. Suffering from amnesia, he travels from dome to dome until, travelling with Re-l and Pino, they reach Mosk, his home-dome, in an attempt to recover his lost memories. When Vincent finally remembers, he suffers from an internal conflict, with who-he-wants-to-be trying to defeat-who he-was. this fight takes a physical form, making an interesting action scene. \\n\r\nPino is the cute AutoReiv infected by the cogito virus. Whenever the anime takes a depressing turn, she lights up the screen with her optimistic attitude and cute smile. Although in many scenes, the dark theme contradicts her light attitude, it still makes a hopeful setting, making the viewers yearn for more.\\n\r\nIggy is the caring and loving entourage of Re-l who, as it turns out is the spy cam of Re-l's grandfather. From the beginning he is seen as nothing but a programmed robot. Viewers would usually turn a blind eye to the insults Re-l throws at him. but we are shown yet another aspect of humanity, when Iggy gets infected by the cogito virus. The feelings of anger, jealousy and betrayal are shown by an expressionless robot and even though we can't see the anger, it is so evident in Iggy's actions that the we can't help but appreciate the irony of an empathetic robot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : \\n\\n\r\nMany complain of the confusing story line and I guess it is because they get caught up in the philosophy of this anime. True, this is psychologically gripping, but the charisma of this anime is lost if we thing too much about the comments and dialogues made. The ending is quite abrupt, but that's another reason why I enjoyed this anime so much. After completing this, I spent days thinking about what happens next, and essentially ended in a lovely ending that I made. This is part of the reason why I don't think this anime needs a 2nd season. The second season takes place mentally and that  is what makes this anime so magnetic. A perfect start, a perfect end, that's Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This was by far one of the most surprisingly good anime series, that I came across. I remember that this was recommended to me by a friend, and I wasn't too sure about it at first. The art alone was something that I've never came across. It was something completely different, compared to most anime styles. You could say that perhaps it was more of an American styled anime, rather than a Japanese one. So let me get to the main points now:   \r\nStory:The story has interesting cyberpunk theme. It's something that I have not come across before, and it was a pleasantsurprise to me. The fact that from the very firs episode, there was already action going on, and we see Re-l already dealing with \"monsters\" is what made me go through the entire series.   \\n\\n\r\nSound:The background soundtrack is very suiting for the series. It's atmospheric, and in some sense dark, really brining out the theme of the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I admire the main character (like I usually do for most series ahaha...), and her strong will. The fact that she's a great female leading character is really admirable. I do have to say that she is by far one of the best female leading characters that I have came across. She pretty much breaks the usual \"strong male character\", that is found in most anime's, and proves that female character's are also great in major roles, like Re-l. Vincent was also an interesting character. He had an interesting background, and the way he acted was also a bit different in comparison to most major male characters.",

            "content": "So Ergo Proxy is probably more suited towards those who have watched a lot of anime and can appreciate different aspects of the darker, psychological genre. To the people who plan to watch this:\r\n1. Be prepared for very unique and beautiful art. The animators in Ergo Proxy pretty much discarded the stereotypical large-eyes, bright colors drawing style of most anime and substituted it for more realistic and subtly beautiful art.\r\n2. Don't get depressed easily. This anime is mostly gray and black (expect for Re-L's eyeshadow). However, that also makes the rare moments with bright color stand out even more. You'll see.\r\n3. Don't get frustrated. Someof the characters in the story may frustrate the viewer a LOT, but grit your teeth and pull through. The ending is worth it.\\n\\n\r\n4. Don't watch this if you don't think you can handle it. This anime has a lot of psychological undertones and is honestly pretty dark and controversial. If you're a die-hard lover of romcoms and cannot handle gore or that kind of \"stuff\" then I suggest you stay away from Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoy! Although everything I just wrote sounds really depressing, Ergo Proxy is a must-watch for the seasoned viewer. The elements of mystery and mindblowing story really draw you in, and like I said, the ending is worth the twenty-something episode wait. (I watched the whole series in one day... oops).",

Nobody stays more than their needed to be, and nobody is under-represented.\r\nMy personal favourite in the series was episode 11, where the arguments used in helping Vincent Law understand himself, and I thinkthat the whole key of this series lies in that episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect which I loved of this anime was its artstyle - although dark and gritty, it does give a wonderful contrast to the situation and the settings in which the anime takes place: the way the transitions happens between Romdeau (or for that matter, any other city outside of Romdeau) and the outside world which is in between cities, makes it really sublime. They not only add to the progression of the series, they also add to the environment and the feel of the anime. For me, this is a really well founded anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this is nitpicking, I think that another aspect which gives this anime a good kick is the subtle influx of philosophical constructs and arguments, as well as the use of literary references. You'll get what I mean once you watch it - oh, and on a conclusion, I think that the best character would be Pino. And I praise her voice acting in the Japanese version.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, its a good anime. Amongst the best I've seen thus far.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is mindfuck. I'm serious. If you don't want to be constantly doushite-ing when watching anime, then this is not for you. There is action, but it thins out quite fast when nearing episodes 8, 9, 10. But to guys who love the likes of NGE, Bokurano, Serial Experiments Lain and such, Ergo Proxy is one more epic addition to your list.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story is easily 10/10. Set in a seemingly standard dystopian Earth setting, the storyline is spread among a few core characters, each a very complicated story to tell. All seemingly separated, yet connected. Mystery is omnipresent while watching. At any pointof time, there are bound to be loads of questions flying around in your head. Throughout the anime, these questions are slowly given hazy hints to their answers, yet sometimes confusing evidence appear, and the characters themselves are as confused as the viewer. One bad thing one may point out is the lack of a true blue explanation of every loose thread by the end of the series, but hey, what's the point of watching such anime if EVERY small detail is explain explicitly?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nFor an anime of such genre, to have animation that rival that of other famous, mainstream anime is simply unbelievable. The environment designs are pure beauty, the movements are fluid, the action is realistic and the characters' emotions are portrayed powerfully with the strong art style used. The constant dystopian-dark theme may be the only flaw in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe best part of the sound aspect is the voice-acting. Every character had a very much appropriate and supportive voice that backed their emotions and character developments up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderfully designed, together with the outstandingly complex storyline, gives a huge amount of character development throughout the series. They connect with the viewer closely, yet maintaining a \"so-close-yet-so-far\" connection due to the mystery surrounding them. There aren't many core characters, but each one is very holistically developed, at a good pace relative to other characters, and they grow into an extremely strong cast altogether. The storyline is fluidly powered by their combined decisions and actions, and their emotions fuel the viewers endlessly. Their dialogue is another thing that differentiates Ergo Proxy from other anime. When watching Ergo Proxy, you feel like you are a phantom in their world watching them, because none of the dialogue responds explicitly to viewer wants. The anime doesn't feel like an anime, more like a documentary, a true story recorded on film. The characters don't say unnecessary lines put in just to let viewers know certain details, no. The characters say exactly what they should say at that point of time, without knowing that us viewers are watching them. Awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThis may be the only part of Ergo Proxy not really up to the usual mark. But the reason is more or less justified. To have dialogue take place of most of the action in other anime and completely 0 fan service, it's hard to say that it has extremely high entertainment value. I guess many would even fall asleep watching certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if u like wanna get a shitload of mindfuck, get a shitload of Ergo Proxy.",

Usually, a movie falls more easily into one or the other. Anime is no different. Your Guilty Crowns and Fate/Stay nights fall into the former. Ergo Proxy, on the other hand, falls into the latter.\r\nThere is very little action in Ergo Proxy in comparison to the other animes I have watched. With the exception of Proxies doing battle and Re-l Meyer showcasing her excellence with a shotgun, the majority of the story is spent investigating and exploring the back-story of Ramdeau, the Proxiesand why the world is the way it is. The story grabs you from the beginning with leaving so much a mystery. As one piece falls into place, an entire portion of the puzzle you were unaware of reveals itself, half-obscured. It is a very somber tale that left me feeling a bit depressed at times (as good animes seem to do).\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is a thinking person's anime. The ending can seem a bit of a letdown and Episodes 10 through 20 appear to be a slog to quite a few people, but I found them enjoyable. I'm one of those individuals who can enjoy Transformers for what it is and still tear up when King George VI shouts \"Because I have a voice!\" in The King's Speech.",

It was the single piece that mostly carried the series; the sound would have a rating of 10 had the series put more of a focus on the music during various scenes.\r\nRating: 9\r\nCharacter:\r\nThe characters were pretty likable and asthe story progressed, their character development became more complex and even side characters had some depth to them which is a welcome surpise.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly even now after having seen the series all the way through and watching a few episodes over again I am not entirely sure that I fully understand what all actually went on in Ergo Proxy.  The plot is fairly complex and several episodes throughout the series appear at the time you see them, to be oddly placed (which to a degree, they are) however, the story is generally pieced together by the end of the series with a small number of exceptions.  Overall, Ergo Proxy's plot is much more intellectual in nature than most animes even attempt which is commendable.  The only reason I'm giving the story an 8 is because the series had a few episodes that seemed to be out of place and it hurt the plot to a degree.\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching Ergo Proxy.  It was a reasonably dark, post apocolyptic anime with an intellient plot.  The series touched on a few futuristic concepts that are worth exploring further and haven't been beated to death by other animes yet.  I try to find anime series that are novel in plot, character style and various other things and Ergo Proxy did a fine job of doing exactly that.\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is a complex if not indeciferable series unless you watch the whole thing all the way through which is probably only meant for anime fans that are into that sort of thing.  The plot takes some getting used to but is very much worth it.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9",

            "content": "This is a very hard anime to rate.  Ergo Proxy is both masterpiece and frustrating to watch at the same time.  If you make it to the end and are actually able to understand everything, or at least most of what's going on, you will be left in awe at how incredible it really is.  It's probably the most thought provoking anime I've watched.  And unlike Evangelion, it actually answers most of the questions, though often in roundabout ways, or otherwise it infers things or deliberately leaves it to the imagination.\r\nSo, to start it off, the story.  Right away, youare thrown into a utopian society with highly advanced technology.  Autoreives, the machines manufactured by humans, run pretty much everything.  They look and act like humans but are devoid of any emotion.  The Cogito virus gives them something like a soul, and they find emotions.  Autoreives infected with this virus often try to find out why they were created or why they serve their masters, but these emotions are not to be allowed and they are destroyed.  The people in this society are driven to become model citizens, that serve the city and its people perfectly.  If you ask me, they all act like robots themselves.  I'd go deeper into that, but I don't want this to be too much of a philosophical discussion.  This is just one of many philosophical questions posed here.\\n\\n\r\nRe-l Mayer is our heroine, and right away she seems a bit different, with her strange eyeshadow.  She is the granddaughter of the administrator, kind of like the head of a council in the city, and also an investigator.  She is investigating the Cogito virus and comes across some sort of monster, and her journey to find the truth begins.\\n\\n\r\nVincent Law works on autoreives and is an acquaintance of Re-l's that seems to have a bit of a crush on our heroine.  He is an immigrant and is working toward citizenship in this utopian society.  But he keeps popping up where the trouble is, like it's following him around.  Re-l and eventually he himself begin to wonder why all of this trouble seems to spring up around him.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first few episodes, a large part of the story, the character introductions, and just an overwhelming amount of information is just dropped on you.  It's very fast paced and very little of the literally hundreds of questions you have are answered.  After that, bits and pieces of what's going on are revealed and the pace of the show slows down.  I can understand why some people might give up on this, because it gets pretty confusing and most of the time you will just be wondering what is going on.  But, most of the questions are eventually answered, and I don't think there are any major parts they leave out.  Well, maybe one in the last episode, but I think they meant to leave that open.  For someone watching it for the first time, I'd like to say that there is a weird kind of game-show episode in the middle.  Pay attention!!!!  Answers to a lot of questions will be here.  Other than that, there are a lot of places that don't really seem important, but they are.  It may take a second watch to pick up on some of those though.\\n\\n\r\nI'll go ahead and say a bit about the characters next, since I already introduced Re-l and Vincent.  The other main character in the story is Pino, and autoreiv infected with the Cogito virus, so she is a lot like a real little girl.  I can't say too much about any of the characters though cause I think I'd probably give away too much, and may start to rant about philosophy again.  I will say that all of the major characters show significant development throughout the series.  And it is done very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is excellent.  The animation is very smooth, from simple scenes to action scenes and everything in between.  The art is gorgeous.  The character designs are a bit different, but fitting with the show, and are also done very well.  The backgrounds are rich in detail and are just beautiful.  Everything is really top notch here.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good.  The opening and endings are good, I liked the songs in both.  There wasn't much music in the show, but the sounds were done pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nI guess that would bring me to the enjoyment factor.  It's really hard to rate.  For most of the series I was plainly frustrated with how little information was revealed for how many questions the show posed.  Even so, I couldn't stop watching it.  Even after one episode of just asking \"what the hell is going on?\" I just wanted to watch the next one.  It just kind of draws you in.  I think this is mostly due to the excellent characters, but you also want to know more about what is going on in this world.  As I said at the beginning, it was frustrating but at the same time it was a masterpiece that can really only be seen for what it is once you have finished it.  While I was watching the show, I probably would've given a 5 or 6 for enjoyment because of the frustration, but I'd end up giving it an 8 or 9 in the end.  After all, it kept me wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, everything about this show was really pretty incredible.  The characters especially shine.  There is a great amount of philosophy there and it really makes you think about a great many things.  It is difficult to rate.  As frustrated as I was through the show, after I finished it, I looked back and was simply amazed by the sheer mass of the show.  I'm giving it a 9, but I may watch the show again and upgrade it to a 10.  Even now, I'm not sure it doesn't deserve a 10, but I didn't enjoy it quite as much as some shows, so I don't think I can give it a perfect score.  So, it's a 9.\\n\\n\r\nPS I have to apologize since this review may be a bit confusing itself.  I was trying really hard to put the show into words with out giving away too much of the show or ending up on a huge rant on philosophy.  And I like huge rants on philosophy.  Hopefully I was able to stay on track fairly well.",

The story came off pretty interesting to me, and is still pretty neat to think about after i've watched the series.\r\nPlot- 6/10. The plot was a bit shaky at it had kind of a hard time staying consistent.\r\nCharacters- 7/10. Very likeable characters overall, but not anything to go crazy over however.\r\nSound- 8/10. Very impressive sound; correct given soundtracks that really complement the atmosphere and given situations overall.\r\nAnimation- 6/10. The animation was pretty shaky, going from good to bad too often. The animation was alright at best it was not anything impressive.\r\nArt- 8/10. Art was visually impressive, very likeablecharacter designs, that cater to the well drawn dystopian environment.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8/10. At first i really didn't want to watch Ergo Proxy, because i thought it was unappealing, and the first two episodes weren't helping me think otherwise, but i slowly began liking and indulgeing myself into episode after next. Overall i felt that this series was very enjoyable in the end, i found no problem in marathoning this series because i was on the edge on my seat at the end of almost every episode, and i felt that the Ergo Proxy's ending did the justice.\\n\\n\r\n   TOTAL= 58/70 or 7.2/10. \\n\\n\r\nThis was well worth the watch, but you aren't really missing out on anything if you feel uninterested, and decide to skip or drop this series.  \\n",

To be honest , i enjoyed the most in this show is watching pino running around and doing pointless things but it is so damn worth.\r\nThe story itself is also very interesting as it slowly unfolds and lead us to the grand finale itself. There will still bequestions after finished watching like information about other proxies because we still only know very little about them. \\n\\n\r\nRest assured , this is not a confusing show. However , it requires one to do a little bit of thinking for each episode. You will need to apply some understanding and logic to fits the puzzle in the end so pay attention and try remember details from the previous episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a good series but definitely would not recommend to watch this series a 2nd time.\\n",

            "content": "What does it mean to be human. Is it simply by breathing, eating, living, creating, thinking that we're called one? Take a look at Ergo Proxy and see for yourself, the journey to discover the meaning of living and the value of a human.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is very intriguing with great pacing. The truth is, there are some episode in the show made me feel like time had been slowed down greatly, and it didn't bother me at all. We all know the same \"robot being human\" story which are told in many kind of media, but Ergo Proxy didn't fail to impress me inthe least with its own creative method. There are many hidden symbolism scattered around the show which might be difficult to notice, but if you're a long anime watching fan or a person who's interested in some classic philosophies, it wouldn't be much of a hard task to do so. However, that is not to say the show isn't flawed, by relying to much on the thematic content, it somewhat failed to lead the audience to a clear and primary objective of the show, which i myself was a bit confused during the narration. There's a saying that too much something is not good, i find it suits this category perfectly. The script is sometimes bugged which confuse me at a specific moment of the show. Still, as an original show, i must give credit to the producer for coming up with such a meticulously crafted story which constantly lead me to unexpected twist and pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nTurning to the characters, i won't deny this being the show biggest drawback (this doesn't mean it's bad, it's just simply the weakest elements of the show alone), not because they were not well portrayed or did not have any development, but because i failed to find any relation with them, or should i say, they didn't impress me much. The protagonist is a team of 3 people formed out of a chain of \"unexpected\" incident, hence some conflicts in the beginning, but soon they learnt how to live with each other, overcome many hardship and finally created a strong bond. There were some development that i found them rather rushed and quite \"unnatural\" from my observation, this is due to either technical or scripting problem, but was not too significant. Though the supporting cast had very little screen time, i find them more interesting than the main characters. However, the show didn't fail to display the characters development in a unique way, it happened very slowly, gently and smooth that i almost missed it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound, this is in my opinion the best feature the show. I meant, normally we don't usually pay attention to the background music being played during intense moment or some \"quiet\" scene. However, Manglobe managed to pull out everything they got on this part, which i couldn't help but \"feel\" when they hit the right spot. What most noticeable in this section is perhaps the OP, the producer deserves a medal for this one. Not just the music alone, the animated sequence are done magnificently which fits the music perfectly and added it to the goosebump whenever i hear it. The ending is \"deep\" which i didn't find it interesting at first but after grinding 23 episode i finally got into it. Kudos to Manglobe for this one.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, the show also win my heart at this one. While i am not really impressed at the art style, it completely fits the show for its theme and scenario. However, it's not the art style that got me, it's the directing skill and the execution. As mentioned above, during a few episode, i felt like it was twice the length of an usual anime episode, i can't really explain why but that is also a big plus for this show. They managed to make me \"become one\" with the protagonist, during their development, i was able to sympathy with them, understand them and couldn't help but cheer them up. There're also some nice camera angle that \"lighten\" the object and the theme, adding up to the impact on me. The character design is perhaps what dragging this part down (just a little). While i don't mind the \"dark\" theme, the robot/autoreiv design is pretty odd, even the female lead' design is kinda creepy as well but soon i got used to it and simply turn a blind eye on it. Moreover, i might be nitpicking but there're some \"bug\" in the execution which somewhat ruined my mood during a dramatic part. I meant a moment ago i was, how to say, filled with \"feel\", but a few second later the transition messed up and made me feel like i was trapped in an awkward situation. Nonetheless, those are just minor \"bug\" that i find them not much of a significance drawback of the show. Overall this is my 2nd favorite aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nHow do i feel while watching this anime? That is probably the hardest question. The show started off pretty slow so i'll be honest here, was quite sleepy for the first few episode, don't know whether it was due to the cold that hit me that day or not, but in the next day i felt like i was full of bean when grinding the remaining episodes. There are some thought-invoking moment which make me rack my brain to comprehend the story and characters. There are moment that so \"feel\" that i couldn't help but trying to clear my mind to drown myself into the show. There are heart-wrenching moment that somewhat hit me, not enough for a goosebump nonetheless. There are even some heart-warming moment that make me feel relieved after the stressful period of the show. I must say rarely did a show make me experience so many different mood in just 23 episode, so i must tip my hat up to the producers again for making this awesome show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is an unforgettable experience that almost \"steal\" my 3rd favorite spot: Aria, but some unfortunate flaws hindered the show from doing so. It managed to moved me, but i doubt it would be able to achieve the same to the other audience due to the difference in culture, taste and some objective obstacle that is inevitable. Still, i highly recommend this show for anyone who's bored of the \"ordinary\" show. If you want to seek something \"deep\", \"unusual\", \"thought-invoking\", then Ergo Proxy might be the a decent option in the \"sea\" of anime that we can hardly tell which one really stands out.",

            "content": "Hi Guys this is my first review on MAL so excuse my inexperience.\r\nErgo Proxy can be described in a nutshell. The word to describe it would be \" pretentious\". The first few episodes started off rather well displaying the danger of the ergo proxy, The secret of the past society {earth} and the overall introduction of the anime's premise.\r\nI thought that ergo proxy would have perfect answers to the mysteries given in the first quarter of the series. The only important fact i got out of the whole anime was that the ergo-proxy was vincent. spoiler much. Alot of my questions were answered in themost awkward way. Remember that Quiz show that Vincent was competing in? All those trivial information on the story like the methane gas bombing and such were mostly answered in that episode.\\n\\n\r\nErgo proxy had a major problem. It's main character Re-al. Her character to me served no major purpose to the entire story apart from being a important grandaughter, a love interest and most importantly an observer. My favourite part of the entire anime was when Iggy got the cognito virus and started calling her a BITCH! that was the most relatable aspect of the show to me. RE-Al's bitchyness.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I hated the story, It did have decent artwork and soundtrack. When I first saw the cover of ergo proxy in MAL. I thought to myself that it had some dark dystopian theme in the picture shown above with Re-al. Although it did have that theme it was done quite poorly. To me this mediocre anime is way overly praised and should watch other animes that is done better e.g Pyscho-pass.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6    \\n\r\nintroduction of a good setup but following up poorly\\n\r\nart 8\\n\r\nfor cool mysterious figures and animation like the ergo proxy\\n\r\nsound 7 \\n\r\nthe op and ed were good but nothing memorable\\n\r\ncharacter 5\\n\r\nfor shallow backstories and a bad main character\\n\r\nenjoyment\\n\r\n5 kill my joy after episode 3\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 6/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Il \"Cogito\", un virus di origine sconosciuta che permette agli androidi di prendere coscienza di loro stessi e provare dei sentimentiumani.\\n\r\nCome se non bastasse, da un laboratorio segreto fugge una creatura sconosciuta, nota come &quot;Proxy&quot;, seminando il panico in citt&agrave; e provocando la morte di numerosi cittadini. Re-L Mayer, la nipote del sindaco viene incaricata di indagare sui recenti accadimenti in citt&agrave;, fino a quando entrer&agrave; in contatto proprio col Proxy, dal quale verr&agrave; spaventatala a morte.\\n\r\nOvviamente questo contatto non verr&agrave; riconosciuto dal dipartimento di sicurezza, che prontamente insabbier&agrave; la verit&agrave; facendo passare Re-L per mentalmente instabile. Nonostante tutto lei &egrave; decisa a scoprire la verit&agrave; riguardo la creatura che ha visto, iniziando le ricerche da un cittadino immigrato trovato svenuto nei paraggi dell'incontro di Re-L e il Proxy, Vincet law.\\n\\n\r\nQueste le premesse per un anime che attinge a piene mani dall'immaginario cyberpunk, con palesi riferimenti a mostri sacri del genere come &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, e impreziosito da spunti di riflessione che si rifanno ai grandi del pensiero filosofico(impossibile non riconoscere le innumerevoli citazioni di Cartesio).\\n\r\nSe la parte propriamente narrativa promette di mantenere vivo l'interesse con una trama ricca di colpi di scena e di trovate interessanti, anche la parte tecnica non &egrave; da meno. Le inquadrature dal taglio decisamente cinematografico,accompagnate da musiche d'atmosfera, rendono la visione decisamente piacevole.\\n\r\nMolto buono anche il lavoro svolto dal character design, tralasciando la protagonista comunque vittima un po' dello stereotipo che si porta dietro, gli altri sono tutti caratterizzati egregiamente.\\n\r\nVincent all'inizio pu&ograve; sembrare il classico signor nessuno senza arte ne parte, ma il viaggio alla ricerca delle sue origini lo porter&agrave; a maturare l'esistenza di altre realt&agrave; al di fuori di Rom-Do, sviluppando una psicologia piuttosto interessante(coadiuvata anche dalla scissione nella natura stessa del personaggio).\\n\r\nDa qui anche il colore verde acceso dei suoi occhi(nascosti nei primi episodi) proprio a voler sottolineare la sua totale estraneit&agrave; a un mondo dove i toni di grigio la fanno da padrone.\\n\r\nInteressante anche la piccola autoreiv Pino, la quale infettata dal Cogito, prender&agrave; coscienza di avere un'anima, sperimentando sentimenti tipici degli umani come la gioia o la tristezza per la perdita delle persone vicine.\\n\r\nIl tutto &egrave; reso ancora pi&ugrave; interessante anche dalla totale assenza di una figura totalmente negativa, il classico cattivone di turno, che qui esplica la funzione di perno della vicenda attraverso varie personalit&agrave; come il capo del dipartimento di sicurezza Raul Creed, e in alcuni frangenti il dottor Dedalus Yumeno.\\n\r\nL'opera quindi si configura in quel filone degli anime con risvolti psicologici(innumerevoli riferimenti alle filosofie moderne), quindi non sarebbe neanche del tutto errato definirlo una sorta di Neon Genesis Evangelion moderno(alcuni passaggio prettamente immaginari ricordano molto le atmosfere), anche se il paragone finirebbe per banalizzare il tutto.\\n\r\nAnche qui come nell'opera della gainax, l'elemento divino ha una forte influenza lungo la narrazione, cos&igrave; come le riflessioni esistenziali dei personaggi, alternando momenti di narrazione, a vere e proprie puntata dedicate ad esplorare la psiche dei personaggi.\\n\r\nIl tutto scandito lungo l'arco di tempo di 23 episodi, anche se a conti fatti potevano risultare meglio ripartiti. Una galoppata iniziale ricca di eventi incalzanti, cede il passo a una narrazione pi&ugrave; pacata e riflessiva nella seconda parte, per poi ritrovarsi catapultati negli atti finali senza essersene resi conto.\\n\r\nIn effetti il rischio di perdere il filo, soprattutto quando la narrazione cede il passo ai momenti pi&ugrave; squisitamente psicologici &egrave; alto, il che pu&ograve; portare a perdersi qualche dettaglio a livello di trama, ma fortunatamente la stessa &egrave; cos&igrave; ben congegnata da portare lo spettatore a riprendersi i momenti chiave.\\n\r\nInfine, menzione speciale alle numerose citazioni presenti, che spaziano tra il campo letterale(La piccola Pino ricorda il burattino di Collodi), cinematografico(la scena della carrozzella della corazzata Potemkin), artistico( Ophelia di Milais),architettonico(la stanza del sindaco &egrave; di chiara ispirazione alla cappella dei Medici di Michelangelo), musicale(la sigla finale &egrave; Paranoid Android dei Radiohead)e chi pi&ugrave; ne ha pi&ugrave; ne metta. Proprio questo continuo scoprire citazioni su citazioni rappresenta quasi un secondo livello di apprezzamento dell'opera, che ne &egrave; letteralmente infarcito, basti pensare ai soli nomi dei vari personaggi.\\n\r\nChiudendo mi sento di consigliare quest'opera a tutti, visto che pu&ograve; essere apprezzato a pi&ugrave; livelli, dal semplice spettatore attratto dalla trama, a quello pi&ugrave; esigente in cerca di qualche spunto di riflessione una volta finite le vicende.",

            "content": "You know, going into this show, I picture this as a psychological mind-fuck series like Serial Experiments Lain or Texhnolyze but hope to follow some of the storyline better than those two, at least the latter. There is also this sci-fi Blade Runner\u00ac type going for it. Also notable, this series composition was by known Japanese screenwriter Dai Sat\u014d, who\u2019s known for writing for anime, such as Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, Wolf\u2019s Rain, Tekken: Blood Vengeance & Eureka Seven. He penning this does peg a slight of interest in me to see how the show goes.\r\nTens of thousands of years ago humans destroyedthe atmosphere, lost 85% of the population and had to evacuate Earth. In a hasty attempt to insure the survival of humanity, a human regeneration project was left behind under the care of an unstable management system. In one of the remaining pieces of that project called Romdo City, the proud and cool-minded Re-l Mayer works as an inspector for the Citizen's Intelligence Bureau. During the process of an investigation she meets the earnest and unassuming Vincent Law. Soon after Re-l has a disturbing encounter with a monstrous intruder in her home. Unable to shake the strange feelings she experienced Re-l is drawn into the mystery and terrible fate of the Proxies with which she and Vincent are somehow connected. Together, Re-l and Vincent work to unravel the mystery of Vincent's true identity, the fate of the Proxies and what their future holds now that Earth's atmosphere has finally recovered.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t lie. You might get lost into watching this show and lose some focus into that but that\u2019s not particularly the show\u2019s fault as you might need to watch this show twice in order to get it or if you feel well enough to give it another chance after some time. I admit some episodes are kind of tricky and head-scratching like the game show episode or the one that basically parodies or lampoons Disney characters. I like that this show is a challenge to me, trying to figure out some of the questions in the show when you know you\u2019re not going to get a quick answer that fast.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the focus on some characters often switch, as in you think Re-l is the main focus and while she\u2019s not really much of an interesting character (well, actually, she has character traits you can find in other female anime characters like her), she does shine well in the anime overall. Vincent Law was probably a very progressive character as you thought he would be this spineless fugitive on the law but as the show goes; his character development excels from being the little bitch character he was to a more evolved character. Pino is the cute little girl character in the show, possibly to contrast the dark and bleak atmosphere, and yet that factor didn\u2019t become annoying. It helped the show a bit. Other characters like Daedalus went through a 180 change in the show from someone that seems utterly faithful to Re-l to one crazy son of a bitch the next.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said about the setting and the atmosphere, the animation is very dark, bleak, and gray\u2026..and I mean very, very, very gray. The studio in charge of the animation is Manglobe, who you already know made shows like Samurai Champloo & Deadman Wonderland. Most of the time, the bleakness of it will put you to sleep but it fits rightfully within the show\u2019s tone. I will say what most people say about the character design of Re-l and yes, she does like that lead singer from Evanescence\u2026.you know, that band that was a thing a long time ago\u2026\u2026..I think they are still a thing though.\\n\\n\r\nThe music especially fits the tone of the series as it is very ambient and often orchestral in most cases. I really like the opening theme, \u201cKiri\u201d by Monorail, which is sung in English and I also give props to the ending theme, oddly enough is by Radiohead performing \u201cParanoid Android\u201d (heh heh, get it? Get it? Get it? Because somebody in the show is a----- OK, I\u2019ll stop now.) \\n\\n\r\nI fully recommend you see this in the English dub from Geneon/New Generation Pictures as it has got amazing performances from Liam O\u2019 Brien (Vincent Law) Megan Hollingshead or by her alias Karen Thompson (Re-l Mayer), Yuri Lowenthal (Daedalus), Rachel Hirschfeld (Pino) and among various voice actors with the bit roles they got.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: This show is quite the challenge to watch but I think some people who want to explore anime deeper than the surface should give this a chance. I just think you really need to have your brain on when watching this. I would say stream it at first and then decide if you want to buy it or not.\\n",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy takes place on a future Earth where humans are confined to cities within domes due to an ecological disaster that occurred in the past and has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. The cities themselves function as a utopia police state in a way. Everyone has a specific function in society and immigration from other cities is strictly controlled. The government of the city, run by a Regent and made up of several sub-departments, relies on control over every aspect of the dome and society to maintain stability in the face of humanity's conditions on the planet.\r\nThe art is gorgeous --- and onereason I loved this series. Backgrounds are quite detailed with lots of atmospheric and lighting effects put into them. Characters are drawn quite flat however, but the line work is superbly crisp. You would think this would clash, but when juxtaposed with the backgrounds it actually works quite well. Music is okay, but a little repetitious overall. This series is notable as having one of the best (not to mention one of the longest) openings I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character is Real Mayer, the granddaughter of the Regent of the city of Romdeau and an investigator for the Citizen Information Bureau. At the time the story begins Real is investigating a series of murders that have begun recently. The humans on Earth live alongside advanced androids called &quot;autorievs&quot; that appear to be partially biological (think Bishop from the movie Aliens) and are intelligent enough to carry on natural conversation. The physical characteristics of autoreivs vary based on their function with some appearing more human-like than others, having higher intelligence, or sensor capabilities, ect. Real has an &quot;entourage&quot; style autoriev named Iggy, who functions as her partner at work and life (note: they are not romantically involved if you're misreading my use of &quot;partner&quot; here).\\n\\n\r\nIn Real's work she comes across an immigrant named Vincent Law who works in the Autorev control dept (think BladeRunner), where his main duty is to destroy autorevs that have become infected with the Cogito Virus, which is a virus spread between autorevs like a contagious human disease and causes them to develop emotions and become self-aware. As an immigrant, Vincent is struggling to fit into society and be successful at his new job so he can stay in Romdeau.\\n\\n\r\nReal begins to find evidence at the murder scenes of creatures that are neither human nor autoreiv, creatures the government wishes to keep secret. After being personally targeted by the creatures Real realizes they have a connection to Vincent Law. Vincent is forced to flee the dome, with the help of a Cogito-infected autoreiv named Pino, when the Citizen Security Bureau attempts to capture him. Vincent has a form of amnesia is blocking him from remembering his past before he left his old dome, and decides to try and return to his birthplace to resolve his identity issues. Real and Iggy leave Romdeau to pursue Vincent and learn more about the creatures, called Proxy, and the connection the Proxy have to the future of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought that summary I just gave was rather vague and ended abruptly; you're right, it was. Ergo Proxy is an incredibly vague anime overall, and lots of people have started to watch it and given up simply from finding it too difficult to follow. There are people who have written entire blogs trying to explain what happened in this show for others' benefit. I was going write a longer summary, but I thought that would spoil the show too much. Ergo Proxy starts off in a fairly action-packed way, with one of the Proxys trying to escape a laboratory and Real being attacked by it later in a stairwell while she's on a case with Iggy. If you're going to judge the pace of the show from these first two episodes, you'll be in for a disappointment. Ergo Proxy is primarily a psychological anime and much of it is the characters having inner dialogs about their own identities and exploring the world outside Romdeau. How exactly the world came to be a frozen wasteland with a muddy brown sky, along with the nature of the dome system and the Proxys' relationship to it is the primary driver behind the plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot is not action packed it's still considered an adventure series by many, and although character-driven there are still the occasional fights, flights, and suspense. The show is filled with references to past great thinkers, psychoanalysts, and existentialists, especially in the character design and settings. I would consider this really cool, except the references are over the heads of most people who would watch the show, even the highly intelligent ones. The fact Shinsen actually made cue cards at the end of every episode when they subbed it, explaining some of the references made, should be a big clue to the producers they were trying a little too hard to be high-brow with their work. It was entertaining overall, but even I'll admit I was bored with a couple episodes in the middle. All this suspense also has the effect of making the ending slightly disappointing, and you may find yourself with many unanswered questions about the plot afterward.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these drawbacks I still recommend Ergo Proxy if you want more of a &quot;thinking man's&quot; anime.\\n",

            "content": "I can't remember how I came about this show - possibly searching this fine site, possibly a recommendation. However, you all want to know, should I be extending this recommendation to you fine folk. Well, welcome to another review by myself, after a long hiatus (after not having access to device on which I could watch anime well), I'm back and ready to review another show, the last episode of which I finished about 5 minutes ago, at the time of writing of course. Let's cut the crap and jump straight in.\r\nStory/Setting - To be as spolier-free as possbile, Ergo Proxy introduces us to adistopian world, with the only shown haven of this wasteland being the city of Romdeau. Oh, I only discovered Fallout 3 and New Vegas last year, that's likely why I picked this series up! Sorry, yes, Romdeau. Romdeau is much like your typical city you'd see today, with one key difference - the Auto-Rievs. In my eyes, essentially androids, they help the humans with their tasks, whether it be helping a doctor do research while he treats patients, or helping the police (or Citizen Intelligence Berau) fight crime, they're there to help us (again, drawing to fallout, not unlike the Mr Handy's and Procterons of that world). Of course, with this comes robot-like morals, and this is a main theme in the plot of the show. Saying that, and maybe it's because I have a short attention span and so wasn't watching as intently as the show went on, the end was crazy, and took me out of the world building they'd done thus far. I won't spoil much more and will outline the main characters later, but this is a solid story and one that reminds me of Bioshock and Fallout a lot. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art style for the show is amazing. Unfortunately for this small time reviewer, art is subjective and therefore some of you may not like the art, or find it average, but I really love it. I think it's testament to the art time that I actually can't find the words to describe it! 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Unfortunately, unlike the art, the sound was lacking, of course in my opinion. Not a fan of the opening theme, the ending was nice and mellow however, and the music only stood out to me in-show whenever some intense drama was going on. And where a lacklustre soundtrack works in a game like Fallout to build tension, I just feel it was needed here. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - there are one-time and recurring characters in this show, some excellent, some forgettable, and it's your opinion as to whether these characters should be labelled as main, integral to the plot, or not, but I will focus only on these three: Re-I, Vincent and Pino. Re-I is who we will follow most of the plot with, all though all three of them get stuck together fairly early on so they all have around equal showtime.\\n\\n\r\nRe-I, pronounced Ree-El (aha! Jokes! Metaphors! In all fairness, this is actually rather clever when it comes to the ending episodes but that's spoilers) is an Inspector for the Citizen Intelligence Berau, known from now on as the CIB (yes, yes, you changed one letter, very good) mentioned earlier. She has two missions, number one is to track down illegal immigrant Vicent Law (I never realized how much exposition was shoved in your face until now), for obvious reasons. They're fates get tied up, more litreally than you may think, as the story progresses and it's gets slightly harem, only with one guy and a cute girl (and that's not the traditional love as she looks up to Vincent more as a father) and tsundere Re-I, but you can deduce if that rating is fair and just.  And, speaking of the aforementioned cutie, we have Pino, an AutoReiv. The other mission Re-I had was to find infected AutoRiev's, the infection making them malfunction and disobey orders, and having thoughts and becoming more human-like as a result. Pino shows us the life these AutoRiev's lead, and on reflection she's actually probably the most interesting out of all the characters in the show. To say more would be spoilers. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up and give you an answer to the question presented at the start, yeah, I'd recommend this. Certainly not the best show in existence, but if you love apocalyptic settings but want a break from the zombies that normally make up post of this genre, this is a good alternative, and if like me you're a fan of fallout, bioshock or both, I think you'll spot similarities like I did. Hope you enjoyed this review and I'll speak to you all, in form of review, next time! Overall rating - 7/10.",

            "content": "Okay Lion Tamers, we visit another in a chain of very peculiar Anime.\r\nWe discuss of course, \"Ergo Proxy\".\r\nBecause of the unusual nature of the story line, or should I say 'narrative'; one cannot in good conscience call this anime a story. It is more of a psycho-babble rant. Is it trash? No. But if one had to ask if it were useful; the rub would tend to peel skin.\r\nFrom the reviews I've read, for Ergo Proxy; one gets a clear idea that absolutely nobody (including me) actually got to the point where the most relevant question is ever answered. While the story lets you surmise,and characters have their own opinion; that question, requiring absolute truth, gets buried in relativism. Hidden in plain sight, and undetectable. There is the strong possibility that the primary question has no answer, at all, and was created that way; as a clever editorial ruse, by the author.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. Let's get to the actual technical review. To that end I'd like to enter into evidence some notes I wrote to myself, while watching the legendary Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\n[\\n\r\n1). The characters are all quite persuasive, and the sense of tension is obvious. But there are problems with character development as well. The largest of which, throughout the story, we don\u2019t have clue-one who the bad guys/good guys are. It seems to me that the story is trying to appear non-adversarial et al. Perhaps the author is trying to hide a bad story in excessive confusion (i.e., blizzarding with BS).\\n\r\n]\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the narrative, my doubts (starting from the very beginning) continued to mount. Those doubts found their true voice upon completion of Ergo Proxy, in a last few lines that sounded very much like \"... Catch me if you can ...\".\\n\\n\r\n[\\n\r\n2). Atmosphere is dark and forbidding. Problems exist with this environment. Music is used far too often to declare a situation forbidding, when the scene does not warrant this much attention.\\n\r\n\t Characters' attitudes are decided by the use of musical atmosphere, when it is not actually clear that these attitudes are in evidence.\\n\r\n]\\n\\n\r\n[\\n\r\n3). Another comment on the musical score.\\n\r\n\tWhile the music often sets the proper mood, does it have to be set by artists with so little connection to the creation of actual music? The OP and ED are both performed by Grunge bands (MONORAL and RadioHead), which are almost always depressing and have no real interest in uplifting Mankind. The proper purpose of true music. Cool sounding refrains aren\u2019t the same thing as useful music.\\n\r\n]\\n\\n\r\nI get the notion that anybody can enjoy any kind of music they want. So can I. This music, and the inter-stigial score, lacked anything that I could enjoy. This took away from, and distracted me from the rest of Ergo Proxy. So in the end, if you like the musicality of the voice of Alanis Morrisette, you will like the vocals and supporting music in Ergo Proxy. If, like me, you like voices that have some passing experience with an education in music or vocal performance; then watch Ergo Proxy and tolerate the racket.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last note to myself;\\n\\n\r\n[\\n\r\n4). One of the plot-devices is becoming a problem. The \u2018cogito\u2019 virus, while government doesn\u2019t like it, and sometimes results in the androids becoming murderous, has not been described with enough evidence to point to the Virus as a negative in the culture. The authors want this to appear obvious, but there is nothing in the actual narrative to make this a truth.\\n\r\n\tCogito Virus may in fact be a good thing. Especially true if it is a response to the government, obviously run by an automated group of entities (which don\u2019t always act in the city\u2019s best interest); as some kind of Android protest.\\n\r\n]\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, it becomes clear, by the end of Ergo Proxy, that not only did the city's creator build the \"Cogito Virus\", but like all other events in the anime; Mankind weaponized it and turned it on themselves. More than ironic, almost prophetic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo it seems I have some of the same misgivings as many other viewers. I realize this review is not following my usual style, but it does seem somehow to fit the disjointed and ultimately hollow narrative that is Ergo Proxy. Unlike others, I will summarize the story line in Ergo Proxy, as follows:\\n\\n\r\n1). Several thousand years ago, Mankind did something really nasty, and laid waste to the entire planet of Earth.\\n\\n\r\n2). The remaining Mankind built the Proxies. These Proxies were left to their own devices, to lead the remaining Humanity to domed cities which the Proxies built.\\n\\n\r\n3). The original Mankind, then built spacecraft and departed to the nether regions, never to return.\\n\\n\r\n4). Clearly, the Domed Earth Inhabitants had become more or less sterile, and depended on their City Proxy to fertilize eggs which were maintained thereafter in incubators. These were matured, and then occasionally dispensed to the Citizenry.\\n\\n\r\n5). The City of Rondeau, loses its' Proxy, and gets another one (by military invasion) from the Domed City of Mosk. Mosk is reduced to ashes by the launching of a ICBM, from Rondeau's military facilities, in order to end any confrontation from any future quarter.\\n\\n\r\n6). Original Rondeau Proxy returns, and in an amnesiac fit, kills the new Proxy, obtained from Mosk.\\n\\n\r\n7). While much of these events are traversed, Rondeau descends into total chaos, and increasing by adversarial groups, leading to mutual extinction by gang/tribal murder.\\n\\n\r\nThe End.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis story starts on such a cheery note, translates through even more cheerfulness, and ends on a note so sweet, my teeth began to rot. In other words, Ergo Proxy is not for someone with a weak stomach. I know I'm being a bit glib, but this anime is that sad, and depressing. The worst part of the story, indicated by the end commentary, this anime is an unfinished work. There was obviously supposed to be a episode 24 and probably more.\\n\\n\r\nNow I finally get to deal with a more usual presentation of information.\\n\\n\r\nI will not talk about the characters. The characters, in a philosophical sense, do not actually exist. They are simply place-holders to hang the story on. In the end, they will all die of murder or deprivation. No struggle, involving the characters, actual resolve any topic or mystery. So in a theatrical sense, the events merely show people as part of the artwork, and have no real significance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for my comments on the artwork.\\n\r\nThe artwork is an attempt to present something that is mildly new and fresh. For 2006 it is a new kind of cartooning. The scene-angles, and other ideas were (for the times) very avant-garde. But more than 80% of the artwork is done in scenes that are so dark, and moody; that the darkness and moodiness get in the way of providing a vehicle that the artist might be able to demonstrate real talent with. If I stop-watched the anime, I think I'd get more than an hour of scenes where no artwork exists at all. It is that dark.\\n\\n\r\nMuch is made of the artwork for the character of Re-L. OK, not badly done. If I didn't know better, I would have guessed that they used a live action actor, for this woman, and cartooned her photography. Her face is a little too good for artwork. The designers of this anime want you to watch her, they need you to watch her, while they use your attention to hide something else; the empty suit behind the curtain (but I've talked enough about the story). She is the only character of note, because every scene she is in concentrates on her face, and almost always dead-center in the frame. And she is in a huge number of scenes.\\n\\n\r\nVincent gets an occasional scene in which his face is centered, but Re-L is the star of the artists.\\n\\n\r\nPino. I agree with other reviewers. She is pleasant comedy relief; she continues to play her harmonium, like Nero plays his violin, as Rome burns.\\n\\n\r\nI have said enough about the music. I hated all of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the question I almost asked at the beginning of this review: What is a Proxy?\\n\r\nLike I said, we can surmise, and some characters have their own opinion. But there is nothing in the story that let's us have any clear answer. Re-L almost asks that question several times, and nobody, not even the Proxies she gets near, ever explain their own existence. Re-L is left with a World in ruin, a large calibre shotgun, and enough cartridges in the magazine to put herself out of her own misery. But she will not be smart enough to pull the trigger and end herself; the only reasonable course of action. Checkmate.\\n\\n\r\nSo to conclude; Ergo Proxy. Long-winded, winding, loud, noisy to the point of distortion; and in the end has all the charm of sitting down to a Christmas dinner while failing to notice the house-fire across the street.\\n\\n\r\nI give Ergo Proxy a very generous 6. And may the actual God of the Universe have mercy on its' soul!\\n\r\nI ran out of mercy, after 9.5 hours of Ergo Proxy wore out my manners.\\n\\n",

I could spend several lines naming more and more influences and references but I will try to be more objective:\r\nThe art style and animation are great, but it seens they put some extra bling in the beggining to catch your attention. Nevertheless, still awesome.\r\nThe music is also great. I'm not talking about just opening and ending themes (one is Radiohead and the other I can't help myself from thinking about U2 playing the Smallvilleintro hehehe), but especially about the music used to build up tension and set up scenes, although with very reflexive and instrospective moments, you will have lot of silence and just hear the sound of the wind or stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the story, as stated above, if you are looking for insane intense action you may be missing the point of Ergo Proxy.\\n\\n\r\n- may contain minor spoilers about plot development, not events -\\n\\n\r\nAt some point near the end of the series I thought this story was great but could be told in half the number of the episodes. Only by the end I realized the author was not only experimenting plots but also building up a scenario of madness and confusion, as time lapses and unexplained events increase not only the characters will be getting lost.\\n\r\nIf that turn is for the good it's not for me to judge. Personally, I was more into the intense beginning and didn't enjoy that much the ending, but still I give it a solid 10/10",

            "content": "I'm going to preface this very simply: Ergo Proxy is not for everybody. This show has both been heavily praised for its abstract methods and accused of being pretentious and hard to understand for the pure sake of being hard to understand. (I can't completely dismiss the accusations of it being pretentious, as the show sometimes gave me a \"2edgy\" vibe, especially with it using Radiohead as a credits song, its a somewhat fair criticism, but its really subjective and is by no means grounds to call the show bad. Besides, radiohead is good stuff) I think the notion that this show is pretentious ismostly due to people who are threatened by cerebral shows, or people who outright do not understand this style of storytelling. Alas, the time for conjecture is over.\\n\\n\r\n I watched this as someone with a background in philosophy, and this show does delve into concepts like gnosticism and theodicy (the problem of evil) Even the name of the show and key elements in the story play off the phrase: \"Cogito Ergo Sum, I think therefore I am.\" That said, I don't believe that this show is unwatchable for anyone who hasn't studied philosophy as the show does a great job at explaining it's thesis. This show will leave you confused at times, and it will make you think at times. If you think a show asking you to think makes it pretentious, then this isn't the show for you. This is a show you watch for it's cerebral qualities, its a show that you're supposed to sit and think about after you watch it. If that's your cup of tea, then great, lets get into some common review points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Anime is full of trope characters, and it's easy to place practically any character into an archetype, Ergo proxy is no different. You have your 2edgy4u daddy issues girl, an awkward character with a hidden bad side, and a cute little girl. What makes the characters in Ergo Proxy great is the fact they so readily break the molds that are given to them. Most importantly, the characters ALL have motives and they are all integral to the plot. This show has no filler characters, a theme I see in a lot of shows I really enjoy, say Psycho-Pass, which is a great show but has characters that seems to be little more than plot devices. In a medium chalk full of filler characters, there's none of that in ergo proxy, and the show deserves praise for it. \\n\\n\r\nSetting: Ergo Proxy takes place in a pretty standard sci-fi post-apocalyptic world with pockets of surviving civilization, nothing terribly original, but the show creates a truly immersive atmosphere that drew me into the world in which the story took place.\\n\\n\r\nPacing: here's the big one, and the primary reason why I can't rank this show higher. the show has honestly, really terrible pacing. it starts off strong, drags on, picks up, and the throws filler episodes at you until it gives you everything it has during the last couple of episodes, which are mind you, where everything starts to come together and you really get a sense of satisfaction from the pending mysteries in the earlier episodes of the series. The parts that drag on, REALLY drag on, and you should keep in mind that the majority of this show is very slow paced. I really had to be in the right mood for this show, you want to make sure you have the mental energy to watch it. I wont go into which episodes I think are filler and which ones are not, because I know many fans of this series will disagree with me on a particular episode, and well, if you are interested in the show, it's best to come up with your own conclusions on that and not have a predisposition given to you by the opinions of some asshole like me. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you've ever picked up a classic Sci-fi book like Dune or even 1984, I highly recommend this series as this genre of dystopian cerebral sci-fi is the closest I can pin Ergo Proxy in. It's a show that's hard to digest but not without the rewards of doing so.",

Hailing the show's plot as deep or insightful is a far stretch. It still has lots of predictability. On top of that, it's dragged out. It's in between the predictable plot developments and cliches that it shines. The relationship that develops between Pino, Lil, and Vince manages to warm your heart despite the shows darkness. And when the trio's friendship is threatened, it put me on edge, because I had the genuine sense they cared for each other and mattered. However, I had qualmswith some characters (Vince's unwillingness to face who he was until the very end and Lil's coldness towards a character she may or may not love). It's good, and somewhat ground-breaking, but not genre defining or revolutionary, because I feel like it holds back. It holds back in character development, it holds back in plot development, and it holds back in creating a world I feel for. But the pros outweigh the cons, especially with the art and personality.

And I must say, this is a 10/10 show.\r\nErgo Proxy does something very similar to shows like Boogiepop Phantom and Serial Experiments Lain... REMOVESALL COLOUR.\\n\r\nNot to the same extent but it's not exactly a nice colour pallet, and I think that this really compliments the show's atmosphere quite well.\\n\r\nThe story is absolutely rich with backstory, and all the plot that it goes through is fairly ambiguous leaving lots of questions at the end. But not in the bad sense that it wasn't really wrapped up.\\n\r\nLots of the questions you have at the end will be solved over time as long as you are willing to put in the time and effort to answer them on your own or rewatch the show. There is one flaw, if you can call it that. This show assumes you are not only a very intellectual person but also that you have enough time and can give enough effort into a show to watch everything that happens very VERY closely. Let me explain, whereas a lot of anime likes keeping a mystery until the very end and saying \"It was me all along!\" right at the very end, maybe having that character give a long monologue about how he did it all to tie up all loose ends, Ergo Proxy just leaves it.\\n\r\nBut that monologue is truly the entire show, it hints at everything the whole way through. And that is why I love it.\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding and I can tell this because of the fact that every episode I feel like my soul is being sucked from my body by the art alone (again, ALL COLOUR IS GONE)\\n\r\nThe music is lovely, Radiohead is the ending soundtrack and the op just grows on you as you watch.\\n\r\nThe characters grow quite well too, although I can't talk too much about them without going into spoiler territory (Oh another thing, you can look up NOTHING about this show, one small picture can spoil it all, so another flaw is that it takes a lot of devotion and care to not accidentally spoil it for yourself)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show the entire way through, it kept me asking questions even after the very end and in a show like this, that's what's best.\\n\\n\r\nI can see somebody not liking this, but give it a shot and try it out for yourself, you may just find a new favorite ;)",

Ergo Proxy is one of the best animes i'll ever seen, everything, since art to screenplay, is a proof that with anime you can do more than the typical shonen and shojo cliches. a lot of people says it's too weird, but they don\u00b4t understand, or maybe they don't want to, the story. yeah, it's a anime to think, and that's why i love it, i like the anime that tell me stories that makes me think. the animation is one of the best i've seen,it's relly well done.Don't worry if you think this story could be so comples, is more enjoyable that you'd think",

Re-watch until you'll learn the true meaning of it.\r\nErgo Proxy was the first anime that really makes me go deeper. Instead of focusing on more about the product, they just focuses more on the art and it's meaning it. In other words, Ergo Proxy is not your typical Saturday morning children's anime that has whackier setting focuses more on the bright side. It turns out, Ergo Proxy is all about the more serious type of anime composes more on about the mystery and supernatural with some philosophical question about it.\r\nErgo Proxy is allabout the story of a man named, Vincent Law a guy who has no idea who really is and he wants to journey back to his mainland to know who really is and why he doesn't remember anything. On the other hand, Re-l Meyer, an investigator, is also doing her own job and also. to know who is Vincent really is.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is composes of not one but two protagonist. The character development here in this anime is pretty fantastic. The storyline is very compelling and deep, and also, some of these episodes are going to make you bizarre to understand due to it's psychological meaning behind it, which is pretty artistic and complex if you understand it. But the biggest plot twist here are the proxies, trust me, they are going to messed up your mind. It's a psychological twist though. And if you didn't understand it, you may consult the summaries of each episodes due to it's deep atmosphere of the anime. But there's a certain flaws that made this anime awkward, although it is not a hundred percent dark, there are not one, but two awkward episodes that you must look forward to. One is a game show that parodied a popular game show, and a Disney Theme park controlled by a proxy.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, due to it's nature of this anime. Expect some dialogue heavy of each of the episodes. It might give you some information in every aspects of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much so, this anime is awesome and a must watch anime. It could also tell about the future of our planet once we let the robots came on our lives, what are the pros and cons of it, about the Earth's condition if we just forget about the environment that mother earth gave us and the roles of every proxies around it. Everything has a question that lies deep in this anime. It's deep and dark atmosphere in this anime is making this more watchable. So if you don't understand it, why bother re-watching it again? It's a worth a try to watch this anime... See it for yourself.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a mature and thought provoking anime, then Ergo Proxy should be at the top of your list. The story is very well written and really challenges you throughout. At first glance, Ergo Proxy seems like your run of the mill sci-fi drama, in which humans and androids co-exist.However, this is not the case. At best, that relationship plays a secondary role throughout the series, because there are more important aspects to deal with. Some of them make sense and some of them will still have you thinking long and hard after you've finished watching the show.\r\nThe series touches on modern dayissues such as the future of the human race; the wellbeing and survival of the planet; and the concepts of God or gods, creation, and, to use a term from the series, the so-called \"model citizen\". It's not religious by any means, but there are some interesting takes on creation at the end of the series. It really depends on your interpretation, which is one of the reasons why the show is so good. (I'll stop here before I write any spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nOn the light side though, there are also some really funny parts and one of the main characters is extremely cute and funny. I generally dislike glaring cute and daft characters, but this character is actually really witty and smart. Her character effectively tells the story of the androids in this series, as she learns to deal with human emotions and being more than just a machine. The series also contains a love connection between the two main characters, which is almost in a state of suspended animation throughout the series. There is always tension and many opportunities for things to escalate, but they rarely do. In my experience, although such love stories are agonizing and frustrating to watch, they are often the best and most rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to all the above, Ergo Proxy also has strikingly beautiful visuals and artwork, which incorporates 3D rendering quite well. I love the contrast between the dark atmosphere of the outside world and the almost plastic and unnatural light of the world inside the dome.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going on too long now, but really give this a try. It's a rewarding show on all fronts.",

But the positive points first, i love the apocalyptic atmosphere, the whole gattaca-them where ppl are divided into classes and outside the perfect world of Romdo is a wasteland which is pretty much what's left of earth. The character design is well done, reminds me of BONES, especially when Vincent Law had a remarkable face lift after he fully awakens the proxy. Re-l Mayer's character art wonderfully fits her personality where she keeps a snobbish/elitist facade but soon learns to genuinely care about the ppl around her. I also lovethe chemistry between her and Vincent Law, as well as Pino who breaks the ice often to the desolate and gloomy plot. I didn't give it a perfect score because it's one of those animes that tries to make a 'complete' sense of the mess it made but will not deliver a very satisfying ending, instead leaving the viewer still in the dark, to pull out majestically from the twists and heavy metaphors and make sense of it to the viewer -is to my opinion what makes a genius storytelling. The atmosphere is also muted if not, ominous almost has the word 'kicka**' in the EP world. xD Lastly, I highly recommend Shinsen subs release as they have several neat notes/tidbits at the end of each episode that help ALOT to better understand the show... that some claim it is the best labor of love from the said group. Overall, Ergo Proxy is worth to check out.",

Yeah sure buddy name me one that's better than this and the only valid ans you can give is the first Ghost in The Shell movie because hell that's an unrivalled masterpiece in a league of its own. NGE went to utter trash with one of the most promising plot lines I'd ever seen and Shinsekai Yori just couldn't pull off that dystopian idea albeit having pretentiously tried to do so. I haven't checked out serial experiments lain as of yet but I've heard good things about it so it might take this shows spot as my favourite dystopian show ever.\\n\\n\r\nThis show had a brilliant soundtrack and had this strong FMAB vibe with the character art and visuals in certain aspects/parts of the show and just jesus christ this was so painstakingly boring to watch at the beginning but became such a page turner towards the end. One of the best endings I've ever seen\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10 from me",

The pallette is overly dark, but it fits very well with the theme the anime is going with. The characters are well designed, the environments are beautiful and the actions scenes are mostly well done. It is beautiful, it is well rendered and it goes really well with the story that is being told.\r\nSound\r\nThere is nothing that really stands out on the sounds. Yes, both the opening and the ending are good, but you don't get shivers from hearing any of the anime'ssoundtrack outside of it. So while the sound fits in well, it is not a point of attraction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show are the characters and their development. Both maind characters are well designed. Irritating, yes, but they are very well developed within the series. Learning about themselves, escaping indoctrination, changing the way they act because of their experiences, learning and growing.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part is actually protagonized by the side characters. The development of both the security chief and the medical chief are fantastic, clearly in line with their own obsessions.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few very big missed oportunities in development on the autoreivs - Pino is ok, but she stays mostly the same annoying thing during the series, and Iggy really could have used more screen time to be more shocking. Although his development is exactly what Re-I experience with him must have been. Ignored, ignored, ignored, holy shit what happened?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI quite liked the show, with a few exceptions ( Ep 19 in particular was terrible ). But it suffers a lot in the middle with episodes that are completely disconnected from the rest of the series that could have been better utilized to expand the storylines and points that the show brings but puts aside.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to get you to think about some pretty big questions - what is humanity, what is to be human, whats the difference between a human and a robot, who controls and decides that...\\n\\n\r\nI can't say it fails to deliver - it raises some really interesting points - but it clearly bites more than it can chew. A lot of points could have been used a lot better - the Cogito virus  why the proxies fight each other, why they are so vital for the cities... The virus in particular could have a series of its own, instead its just utilized as a backdrop instead we get a lull that lasts almost 10 episodes, going to very random places. A lot of that time could have been much better utilized.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a good and interesting series, but it just does not compete with the masterpieces of the genre.",

It will be difficult to understand it if we do not have good attention and memory that works in many moments of the series. Its dark and decadent theme shows very well the atmosphere of the typical stories about alternative governments and dystopias of future civilizations that for some reason or reason came to live in precarious situations. However, its complexity, the feeling that there are filler chapters (which are not, because they all have their importance, but that can really give you that idea) make a dent in it. It'snot perfect, but it's a great series.\\n\\n\r\nNow personally I admit that I got bored in parts, but it is to date perhaps one of the heaviest, cryptic and complex animes or stories I have seen, I generally like it and it really leaves you to think, it does not give you everything to eat easy, perhaps not even 60% eaten, you can or forces you to a review or seek separate explanations and when you find out details or incredible points that you missed or simply did not understand you are surprised, in itself, it can be considered a great work of worship, with great philosophical and existentialist messages, is not something I would recommend to a casual audience or just want to entertain because it can really become tedious and even boring for many and it is true that when something confuses you is not to feel so, perhaps I need more entertainment or go deeper into those issues in which the story unfolds (probably my only complaint), it is obvious that they deliberately leave themselves half eaten or complicated, but not necessarily have to be so much. Likewise an 8/10 and a great story that must be seen yes or yes.",

Ergo Proxy was visually stunning and could have been \"great\", but the story line and pack of depth was just too much too bare.  Ambitious but empty.  After about 19 episodes the ambiguityncaught up withitself and it began to feel like they were making it up as they went.   I rewatched (more than) half the series to better understand what complexities I might have missed, but I didn't miss anything,A pretentious waste of time.  Anime equivelent of the  \"Lost\".",

            "content": "\"I think, therefore I am\"\r\nThis is the main reasoning of the highly acclaimed cyber-punk series which left many people scratching their head. The series isn't very keen in holding your hand throughout the series, so you have to use your own brain to figure out most of missing pieces. When you do, you mind is blown and you now look very different at things in life.\r\nWho am I? What is my purpose? Why do I live? Those are the main questions that set the story in Ergo Proxy. The identity of the characters are contantly questioned by others, but especially by themselves. The story isvery complicated and doesn't give much away in the first half of the series. You constantly left guessing which purpose everyone has and it can make your brain melt. I feel like this is the main selling point of the series.\\n\r\nThe series has a very deep meaning, but it isn't trying to be pretentious by just throwing deep and unnecessary philosophy at the viewers just for the sake of.\\n\r\nIt actually makes the viewer think about the meaning of life and having a purpose and I find that really enjoying.\\n\r\nAfter only watching it once, I still haven't figured out everything the story has to offer, but the series is inviting enough to watch is a second time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art does it job by giving out a eerie vibe throughout the whole series. The cyberpunk dystopian setting has been handled pretty well and you can really see the thin line which humanity walks on.\\n\r\nThe art could have been more fluid in some parts of the series, but it doesn't take much away from the overall quality of this series which is almost a decade old.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is, just as the art, very eerie and dark. It really makes you feel like  humanity is on the last brink of survival. Majority of the OST is done very well, but some songs could have made more impact. The opening and ending are very refreshing and in a weird way complement the series. It's not normal for a anime to have a opening song from a English band like Radio Head.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done. You have the strongheaded, calm and driven Lil, who takes a lot of things for granted. You have the kindhearted, but at times, strange Vincent Law, who is on a quest to find his true meaning. At last you have the cute and innocent Pino, who still has to learn what being a human is all about.\\n\r\nThe side-characters are a strongpoint of the series. You can relate to of feel for many of the characters as you slowly begin to understand their purpose and goals in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe series left a great impact on me. At times it was hard to follow the direction the story was taken and that left me with alot of questions. At times, the pacing could be slow in the first half, but the series redeemed itself in the second half. Overall, I really enjoyed watching this series, because it left a great impact on me at the ending. \\n\\n\r\nI would reccomend this to anyone who likes a good and dark anime with a compelling, but vague story which unfolds as the series progresses. Anyone who likes great characters who you can relate to and feel for with their own struggles that they need to overcome.\\n\r\nAnd anyone who likes any scifi series that makes you scratch your head.\\n\\n\r\nIt has pacing problems, but if you stick to it, you will be very satisfied when everything falls at it's place at the end.",

            "content": "Okay, it's not that this show is bad exactly. Lots of people really love this show and it doesn't do anything that makes it specifically bad or unenjoyable to watch. However, for me, Ergo Proxy is smack in the middle of \"Meh\" and \"Okay\". The main issue is that for the whole viewing of it, give a take a few interesting scenes, I was BORED...actually bored isn't a good word for it. Nothing in the show is boring really, and there are some moments that really are executed well. The issue that I experienced was more along the lines of tedium; every episode felt likeit lasted longer than 30 minutes and the show as a whole was very dragged out. It's not good to have a 23 episode show with over 4 episodes of filler.\\n\\n\r\nIn a dystopian society where everyone lives in domes to protect them from the harsh conditions of the outside world, there are a series of events taking place. For one, a virus is effecting the robots that manage the daily activities of the city, making them develop feelings and emotions they shouldn't have. On top of this, rumors are spreading about a demon that has escaped from the government's secret holding facility. Enter Lil Mayar, granddaughter of the city's regent and someone who has taken an interest in said rumor. The whole story really gets spoilery from then on, so that's about all I can say.\\n\\n\r\nGetting right to it, the characters were not a highlight of this show. Most of them were bland, stereotypes with a few characters making the show enjoyable, mainly the main 3 characters. But, even then, Lil herself doesn't really develop that well until one filler episode and ALL her development happen in that episode. I found my self being compelled to want to watch one group of characters, but then the show shows me others I don't care about, and just when I start to enjoy those characters, the show switches back to the OTHER characters. It's just not  compelling to watch theses stories when they're so disjointed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation.....dark. Very dark. Like, so dark, oh my god, what is this? I actually got excited when there was color. Just....too dark, man.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, finally something good. the soundtrack is nice. It's a good mixture of classic and modern with a feeling that fits the atmosphere of the show quite well. Also, I count this show as one of my 'Songbird Shows' because I watched it for the opening, and the opening is beautiful. It's simple and repetitive, but it didn't grow old on me that much, which I appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Ergo Proxy is a show plagued by bad details. There's nothing inherently awful about the show, but so many small things combine to make a show that is a chore to watch. I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority here, but that's how it was for me.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Great, yet simple opening\\n\r\n+Soundtrack is nice\\n\r\n+Ending was good and fit the whole setting\\n\r\n+Some select characters\\n\r\n+Unique plot\\n\r\n+Reveals in this show are genuinely surprising and interesting (if you can keep track of it all)\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Lots of the characters\\n\r\n-TOO DARK\\n\r\n-Sometimes hard to follow if you don't pay close enough attention\\n\r\n-Feels too drawn out\\n\r\n-4 EPISODES OF FILLER IN A 23 EPISODE SHOW\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe positives listed are more numerous than the negatives, but the negatives here are way more significant. It all combines to create a mediocre show with a cool story that is squandered due to too dark of an atmosphere and lack-luster characters.",

            "content": "When stumbling across most dystopian works (both in literature and audiovisual fiction), you can assume with no hesitation or mislead that the plot will probably reflect a detailed and quite complicating exploration of the presented setting. While not being exactly formulaic, the multiple repetitive attempts on this subgenre of sci-fi range from fantastic experiences to bottom-of-the-barrel kind of pretentiousness. Normally, highly ambitious; yet the fresh air they once possessed has been slowly weakening as time goes on. Fortunately, a particular Manglobe production aired during 2006 came to slap on our faces what an extremely experimental creation can actually achieve. Ergo Proxy is a title thatpleasantly defies all conventions stablished for most science-fiction stories found in the medium. Unlike your typical dystopian setting, the human society is not the main focus of the story, nor are the weird mechanisms of politics or the rebellion of manufactured robots. Instead, Ergo Proxy takes us into a journey. A metaphysical, deeply philosophical and enriching adventure that stands out from any other title of the same genre, as well as becoming a wholly memorable experience in the process. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, you notice what kind of anime you're dealing with. The mood is serious and it doesn't change very often. Ergo Proxy is not a light watch, but a rather interpretative and ponderous one. Actions scenes are present but very far in-between. The series is, in a nutshell, a complex story of self-discovery with various allegories and puzzling references to famous philosophical motifs and mythology (I haven't seen this amount of theme tackling since Final Fantasy X!). The meaning of life, the end of a self and the appreciation of the 'being' are some of the themes explored in the series. Besides the core themes that make a poignant resonance with the cast (which I'll discuss later), Ergo Proxy still delivers a great amount of world build up to care about. The AutoReiv's infection, the misery outside the 'domes', the reasons behind the catastrophe, the origin of Proxies. Everything is slowly answered subtly, avoiding the annoying random exposition and hazardous plot-holes. By the time the show reaches its climax, everything feels satisfyingly wrapped up.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot may seem linear basing on the first six episodes, but by the midway it will reveal its episodic, road-adventure narrative as our characters travel from one place to another. This is something that usually leads to a turn-off for most viewers expecting a sense of continuity from their stories, but Ergo Proxy gladly subverts it by having numerous compelling dynamics among its characters, multiple events happening at-the-meantime and themes that are looked into without feeling 'pretentious'. Most of the episodes range from very experimental exploration to exploiting the character's identity crisis: but the big picture keeps reflecting a ride that leaves you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the story is far from perfect. Often contemplative, the metaphysical nature of the show mixed with the overall subtlety and enormous variety when managing very abstract concepts can make the experience a bit too random and even wacky for many. It's also quite experimental with genres (one episode was about a comedy Pop Quiz contest!), so the change of tone can come a bit too abrupt. Furthermore, the overreaching theme exploration, as with any philosophical series, sometimes leads to a torturous preachiness that appear as extended character monologues.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strongest part of the show, undoubtedly. Seemingly shallow at first, they develop a lot of dimensions, learn to value themselves and find a reason to exist within a lacking world, emphasizing how relevant the core themes are to practically everything. \\n\\n\r\nRe-L is the darling of the Romdeau dome Regent, as well as being an arrogant and cold-headed leader-type of character, similar to what Motoko Kusanagi was for 'Ghost in The Shell'. She's also rather tomboy, tricky and over-analytical most of the time, acting heartless towards her personal AutoReiv Iggy. Despite her initial unsympathetic personality, later on the show her attitude touches further layers than what the viewer can think of such a vexatious figure; leaving to us one of the most likable and developed female leads I've seen in anime. Plus, she looks pretty bad-ass when using her trademark automatic shotgun. \\n\\n\r\nVincent is an immigrant from a foreign dome, aspiring to become a 'fellow citizen' in Romdeau. He's the heart of the series, as the story follows his adventure of self-discovery and search of an identity. He has an innocent, passive attitude towards most people he meets, but also hides a very cryptic side that's getting suffocated by his identity crisis. Curiously, he also has this funny gimmick of keeping his eyes almost always closed.\\n\\n\r\nPino is the adorable little girl companion-type AutoReiv infected with the Cogito Virus. She's always cheering up mates, repeating gags and buzzwords related to whatever monologue the characters are saying or just joking around. Her presence is crucial so the show never gets too lifeless, and she also develops more feelings as the story goes on. The rest of the cast include Daedelus, doctor and the one in charge of the Proxies investigation, who also shows a naughty obsession with Re-L; and Raw, the chief of the Security Bureau in Romdeau who lost his wife and daughter during the first appearance of the Proxy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is another apartment very well thought-out. Given the very dry and melancholic nature of the show, the color palette is dark and sinister, all the backgrounds are well drawn and the most abstract shots have a striking touch. The animation is quite fluid, too. The character design, though, can turn quite erratic. From different perspectives, the face lines ranges from very plausible to goddamn dreadful. Still, the production values were maintained quite consistently throughout the story, unlike other studios that get really poor and lazy towards the end (*ehem*Gainax*ehem*). \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is amazingly atmospheric. While not having a lot of memorable individual tracks, the sound effects are extremely haunting. However, this aspect of the soundtrack pales in comparison to the beautiful opening theme song. \"Kiri\" (also known as \"Come and Save Me~\" for the pals) is among the best opening themes I have ever listened to. A very high pitched, surprisingly sung in English and full of feeling, is one of those songs that makes everything a little better. The ending theme song (\"Paranoid Android\") is also pretty good but lacks the organic and upbeat nature of the OP. If I had to state which dub is superior, I would incline towards the English one. There the voices fit far better and the general seriousness is reflected in a far more plausible way than the seiyuus did. Still, the Japanese is quite decent.\\n\\n\r\nFew science fiction titles had appealed to me as much as Ergo Proxy did. The exploration of its themes is magnific. It has an attractive narrative, great soundtrack and memorable characters. The repetitiveness and some dull moments hinders it from being an absolute favorite, but is still one that I have on my pedestal. \\n\\n\r\nClearly, it's not an anime for everyone. Very thought-provoking, quite confusing, too subtle for the average viewer; it's an inevitably controversial series. Still, Ergo Proxy remains as a highly recommendable modern classic, and should be watched by anyone who wants something that dares to be different and succeeds splendidly.",

            "content": "In a post-apocalyptic world,  humanity survives amidst the barren wasteland in isolated domed cities.  In these cities, biogenetically produced humans and androids called AutoReivs all function according to their raison d'etre for the common good.  In Romdo, one of the last remaining domes, Re-l Meyer, Inspector of the Intelligence Bureau and granddaughter of the city's regent, heads an investigation into the mysterious cogito virus, which is causing AutoReivs to develop free will and sometimes murder citizens.  While investigating, she meets the unassuming immigrant Vincent Law and is later attacked by a terrifying monster.  Sensing Vincent is somehow connected to thestrange occurrences, Re-l seeks him out to uncover the mystery of the proxies.\\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is my favorite type of anime: serious, complex, and philosophical.  From the opening scenes, which feel more like the introduction to a movie than a series and immediately suck you in, it is apparent that this is an ambitious undertaking, intended to be a legitimate addition to what might be termed the \"intelligent\" anime genre, alongside the likes of Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Ergo Proxy lives up to its ambitions, offering a brilliant and layered post-apocalyptic story that is well-executed and paced throughout the first half of the series.  Even in the more muddled second half, where the series begins to reveal and intertwine the historical context and the identity and purpose of the proxies, the attentive viewer will be well-rewarded and will find that virtually no scene or dialogue was without purpose.  In addition to a superb story, the main characters are complex and enjoyable.  Re-l is serious and, in her own terms, often a \"total selfish bitch;\" Vincent is meek and relentlessly kind; and Pino is the adorable child AutoReiv who is always being cute, hilarious, or both.  As seen in the aptly-named episode 16, \"Busy Doing Nothing,\" (arguably the best episode in the series) their interactions are often a pleasure to watch.  Production-wise, Ergo Proxy's animation is quite nice and the character designs (particularly the unforgettable Re-l) are original.  The voice acting is great, and the OST, while lacking any standout tracks (perhaps \"Wasteland Nostalgia\") and more like an orchestral soundtrack for a movie, is very cyberpunk and post-apocalypse.\\n\\n\r\nBut while such \"intelligent\" anime have the greatest potential, they are also the easiest to complicate.  Ergo Proxy is very complex, and would undoubtedly suffer from debilitating obscurity were it not for episode 15, a filler that is anything but because it lays out critical facts regarding the apocalpytic event, the proxies, and the main antagonist.  Although this is certainly appreciated, presenting these facts all at once in a random game show episode, instead of interspersed throughout earlier episodes, reflects an uncharacteristic laziness on the part of the otherwise carefully-executed series.  Similarly problematic is the final episode, which admits its shortcomings through its title, \"Deus Ex Machina,\" a literary term referring to an unrealistic or unexpected intervention that saves the protagonist or story through improbable means.  While earlier episodes offer some hint of the events in the final episode, only the extremely attentive viewer will have foreseen its coming, and most will find the surprise to be the product of poor rather than clever writing. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, Ergo Proxy is a wonderful story and anime if not somewhat poorly executed.  Really this is one of the best and most interesting of premises and most complex of plots that I've seen in any anime.  Unfortunately once the series moves beyond telling the immediate story of the events in Romdo and Re'l, Vincent, and Pino's journey, and begins to provide a larger historical backdrop and philosophical connotation, it fails to deliver in a clear and thought-out fashion and it could be a lot tighter.  This by no means is to suggest passing up what is otherwise an amazing show.  If you watch closely (and look online or to the manga for help if you get lost), Ergo Proxy ranks among the best.",

What was fascinating about it was the fact that the characters, setting, and events suggested the layout/activity of a human brain or human thought. It's hard to explain, but the city Romdo represents thoughs bound by societial influence, the world outside basically represents \"thinking outside the box.\" Iggy is the conscience, Proxy/Vincent is the introduction of a new way of thought, Daedelus is desire, kitty girl is hope, and Re-l is the final result: the final action or thought created by the \"brain.\" \r\nThis is just my little theory, obviously you could take this show many differentways, and analyze it forever until you realize there really is no real answer to anything that happens.",

I'm not that big of a fan when it comes to sci-fi but Ergo Proxy was something I enjoyed watching. However, there are a couple of downfalls, such as there isn't always action and some scenes are CONFUSING AS HELL! Other than that, great watch,& I don't regret it at all.\r\nStory: 9/10. The background storyline of this is genius, imho. The plot develops well and the ending of this series was an AMAZING cherry on top. I can't say much more without writing spoilers.. this is ananime that you just have to watch to figure out the story line. A lot of mystery is involved so it keeps you going. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Flawed at times, and somewhat weird.. but it is unique so I gave it an 8/10. I loved the character design of Re-l mostly. And pino. It was just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. I lalaLOVE the opening song and the ending was very nice. I also think that the background music fits very well with the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Each character has its own unique personality. Throughout each episode, you'll unravel more and more about each character. 10/10 because Vincent was the cherry on top when it came to this. He was such a complex character, a complex person, he was the mystery that kept me watching. Re-l's personality was developed so well too, imo. Her attitude would fit the way she acted. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. Overall, I liked it and had a great interest throughout the anime. There were parts that were WAY too slow-paced and bored me nearly to tears, so that's a negative. Another negative is that there were some really confusing episodes that made no sense whatsoever. It is arguable whether or not they are fillers or actually contribute to the development of the characters/plots. Either way, it was confusing, so eh. :(\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. The storyline is fantastic, art is nice and unique, music good, characters amazing, and I enjoyed watching it for the majority of the time. Overall I'll give it an 8/10 because of that.",

Interesting?\r\nI might say so. Re-L is the grandaughter of the Devon Meyor,one of the councilors in Ramedeau, a dome that stands in a wide spread desert which was once Earths nature. Enough with the drama. Re-L although her grandfathers position is nothing less than an inspector and a very known person. \r\nThings start to rumble when she is going to meet someone. (not telling who, you got to watch). Untill that point i thought it to be a totalbore, although i am up for a dose of futurism. All the high tech words made my head spin so fast, i stopped and glanced at the ending of the first episode with the desire to watch even further.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has it all to make it an interesting and good anime to watch. Re-L is sorta the type that looks for her own truth. (you will see along what i am talking about). She has an Entourage, Iggy, who is an ideal citizen, one who doesn't makes mistakes. Apparently in that future a virus known as Cogito appears and thus far can infect these ideal citizens to have emotions and practically a soul.\\n\\n\r\nThe one whom i didn't not mention is Vincent Law, the clumsy, obedient one, who will later on play an role of the utmost importance. The atmosphere created by his persona along with Re-L consists of 45% of the series. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion. It's a most for science fiction addicts and those who search for a more deeper story then the harem type or the love triangle, which are nice too, but sadly pretty hallow as in wisdom.",

            "content": "Overyhyped. That's the word I'm going with to describe this show. I read the reviews on MAL and the praise from some other websites and I saved this anime until I had time to watch and appreciate it. In all, I've had to give it a 7.\r\nThat is not to say the anime is bad. It has a lot of strong points. Also, no matter what anyone has to say about the anime, positive or not, no one can deny it's unique. If you're tired of the usual generic tropes associated with anime, watch this. Also, the music is pretty well chosen and the art-stylefits the story very well. The animation is also fluid and the characters can express emotions well. But some of the flaws of this anime seriously hinder proper enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThere are SPOILERS AHEAD. I'll try to minimize it but I want to defend my stance here because most people seem to find this anime a jewel among coal --  and I can't see it that way. I repeat SPOILERS AHEAD.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the good stuff. The ART, as I have stated is really good. There is a slight amount of time required to warm up to the character and world designs, but it is no dealbreaker -- unlike One Piece. In fact, when I thought about it, I found the artstyle to be perfect for this story. It is at times uncomfortably dark; like in a Dark Souls or Dark Knight game. The darkness creates a mood that fits the world really well. We are talking about an Earth so ravaged by pollution that the Sun does not shine on the surface anymore. Darkness is just right. The character designs are also good. Pino is very well drawn and is adorable, especially when she wears her rabbit costume. Re-L.... well let's just agree she has her own style. Personally I think it is way too much make up but it does not look out of place. Vincent is also well drawn. His drooping eyebrows, his stoop and his facial expressions all convey the idea that this guy is indecisive and unsure of himself; but also kind. The other characters also look good and the proxies look downright scary, as they should. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the SOUND. This is where the anime shines best. The sound is very well chosen and very well composed. The OP and ED fit the theme very well and are different from the usual J-POP that graces the runtimes of the average anime. Regarding the OP and ED however, I will say that it does not make my favourites list by a long shot. Nagi no Asukara's OP was incredible. Nichijou's first ED (zzzzz , google it) was just perfect. Shinsekai Yori's ED was also great. I remember these because they were simply incredible, fitting the theme perfectly while also being good stand-alone songs. The OP and ED here were good, but not great. But the soundtracks for the journey and the important plot moments was very well chosen. There is always a hum in the background that generates a feeling of uncertainty. I liked that. \\n\\n\r\nNow, we step into the stuff that brought the anime down in my eyes. The CHARACTERS are the first problem. Pino is by far the best character in this show. Seeing her slowly develop emotions, then understand the meaning of death and life for humans and fit it into her own concept is very nicely done. Pino always fits into the situations she is in. You grow to genuinely care for her. Re-L is the next character I like. Strong, haughty and genuinely assuming (like a princess) that people will make way for her, she becomes obsessed with the truth. I can understand this very well. She is quite an important person within her own society, being the granddaughter of the regent. If someone like this were to come across some blaring hypocrisy, some unfair treatment meted out by her own family to others in the world she lives in; well of course you'd want to get to the bottom of it. And she has the guts to do it. She changes, of course, on her journey; learning to become moe independent and more flexible to others. Now, Vincent. I just don't understand the guy. In the end, I guess there was no real need to understand him because he is superceded by the character that was hidden inside him all along. Why does Vincent want to become a true citizen of Romdeau? Why does he want to find the turht about himself anyway ( he doesn't seem to care for at least the first 5 episodes.) Why does he even like Re-L? It's not like he gets to meet her often. Is it the kind of love people have when looking at a poster of a celebrity. I don't think of that as love. His motivations and his choices are those of a generic, approachable good person growing up in Japan's society. Too many things about his character don't add up. He fit into the froup because of course he would. That's the kind of person he is. The proxies are confusing and we don't know their real position in the whole story, even in the end. Daedalus and Raul Creed are interesting. We get to know a bit more of what motivates them to make the choices they do and I understand why they were mentally scarred upon the degradation of scoiety within the dome. However, characters are randomly introduced with no reason other than to forward the plot or develop the characters at every point in the anime, even as late as episode 21! I can't appreciate that. At that point, the characters are not part of the story, they are just externally applied influences to move the story along because the author knew no other way to get it done. Some of these admittedly were well done. The AutoRev the group came across before Iggy disobeyed ReL did advance the story and showed us the kind of people who lived in the sparse lands between domes. The people who lived right outside Ramdel were also interesting. However, the quiz guy and the Smiley Land episodes? I can't understand how they tied into the story other than to intorduce plot elements. I would pass by such characters in my usual evaluation because anime is supposed to be fun and too serious analysis of the show is uncalled for and/or unnecessary; but this show portrays itself as so much more with its freshman psych student blurbs....\\n\\n\r\nAnd that leads us to the STORY. The biggest problem I had with the show. Many episodes feature the audience being dropped right in the middle of the episode and then being taken to the beginning as a flashback and/or character speech and then being seen through to the end. This is okay sometimes. Baccano does a very good job of it. In Ergo Proxy, it's confusing at best and bad writing at worst. Let's be honest, no one would accept this quality of writing from a novel. This show is being paraded as something so smart that the average viewer wouldn't 'get it' on first viewing. I can't accept that as good writing. Seems to me like a naked emperor parading around without clothes while the public claims it's too good to see. I've read Artist of a Floating World by Kazuo Ishiguro and I think its amazing. We are accustomed to think of the narrator as some infallible being who tells the story as it is. Over the course of the book, we instead realize that the narrator is from a time that modern Japan has decided to blur and forget. This is well done. In Ergo Proxy, the confusion of the characters is compounded by the fact that no one seems to understand what is going on. Not the regent, not even to a certain extent the proxies. Perhaps the creator knows what's going on but he's not telling. The quiz in particular was bad. It didn't fit into the story. We are not told how the gang came across the quiz show or how they left and we are not told how or why the show was broadcast around the world. If it was broadcast around the world regularly, why didn't people know of the existence of life outside the dome?\\n\\n\r\nSome stories do pull off this kind of storytelling. What comes to my mind is a book I read called \"They things they carried\". In brilliant fashion the book introduces characters and sometimes repeats stories. Each time a story is repeated, we see somehting slightly different; a slightly different POV and we come to the conclusion that memory is a fragile thing indeed; and that imagionation is as much a part of our memory as reality. Also, we come to the sad understanding that there are some things people will never understand without living through them. Ergo Proxy does not show us a POV muddled by memory, or past experiences or split personalities. The only answer I have is that it si intentionally written poorly to enhance the idea that the characters are as lost as we are. \\n\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is just not a very enjoyable show. I get it, such anime without incessant otaku pandering and fan service is going to require a greater commitment on the part of the viewer. I gave it my attention, I really did. It's like Shinsekai Yori in the beginning, but the characters never really grow and the world does not really expand. Also, consistently starting the show in the middle of the episode and then alluding to the beginning is not fun for the viewer. I get that its experimental but I don't think its right to give a review that level of leniency just because the show is experimental. I always evaluate anime in the context in which it is presented. Is it a shoujo anime? a VN adaptation? is it in the sports genre? and so on. However, the important part of my evaluation always is: is it serious and trying to portray some message about the world? Is it fun and a way to get my mind to relax? Sometimes these might be mixed like in Gurren Lagann. Ergo Proxy comes across as a serious show with a message and I just can't get that message. My favourite episode was the one where they were stuck because there was no wind and we see Re-L trying to analyze Vincent's character. That was truly enjoyable. If they had kept that tone and tried to avoid the aforementioned psyche student garbage, it may have been a fun show. Ergo Proxy tries a lot of things; it just doesn't execute any of them very well.\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT,\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally write reviews for shows that already have so many reviews, but I have to say most of the reviews here with 9's are simply overhyping the show. It's unique and that is its strongest selling point. If asked whether it was worth watching the show, my answer would be yes. But I'd ask people to put aside some serious time to watch it because this is not a show I see people being invested in because of the flow of the story. You will need to force yourself at points to continue watching. Some of the moments are genuinely good. These are sadly few and far in between. Most of the time you will be scratching your head trying to make heads and tails of a story that I think has intentionally been written in a way to obscure understanding on the side of the viewer. This is my understanding of the show and if someone has any comment to make on my review, I'd encourage them to make it on my profile. I may give this anime a second viewing and may change my scores and opinion on it if those who consider it masterpieces of postmodern fiction and consider it a great anime give my their two cents.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is an anime that does a number of things right. First of all, it is an adult anime that treats its\u2019 viewer as adults. There are no boob jokes or typical anime fair, it\u2019s a lot of philosophical and biblical things that make up a good portion of the show. The show does a good job of being intelligent, though sometimes this comes off as totally insane. The ending is a typical anime ending that leaves you scratching your head, but the ending comes too abruptly and right out of left field, leaving you scratching your head even longer than usual. Think BigO quality of \u201cwhat the hell\u201d at the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nI like to say that the story is told in three acts because the acts are all completely different. The first act is the one that many people will think to associate with the whole series, a cyberpunk-y kind of crime show. Then the second act rolls around and we get a lot of exploration and get to know the world even better. The third act is when the show\u2014well, it doesn\u2019t degrade, I like anime that does crazy things at the end and I was sort of expecting it\u2014but it just doesn\u2019t fit in with the rest of the series. I don\u2019t know how to react to the ending because it was just too different from the rest of the show. It just wasn\u2019t set up enough that we would be tromping through biblical/religious/philosophical ground for a whole three nonsensical episodes. The episodes before that are all internal conflicts and a lot of it makes no sense as well, but you think the end will be a very psychologically stressing one for the characters; it turns out to be just psychological stress on the person watching,\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nErgo Proxy has good animation. Its\u2019 landscapes look amazing. The characters are another story though. They look decent from up close but far away they look pretty crappy. Overall though the animation is pretty good. Characters do look a lot more gritty and realistic than other anime, but that\u2019s not enough to save the fact it just looks choppy at some points.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe Japanese voice actors do a good job and the music, well, there\u2019s barely enough to really complain about. It doesn\u2019t exactly need music though because there is enough dialogue to suffice. The opening theme is alright, though I\u2019ve heard better before. The end theme just plain sucks. Otherwise, everything sounds good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n I liked all the characters for whatever reason, but most were shallow. Lil Mayar who should have been the outstanding character of the series is just kind of bitchy and dull, Vincent isn\u2019t all that compelling, and Pino can come off as a decent character at points but at other points just doesn\u2019t come off as any good either. Raul, who actually was shaping up to be an awesome character, just turns out to be bland and Daedalus is probably the worst character of the series, I still have no idea what the hell he had to do with much of anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThis anime is not something that you can go into as a fan of cyberpunk, because it\u2019s not cyberpunk. It\u2019s a weird mix of cyberpunk, steampunk, apocalyptic, and religious that works to a degree, but ends on a weaker note because of its attempt at blowing our minds toward the end with its religious turn. While its last episode is enjoyable for those who do like to mull over the meaning and everything, it may be way too much for the average fan of anime. Hell, the whole series may be a bit too much. It caters to a certain sci-fi niche essentially and for whatever reason, I wish the world that was created (an exceptional world) could have been utilized much better than with this overly-complicated and scatterbrained plot thats only job seems to be to hurt the brain.\\n\\n\r\nNot that I didn\u2019t enjoy it. It was a good anime, an anime for adults and thinking types. While some of its philosophy came off as corny a lot of it was pretty good and there are a lot of things you can decipher from this anime if you really want to think into it. And that\u2019s probably part of the reason I don\u2019t understand bits of the plot, I don\u2019t feel like thinking.\\n\\n\r\nCan I suggest this to everyone? Definitely not. But Ergo Proxy comes off with an 8 for me. Not one of my favorites, but can be an enjoyable ride for those with the right mindset to take it.",

            "content": "This show is rather hard to follow sometimes, showing a lot of thought into it. It\u2019s not great if you want your mind to shut off but if you really want something to think about, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s hard to follow at first but I fell in love with the story line and the meanings behind everything that happen. I was second guessing myself every once in a while to figure out what was real and what was all in the mind. So many things about it get turned around and become a mind-fuck (Pardon the language) that most of the times, the end ofthe episode left me with more questions than answers. I still have many questions about the show that were not answered, or were just half answered.\\n\\n\r\nThey never give you a true answer in the end as well, making up a lot of problems when they leave me scratching my head but I guess this is what happens when you look at the journey of self discovery and it's not you that you\u2019re learning about. My thoughts on that are watch it more than once to get the true meaning of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderfully created and fully detailed in background story but I feel we do not spend enough time on them. Still, the women lead, Re-L is a wonderful choice as although she is a perfect character in Romdeau, she feels out-of-place in the outside world and yet if she is considered Yin, we can fully call Vincent yang. They are opposites that seem to be attracted by one thing and that it to find out the truth, no matter what is in store for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork has rather a dark, gray, sleepy feeling to the look that could make you fall asleep at times. The darkness makes it hard to see and even when I had my brightness set high, it was still hard for me to see. It is like walking through a tunnel where you see only shadows of things. Now that is mostly for the outside world of Romdeau where most of the story actually seems to take place. On the inside, it maybe still gray but the area is much lighter and they even have a substitute sky up however unrealistic that may look.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is hunting and scary if you\u2019re not ready for it but I still loved it none the less. It was mostly instrumental and choir vocals which made some of the scenes a little\u2026 well\u2026 godlike I guess, or made me believe that whoever was around was not a normal human or something that was above human thought.\\n",

            "content": "Initial TLDR - If you like thought-provoking, somewhat serious anime, you'll likely find Ergo Proxy enjoyable. If you don't like doing a lot of analysis when engaging with your chinese cartoons, you'll probably hate it. No ecchi battle scenes or moe schoolgirls here; meet Shingeki no Kyojin's melancholy cousin.\r\nAt first, I thought maybe this anime would be a bit boring and stereotypically dystopian as at the beginning, but the meat of the story picks up within the first handful of episodes. A number of people seem to dislike or drop this anime mid-season as it starts getting super deep and analytical, or even pseudo-philosophical tosome. Personally, this was interesting to me and I really enjoyed thinking about and analyzing the deeper meanings of aspects of the plot: the game show episode in particular is one that may initially feel like a weird-as-hell filler episode but once you dig a bit deeper and begin to really follow along, like the rest of the episodes, only reveals a lot more truths about the world Re-L and Vincent live in.\\n\\n\r\nTruth and revelation are both strong themes focused on throughout the anime and I can understand why for some, it might feel a bit tacky or pretentious \u2013 and I can admit that occasionally it did for me, too. In spite of the at-times confusing and overbearing intellectual aspects, it didn\u2019t necessarily seem insincere or pretentious to me, and I often walked away after an episode binge thinking about the concepts that were brought up. However, due to the heavy-handedness of these concepts, it\u2019s definitely not going to be for everyone. Even for me, some parts were quite complex - there will be folks who find it just too hard to follow and not easy to understand. The way parts of the plot are not immediately clear may be frustrating or confusing. Some people just don\u2019t like to think this much while watching anime and that\u2019s fine. Nevertheless, like most futuristic, dystopian stories, this anime comes with a plot that is intended to be thought-provoking. If it\u2019s your first time watching, this isn\u2019t an anime to put on while half-asleep or in the background while getting work done. You\u2019re going to need your full attention in order to follow along.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the story overall, I felt that the writers did a really good job intertwining character development with progression of the plot. Things moved at a pretty good pace - it was fast when it needed to be, and the slow parts accentuated areas of the story line accordingly (such as when Vincent and company are travelling through the decimated Earth). There are moments of the story where there are these interesting switches between POV and setting and even consciousness. It can be confusing or jarring at first but in relation to what is going in the story, is generally used effectively to get feelings or points across. The animation is fluid and the art style itself is nice. It\u2019s pretty similar to what you\u2019d see in other mid 2000\u2019s anime. Cool character designs and aesthetics. The color palette and various settings do a nice job at building that futuristic, dystopian, post-apocalyptic atmosphere, although sometimes it felt a little muddy and could\u2019ve used some variation. It reminded me a lot of the palette in Witch Hunter Robin. Although I thoroughly enjoyed this series, there\u2019s still some imperfect aspects one could pick apart at. Every now and then there\u2019s inconsistencies in the animation and art. The plot can become too much to handle or confusing at times if you don\u2019t stop to get your bearings straight. Sometimes things feel a bit too slow or even too fast. Acknowledging all that, Ergo Proxy gets a 9 from me. The visuals were wicked cool, the plot was thought-provoking, and I was very much entertained for 23 episodes. A highly enjoyable series if you\u2019re looking for something different, but as you can see from other reviews, this is definitely one of those anime series that people either  \"get\" and enjoy or don\u2019t.\\n",

            "content": "This series has too many flaws bringing it down. The art direction and filler episodes are in particular worth criticizing. \r\nThe art direction is grim-dark, undersaturated, brown and edgy. It's very 2006-looking and that isn't aging well at the moment. Overly dark lighting occludes for the sake of adding mystery where the story has plenty of mystery already, and the colors really limit scenes where there could have been a stronger contrast to the brown wasteland world.\r\nThe filler episodes are harder to talk about without spoilers, but at least 5 episodes would be improved by reading a paragraph of backstory instead. Seriously, just skip 11,14, 15, 16, 19, and 20. 15 will make you hate your eyes and ears while 16 will just make you hate Re-L: the flawed hero who overcomes her pettiness by... being increasingly petty? At least 19 isn't horrible, it just doesn't fit in the series at all.\\n\r\nThe last 3 episodes are actually good and should be watched together. Honorable mention goes to the dub which was just fine. The sound and music was completely unnoticed through the show's whole run, unless you like Radiohead.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is a meticulously orchestrated puzzle and it\u2019s hard to predict what will happen next. The mystery is interesting and the show doesn\u2019t spoon feed you the answers. It\u2019s one of a kind and one of my favorites. The atmosphere is amazing and immersive, from the music to the characters designs to the dark scenery. The dark and barren landscapes convey the pervasive metaphorical and existential darkness. I like its message of facing reality, pursuing the truth, and following your own meaning of existence instead of being someone else\u2019s proxy. \r\nI love all the characters and think they are complex and fascinating, from theprimary ones to even the minor ones. There aren\u2019t really any characters I would consider a villain; everyone has their personal intentions and struggles. \\n\\n\r\nRe-L is one of my favorite female characters- she\u2019s strong, clever, fiercely independent, and she\u2019s not afraid to question what she\u2019s told. Vincent Law is also a memorable character. His character development is executed well. Vincent and Re-L are one of my favorite ships. I usually dislike romance in primarily non-romance shows because they tend to feel superfluous and shoehorned in, but their relationship is done so well. It\u2019s built up gradually and I honestly wanted to see more. I really wish there was a second season. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished the series for the first time, I could not stop thinking about it. I immediately wanted to rewatch it in order to pick up all the foreshadowing and clues I missed. The OP is great and its lyrics tie in with the events of the show, however it\u2019s not apparent until you reach the end of the series. Paranoid Android is the perfect ED for Ergo Proxy. The rest of the songs on the album, \u201cOK Computer\u201d, fit the show as well and I consider it an unofficial soundtrack. The songs are atmospheric and contain some overlapping themes with Ergo Proxy. \\n",

            "content": "Initial Impressions:\r\nErgo Proxy was just a chance encounter for me. I wasn't necessarily looking for it nor did anybody recommend it to me. On top of that, I had never even heard of it. Whevener I sat down to watch it, I was engrossed in the world this series had to show. While, yes, the first episode is intimidating with how insanely fast it goes, I couldn't help but continue watching. I feel like Ergo Proxy is a hidden gem where I don't hear the name get thrown around enough, but I feel like it should be bigger than it actually is. I really enjoyedthe series and would give it a 9/10. It has a few bumps but is otherwise just shy of being a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story is... bizarre. It starts out as a simple detective thriller where Re-L is investigating a series of murders that are linked to something called the Cogito Virus. However, she soon unearths a conspiracy plot, and everything begins to pick up from there. While the first episode goes way to fast, the rest of the series is fairly mellow in terms of story presentation. Everything is not as it seems as some of the episodes deal with various psychological elements that make the viewer feel disoriented, which actually works in the show's favor. While some may criticize these elements for being distracting or taking away from the experience, I feel it actually brings the viewer closer to the characters' struggles as they watch their world essentially crumble around them. The main goal of the anime is to explore what it means to be human and including instances of psychological break downs and paranoia fit into that. Although, some of the ideology that the anime presents can be a bit suffocating at times as it is one of the elements that is never given a resolute answer and is a major backbone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nOne of the most inconsistent elements of the show is its art. Sometimes it looks really good, other times it can look a bit bad. However, the character designs are rather fitting for each character as well as the overall color palette of the show. Romdaeu is majorly painted with lighter colors, white and silver. It gives the city a clean and utopic vibe which contrasts with the worn our grays and browns of the utterly destroyed outside world. Even in other settings, the colors never reach the point of having a high saturation in them, something I feel is actually fitting for how gritty and realistic the show can be.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nNot really much to say about the sound, other than it was pretty great. It was never overdramatic and the pieces fit with whatever setting they were made for. The VA's also did pretty great as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI feel like the characters in this anime cause a lot of strife amongst reviewers, but I overall thought they were great. Everybody, for the most part, stayed consistent and had a set motivation that didn't constantly flipflop like a lot of modern shows. I feel like our main protagonists had good character arcs that showed how far they had come from the beginning of the series. Though there are some characters that are very black and white in terms of loving or hating them, and when that falls on the protagonist things can be a bit rough. Re-L specifically can be seen as a bit of a brat for the majority of the run if you look into her enough, Vincent can be an aggravating coward, and Pino... Pino is a small child. There's not much else to say about that. But, these were flaws I accepted as a part of the characters, and I didn't let them get under my skin all that much. It's just something to be aware of while watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm really glad I picked up this series and gave it a shot. I feel like this is one of my all-time favorite animes now that I watched it. It's one of the series that I frequently reflect on and think about a lot in my spare time, and I feel that's the good mark of a great anime. I absolutely love this series and the trip that it took me on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nA great series that definitely deserves more love than it has been getting. The story is amazing, and the themes it presents are deep yet feel grounded to the human condition. I couldn't recommend this anime enough, though I advise against binging the series all at once since it can quickly become an information overload.  Aside from the story sometimes feeling convoluted or the characters being somewhat aggravating, it is a really good series, and I feel if it ran any longer than it did it would've lost its way. Overall, go watch it. See where you end up once you're through.",

Vincent's attempts to find out what he is juxtaposes beautifully with Re-L's attempts to find out the nature of where she had lived her entire life.\r\nHowever, alarm bells first went off when exposition was provided in the most asinine manner possible. The worst part is that particular episode, believe it or not, was CANNON. It actually becomes important later! Most of the \"filler\" was fine, adding some development of the relationships between the three main characters, but I actuallyskipped one of the episodes after about five minutes of a pure cringefest. These episodes were very polarizing, so take this paragraph with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nDespite two episodes that had some problems, Ergo Proxy is very high-quality, focusing more on the characters and themes than the action. If you like a thought-provoking anime, then I would definitely recommend this.",

Your immersion with the chracters in this anime absolutely depends if you are into the story and lore, perhaps by being on the ground and running. The art is pretty mature, though. I likeit, but it also depends if you are into the story and lore. In terms of sound, only the opening and ending themes are outstanding. The story is okay as a whole. Overall, from Story-6, Art-6, Sound-7, Character-5, Enjoyment-6, I give Ergo Proxy a 6. It may be your cup of tea.",

In this series, most humans have gone up to space while the ones that remained along with humanoid creations and robots are suppose to make it habitable at an even more distant date.\r\nAnyone who watch this for the first time will find it confusing and possibly doesn't make sense. This does not mean that the anime is bad. In fact, some of which is intentionally and suppose to scramble your head till the very end. The focus of the story revolves around Vincenta being that is not human yet the person himself isn't aware of it. He essentially travels around to find out his origin. Through the episodes, he finds out a little more of himself, but the series  deceive both the characters and the audience, in which, we can't tell whether all these things are in his head or actually happen. There is even a what I thought was a \"troll\" episode that actually did happen and explain a lot of the premise of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot say much about it since there were lots of things I did not get when I first watched it. But I could say it was very enjoyable. It has a nice opening theme, most of the characters might seem annoying, perhaps even \"bitchy\", but soon you understand some of their reasoning why they act such way. In fact, some of the characters you won't really know till the end of the series. If you are willing to accept psychological confusion for the moment, feel free to watch it.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is my favorite type of anime: serious, complex, and philosophical.  From the opening scenes, which feel more like the introduction to a movie than a series and immediately suck you in, it is apparent that this is an ambitious undertaking, intended to be a legitimate addition to what might be termed the \"intelligent\" anime genre, alongside the likes of Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Ergo Proxy offers a wonderfully compelling and layered post-apocalyptic story that is well-executed and -paced throughout the first half of the series.  The attentive viewer will be extremely well-rewarded.  While often criticized,the main characters are sufficiently complex and enjoyable.  Re-l is serious and, in her own terms, often a \"total selfish bitch;\" Vincent is meek and relentlessly kind; and Pino is the adorable child AutoReiv who is always being cute, hilarious, or both.  As seen in the aptly-named episode 16, \"Busy Doing Nothing,\" (arguably the best episode in the series) their interactions are often a pleasure to watch.  Production-wise, Ergo Proxy's animation is nice, the character designs (particularly the unforgettable Re-l) are generally original, and the soundtrack and voice actors are great.\\n\\n\r\nBut while such \"intelligent\" anime have the greatest potential to succeed, they are also the easiest to complicate.  Ergo Proxy is very complex, and would undoubtedly suffer from debilitating obscurity were it not for episode 15, a filler that is anything but because it lays out critical facts regarding the apocalpytic event, the proxies, and the main antagonist.  Although this is certainly appreciated, presenting these facts all at once in a random game show episode, instead of interspersed throughout earlier episodes, reflects an uncharacteristic laziness on the part of the series.  Similarly problematic is the final episode, which implicitly admits its shortcomings through its title, \"Deus Ex Machina,\" a literary term referring to an unrealistic or unexpected intervention that saves the protagonist or story through improbable means.  While earlier episodes offer some hint of the events in the final episode, only the extremely attentive viewer will have foreseen its coming, and most will find the surprise to be the product of poor rather than clever writing. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, Ergo Proxy is a wonderful story and anime, if not somewhat poorly and lazily executed.  Once the series moves beyond telling the immediate story of the events in Romdo and Re'l, Vincent, and Pino's journey, and begins to provide a larger historical backdrop and philosophical connotations, it fails to deliver in a clear and coherent fashion and could be a lot tighter.  This by no means justifies passing up what is otherwise an immensely complex and engaging story, as well as an attractive and highly professional production.  If you watch closely - and look for explanations or at the manga when you get lost or confused - Ergo Proxy ranks among the best.",

At some moment's you hate them and other moment's you feel their pain.

            "content": "Review + English Dub Review (Geneon):\r\nGeneral Thoughts:\r\nA dark drama set in a post-apocalyptic/disaster type setting, I was drawn to this series from the interesting concept as well as the distinctive art style.  The gist of the anime follows two principal characters Real Mayar and Vincent Law, two polar opposites in terms of personality, upbringing and social class.  Humans have taken shelter in a domed city called Rohndo and due to numerous hazards in the outside atmosphere, they are prohibited from leaving for their own good.  An \u201cimmigrant\u201d in the process of becoming an official citizen of Rohndo, Vincent Law suddenly becomes agovernment target after a mysterious being referred to as the \u201cProxy\u201d attacks numerous citizens, one of which happen to be Real Mayar.  Real is the daughter of the appointed leader of Rohndo who is advised by these interesting talking statues that hold wisdom and knowledge (imagine Hercules gone PG-13).  Anyway through a confrontation with the Proxy, Real discovers the mysterious being is somehow linked to Vincent Law and will stop at nothing to discover the truth.\\n\\n\r\nI was very interested in the premise of the series as I had been on a mysterious-story spree.  The first six episodes or so kept me very engaged and interested in the story with its beautifully somber dark tones and unique character designs.  The entire sequence involving the Proxy is very slick and Real is a refreshingly cold female lead which is a nice change of pace from the more common upbeat or noisy female protagonist of other series.  However as the initial Proxy sequence shifted to Vincent, I found myself unfortunately losing interest in the series fast.  At times I felt like Ergo Proxy was trying too hard to be melodramatic and dark for its own good as there was a stretch of episodes that consisted entirely of Vincent pondering his existence in a mopey state with no real progression of the plot.  While this sets some important groundwork in place for the latter half of the series, I felt like it was stretched too long and I found myself struggling to keep watching.  The story eventually wrapped up revealing the true intention and background behind the Proxies, Vincent\u2019s past, and a host of other interesting details about Rohndo and the world around them.  Unfortunately the ending sequence was mostly compressed into two and a half episodes full of philosophical points that were difficult to follow and rushed.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the first set of episodes but gradually became less and less invested in the show as it progressed.\\n\\n\r\nDub Presentation:\\n\r\nLicensed by Geneon and currently re-released by FUNimation after Geneon\u2019s departure from the US anime market, I found the dub track to be a respectable and smooth job.  The cast overall was well cast and turned out fine performances.  While no particular performance completely wowed me, I was not disappointed either which resulted in a very consistent and professional dub to watch.  I thought Liam O\u2019Brien did quite a respectable job with Vincent including the drastic change and a shift in vocal tone early in the series as well as other more demanding voices required of him.  Another role I found particularly noteworthy was Rachel Hirschfeld as Pino.  All too common in English Dubs young girl characters are very high-pitch and forced/shrill sounding, but Hirschfeld sounded like a genuine young girl and captured the characters innocence well.  Yuri Lowenthal as Daedelus was also a refreshing pick on a creepy and egotistical character from his usual male protagonist type-cast and Patrick Seitz made no missteps from what I heard as Raul.  My only qual with the dub is the quality drops off a bit in smaller extra roles.  In particular there is one boy in the 7-10 episode span who\u2019s acting is incredibly flat and awkward-sounding.  However all principal characters I felt were quite strong indeed.\\n\\n\r\nRecap:\\n\r\nWhile I found the beginning of the series to be very strong, it took a very different direction that I wasn\u2019t too fond of.  I also think the opening episodes paint out such a vivid world with a very complex plot that the ending doesn\u2019t completely resolve.  However Geneon\u2019s dub was quite solid and despite some of the flaws in the source material, I thought ADR Director Jonathan Klein did a respectable job here.",

            "content": "There is a significant amount to talk about Ergo proxy and it is quite difficult for me generalize it appropriately. Perhaps the best way to frame it is as a story of lies,truth and happiness that is delved into in a very philosophical sense. It is a story that presents us with an interesting perspective as what defines happiness. To the myopic few, their happiness may be limited to that of which is their own and thus they define it objectively as so. But Ergo proxy presents us with vastly different characters seeking out different forms of happiness and thus in turn showcases the arbitrarinessof happiness. It delves into topics that of which defines an individual's reality and as a result sets the basis for an interesting perspective of truth defined within a subjective sense. \\n\\n\r\nAn instances of this is shown through the quote:\\n\r\n\"A lie is truth, until you recognize it as a lie. To see the truth behind those lies is probably the right thing to do. However, it may not necessarily bring happiness. Lies are Happiness.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is another form of \"Ignorance is bliss\" that also differentiates objective truth from subjective truth. Though, I felt at odds with the claim that \"Lies are Happiness\" just as I did for the statement \"Ignorance is bliss\" when I first encountered them. That is because I believed that neither lies are necessary for happiness nor is ignorance necessary for bliss. Lies can lead to one's happiness just as equally as truth can and this will vary depending on the context. Of course, Ergo proxy's story exemplifies the significance of this quote.\\n\\n\r\nThe manner in which Ergo proxy convey meaning to us is often through reference that range from subtle to blatant, much of which reside in the subtle end as opposed to the blatant end. As a result, I often find myself left to my own devices to decipher implicit meaning through the context. Even the manner in which characters interact with one another within Ergo proxy is usually through references that is sometimes clarified with analogies. This aspect of Ergo proxy, I am quite fond of because it allows the viewer to discern it's meaning, but for some reason there also exist points in Ergo proxy where it provides us meaning through exposition. The exposition seemed very inconsistent with implicit way that the anime conveyed meaning. I am not fond of exposition in any manner of which it is used because it strikes me as contradictory to the nature of story telling. The beauty of story telling lies in it's ability to convey meaning that otherwise cannot be conveyed through only words. After all, words serve only to represent only our perceived meaning of the word and that is potentially in contrast to that of others. Some may of viewed the exposition aspect of Ergo proxy as pretentious and I would of had shared this sentiment had it not been the fact that the exposition does complement the story very well. Though even if I assume the pretentious intent of anime's creator, I do not find that as valid reason to denounce his/her work, because the intent of the work is independent of the work itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe structure of Ergo proxy is a bit odd. Initially it's setting is focused on Romdeau and it's peripherals, but then it later transitions to a very episodic structure where we encounter many different settings. This is by no means necessarily a bad thing but it is quite out of the norm. It seemed to hint at an inconsistency of story telling, but I did not notice any such inconsistencies and thus I disregarded that possibility.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters within ergo proxy not only have their own interesting story, but also exemplifies the world that surrounds them. I found that many of characters were developed on par to that of the protagonist and though this may be perhaps a be a bit unusual, I found keeping track of each of their stories to be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nVincent is the protagonist within Ergo proxy. He is the ignorant part of a whole whose traits contrasts with that of Re-I Mayer. While he finds contentment in his own ignorance, Re-I seeks the truth simply for the sake of it, even though she is aware that it may not lead to her happiness. It should be noted that Romdeau is a controlled environment and thus individual's actions are dictated by the reagents. So such anomaly such as Re-I Mayer coming about seems very unusual. It is given that there was a lesser degree of control of her to provide her with a more stimulating environment. This striked me as interesting as it seems that the people of Romdeau were what Aldous Huxley will call \"Slaves by consent\". They believe they have free will, but it is simply an illusion. Raul Creed is another significant anomaly within Romdeau. His recognition of the system that demeans him leads him to lament it and seek its demise. Daedulus exemplifies the Utopian qualities of Romdeau. He cannot help but seek what he desires even if it leads him to denial.\\n\\n\r\nThere seemed to be many philosophies employed within Ergo proxy, but I do not know many philosphers. I believe the only one I recognized was Rene Descartes \"I think, therefore I am\". This quote is basically a response the doubt of one's existence postulates the existence of one's reality. Ergo proxy frames as \"I think, therefore you are\" which does differ from Rene Descartes's quote but both simply imply the existence of one's reality.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is not pretentious. However, it is messed up and does a poor job of keeping consistency by appealing to an exaggerated interpretation of post-modernism in literature theory. To me it's the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat of anime, as I'll later explain.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot starts develops slowly in the first three episodes, giving a general feel of the society's structure and the city's (Romdeau) organization, which reflect quite well with each other. By the end of the third episode, however, the main question of the whole first arch is answered, thus turning the next 9 episodes in an almost filler story that does nothing but repeat thewhole point made clear on the first three about the society's organization. Thereafter, it takes a fast pace and starts the main character's quest to grasp the idea of personality. This culminates in three genuinely brilliant episodes. In episode 15 the characters are trapped inside a high-stakes gameshow out of nowhere in a brilliant recap/exposition scene, in episode 16 they find themselves unable to keep the journey going and simply get bored, this is the only episode where the characters are likable and reminded me of some of the best moments in Cowboy Bebop; episode 20 delves into a deep reflection on the self as seen by others using a very creative narrative method as the events narrated by one of the characters through the eyes of the other. After that the narrative gets dead boring and by the end of the anime it's all such a mix of references and theories that almost anything could be taken from it. This mix is the weakest link in the story. References range from Pinocchio to Icarus and Nietzsche and although they're more or less tied to the overall theme of personality, at times they are many logic steps away from each other and seem just thrown in. The \"death of the author\" is evoked sometimes, but it seems like an excuse to atone for the lack of thought put into the binding of the narrative. That's why the show is a Schr\u00f6dinger cat. It mocks post-modern literature theory, but in the end proves it right. The anime is not pretentious because it makes sense, but in making sense it defeats what is seemingly its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhen the art is good, it is really good, but that's not the case all the time. Character design is mind-blowing, from Raul, which is evidently a person of power from the first look, to Re-l and her distinguishable eye shade and dark looks. Vincent is a special case, the way his hair and eyes change in every critical moment from clean-cut to spiky (representing rebellion and free-will) and from closed to open (representing his awakening or shying away from harsh truths) is incredible, so much that I'd put him on par with Lain. Background art is inconsistent. The cities are well distinguishable from one another and each of the designs are well relatable to the cities' purpose, way of living and importance in the overall plot. On the other hand, the buildings are boring and generic, so much as the scorched-earth landscapes. Animation is good at times, but some facial expressions got me really confused in the first episodes, Pino makes up for it, though. Battle scenes are subpar, but that's not the anime's purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening title is great and matches the tone of the show. As for the ending, well... it's Radiohead's Paranoid Android so yeah, freaking awesome. For music that's all that's good, the rest of the OST makes me wanna sleep, it's so boring I can't believe it came from the same studio as Samurai Champloo. Sound effects are really well coordinated and produced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf they all died I wouldn't care. Objectively they are well developed, as each confronts their own personalities with the idea of free-will, but none of them can link emotionally to the viewer. Except for Pino, and that's only because she's cute af. As stated, the exception is episode 16.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall:\\n\r\nThe show can develop complex themes, which is difficult by itself, but ironically that's why it defeats one of its purposes. The plot doesn't tie itself well, but each individual part is nicely explored. Some episodes achieve brilliancy and are 10/10 individually, but others are either boring, useless or too messed up with mixed references and theories. Character design is incredible. The rest is just... meh. That's why I kinda liked it, overall it was as good as it was bad, but the exceptions make me want to give that extra point.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy begins as a strange, mysterious story with a very unique feeling to it and a wonderfully bleak, dark setting. It doesn't treat the viewer as as an idiot and doesn't explain every element of its very convoluted, yet appealing story. There is real character progression, plot twists and big reveals in its 23 episodes. The art style is good. The sound is superb and greatly adds to the already thick atmosphere of the post-apocalyptic world of the show and the OP and EP masterfully enchant the feelings that the series has already invoked within the viewer from its very beginning. It gave mea special vibe of melancholy and sadness. \\n\r\nThat being said, I can't really say that Ergo Proxy is a masterpiece. It's an anime with a great beginning and a rushed end with a slow middle part, almost pathethic at places. The majority of episodes from 11 to 20 are a slow ride that doesn't really progress the story and just gives vague hints about elements of the plot. I tried to like them but I simply couldn't - they don't give enough of anything (plot progress, good visuals or character progression). I wouldn't go as far as say they're filler (except episode 19 which I couldn't even get through and is probably the most pathethic and boring filler that I have ever watched in anime, although it is part of the story) because they give additional details about the setting and its story. \\n\r\nI feel like the ending was rushed. For me it seems like they lost the important thread of the story along the boring stuff and when they finally catched it they had little time left to finish the series. The 3 final episodes are filled with action building up to an intense and interesting ending but I feel it could be more fleshed out and well executed if they used one or two extra episodes to do it. \\n\r\nOverall Ergo Proxy was an enjoyable ride, even if clunky at times.",

            "content": "Ergo proxy is definitely a step in the right direction for anime. This show has real characters, not arch types or tired tropes.\r\nYou can't just look at the female lead and go \"oh, she is the tsundere of the show\", they are all original characters, and that already sets this show miles ahead of most other anime\r\nThis is especially reflected by the character Pino. Normally a child is the worst offenders of generic no personality, but Pino is portrayed so well, it is impossible to watch ergo proxy without feeling for her.\r\nThe setting is awesome. Dystopian low-science fiction. Setting wise, what anime can do betterthan \"real life\" tv shows is going large. You can create shots that would be impossible to create, just by drawing it. This is where I feel the show comes in a bit short. There are so many large beautiful back pieces. The art is amazing. But it is rarely utilized. A large part of the story will take place in a desert wasteland or a dark corridor.\\n\r\nMuch of the \"action\" will take place through conversation or a monologue in a characters head, so many of the fantastical elements of anime are wasted on this show. Sure they do so in an incredible beautiful world, but they rarely interact with it. This show could easily be recreated with human actors, and would probably even be accepted in western culture.\\n\\n\r\nI am not really going to blame it for not living up to the potential anime as a medium has to offer, since it is very clear ergo proxy tries to go in a different direction, focusing on psychological and existential elements.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show falls short in my opinion. I watched it with English dubs, so it is very possible that a lot of the content is lost in translation. Like a lot of other shows I have watched with a lot of talking (ghost in the shell, katanagatari) the characters will make weird leaps of logic, which I am sure makes sense in the original text, but in English you will kind of have to \"translate\" the translation. Through a lot of the existentialist stuff  you will have to think \"what is the sum of what this person is trying to communicate\" instead of taking it in word for word.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the actual psychological and philosophical content, it is actually a bit uninspired. What you will learn is somewhat limited. You get to deal with alot of characters whose existence is sort of in debate, but it has been seen before. There is a great analogy where humans are \"created\" just like the adroids whom are declared broken or virus ridden if they develop personalities. The main characters are \"broken\" as well, even though mostly human. It touches a lot of great stuff, but there is really nothing new, at least for an atheist / agnostic western audience. Whether or not the show has a message that is relevant for Japanese society is beyond me\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a 7 for me. Almost everything is perfect, the characters, their interactions, the setting, the art.\\n\r\nThe story content itself drags it down from a 10 though. Very little actually happens in the show. Lots of action in the beginning and the end, but most of the show is very slow. The end develops too fast, and I am certain most people will have to look up what they actually saw.\\n\r\nThere is a lot of unused potential from the setting, which could have lead to great stories, I feel the story with the androids gets way too little attention, some episodes about this (maybe with some action even) could have helped make the show more tolerable for the people who don't think a great monologue while watching a ship sail through a desert for 5 episodes is enough.\\n\\n\\n",

This question, seemingly easy to answer, can be broken into different parts- Is it strictly another being with our genetic code?  or are there more?  How should we treat non-human rational beings?  What makes a living thing not human?  These questions form the base of what Ergo Proxy is about- the quest to find humanity within yourself.\r\nStory- 9\r\n  You can read the synopsis, so don't expect a summary here.  The story of Ergo Proxy is a hard one to tell.   There isa great deal of, well, nothing that goes on.  Of course, that doesn't mean it's boring.  The middle 3rd of Ergo Proxy is just are characters sailing around.  It introduces concepts and builds on the world, but isn't as enthralling as the first 8 or last 5 episodes. Stick through the middle, you won't regret it.  \\n\\n\r\nArt- 7\\n\r\nThe art of Ergo Proxy is bleak.  Of course, that is the look I can only assume the animators were going for,  but even so,  it feels barren.  This is the weakest part of the whole anime, and prepare for a lot of greyscale.  That being said, the animation itself is fairly strong and it does make the world feel like it actually went through an apocalyptic event.  \\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nOK, the OP is amazing.  Simply amazing.  Would rate 10 even if OST sucked ass, which it doesn't.  The OST has some really moving lines and is used well in the episodes, and is the strongest part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8\\n\r\nRe-l Mayar is a badass.  Let's just get that out of the way.  Vincent, does become entertaining, but he needs some time to grow first.  Let's just say he won't be a bitch for the whole series.  Pino is adorable.  Other than that, very few characters play a role.  8/10 for Pino.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\nWas very entertaining the first and last parts, and I was emotionally invested in the characters by the end.  The setting feels very realistic.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\r\nErgo Proxy is a good show that had the potential to be great.  It will always be remembered as a high point for Manglobe, and it would take a strong hate of post-apocalyptic anime to dislike this show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, honest review. \r\nYou might have already noticed that I gave this show a pretty low score compared to the other reviewers and here is why. \r\nThe plot of this very rare anime was interesting and moving and it can definitely not be explained. This is a show you have to dare yourself to watch because no review or wikipedia page will explain it well enough. \r\nIt has a very dark over all atmosphere and it will certainly leave you with an unusual feeling. A mixture between sadness and exhaustion, is how I would describe it. \r\nThrough out these 23 episodes of beautiful art workand moving soundtracks you will encounter more confusion than you might have, watching any other anime. (Yes, that includes Steins;Gate. It is nothing compared to this show) \\n\r\nThe mood will keep you in a fairly gloomy and depressing state so do not expect an emotional roller coaster. What you can expect though, is the feeling of nothing making sense. I felt this during the first few episodes but as it went along I started to piece things together. However, from time to time more brain damaging episodes would come along and completely throw me off. It made me question reality and existence. Don't get me wrong though, I liked this part of the anime. What I didn't like though was:\\n\\n\r\nThe character development. \\n\r\nYes, the characters do develop but I wasn't satisfied with how it happened. \\n\r\nI can honestly say that I was not touched by their individual development at all. It was too subtle or too confusing or some times even too rushed. Especially for the supposedly main character who only needed one episode to change compared to the actual main character who needed 23 episodes to develop. Still I don't feel like he changed much at all.  There were also times where characters would act unreasonably or illogical in situations which threw me off completely. \\n\\n\r\nI would have been less bothered if that was the only thing throwing me off. I liked the dialogues in this series, I think they were deep and meaningful but a lot of times it got too much. I felt like they repeated the same thing over and over but in the end, hearing them or not hearing them made no difference for me what so ever. This caused each episode to feel dragged out and eventually it was hard to keep up and keep watching. \\n\\n\r\nBecause this turned out to be such a complex show, my expectations for the ending were rising with every episode but as I reached the climax point, I was extremely disappointed. Plot twists make a great ending but this one did not live up to my expectations. I was hoping for something that would connect all the dots and would make all the clues and all the repeated dialogues add up in to one final mind blowing revolution. Sadly, that is not what happened. \\n\r\nThe ending resulted in having no affect on me at all and even though I appreciate the journey I took with the characters, I felt like it was taken in vain and that nothing was gained.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard to recommend this anime since it is not for everyone. It takes an open mind to enjoy a show like this and even if you are open minded you still might not truly fall in love with it. I would recommend watching all the episodes even the filler looking ones, because they will be referred to later. \\n\\n\r\nI will end this review by saying: Watch it if you dare, but remember these words; \\n\\n\r\n\"I think, there fore I am\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n",

            "content": "ERGO PROXY (I'm using the Anime Amino format as it's easy t use) \r\nFavourite Quote-What a boring Utopia-Re-L\r\nWhat I like-unique setting and complex plot \r\nWhat I dislike- can be quite slow and hard to follow at times \r\nOther info-recommended-Gilgamesh for art, Serial Experiments Lain for mind fuckery.\r\nErgo Proxy is a 23 episode anime from 2006, produced by Manglobe. It has a dub and sub. It's comprised of normal animation, along with 3d animation on occasion.\r\nThe story is based in Romdeau in the distant future. This is a seemingly immaculate utopia, but is domed and isolated from the outside world due to some sort of massextinction a thousand years prior. In this city, AutoRieves have been made to assist humans with daily tasks, but just before the beginning of the anime, some of these androids became self aware and began murdering others and humans. Re-L mayer is assigned, along with her AutoRieve(Iggy) to investigate this by her grandfather-the all powerful leader of Romdeau. However during her explorations, she is attacked by two inhuman creatures-Proxies. While all this is going on, an immigrant named Vincent is being hunted down as he attempts to return to Mosk,his home city. He then just so happens to run into Re-L.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION; The art style of this is similar to anime like Death Parade and Gilgamesh. Unlike Death Parade though it doesn't have a wide range of dark colours, it's just dark. It's designed to make the world seem dull and drab even though it's referred to as perfect and.it does this very well. The majority of shades you'll find are grey, black and more grey. However, Re-L's eyes are intentionally outlined with purple eye Liner in order to show she is unique and does not follow the government system.\\n\r\nThe animation follows a similar style in that it tends to drag along and is rarely flashy(except during fights). Everything done by the art and animation is to show is things are not always as perfect as they seem, and a world of order is not necessarily a good one.\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDS/VOICES; The soundtrack of Ergo Proxy is equally as dismal. They're there to add to the generally dreary atmosphere(once more with the exception of fight scenes). Even the opening- Kiri by Moneral-has a hopeless tone to it with lyrics like 'Come and save me'. Literally almost everything emphasises just how terrible this world is. The voices are exceptional in the sub and dub. I watched a mix of both because I heard Crispin Freeman did Vincent's voice at episode 11 and had to switch over. The voices once again follow suite. Everyone sounds very pessimistic and unhappy....with 1 exception-Pino. I believe this has to do with the idea that even afyer an apocalypse, there's still hope in the form of a child's innocence. Nonetheless I very much like the voices in that Re-L sounded powerful, iggy sounded obsessive and Vincent's constantly seemed surprised(dubbed and subbed).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS; Overall, the characters of Ergo Proxy are good, not amazing. Re-L never seems to develop past being slightly more tolerant people. She sees a little more hope for humanity towards the end too, but otherwise, nothing. It was refreshing having a realistic, strong, female protagonist to a non-fan service show though(basically it doesn't use her body to attract watchers). Vincent too seems to never fully comprehend his situation until very near the end. Although he does have a little more development, it's like a child adapting to the world-he just goes along with things. The AutoRieves are the most fascinating by far. These supposedly soulless machines show more humanity than the characters that are human. It symbolises that humans thought that logic is perfect is wrong. Emotions are natural and even in an item designed to work for precision, they are needed. It also creates the question of whether humans should play God(as does the whole show-but no more or else spoilers). Pino(am AutoRieve designed to be a daughter) is the manifestation of the above statement in a good way, others take on the darker human form.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION; This is rare in that it's the story that brought me in as well as the setting. The characters are good, but are more of a method of portraying what the story is saying to us. The philosophy in this and constant mystery may put some people off but it's really worth it in the end, if you can overcome the slow pacing too. If you're easily invested in anime, this is for you.",

            "content": "Ergo Proxy is one of those amazing animes that has been unfairly categorized as \u201ctoo complicated\u201d or \u201ctoo confusing to enjoy\u201d. I must say that although the plot itself is not particularly obvious, it is very worth watching and trying to understand the excellent underlying plot behind the so-called (unfairly) nerve-wracking story. \r\nStory: \r\nThe main reason why the anime is categorized as confusing is the fact that the most of the essential plot facts do not take place in the \u201cpresent time\u201d the anime is set in. Thus, it is crucial to acknowledge every piece of information the anime gives to the viewer (some episodeslook like fillers when they are really crucial to the plot). To avoid this, please do NOT skip any episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the post apocalyptic setting is common in a lot of animes, it is worth noticing that EP deals with the same one on psychological and philosophical level, rather than displaying solely the technological, futuristic and fantastical components that would be expected from a classical sci-fi anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nEP gives a strong insight into the themes of existentialism, the limits of omnipotence (ironically) and analogies of the eternal human dualism (between live and death, wrong and right). The series is set on a world where three possible intelligent forms of life may arise; The humans, the autoraves and the proxies. Although their existence is entirely different in essence, the characters show depth in the development of their personality and the vast differences and difficulties in dealing with their existential matters. This open mindness that results from dealing with the difficulties of other forms of live other than humans is one of the distinguishing features of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe deep way of dealing with these themes, while keeping emotions felt by the characters very faithful to reality, is what makes this series so memorable. The characters expose their mournful emotions without giving the series an overly dramatic, depressing atmosphere. The mood achieves moments of desperation without leaving a melancholic after-taste. It is this equilibrium between action, emotion and mystery what makes the characters especially interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough a common plot unites the characters, they each deal with their own problematic personally, only involving the other characters in the essential, depicting a more realistic and desperate struggle than the majority of psychological animes (where the characters tends to share their struggle between them.\\n\\n\r\nEach main character has a specific role in completing the metaphorical nature of the series: \\n\r\nVincent depicts the deep sorrow of exile and amnesia, while Pino personifies a chilling innocence that contrasts the strong and tough reality of the Ergo Proxy world. \\n\r\nRe-L (or Lil) has a tough personality that allows her to give a voice to typical human complaints and attitudes. She gives voice to what we all think yet no one says, which makes her very relatable and the true representative of humanity in the EP world. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art remains dark, with shades of brown, blue and black with some occasional yet outstanding red and blue contrasts. Overall, very beautifully drawn, sharp and well distinguished faces with complex facial features. \\n",

            "content": "\"raison d'\u00eatre\" (\"reason for existence\") The defining words that the story wants to go through your head as you get closer to the end. A heady, gloomy anime which has its place when you're feeling a bit down or existentialistic.\r\nThe beginning of the story has enough mystery to pull you in. You want answers just as much as Re-l Mayer. What is a proxy and why do they exist(Reason for existence)? Story gets slow in the middle, personally I found it boring at times, but what kept me going were the characters. Re-l Mayer, Vincent Law, Pino. Towards the later episodes 17 onward arewhere you want to be. Some episodes were entertaining more than progressing the story, e.g (EP.15)Who wants to be in Jeopardy (Nightmare Quiz Show), (EP.19)Eternal Smile (The Girl With a Smile). I believe the idea they tried to present at the end of the show is a good one, and one that you can think about again and again and come to different conclusions or even conclusions branching off their main idea and on to new ideas completely different.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound were done well, it didn't turn me off from enjoying the show so I would say it did the job. Nothing stood out. The setting they presented was interesting enough that draws you in, again has enough mystery that your curiosity has to know more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a good show. The beginning and end is where I feel it is strongest. The complexity of the questions I asked myself when I finished the anime is what tells me it was a worthy anime.",
