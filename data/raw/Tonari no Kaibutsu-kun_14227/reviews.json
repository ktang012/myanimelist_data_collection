            "content": "An extremely disappointing series that had a lot of potential with vibrant characters that goes absolutely no where\r\nAt first glance, TNKK seems like a cute and different kind of story. The female lead, Shizuku Mizutani, is top of her class but not without a price. She's cold and emotionless, only caring about studying and becoming successful, very much the anti-shoujo stereotype of being obsessed with love. She meets Haru, an intimidating boy with natural smarts that outmatch hers, a vivid outlook on life and an extremely wild, aggressive streak. The two are natural opposites - id and ego - who are destined to fall inlove and grow together, to better themselves, right?\\n\\n\r\nNah.\\n\\n\r\nTNKK falls short of being a slice-of-life type of romcom, with half-hearted life lessons and story arcs that don't lead to actual character growth. Beyond the first episode or two, the story isn't exactly \"touching\" either. There is this back-and-forth love story for the majority of the 13-episode anime which was extremely tiresome all too soon. Characters are introduced, such as 3rd party love interests or the main characters' relatives, that are irrelevant to the plot, get no character depth, or are rarely seen or heard from even though they are engaging and exciting. No plot lines get resolved and there is next to no character development. If anything, Haru and Shizuku regress into their 1-dimensional roles and become side-characters to others, such as Yamaken or Natsume (who, unfortunately, do not get their stories resolved either). It ends up being a chore to care about the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I just wouldn't recommend this series unless you REALLY have nothing better to watch. It has a few cute or sweet moments, but don't expect another Toradora or Chuunibyou. Having not read the manga, I can't be sure as to how well it goes along, but as a stand-alone anime, 13 episodes have left me wondering why I even bothered watching this show. And the fact that it can't hold its own, to me, is a mark of a bad show.",

            "content": "Too many times have I seen the redundant case in anime where a show will conclude at what feels like the midpoint of the series. Although providing quality artwork, animation, and satiating my thirst for lighthearted romantic-comedy, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (My Little Monster) falls victim under this unfortunate plague. \r\nThe plot of My Little Monster resides mainly in the perspective of the two main characters, Shizuku and Haru; both are social outcasts and have no friends at the beginning of the series due to their own respective personalities not meeting the standards of the social norm. They are both very weird characters, but maybe that'swhy they were so entertaining to watch. I enjoyed the first half of My Little Monster a little more than the second because the characters were so forward with their emotions in the beginning and they really did voice what was on their mind unlike many other extremely passive rom-coms. The second half seemed to be a bit lacking for me in terms of development overall. \\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the two main characters would be best described with a quote many of us have probably heard before in our lifetime, \"Opposites attract.\" Shizuku is a study enthusiast whose main goal is to get good grades, while Haru is a semi-delinquent that does whatever he thinks is entertaining and often is seen getting into fights. Both become each other's first real friend. As they get to know each other Shizuku and Haru slowly begin to understand themselves as individuals and what they want from themselves and each other. They are able to make friends and assemble their own group of oddballs to form their own little niche. \\n\\n\r\nThe core of the group consists of Shizuku, Haru, Natsume, and Sasahara and I liked all of them collectively. Since we know Shizuku and Haru are the romantic duo, where does that leave Natsume and Sasahara? Natsume is typically seen 'third-wheeling' with Shizuku and Haru and often tags along with them to go places because she doesn't have friends either; she isn't very smart, is athletic, and is quite attractive to many guys in the show, leading her to be shunned by almost every other girl as a result. Sasahara is a baseball player that pops in every now and again, and though he's part of the core group he isn't there as much as Natsume is due to being in baseball and having other friends. He seems to be the most normal of the group. I loved this group of weirdos because they each brought something interesting to the table and truly delivered on the comedy portion of the rom-com. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many times in My Little Monster that you will sadly forget the show is in fact a 'romantic' comedy since the romantic bits of the show are extremely lacking. In fact, I would go so far as to deem it underwhelming. It was such a nice change up for the main characters to admit they were in love with each other within the first three episodes that I developed higher expectations thinking the series would be one of the best rom-coms around. Unfortunately, the romantic progress seemed to work backwards and the main characters went from knowing they were in love to becoming extremely passive, both unsure what they wanted from the relationship. Though this saddened me greatly, it does not ruin the show in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork/animation and sound were spot on. I enjoyed everything the show had to offer for this portion. The artwork was unique and refreshing, there was clean animation, and the OP/ED were actually pretty good. There was the tingle of piano at dramatic moments, and upbeat silly music when things were getting fun, I couldn't ask for more. I also enjoyed the dialogue of My Little Monster very much. The subtle comments and word choices used really made for some quality comedic entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, the ending. As I mentioned in my introduction, the show seems to end at what seems to the the mid point in the series; it feels like it got halfway through a 24 episode run and got scrapped. A second season would do this series so much justice, but alas it may never come. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you plan to watch My Little Monster, don't have any expectations of a grand love story because there isn't one. As a romantic-comedy there should be a balance between romance and comedy, but this one leans more on the comedic side than the romantic one. It is a very feel good anime, and if you can ignore the lack of romantic development the show excels in giving you laughs and will leave you feeling genuinely happy.",

            "content": "So while scrolling through Netflix during the ungodly hours of the early morning, I came across Tonari no Kaibutsu-Kun. The premise seemed interesting; a studious, no nonsense, anti-social girl named Shizuku finds a friend in a hostile boy Haru. \r\nWhile not an entirely unique story nor complex, I still found it entertaining.\r\nThe story is quite simplistic, but I didn't really mind that much. (I just finished Noragami yesterday and that one was very complex.) \r\nI will say that I almost clicked out on the first episode due to pacing issues. However, I'm glad I didn't, because it turned out to be quite enjoyable. The saidpacing issues were non-existent due to a scene that happens at the end of the first episode that surprised and intrigued me, but I won't spoil it here. \\n\\n\r\nIt was listed under the comedy section, so I figured I'd give it a shot, to break it up from all the serious anime I've been watching lately.Needless to say, the comedy did not disappoint. On multiple occasions I found myself laughing out loud, I even almost squirted milk up my nose.\\n\\n\r\nThe art while nice and clean, is nothing special, however there are aspects and moments that are really beautiful. The animation during any of the sunset scenes are absolutely stunning. In the second episode I believe it's raining and the shot holds on the rain and the puddle. It looked incredibly realistic. Though not as stunning as others, I also love the eye designs, especially Shizuku and Haru's.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is pretty average for the Shouju genre (or at least the ones I've seen), and I admittedly don't think that much for the ending song either. I will say I adore the soundtrack though, it's really mellow, and I could probably listen to it whilst going to sleep.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, I found were all very unique and distinct from one another, yet still maintain their personality as they developed. That being said, I feel as if it could have used a few more episodes to further develop the characters, as it ended fairly ambiguously in regards to said characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started this early this morning, (like at one or two am) I didn't want to stop. But after watching four episodes I figured I should go to sleep. The first thing I did when I woke up this morning, you ask? I watched more. I definitely had me hooked, and I really wanted to know what was going to happen. I was a touch disappointed at the ending however the journey paid off, more so than the destination.\\n\\n",

She is a bright, young, brown headed teenager who only knows the world of textbooks. \r\nEveryone's favourite character in the show, Haru, is a dark-headed male teenager who lacks social skills who at first look appears to be just another delinquent.Being the delinquent that Haru is, he regularly skips classes making histeacher send homework to his place of residence. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show starts off when Shizuka delivers Haru's homework to him. They have a \"weird\" first meeting and she slowly develops an interest in Haru overtime. As time passes the viewer learns that Haru is actually a genius, good-looking, well mannered teenager that is 2nd to best Usui, Takami from Kaichou-Wa Maid Sama. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like comedy romanced animes, I suggest this to everyone. Think Kaichou-Wa Maid Sama + Toradora with great visuals and an amazing soundtrack. I have high expectations for this anime. Cheers!",

            "content": "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is a romance anime that tries and ever so slightly succeeds at setting itself apart from the standard mass of harem anime that's out there, but inevitably stumbles and falls on its own flaws.\r\nIts first and most obvious flaw is that it progresses too fast. It is determined to set itself apart by portraying an attraction (of sorts) that's there and out in the open nearly from the get-go, but fails to recognize that this makes little actual sense when the characters hardly know each other. What is an attempt to portray, perhaps, a sense of naivet\u00e9 or cute clumsiness from themale lead - both at this junction and elsewhere in the series - comes across as silly rather than profound. The way the female lead falls for the male lead and the attraction she experiences feels rather out of tune with the character established in the beginning, creating dissonance rather than actual development. The subsequent challenges they face versus each other and those next to them tend to feel forced and this is both a result of the unsteady premise and the fact that, well, it doesn't set itself that much apart in the end. The end is a little better, especially if you overlook the last twelve-and-a-half episodes, but just... no.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters it portrays tend to be more of the same; unlikely and odd combinations that do not create interesting contrasts; rather, they left me dumbfounded at times with inane character interaction and stupid attempts at jokes. It felt... dumb. Simple and unclever. Few of the jokes really worked and their internal issues were driven by and challenged with equally plain methods. The ending was insufficient on many, many levels, failing to close some important knots and like so many other romance series, leaving the relationship itself a little too open.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise it does not offer a lot. Character designs are probably its strongest suit and they appear rather average, with often-out of place body structure and simple shading (yet at other times especially shading and vividness is done quite well). The backgrounds don't mix well with the character designs and are often very simple, as are the camera angles and shots used. The soundtrack offers some nice string and piano tracks, but for the most part it is your run-of-the-mill romcom soundtrack with a mix of comedy and romance themes. The opening theme is a very average school/romance theme with the usual colourful backgrounds and animations we've seen a thousand times before. The ending theme is more flowery but equally bland in terms of originality. \\n\\n\r\nLet this be said though. It avoids several common pit traps and clich\u00e9s of romance anime, lacking both a distinct harem and many of the common episode settings that are so common. All in all however, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is an anime that tries to set itself apart, succeeds a little but eventually stumbles and falls face-first into the mud, void of any real sense of clever and intriguing writing. I did not like it at all and struggled watching through it. Maybe you have more luck with it, but I would not personally recommend it.",

            "content": "Ok, so I wanted to wait for the anime to finish before writing a review because I wanted to have all my facts straight. Let me be a bit frank here:\r\nI am going to make a lot of people mad with this review \r\nPlease keep in mind that I rate a lot of anime highly on the premise of entertainment. If I enjoy something and finish it then I rate it highly. However, enjoying something and thinking that a series was well done can be two completely different things. \r\nBut, as someone who is a huge fan of romantic comedies, who hasn\u2019t read the mangaand has re-watched certain scenes, I feel the need to mention a few things regarding this anime: Both what\u2019s great about it and what\u2019s wrong with it. \\n\\n\r\nTonari no Kaibutsu-kun (or The Monster seated Next to Me) tells the story of Shizuku Mizutani, a very serious student who only cares about her grades. One day, Shizuku is tasked with delivering class printouts to the home of a boy named Haru Yoshida, a delinquent who rarely attends school. Upon meeting Shizu, Haru immediately considers her his friend and a new relationship sparks between the two as they begin to experience things that neither of them have felt before such as friendship and love. \\n\\n\r\nThe series itself is very episodic and appears to be well paced. Every episode contains at least one moment that will make you laugh and at least one moment that will make you go \u201cawwww, isn\u2019t that cute\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base did a great job with the animation for this show. Such amazing detail went not only into the main characters overall design, but even the side characters appeared to stand out. The backgrounds and lighting were also well done. Combine this with the animators bright color choices makes for the series to have an overall relaxing and cute atmosphere that most will enjoy.  \\n\\n\r\nNow at this point you\u2019re probably saying \u201cWell, this anime seems interesting so far, why would you make people angry with these positive remarks?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain (spoilers).  After the first episode of the series, the premise of the story was presented to us in a way that made us think that for once, the female lead would be the one being chased rather than the one doing the chasing. I, personally, as a fan of Shojo, was happy with this because Shizu, while being extremely stoic, seemed to be a rational thinker while Haru was presented as\u2026\u2026\u2026well\u2026\u2026.. a possessive delinquent. The fact that Shizu WOULDN\u2019T be interested in Haru makes sense to us. \\n\\n\r\nThen the third episode happened and this premise does a complete 180 with Shizu doing the chasing more or less out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThis, I\u2019m sorry to say is one of the main problems with this series. While the premise and characters seemed good at the beginning, as the series goes on, you begin to realize how scattered and poorly structured the overall series actually is. You expect for the characters to move the overall story in a slice of life romantic comedy which has such a simple setting. But here, stuff happens almost at random and the characters actions at times seem to completely contradict what their characters SHOULD be doing.\\n\\n\r\nYou could argue that the characters are growing and are trying to adjust to an environment that their not use to. After all, this series is about how two socially awkward people make friends and fall in love. But if that were the case, then we wouldn\u2019t see them break out of character one moment, but then immediately regress to the way they were at the beginning. This makes everything done seem very forced and unnatural when there were maybe a dozen different ways the story could have been done right. By the end of the series, it\u2019s really hard to claim that the main leads really changed between the first and last episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf this were like say School Rumble were the series revolves around randomness and contradictions for the sake of comedy, then this would all be ok. But the producers are making the characters do this for the sake of unnecessarily expanding a series, making it longer and more complicated than it needs to be. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cSo if the series has such cookie cutter story progression like you claim, then why does this series get such unreal praise?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSimple: Gimmicks and quirks sell more than story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile one might THINK that the story is interesting and engaging, what\u2019s REALLY interesting and engaging are the non-perverted comedic moments as well as the cute confessions which are done so well that I almost get a nose bleed from a cuteness overload. Who cares who confessed first, they\u2019re cute together. Who cares if Haru\u2019s not well put together, he looks adorable. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, I don\u2019t think this is a bad anime at all. If you are a fan of Shojo and or romantic comedies then it\u2019s defiantly worth a look at least till the third episode. But it is a little\u2026\u2026..misguided and manipulative to not be a little upset by it. \\n",

            "content": "This was the first romantic-comedy series I watched when I started watching anime a while back, it was great. Apparently this anime is shoujo, I didn't know what it was, but now I know. The setup or the premise instantly grabs you. The show is certainly enjoyable, greatly assisted by colorful range of expressions, and some genuinely funny lines. There were way too many still scenes , but we can use them. The scenes that were set up had such memetic potential. \r\nThis series is bold, colorful, using varied, solid strokes with full color. The character designs are gorgeous and really appealing. The comedic sensewas simply pitch perfect for me. Gags and expressions were timed long enough for the chuckle, while being short enough so it does not overstays its welcome. The comedy remained consistent, deriving from characters taking advantage of humor, rather than utilizing gag-based jokes. The drama presented itself very well, intersecting with humor and not going into melodrama. The drama carefully presents multiple explorations and perspectives of relationship. Any episode does not end with a cliffhanger and was good. This anime was by far one of the straightforward I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nI can safely say that I enjoyed watching Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun.It has a great love story, cute and funny. The characters are great as they carry the show and make sit memorable. The series is an excellent show that is easy to watch whilst enjoying. It has great moments of comedy and emotion. Highly recommended for people who are searching for a slice-of-life or romantic-comedy series. Or for people who love a romantic comedy about two opposites that greatly attract, you'll love this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe series balances drama and comedy in a really good way, skillfully, very fun, quirky, with good characters and decent romantic-comedy. \\n",

            "content": "When I first started watching My Little Monster, I was already following Say 'I Love You' and I must admit, the initial impression I was left after three or four episodes with was mixed. One of the strengths of this show - and this is already strikingly clear from its first episode which was a very strong start - is the amount of content and fun it can cram into 20 minutes. However, I was a little bemused at the first-glance appearance of the relationship.\r\nHaru's casual rape threat in the first episode, and repeated use of his physical strength to have his way made mewary, given Shizuku's remaining at his side without much objection. The relationship definitely has some interesting moments and eventually becomes much more appealing and less tasteless than it seemed at first - both are very interesting, flawed characters (especially Haru, whom you might not even end up liking much) and their differences certainly enrich the experience. Shizuku is by no means a weak lead character.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the underlying truth is that, despite all of the teenage turbulence, ups and downs etc. their relationship hasn't really gone anywhere throughout the one cour of MLM that we'll (probably) ever get. Shizuku can't be straightforward and sees the distribution of her energy between Haru and studying as a zero-sum game in which the latter is more important. Haru is alarmingly frank about his feelings but is repeatedly self-sabotaging in his attempts to unravel her defences and by the end, since the first episode, we feel that he has in a way made as many steps backwards as he has forwards in pursuing her. At this point, much of our attention is captivated by the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, a romantic primary plot that doesn't really get anywhere wouldn't be too much of a problem, but it actually becomes fairly noticeable in this show simply because of how pumped full of content and activity each episode is - a fact that the very exciting first episode only exacerbates. Sure, quite a lot can go on in a single episode and this is definitely, overall, a forte in terms of fun, laughs and subtle developments. However, the big problem is that the fact that there is such a limited sprinkling of the dramatic over this whirlpool, and the fact that our character's stories only change very gradually somewhat trivializes most of the content and makes it less deliberate or meaningful, as you would get from some of the other great rom-coms. I consider myself a fairly patient viewer, but by the end I was really hoping for some zest, some drama, some passion, which I think would really add completion to MLM and bump it up to a 5-star rating, but which never really surfaced in these 13 episodes. This isn't really a big deal though, the high-school setting managing to overcome the absence of feels quite passably and charmingly. Besides, MLM is quite full of laughs and it isn't a dull show. You will be enjoying yourself.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the secondary characters and their relationships: Surprisingly, these are the hidden strength of the series. You can relate to MLM's secondaries quite strongly. They emerge gradually in line with the show's \"fast but actually slow\" pacing and as I said before, at the end they have somewhat forced their way onto the centre stage alongside the primary relationship. Jaded romance-viewers might find the character line-up a little standard, but I think they were overall well-handled and endearing. Things weren't particularly predictable to me. Despite this, the sluggish progression of significant events means that we haven't really seen much more movement with the secondaries than we have with the primaries, even though they are all well fleshed-out. It seems that this season has been a big preparation - ie. gradual introduction of characters etc. which will precede the crescendo. But then as I said, that crescendo will probably never come as this may have just been a big advert for the manga.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, on the technical side it's very solid. The art is superb and sometimes the movements are quite impressive. Character designs are good and quite unconventional in this day and age, supported by plenty of fun expressions. No complaints here. The music is also great, with a fantastic OP and ED to wrap each episode in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, MLM has some great moments hidden within. It's highly entertaining, and seems destined to become even better if it's ever given a second cour. The lack of both potent drama and a more determined linear progression in the relationship dynamics have been the main weaknesses of this season, but they are not significant. It's a solid and fun watch and deserves its recognition.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10",

The development of their relationship from Friend to an \"Item\" was really good, but after then it somewhat didn't progress at all, and even by the end i feel both characters were roughly the same development wise as from early on.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bugged me was how they would start little \"Side\" stories with the sub characters, but for the most part they didn't go no where, and even one of the key ones involving Asako Natsume was just left without anything happening to it.\\n\r\nThis just feels to me a little rushed, and even the ending, I had to look at this site to know their was 13 Episodes, It left me wanting more, But not in the good way, Felt like we missed out on a lot. Not sure if thats because they might of pushed for a S2? Who knows.\\n\\n\r\nOveral, I liked the series and enjoyed it alot, But the reasons i've stated, it just felt a little rushed and story somewhat took a back seat.\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend it if you like Toradora, or a series like that, The whole Comedy/Romance in this series is good.\\n",

            "content": "Merry Christmas everybody, so I've just finished this 13 ep anime, so without further adieu, here's my rating.\r\nStory: Good 7.\r\nThe execution of this anime's genre especially on the romance side is to me a well executed. You really can relate to the, I really like how this anime's romance being combine with a little bit of comedy was done. Basically it is a reverse thing where bad boy comes into normal high school girl's life and turns it upside down and along the way bad boy's relationship seem threaten when he sees possible competition trying to win normal high school girl's affection.\r\nArt: Poor 3.\r\nThis probablythe only time, where I's gonna criticized this anime's art.........it's generally terrible. For the female protagonist, I'd probabaly say that she looks better in a school uniform than in plain clothes, which she looks like a grandma. As for the boy's uniform where the main character's were studying I find it soooooo 70's, I will never understand the illustrator's PV as to why the boy's have to wear plaint pants co'z the last time I saw those kinds of pants is when my grandpa was young and part of the hippie movement in 1973.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre 5. \\n\\n\r\nI just have nothing much to say about this category.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7. \\n\\n\r\nOk, the character's involved in this anime are somewhat you'll be irritated on one side but will most appreciated in another, ok, so about Haru, he's probably a guy whom you'll wanna do a ground and pound thing on him co'z he's more like this poster boy for a spouse abuser and he's also too reckless, but on the other hand you'll admire him that eventhough he's a delinquent, he's a delinquent who has both brains (in studying), brawn and certain level of dedication to the people close to him. Shizuka, is one ordinary mind my own business type of study bug whom you'll wish that she go for Yamaken instead of going for Haru, but you'll be a bit irritated by her seemly cold attitude towards the people around her.  There is also that part where you wish that a romantic arc develops between Sasayan and Asako, but unfortunately it don't look like that it's gonna happen, however I also see a potential for a Sasayan X Chizuru arc, then again like that's gonna happen.\\n\r\nGoing back to Haru, so he does provide the comedy aspect of this anime, but for him to be in a relationship with either Shizuka or Chizuru.......I kinda hate seeing it, to me I find him a someone who should be in a correction facility than  having a romantic relationship. I wonder what the hell was that chicken doing in this anime? Cluck! Cluck!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nthe enjoyment part of this anime revolves around as to what will Haru do next or what crazy thing does Haru up to order to satisfy his insecurity with his relationship with Shizuka. Overall, this anime is a combination of one irritation with Haru for being an insecure asshole and the ice cold study bug Shizuka. However it is good that their opposites attract one another.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, It's time for dinner, I'll be having fried chicken tonight. CLUCK! CLUCK!\\n",

            "content": "From the first episode you might think that its another shoujo about a CRAZY delinquent boy getting dropped into a studious girl's lap, and might lose interest. However I think Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is unique in that it doesn't try to make it's lead male into this delinquent boy who happens to be percieved wrong by all of his classmates, and is actually deep down a sweetheart who is a hero with all of his morals in the right place. In Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun Haru (the male lead) is literally an almost sociopath, minus the fact that he hasn't actually killed anyone, yet, and allof his classmates have had the time to acknowledge this. Although there are plenty of shonen that have made comedic use of following an \"evil\" delinquent boy who has messed up morals like beelzebub and kyou kara ore wa, its quite rare in shoujo and I think the story of Shizuku (the female lead) reaching out to this troubled boy (out of obligation at first) is sweet and also hilarious and worth watching. \\n\r\nOften art in shoujo has a particular style that is hard to transfer to anime successfully. However I think its obvious that this anime had the funds to make their art work properly and there weren't as many \"chibi\" + flowers scenes which are generally often present in shoujo, so it made this anime more realistic and watchable for me.\\n\r\nI gave sound a high score because there are these \"classy\" characters that go to an expensive all boys school, and every time they show up/mess up/ do something silly it plays this public domain classical music and its hilarious. (they make use of the public domain music because of the lack of funding, it was correctly placed and super funny).\\n\r\nCharacter wise Haru and maybe also his brother are the most in depth more 3 dimensional characters, who get tens because its hard to write an manga/anime character that is 3-D. The rest of the characters are more two dimensional, however some of them are 2-D for a reason. Shizuku is a girl that does nothing but study, which is unrealistic, however it probably reminds many girls with maybe good but not perfect grades of themselves in high school, who might regret being too serious. Although if there's no crazy delinquent beau around too force you into a less serious strain of activities, there is no crazy delinquent beau around. (There wasn't for me, and I happen to be attending a good college, but like most girls I like to watch anime in which characters, who are either very similar too me, or only have one trait because they are 2-D and thus easy to relate to, get to experience something more romantic.)\\n\r\nI really like anime and manga that are humorous and I tend to not like a shoujo unless it's stupid funny in a good way, I enjoyed this anime a lot and would recommend it to other people.\\n",

            "content": "It's hard to find a romance/comedy/slice of life that really leaves a good impression.  Tonari no Kaibutsu-Kun does exactly that and for those of you who have already seen Lovely Complex and/or Honey and Clover it gives you some traits from each of those shows and adds it's own flavor into the mix as well.\r\nStory- This is the weakest point of the series, however it's not so weak that it provides no interest or doesn't evoke any emotion from you.  It's simple and laid out right in front of your eyes within the first two episodes essentially.  That being said though, thereare a few kinks in the story along the way that give you something to think about.  So while it is the weakest point of the series, it also has it's strong point, and does enough with the core plot to move things along nicely at a solid pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt-  The art was a hair away from a ten, but I just couldn't do it so it wasn't meant to be i guess.  Anyway, it really was my favorite part of the show and I've only thought this about maybe three anime I've ever watched.  For the art to really have such an impact on the characters and story is really special I think.  The pleasant background ambiance and bright, sometimes exotic colors give the scenery personality and a location as simple as their popular spot \"the batting cages\" suddenly becomes unique and colorful because of it.  \\n\\n\r\nSounds-  The OP is one of my favorites and the full length version of it is an extremely catchy song, not to mention a solid ED.  There's a somewhat surreal feel to the background sounds i only mentioned in the \"art\" section of the review and immediately provide you with an engrossing feel that sucks you into what's going on.  Every sounds seems to fit just right and because of this it all flows so naturally.  Finally, the voice actors (or seiyuu) do a fantastic job portraying their character's attitude and feeling in various situation be it good or bad ones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  At first they may seem like typical rom/com cookie cutter type characters but you'll be quickly proven wrong in that regard.  It's not as though we haven't ever seen these characters before in this genre, but the way they're executed is what makes them so enthralling to watch.  Haru is best compared to a wilder Morita (if that's believable for those who've watched Honey and Clover) he's more violent and protective you could say.  That said, he's extremely passionate in everything he does as well as having nothing but pure intentions.  He's very funny and extremely intelligent, and just an overall interesting character that is well designed based on who he is as well.  Shizuku is a character that takes a little bit of developing for her to break out of her shell, and it works for the setting and story.  You really get to see her grow with Haru and the other supporting characters slowly but it never truly gets tiresome as it's not your typical whiny self-conscious high school girl questioning her life/love every few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  Needless to say I rather enjoyed this, and I'll be sure to re-watch it eventually.  I higly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the anime I mentioned above, as well as anyone interested in a good romance told in a slightly different yet charming way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- It's a 9/10 like above the only reason it doesn't get 10/10 is because I believe you need to really go far above and beyond your genre and all other genres for that matter.  This is definitely one of the best rom/com/slice of life iIve seen.  This is also a perfect type of anime to get those who are just starting to pique their interest in this genre.  At only 13 episodes it progresses nicely, and it doesn't have those cringe-worthy overly dramatic moments some romances have, so it's easier for someone new to the genre to dived in without worries.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The anime is about a girl named Shizuku Mizutani who has grew up without any friends. Instead of making friends, this girl would rather study and try to be the smartest girl in class. She would act cold towards people and she doesn\u2019t really care for most things. She is so extreme that people started calling her \u201cDry Ice\u201d. One day, Shizuku was asked to deliver some homework to a classmate named Haru Yoshida. Haru is a troublemaker and he loves getting into fights. Shizuku was shocked to discover one of the school\u2019s toughest guys to actually be desperate for friends and he has gaineda strange liking towards Shizuku. So now, a girl with very little experience about making friends is suddenly being befriended by a guy who would scare people away just by glaring at them. Shizuku has a tough front but it would seem Haru caught her attention. What\u2019s a girl to do when Haru suddenly started saying declaring his love for you? For Dry Ice, it was a new experience but this love thing isn\u2019t exactly one sided. Or is it?\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the anime instantly grabs you. There is a girl who has no care for anything except her studies and a guy who is a brute but a gentle misunderstood soul. Their interaction was pretty fun to watch since the girl is the only person that can get close to the guy and the guy is annoying the hell out of the girl. Little by little though, the relationship of the two gradually grows into something that is really adorable. The anime is pretty straight forward pretty much focusing on this story alone. That\u2019s right. There are no other love stories in the anime. Or rather, the anime was still building up one but it was surely not as important as the main love story. This was great thing because the story of the two characters is really fun to watch and their story might seem straight forward at first, but it eventually reveals some surprises you never expected the show to do.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not perfect and one of the reasons is because the primary focus of the show is the love story yet it was thinly spread out throughout the anime. There is a decent progression but the relationship of the characters are often dreadfully dragged that nothing satisfactory comes out of it. Majority of the episodes have the relationship on stand still going absolutely nowhere and you wait for a decent resolution only to be sorely disappointed. It was cute but thirteen episodes are too long for something cute that doesn\u2019t have much to tell. Towards the second half, the pace died down and the focus was shift towards something else. At first I was glad that there is only one love story in the anime so it can develop the story some more but towards the end, the show fizzled out. The love story that grabbed you halted midway and snail paced its way to the ending. The characters stopped developing to compensate the immediate halt of the story and the focus was shifted to another thing. This is sadly, a typical Shoujo thing. I swear to God the whole anime is a manga lure. These are anime that stops the story so blatantly that it urges you to read the manga. It\u2019s not really bad because anime fans are now familiar with the medium. The problem is that the anime had no decent ending. It basically slammed the door in your face with the sign hanging on it that said: read the manga.",

            "content": "So, I have somewhat weird routines in the morning. I need to yotube-surfs for at least one hour before start my day. It is when I found an interesting anime scene in someone amv. It's when a black-haired guy lick his girl's hands in stairs. This scene succesfully make me do some research in Google. And I found it, an awesome romcom anime named Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun.\r\nStory - 5/10\r\nSorry... but i can't find anything new in this whole series. A violent guy who got tamed by a shy girl. Too focus girl on studying who defeated by a \"never-studying boy\". A girl who didn't cometo class in her first week and end up having no friends. There's too much clich\u00e9 in this series. But, I don't take it seriously because it's romcom anime. It doesn't really annoying because what makes romcom anime fun and hilarious is the characters.\\n\\n\r\nBut again, this series storyflow is too classic for me. Let's say Strangers > Be friend > Vague relationship > Rival show up > Jealousy > Clash between them. Ugh, i have watch too much romance story looks like this. And for me, it's boring. One aspect which makes me finish this series beside dropping is, i love the characters. Shizuku and Haru saves this show for me.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, there are so many scene that makes me giggle and laugh. I just can't forget how they meet for the first time. xD\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters is what makes this show entertaining. Our 2 main characters, Haru and Shizuku, have unique personality. And as this show has a strong start, it makes the characters well-developed. How Haru and Shizuku changed from \"socially awkward\" to person who understand others is simply beautiful. I love how they complement each other.\\n\\n\r\nOne more aspect, the consistency of the characters. Even after all the teenage problems, they still be who they are. Shizuku with her score-on-top-of-everything, and Haru with his violence personality. I found it cool how the author makes his/her characters realistic. After all, natural behaviour isn't something easily changed in short span of time.\\n\\n\r\nVisual - 7/10\\n\r\nFor me, there's a huge gap between visual for action anime and visual for romcom anime. In romcom, we don't need battle scene or fluid movement. As long as it can helps building emotion, it will pass my criteria. That's why I have different parameter for this two genres. Okay, just forget my bullshit. I just pretending to be smart. xD\\n\\n\r\nVisual is something who support from the background, something who support build up emotion. In this show, it was nicely done. The character designs are great. And the art is impressive. There are so many funny faces in this show which makes me laugh, lol.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 7/10\\n\r\nI must admit that the opening song are typical shoujo anime (I don't watch it that much, though) and it's pretty average. And for the ending... ugh, I'm the type who close-before-ending-song person. But before I make this review, i watch it once and my thoughts are the same. Like the opening, it is an average ending song.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, I appreciate the soundtrack. I love how it makes funny scene funnier, and romantic scene more romantic. It helps build-up emotion in an elegant way.\\n\\n\r\nOkay that's it! Thank you for your time and attention. See you in my next review. ;p\\n",

Ikuzo!\r\nTo be absolutely blunt, what initially drew me in was the OP, in all honesty it's one of the best OP's for a series, it fits the story perfectly and is cheerful, catchy and upbeat, I'm listening to it right now actually xD.\r\nAaaanyways, back my opinion, it takes a little bit of a while to pick up speed but around episode 3, the storyline becomes a little more interesting, personally I like really like Mizutani's character and feel a great many of us can relate to her(myself included) given the nature of most students (especially in Japan) which makes it easy to understand what she's going through.\\n\\n\r\nI give it 8/10 because I don't personally like rom-com's as much as I do psychological dramas but this particular story stood out from the rest, so I gave it the rating I feel it best deserves.\\n\\n\r\nReally have no clue what else to write (yes I'm a noob) I'd recommend it to people who like rom-coms or \"studybugs\" kekeke",

            "content": "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun: It's Not My Little Monster\r\nI'm actually somewhat speechless at how underwhelming this series is. Skin deep, it's a pretty decent series with an interesting cast of characters, a somewhat intriguing plot in regards to Haru's back story, and has some rather amusing character interaction. However, I'd be lying to myself if I didn't call Tonari a disappointment. This series reminded me of a teenager going through puberty. It's so full of potential but it's just so damn awkward in quite a few ways.\r\nThe story of Tonari revolves around Shizuku, a rather studious girl that does nothing but study so that she getsthe best grades. She has no friends and has no interest in friends until one day, her teacher asks her to drop off some worksheets for Haru, a rebellious boy in her class that is serving a suspension for getting into a fight at school. However, as soon as the two meet, Haru becomes obsessed with Shizuku, essentially falling in love with her almost as soon as they meet. Hijinx ensue as the two of them have \"difficulties\" bonding, although still maintain a friendship/relationship throughout the series as well as make new friends. \\n\\n\r\nThat leads me to the characters, which were probably the strongest part of this series. Besides the two leads, we're introduced to Natsume, a beautiful troubled girl that struggles with interpersonal interaction but loves social networking, Sasayama, an eccentric baseball loving friend of Haru's from middle school, Chizuru, a shy girl that develops a crush for Haru after he stands up for her, and Kenji, a rather arrogant boy who associates himself with Haru but has his own clique of friends as well as develops an attraction for Shizuku. For the most part, there are many supporting characters in this series, each with their own groups. There are several other supporting characters such as Mitsuyoshi, Haru's uncle and Yuuzan, Haru's brother. While I found the characters to be strong in their presentation, I found the development of those characters to be lacking...severely. As this series progressed, I wanted to know more about the troubled relationship between Haru, Yuuzan, and their father. I wanted to know how Mitsuyoshi and Kyouko (not spoiling this) played a role in that. I wanted to know more about Shizuku's own rather odd family situation. Hell, I just wanted to know more about the entire supporting cast in general. However, instead of focusing on these things, the writers brush it off for more odd character interactions that mostly lead to nothing. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I had with this series was just how awkward it was with it's character interaction. While I know I said it was one of the strengths of the series, it was also one of the weaknesses. The relationship between Haru and Shizuku is just bizarre, mostly because they often change their minds about how they feel about each other. While I'm aware that considering they are both awkward individuals in the first place, it was rather confusing how both would tell each other how much they love each other during the series, but then nothing would happen and they'd act like they would break up. Honestly, it was hard to follow where the series was going with it. If nothing else, it made things kind of frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have complained about the characters development, I think where the series falls short with it was how it was paced. The pacing was just awful and a lot of the situations the characters would get into were quite forgettable. For example, I barely remember anything actually happening in the final three episodes. There were stretches during this series that were just so bland and so forgettable it makes me wonder why the writers didn't even try to delve into the character back stories. That's what was weird about this series. You could sort of feel how the characters felt toward each other when they interacted, but what was even happening in the story was forgettable. It seemed like it was essentially leading to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't say Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is a bad series. The characters were a lot of fun to watch and some of the interactions were downright hilarious. However, this series fell very short in it's story progression and character development...it showed. This series was downright awkward because it wasn't very strong for a comedy, it had dramatic elements that it seemed it barely wanted to touch upon, and the romance is very passive. This series essentially had a genre identity crisis, even though it tried to make it obvious that this was a romance series. It has me at a loss for who I'd recommend it to. If you like a mild romance with a couple that has a unique chemistry about them, I guess I'd recommend this. Unfortunately, while I want to say this would be an interesting series to watch, I cannot give it the strongest of recommendations. This is a series that is setup for a 2nd season and it badly needs one. I feel that if this series does have a 2nd season that cleans up what the 1st season left behind, it's worth a watch. However, until then, I'd say wait on watching this series until a 2nd season is released if you do plan on eventually watching this.",

Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun pretty much masters what it is supposed to be a shoujo rom-com slice of life.  \r\nThe characters act like high schoolers. The love is awkward at times because, that's exactly what's it's supposed to be, awkward love between awkward members of society. The main characters are social misfits with social ineptitude. What ensues make sense. This is where the comedy aspect comes in. The take this awkward approach to love to showcase the hilarity of how out of normthe characters are and used to poke fun at cliches. It definitely kept me laughing. But the slice of life aspect remains strong; the characters continue living on as normal. Rather than showcasing secret illicit romance rendezvous to hot springs, or other unbelievable likewise situations, like so many other high school romance animes do, they showcase the characters doing things like studying or just hanging out with one another. There are moments that make you laugh, that tug at your heart, that make you say \"aw\", just like real life.\\n\\n\r\nFor technical aspects the art is very good, and smooth flowing. I personally really favor the soundtrack of this anime. The main song has just a beautiful nostalgic feel to it. \\n",

            "content": "Bad boy meets lonely girl rom-coms are nothing new--they occasionally make for good comfort food, but having been done to death the way they have it's rare to find a series that's willing to look at its characters honestly rather than just putting an attractive loner on display to get the fawning fangirls a-squealin'. Thankfully, My Little Monster not only averts many of the stale stereotypes associated with its tired premise, it manages to make its leads some of the most believably lonely and isolated characters I've ever seen in a good long time. Love them or hate them, but we've all known kids likeShizuku and Haru. Some of us probably were those kids. Better still, they complement one another remarkably well, each filling in the other's deficiencies in surprisingly clever ways. This little gem of a series really does go to surprising lengths to set itself apart.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one word to describe the visuals of this series, it's colorful. The backgrounds and character designs are bright and lively, and yet they never stray so far from reality that it becomes a barrier against seeing these characters as real people. The animation itself isn't particularly high-end, presumably because it's adapted from a relatively little-known source manga, but it's good enough to get the job done. On a whole the show has a charming, playful aesthetic that's still earthy enough that it doesn't detract from the show's dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of this show's high points. It can dive into over-the-top territory with rowdy and energized blaring trumpets, only to turn around and perfectly accent a sentimental, contemplative moment with soft strings, hitting just the right level of sensitivity without ever coming across as corny. It's a tough task to pull off, made no less difficult by the dichotomous nature of the content. Suffice it to say that there's not a second in this show that doesn't deliver musically. On a side note, am I the only one who got a Peanuts vibe from a few of the show's quirkier pieces, because I swear the resemblance is uncanny.\\n\\n\r\nBad news for the dub lovers out there, this show is currently unlicensed, but I'm pleased to say that the Japanese track will fill your needs just fine. I have to give the voice actors credit for managing to bounce between over-the-top silliness and grounded drama without a hitch, often managing to carry their characters with surprising subtlety. I have a hard time critiquing a language I don't speak, but I still find Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Haru to be a pretty impressive stand-out performance. From his aggressive side to his silly blunt honesty to his thoughtful, serious side, Suzuki manages to tie them all together into one memorable main character and make it sound like the most natural thing in the world.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Haru, he's definitely not your typical male rom-com lead. Rather than the brooding, stone-faced rocks we're used to, he actively fawns over Shizuku to the point of obsession. Naturally, this makes him an enormous pain-in-the-ass to Shizuku, who's used to being left alone and doesn't know how to cope with the attention. Actually, Shizuku herself is much nearer the stereotypical male lead I just described, but she still carries just a hint of suppressed femininity. She's much more grounded in conventional sensibilities than Haru, but just as unsure of how to act in social situations. She keeps her head down and is more interested in grades than guys (or so she tells herself), and it irritates her to no end that Haru, who seems like a complete buffoon, tops her test scores effortlessly. Haru, by contrast, wants to make friends with all his heart, but his brash nature scares people away, and those who do choose to hang around him tend to have ulterior motives, furthering his general mistrust for those around him. He generally gets into fights for the right reasons, but that's not how the people around him see it. Both characters are plagued by loneliness, but for completely different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nNot that this show is all sentimental and serious all the time. Far from it, most of the show is actually really lighthearted and silly, built around Haru's antics getting on Shizuku's nerves, their friend Natsume overreacting and panicking when things get out-of-hand, etc. Thanks to the show's charming direction it's almost never too dark or uncomfortable (notice I said almost, but we'll get to that later). The style of humor, like many other things about this show, is refreshingly grounded, like the kind of silliness that happens between real friends bouncing off of each other naturally, while still injecting a little extra silliness as only anime can. Much like Princess Jellyfish, a lot of effort was put into making this show warm and welcoming, and even the secondary characters have some genuine effort put into them, particularly their new friend Natsume and Haru's old friend Kenji, both of whom start out as borderline stereotypes but grow into complex, flawed yet strong characters in their own rights over the course of the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one problem with creating truly believably flawed characters, it's that it becomes very hard to give such characters proper catharsis and making such an ending feel deserved. Haru in particular is a daunting character to work with, constantly straddling the line between a misguided but good-natured boy... and a borderline psycho-path. In the first episode he actually threatened to rape Shizuku, but it was so thoroughly tongue-in-cheek and he said it with such barefaced innocence that I couldn't help but wonder if he even knew how to insert Tab A into Slot B. Later that same episode he accidentally hurt Shizuku in a moment of passion while trying to come to her rescue, but she gave him a firm scolding for it and it seemed like he'd learned his lesson. And yet as the story progresses and we dig deeper into his pit of problems, he becomes progressively harder to sympathize with because by the end it's unclear whether he's made any progress from who he was at the start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI have a no-spoilers policy, and I think it's worked pretty well for me up to this point, but for this review it's hard to explain just how badly the show messes up his character arc without giving away a detail that comes up later in the story. Let's just say that there's one moment, you'll know it when you see it, where Haru comes dangerously close to crossing a moral event horizon. It was creepy and disturbing (heck, I'd actually related to his character up to that point), and then they never bring it up again. Once again, we're plagued with the problem of a series that's adapted from ongoing source material. Maybe they address it later on in the manga, maybe they don't, but either way it wasn't addressed in the show and that's what I'm reviewing. Shizuku's character arc is somewhat more refined in execution, but still a little too open-ended for comfort, especially in the context of her relationship with Haru, which constantly waffles about in typical will they or won't they fashion. By the end Natsume felt more like the heart of the story than either of them, she had a much stronger grasp on what's important in life. The conclusion was inconclusive and open-ended, saved only by the show's strong direction, which somehow managed to remain consistently charming from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most frustrating things a story can do is to reach for greatness and then stop halfway, and that's exactly what My Little Monster does. After putting so much effort into building up a realistically screwed up character, the show falls into the \"crap, I'm an adaptation\" pitfall and stops before it can help him out of the pit he's in. Still, its strong characterization cannot be ignored, and coupled with its strong atmosphere I think the show has enough going for it to merit a watch and hope for a second season.",

            "content": "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun [My Little Monster] is a Rom-Com that fails to deliver. It continues to go in circles while not coming forth and facing its problems. At the same time showing us meaningless love interest with the side characters. Will they? Won't they? Why haven't they?\r\nIt's a decent at most. I just fail to see, why others give it such high praise. If you enjoy, \u2018Rom-Com; than this is for you. Be warned 'Abuse' and 'Odd' situations ahead. I\u2019m a bit dumbfounded how I wasn\u2019t able to enjoy. I love Romances but when watching this one, I found myself struggling at times and leavingbriefly hoping I'd enjoy it later. The first episode was a great step forward towards on establishing a relationship but only took more steps back if anything. Never doing anything.\\n\\n\r\nA bit of spoilers a head. Gomensai. Read at your own risk.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe show is centered on Haru and Shizuku as they form a peculiar friendship of their own. From episode one, we're told Haru has a thing for Shizuku. Insisting to her that he \u2018Loves\u2019 her. Only to get rejected right there and then. There was no establishment that they were even good friends before hand but it was promising start nonetheless. As we got to see how their bond and relationship beginnings to form and unfold before our eyes. Both of them are stubborn as they try to come out their shells while making friendships with their classmates mainly Masahiro and Sasahara. I'm left at awe at times how some of the side characters fall in love with others just because of a simple action or meaningless small talk. \\n\\n\r\nWhen others try to give advice to Shizuku and Haru, I fail to see where they\u2019re coming. Feels forced, in hopes of only advancing the main love interest. There were cringe worthy moments, that could be questioned as abusive. Just a heads up.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:  7 | 6\\n\\n\r\nThe animation does have it's drop in qualities but it isn't too apparent. I like the characters designs for just about everyone, giving them all a distinct look. It's music does fit the tone at times during it's more dramatic situations which I found to be pleasant. However, the Opening and Ending OST aren\u2019t really all that great in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nHaru is the most intriguing character from the start and the driving force of the show. Lively, hot-headed, with a full head of steam. It's surprising how they don't address the fact that he enjoys, beating and wealing on others. That should have been more of focus rather than comedic relief. I didn't find it that funny, when he wailed on some people, which included his love interest at times.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Haru can be so dense and gullible. It blows my mind how a prodigy when it comes to exams can be like that. He\u2019s always seems to make act without giving it much thought on how it might affect others.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku is the studyholic placing it above anything or anyone else. Let it be family or friends, studying comes first. Through the progression of the show, she opens up to others but has great difficulty when it comes to Haru. She can\u2019t seem to figure him like her homework problems; they\u2019re are simple while he\u2019s a complex problem to her. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, I didn't find the side characters all that appealing. None then did anything to stick out. All were bland and poorly written. We have Natsume who the \u2018Baka\u2019 and the annoyance of the show. Due to her poor choices of posting on internet forums. Sasahara is just their to give advice if anything else while being a comedy relief. The show didn\u2019t let the side characters develop at all that much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nI found myself trying to watch this anime but had myself struggling often at times. The most I got out of it were from Haru goofy actions and behavior.  \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts/Overall: 5\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an unfinished Anime than this is the one for you. It a poor adaption which was made for watchers to read the Manga. It only rose questions like, \"Will those two end up together?\". Nothing was ever adress through the series. It set itself up for a Season 2 that won't likely come.",

            "content": "An extremely disappointing series that had a lot of potential with vibrant characters that goes absolutely no where\r\nAt first glance, TNKK seems like a cute and different kind of story. The female lead, Shizuku Mizutani, is top of her class but not without a price. She's cold and emotionless, only caring about studying and becoming successful, very much the anti-shoujo stereotype of being obsessed with love. She meets Haru, an intimidating boy with natural smarts that outmatch hers, a vivid outlook on life and an extremely wild, aggressive streak. The two are natural opposites - id and ego - who are destined to fall inlove and grow together, to better themselves, right?\\n\\n\r\nNah.\\n\\n\r\nTNKK falls short of being a slice-of-life type of romcom, with half-hearted life lessons and story arcs that don't lead to actual character growth. Beyond the first episode or two, the story isn't exactly \"touching\" either. There is this back-and-forth love story for the majority of the 13-episode anime which was extremely tiresome all too soon. Characters are introduced, such as 3rd party love interests or the main characters' relatives, that are irrelevant to the plot, get no character depth, or are rarely seen or heard from even though they are engaging and exciting. No plot lines get resolved and there is next to no character development. If anything, Haru and Shizuku regress into their 1-dimensional roles and become side-characters to others, such as Yamaken or Natsume (who, unfortunately, do not get their stories resolved either). It ends up being a chore to care about the two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I just wouldn't recommend this series unless you REALLY have nothing better to watch. It has a few cute or sweet moments, but don't expect another Toradora or Chuunibyou. Having not read the manga, I can't be sure as to how well it goes along, but as a stand-alone anime, 13 episodes have left me wondering why I even bothered watching this show. And the fact that it can't hold its own, to me, is a mark of a bad show.",

            "content": "Too many times have I seen the redundant case in anime where a show will conclude at what feels like the midpoint of the series. Although providing quality artwork, animation, and satiating my thirst for lighthearted romantic-comedy, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (My Little Monster) falls victim under this unfortunate plague. \r\nThe plot of My Little Monster resides mainly in the perspective of the two main characters, Shizuku and Haru; both are social outcasts and have no friends at the beginning of the series due to their own respective personalities not meeting the standards of the social norm. They are both very weird characters, but maybe that'swhy they were so entertaining to watch. I enjoyed the first half of My Little Monster a little more than the second because the characters were so forward with their emotions in the beginning and they really did voice what was on their mind unlike many other extremely passive rom-coms. The second half seemed to be a bit lacking for me in terms of development overall. \\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the two main characters would be best described with a quote many of us have probably heard before in our lifetime, \"Opposites attract.\" Shizuku is a study enthusiast whose main goal is to get good grades, while Haru is a semi-delinquent that does whatever he thinks is entertaining and often is seen getting into fights. Both become each other's first real friend. As they get to know each other Shizuku and Haru slowly begin to understand themselves as individuals and what they want from themselves and each other. They are able to make friends and assemble their own group of oddballs to form their own little niche. \\n\\n\r\nThe core of the group consists of Shizuku, Haru, Natsume, and Sasahara and I liked all of them collectively. Since we know Shizuku and Haru are the romantic duo, where does that leave Natsume and Sasahara? Natsume is typically seen 'third-wheeling' with Shizuku and Haru and often tags along with them to go places because she doesn't have friends either; she isn't very smart, is athletic, and is quite attractive to many guys in the show, leading her to be shunned by almost every other girl as a result. Sasahara is a baseball player that pops in every now and again, and though he's part of the core group he isn't there as much as Natsume is due to being in baseball and having other friends. He seems to be the most normal of the group. I loved this group of weirdos because they each brought something interesting to the table and truly delivered on the comedy portion of the rom-com. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many times in My Little Monster that you will sadly forget the show is in fact a 'romantic' comedy since the romantic bits of the show are extremely lacking. In fact, I would go so far as to deem it underwhelming. It was such a nice change up for the main characters to admit they were in love with each other within the first three episodes that I developed higher expectations thinking the series would be one of the best rom-coms around. Unfortunately, the romantic progress seemed to work backwards and the main characters went from knowing they were in love to becoming extremely passive, both unsure what they wanted from the relationship. Though this saddened me greatly, it does not ruin the show in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork/animation and sound were spot on. I enjoyed everything the show had to offer for this portion. The artwork was unique and refreshing, there was clean animation, and the OP/ED were actually pretty good. There was the tingle of piano at dramatic moments, and upbeat silly music when things were getting fun, I couldn't ask for more. I also enjoyed the dialogue of My Little Monster very much. The subtle comments and word choices used really made for some quality comedic entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, the ending. As I mentioned in my introduction, the show seems to end at what seems to the the mid point in the series; it feels like it got halfway through a 24 episode run and got scrapped. A second season would do this series so much justice, but alas it may never come. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you plan to watch My Little Monster, don't have any expectations of a grand love story because there isn't one. As a romantic-comedy there should be a balance between romance and comedy, but this one leans more on the comedic side than the romantic one. It is a very feel good anime, and if you can ignore the lack of romantic development the show excels in giving you laughs and will leave you feeling genuinely happy.",

            "content": "So while scrolling through Netflix during the ungodly hours of the early morning, I came across Tonari no Kaibutsu-Kun. The premise seemed interesting; a studious, no nonsense, anti-social girl named Shizuku finds a friend in a hostile boy Haru. \r\nWhile not an entirely unique story nor complex, I still found it entertaining.\r\nThe story is quite simplistic, but I didn't really mind that much. (I just finished Noragami yesterday and that one was very complex.) \r\nI will say that I almost clicked out on the first episode due to pacing issues. However, I'm glad I didn't, because it turned out to be quite enjoyable. The saidpacing issues were non-existent due to a scene that happens at the end of the first episode that surprised and intrigued me, but I won't spoil it here. \\n\\n\r\nIt was listed under the comedy section, so I figured I'd give it a shot, to break it up from all the serious anime I've been watching lately.Needless to say, the comedy did not disappoint. On multiple occasions I found myself laughing out loud, I even almost squirted milk up my nose.\\n\\n\r\nThe art while nice and clean, is nothing special, however there are aspects and moments that are really beautiful. The animation during any of the sunset scenes are absolutely stunning. In the second episode I believe it's raining and the shot holds on the rain and the puddle. It looked incredibly realistic. Though not as stunning as others, I also love the eye designs, especially Shizuku and Haru's.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is pretty average for the Shouju genre (or at least the ones I've seen), and I admittedly don't think that much for the ending song either. I will say I adore the soundtrack though, it's really mellow, and I could probably listen to it whilst going to sleep.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, I found were all very unique and distinct from one another, yet still maintain their personality as they developed. That being said, I feel as if it could have used a few more episodes to further develop the characters, as it ended fairly ambiguously in regards to said characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started this early this morning, (like at one or two am) I didn't want to stop. But after watching four episodes I figured I should go to sleep. The first thing I did when I woke up this morning, you ask? I watched more. I definitely had me hooked, and I really wanted to know what was going to happen. I was a touch disappointed at the ending however the journey paid off, more so than the destination.\\n\\n",

She is a bright, young, brown headed teenager who only knows the world of textbooks. \r\nEveryone's favourite character in the show, Haru, is a dark-headed male teenager who lacks social skills who at first look appears to be just another delinquent.Being the delinquent that Haru is, he regularly skips classes making histeacher send homework to his place of residence. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show starts off when Shizuka delivers Haru's homework to him. They have a \"weird\" first meeting and she slowly develops an interest in Haru overtime. As time passes the viewer learns that Haru is actually a genius, good-looking, well mannered teenager that is 2nd to best Usui, Takami from Kaichou-Wa Maid Sama. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like comedy romanced animes, I suggest this to everyone. Think Kaichou-Wa Maid Sama + Toradora with great visuals and an amazing soundtrack. I have high expectations for this anime. Cheers!",

            "content": "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is a romance anime that tries and ever so slightly succeeds at setting itself apart from the standard mass of harem anime that's out there, but inevitably stumbles and falls on its own flaws.\r\nIts first and most obvious flaw is that it progresses too fast. It is determined to set itself apart by portraying an attraction (of sorts) that's there and out in the open nearly from the get-go, but fails to recognize that this makes little actual sense when the characters hardly know each other. What is an attempt to portray, perhaps, a sense of naivet\u00e9 or cute clumsiness from themale lead - both at this junction and elsewhere in the series - comes across as silly rather than profound. The way the female lead falls for the male lead and the attraction she experiences feels rather out of tune with the character established in the beginning, creating dissonance rather than actual development. The subsequent challenges they face versus each other and those next to them tend to feel forced and this is both a result of the unsteady premise and the fact that, well, it doesn't set itself that much apart in the end. The end is a little better, especially if you overlook the last twelve-and-a-half episodes, but just... no.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters it portrays tend to be more of the same; unlikely and odd combinations that do not create interesting contrasts; rather, they left me dumbfounded at times with inane character interaction and stupid attempts at jokes. It felt... dumb. Simple and unclever. Few of the jokes really worked and their internal issues were driven by and challenged with equally plain methods. The ending was insufficient on many, many levels, failing to close some important knots and like so many other romance series, leaving the relationship itself a little too open.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise it does not offer a lot. Character designs are probably its strongest suit and they appear rather average, with often-out of place body structure and simple shading (yet at other times especially shading and vividness is done quite well). The backgrounds don't mix well with the character designs and are often very simple, as are the camera angles and shots used. The soundtrack offers some nice string and piano tracks, but for the most part it is your run-of-the-mill romcom soundtrack with a mix of comedy and romance themes. The opening theme is a very average school/romance theme with the usual colourful backgrounds and animations we've seen a thousand times before. The ending theme is more flowery but equally bland in terms of originality. \\n\\n\r\nLet this be said though. It avoids several common pit traps and clich\u00e9s of romance anime, lacking both a distinct harem and many of the common episode settings that are so common. All in all however, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is an anime that tries to set itself apart, succeeds a little but eventually stumbles and falls face-first into the mud, void of any real sense of clever and intriguing writing. I did not like it at all and struggled watching through it. Maybe you have more luck with it, but I would not personally recommend it.",

            "content": "Ok, so I wanted to wait for the anime to finish before writing a review because I wanted to have all my facts straight. Let me be a bit frank here:\r\nI am going to make a lot of people mad with this review \r\nPlease keep in mind that I rate a lot of anime highly on the premise of entertainment. If I enjoy something and finish it then I rate it highly. However, enjoying something and thinking that a series was well done can be two completely different things. \r\nBut, as someone who is a huge fan of romantic comedies, who hasn\u2019t read the mangaand has re-watched certain scenes, I feel the need to mention a few things regarding this anime: Both what\u2019s great about it and what\u2019s wrong with it. \\n\\n\r\nTonari no Kaibutsu-kun (or The Monster seated Next to Me) tells the story of Shizuku Mizutani, a very serious student who only cares about her grades. One day, Shizuku is tasked with delivering class printouts to the home of a boy named Haru Yoshida, a delinquent who rarely attends school. Upon meeting Shizu, Haru immediately considers her his friend and a new relationship sparks between the two as they begin to experience things that neither of them have felt before such as friendship and love. \\n\\n\r\nThe series itself is very episodic and appears to be well paced. Every episode contains at least one moment that will make you laugh and at least one moment that will make you go \u201cawwww, isn\u2019t that cute\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base did a great job with the animation for this show. Such amazing detail went not only into the main characters overall design, but even the side characters appeared to stand out. The backgrounds and lighting were also well done. Combine this with the animators bright color choices makes for the series to have an overall relaxing and cute atmosphere that most will enjoy.  \\n\\n\r\nNow at this point you\u2019re probably saying \u201cWell, this anime seems interesting so far, why would you make people angry with these positive remarks?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain (spoilers).  After the first episode of the series, the premise of the story was presented to us in a way that made us think that for once, the female lead would be the one being chased rather than the one doing the chasing. I, personally, as a fan of Shojo, was happy with this because Shizu, while being extremely stoic, seemed to be a rational thinker while Haru was presented as\u2026\u2026\u2026well\u2026\u2026.. a possessive delinquent. The fact that Shizu WOULDN\u2019T be interested in Haru makes sense to us. \\n\\n\r\nThen the third episode happened and this premise does a complete 180 with Shizu doing the chasing more or less out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThis, I\u2019m sorry to say is one of the main problems with this series. While the premise and characters seemed good at the beginning, as the series goes on, you begin to realize how scattered and poorly structured the overall series actually is. You expect for the characters to move the overall story in a slice of life romantic comedy which has such a simple setting. But here, stuff happens almost at random and the characters actions at times seem to completely contradict what their characters SHOULD be doing.\\n\\n\r\nYou could argue that the characters are growing and are trying to adjust to an environment that their not use to. After all, this series is about how two socially awkward people make friends and fall in love. But if that were the case, then we wouldn\u2019t see them break out of character one moment, but then immediately regress to the way they were at the beginning. This makes everything done seem very forced and unnatural when there were maybe a dozen different ways the story could have been done right. By the end of the series, it\u2019s really hard to claim that the main leads really changed between the first and last episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf this were like say School Rumble were the series revolves around randomness and contradictions for the sake of comedy, then this would all be ok. But the producers are making the characters do this for the sake of unnecessarily expanding a series, making it longer and more complicated than it needs to be. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cSo if the series has such cookie cutter story progression like you claim, then why does this series get such unreal praise?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSimple: Gimmicks and quirks sell more than story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile one might THINK that the story is interesting and engaging, what\u2019s REALLY interesting and engaging are the non-perverted comedic moments as well as the cute confessions which are done so well that I almost get a nose bleed from a cuteness overload. Who cares who confessed first, they\u2019re cute together. Who cares if Haru\u2019s not well put together, he looks adorable. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, I don\u2019t think this is a bad anime at all. If you are a fan of Shojo and or romantic comedies then it\u2019s defiantly worth a look at least till the third episode. But it is a little\u2026\u2026..misguided and manipulative to not be a little upset by it. \\n",

            "content": "This was the first romantic-comedy series I watched when I started watching anime a while back, it was great. Apparently this anime is shoujo, I didn't know what it was, but now I know. The setup or the premise instantly grabs you. The show is certainly enjoyable, greatly assisted by colorful range of expressions, and some genuinely funny lines. There were way too many still scenes , but we can use them. The scenes that were set up had such memetic potential. \r\nThis series is bold, colorful, using varied, solid strokes with full color. The character designs are gorgeous and really appealing. The comedic sensewas simply pitch perfect for me. Gags and expressions were timed long enough for the chuckle, while being short enough so it does not overstays its welcome. The comedy remained consistent, deriving from characters taking advantage of humor, rather than utilizing gag-based jokes. The drama presented itself very well, intersecting with humor and not going into melodrama. The drama carefully presents multiple explorations and perspectives of relationship. Any episode does not end with a cliffhanger and was good. This anime was by far one of the straightforward I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nI can safely say that I enjoyed watching Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun.It has a great love story, cute and funny. The characters are great as they carry the show and make sit memorable. The series is an excellent show that is easy to watch whilst enjoying. It has great moments of comedy and emotion. Highly recommended for people who are searching for a slice-of-life or romantic-comedy series. Or for people who love a romantic comedy about two opposites that greatly attract, you'll love this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe series balances drama and comedy in a really good way, skillfully, very fun, quirky, with good characters and decent romantic-comedy. \\n",

            "content": "When I first started watching My Little Monster, I was already following Say 'I Love You' and I must admit, the initial impression I was left after three or four episodes with was mixed. One of the strengths of this show - and this is already strikingly clear from its first episode which was a very strong start - is the amount of content and fun it can cram into 20 minutes. However, I was a little bemused at the first-glance appearance of the relationship.\r\nHaru's casual rape threat in the first episode, and repeated use of his physical strength to have his way made mewary, given Shizuku's remaining at his side without much objection. The relationship definitely has some interesting moments and eventually becomes much more appealing and less tasteless than it seemed at first - both are very interesting, flawed characters (especially Haru, whom you might not even end up liking much) and their differences certainly enrich the experience. Shizuku is by no means a weak lead character.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the underlying truth is that, despite all of the teenage turbulence, ups and downs etc. their relationship hasn't really gone anywhere throughout the one cour of MLM that we'll (probably) ever get. Shizuku can't be straightforward and sees the distribution of her energy between Haru and studying as a zero-sum game in which the latter is more important. Haru is alarmingly frank about his feelings but is repeatedly self-sabotaging in his attempts to unravel her defences and by the end, since the first episode, we feel that he has in a way made as many steps backwards as he has forwards in pursuing her. At this point, much of our attention is captivated by the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, a romantic primary plot that doesn't really get anywhere wouldn't be too much of a problem, but it actually becomes fairly noticeable in this show simply because of how pumped full of content and activity each episode is - a fact that the very exciting first episode only exacerbates. Sure, quite a lot can go on in a single episode and this is definitely, overall, a forte in terms of fun, laughs and subtle developments. However, the big problem is that the fact that there is such a limited sprinkling of the dramatic over this whirlpool, and the fact that our character's stories only change very gradually somewhat trivializes most of the content and makes it less deliberate or meaningful, as you would get from some of the other great rom-coms. I consider myself a fairly patient viewer, but by the end I was really hoping for some zest, some drama, some passion, which I think would really add completion to MLM and bump it up to a 5-star rating, but which never really surfaced in these 13 episodes. This isn't really a big deal though, the high-school setting managing to overcome the absence of feels quite passably and charmingly. Besides, MLM is quite full of laughs and it isn't a dull show. You will be enjoying yourself.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the secondary characters and their relationships: Surprisingly, these are the hidden strength of the series. You can relate to MLM's secondaries quite strongly. They emerge gradually in line with the show's \"fast but actually slow\" pacing and as I said before, at the end they have somewhat forced their way onto the centre stage alongside the primary relationship. Jaded romance-viewers might find the character line-up a little standard, but I think they were overall well-handled and endearing. Things weren't particularly predictable to me. Despite this, the sluggish progression of significant events means that we haven't really seen much more movement with the secondaries than we have with the primaries, even though they are all well fleshed-out. It seems that this season has been a big preparation - ie. gradual introduction of characters etc. which will precede the crescendo. But then as I said, that crescendo will probably never come as this may have just been a big advert for the manga.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, on the technical side it's very solid. The art is superb and sometimes the movements are quite impressive. Character designs are good and quite unconventional in this day and age, supported by plenty of fun expressions. No complaints here. The music is also great, with a fantastic OP and ED to wrap each episode in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, MLM has some great moments hidden within. It's highly entertaining, and seems destined to become even better if it's ever given a second cour. The lack of both potent drama and a more determined linear progression in the relationship dynamics have been the main weaknesses of this season, but they are not significant. It's a solid and fun watch and deserves its recognition.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10",

The development of their relationship from Friend to an \"Item\" was really good, but after then it somewhat didn't progress at all, and even by the end i feel both characters were roughly the same development wise as from early on.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bugged me was how they would start little \"Side\" stories with the sub characters, but for the most part they didn't go no where, and even one of the key ones involving Asako Natsume was just left without anything happening to it.\\n\r\nThis just feels to me a little rushed, and even the ending, I had to look at this site to know their was 13 Episodes, It left me wanting more, But not in the good way, Felt like we missed out on a lot. Not sure if thats because they might of pushed for a S2? Who knows.\\n\\n\r\nOveral, I liked the series and enjoyed it alot, But the reasons i've stated, it just felt a little rushed and story somewhat took a back seat.\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend it if you like Toradora, or a series like that, The whole Comedy/Romance in this series is good.\\n",

            "content": "Merry Christmas everybody, so I've just finished this 13 ep anime, so without further adieu, here's my rating.\r\nStory: Good 7.\r\nThe execution of this anime's genre especially on the romance side is to me a well executed. You really can relate to the, I really like how this anime's romance being combine with a little bit of comedy was done. Basically it is a reverse thing where bad boy comes into normal high school girl's life and turns it upside down and along the way bad boy's relationship seem threaten when he sees possible competition trying to win normal high school girl's affection.\r\nArt: Poor 3.\r\nThis probablythe only time, where I's gonna criticized this anime's art.........it's generally terrible. For the female protagonist, I'd probabaly say that she looks better in a school uniform than in plain clothes, which she looks like a grandma. As for the boy's uniform where the main character's were studying I find it soooooo 70's, I will never understand the illustrator's PV as to why the boy's have to wear plaint pants co'z the last time I saw those kinds of pants is when my grandpa was young and part of the hippie movement in 1973.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre 5. \\n\\n\r\nI just have nothing much to say about this category.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7. \\n\\n\r\nOk, the character's involved in this anime are somewhat you'll be irritated on one side but will most appreciated in another, ok, so about Haru, he's probably a guy whom you'll wanna do a ground and pound thing on him co'z he's more like this poster boy for a spouse abuser and he's also too reckless, but on the other hand you'll admire him that eventhough he's a delinquent, he's a delinquent who has both brains (in studying), brawn and certain level of dedication to the people close to him. Shizuka, is one ordinary mind my own business type of study bug whom you'll wish that she go for Yamaken instead of going for Haru, but you'll be a bit irritated by her seemly cold attitude towards the people around her.  There is also that part where you wish that a romantic arc develops between Sasayan and Asako, but unfortunately it don't look like that it's gonna happen, however I also see a potential for a Sasayan X Chizuru arc, then again like that's gonna happen.\\n\r\nGoing back to Haru, so he does provide the comedy aspect of this anime, but for him to be in a relationship with either Shizuka or Chizuru.......I kinda hate seeing it, to me I find him a someone who should be in a correction facility than  having a romantic relationship. I wonder what the hell was that chicken doing in this anime? Cluck! Cluck!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nthe enjoyment part of this anime revolves around as to what will Haru do next or what crazy thing does Haru up to order to satisfy his insecurity with his relationship with Shizuka. Overall, this anime is a combination of one irritation with Haru for being an insecure asshole and the ice cold study bug Shizuka. However it is good that their opposites attract one another.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, It's time for dinner, I'll be having fried chicken tonight. CLUCK! CLUCK!\\n",

            "content": "From the first episode you might think that its another shoujo about a CRAZY delinquent boy getting dropped into a studious girl's lap, and might lose interest. However I think Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is unique in that it doesn't try to make it's lead male into this delinquent boy who happens to be percieved wrong by all of his classmates, and is actually deep down a sweetheart who is a hero with all of his morals in the right place. In Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun Haru (the male lead) is literally an almost sociopath, minus the fact that he hasn't actually killed anyone, yet, and allof his classmates have had the time to acknowledge this. Although there are plenty of shonen that have made comedic use of following an \"evil\" delinquent boy who has messed up morals like beelzebub and kyou kara ore wa, its quite rare in shoujo and I think the story of Shizuku (the female lead) reaching out to this troubled boy (out of obligation at first) is sweet and also hilarious and worth watching. \\n\r\nOften art in shoujo has a particular style that is hard to transfer to anime successfully. However I think its obvious that this anime had the funds to make their art work properly and there weren't as many \"chibi\" + flowers scenes which are generally often present in shoujo, so it made this anime more realistic and watchable for me.\\n\r\nI gave sound a high score because there are these \"classy\" characters that go to an expensive all boys school, and every time they show up/mess up/ do something silly it plays this public domain classical music and its hilarious. (they make use of the public domain music because of the lack of funding, it was correctly placed and super funny).\\n\r\nCharacter wise Haru and maybe also his brother are the most in depth more 3 dimensional characters, who get tens because its hard to write an manga/anime character that is 3-D. The rest of the characters are more two dimensional, however some of them are 2-D for a reason. Shizuku is a girl that does nothing but study, which is unrealistic, however it probably reminds many girls with maybe good but not perfect grades of themselves in high school, who might regret being too serious. Although if there's no crazy delinquent beau around too force you into a less serious strain of activities, there is no crazy delinquent beau around. (There wasn't for me, and I happen to be attending a good college, but like most girls I like to watch anime in which characters, who are either very similar too me, or only have one trait because they are 2-D and thus easy to relate to, get to experience something more romantic.)\\n\r\nI really like anime and manga that are humorous and I tend to not like a shoujo unless it's stupid funny in a good way, I enjoyed this anime a lot and would recommend it to other people.\\n",

            "content": "It's hard to find a romance/comedy/slice of life that really leaves a good impression.  Tonari no Kaibutsu-Kun does exactly that and for those of you who have already seen Lovely Complex and/or Honey and Clover it gives you some traits from each of those shows and adds it's own flavor into the mix as well.\r\nStory- This is the weakest point of the series, however it's not so weak that it provides no interest or doesn't evoke any emotion from you.  It's simple and laid out right in front of your eyes within the first two episodes essentially.  That being said though, thereare a few kinks in the story along the way that give you something to think about.  So while it is the weakest point of the series, it also has it's strong point, and does enough with the core plot to move things along nicely at a solid pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt-  The art was a hair away from a ten, but I just couldn't do it so it wasn't meant to be i guess.  Anyway, it really was my favorite part of the show and I've only thought this about maybe three anime I've ever watched.  For the art to really have such an impact on the characters and story is really special I think.  The pleasant background ambiance and bright, sometimes exotic colors give the scenery personality and a location as simple as their popular spot \"the batting cages\" suddenly becomes unique and colorful because of it.  \\n\\n\r\nSounds-  The OP is one of my favorites and the full length version of it is an extremely catchy song, not to mention a solid ED.  There's a somewhat surreal feel to the background sounds i only mentioned in the \"art\" section of the review and immediately provide you with an engrossing feel that sucks you into what's going on.  Every sounds seems to fit just right and because of this it all flows so naturally.  Finally, the voice actors (or seiyuu) do a fantastic job portraying their character's attitude and feeling in various situation be it good or bad ones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  At first they may seem like typical rom/com cookie cutter type characters but you'll be quickly proven wrong in that regard.  It's not as though we haven't ever seen these characters before in this genre, but the way they're executed is what makes them so enthralling to watch.  Haru is best compared to a wilder Morita (if that's believable for those who've watched Honey and Clover) he's more violent and protective you could say.  That said, he's extremely passionate in everything he does as well as having nothing but pure intentions.  He's very funny and extremely intelligent, and just an overall interesting character that is well designed based on who he is as well.  Shizuku is a character that takes a little bit of developing for her to break out of her shell, and it works for the setting and story.  You really get to see her grow with Haru and the other supporting characters slowly but it never truly gets tiresome as it's not your typical whiny self-conscious high school girl questioning her life/love every few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  Needless to say I rather enjoyed this, and I'll be sure to re-watch it eventually.  I higly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the anime I mentioned above, as well as anyone interested in a good romance told in a slightly different yet charming way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- It's a 9/10 like above the only reason it doesn't get 10/10 is because I believe you need to really go far above and beyond your genre and all other genres for that matter.  This is definitely one of the best rom/com/slice of life iIve seen.  This is also a perfect type of anime to get those who are just starting to pique their interest in this genre.  At only 13 episodes it progresses nicely, and it doesn't have those cringe-worthy overly dramatic moments some romances have, so it's easier for someone new to the genre to dived in without worries.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The anime is about a girl named Shizuku Mizutani who has grew up without any friends. Instead of making friends, this girl would rather study and try to be the smartest girl in class. She would act cold towards people and she doesn\u2019t really care for most things. She is so extreme that people started calling her \u201cDry Ice\u201d. One day, Shizuku was asked to deliver some homework to a classmate named Haru Yoshida. Haru is a troublemaker and he loves getting into fights. Shizuku was shocked to discover one of the school\u2019s toughest guys to actually be desperate for friends and he has gaineda strange liking towards Shizuku. So now, a girl with very little experience about making friends is suddenly being befriended by a guy who would scare people away just by glaring at them. Shizuku has a tough front but it would seem Haru caught her attention. What\u2019s a girl to do when Haru suddenly started saying declaring his love for you? For Dry Ice, it was a new experience but this love thing isn\u2019t exactly one sided. Or is it?\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the anime instantly grabs you. There is a girl who has no care for anything except her studies and a guy who is a brute but a gentle misunderstood soul. Their interaction was pretty fun to watch since the girl is the only person that can get close to the guy and the guy is annoying the hell out of the girl. Little by little though, the relationship of the two gradually grows into something that is really adorable. The anime is pretty straight forward pretty much focusing on this story alone. That\u2019s right. There are no other love stories in the anime. Or rather, the anime was still building up one but it was surely not as important as the main love story. This was great thing because the story of the two characters is really fun to watch and their story might seem straight forward at first, but it eventually reveals some surprises you never expected the show to do.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not perfect and one of the reasons is because the primary focus of the show is the love story yet it was thinly spread out throughout the anime. There is a decent progression but the relationship of the characters are often dreadfully dragged that nothing satisfactory comes out of it. Majority of the episodes have the relationship on stand still going absolutely nowhere and you wait for a decent resolution only to be sorely disappointed. It was cute but thirteen episodes are too long for something cute that doesn\u2019t have much to tell. Towards the second half, the pace died down and the focus was shift towards something else. At first I was glad that there is only one love story in the anime so it can develop the story some more but towards the end, the show fizzled out. The love story that grabbed you halted midway and snail paced its way to the ending. The characters stopped developing to compensate the immediate halt of the story and the focus was shifted to another thing. This is sadly, a typical Shoujo thing. I swear to God the whole anime is a manga lure. These are anime that stops the story so blatantly that it urges you to read the manga. It\u2019s not really bad because anime fans are now familiar with the medium. The problem is that the anime had no decent ending. It basically slammed the door in your face with the sign hanging on it that said: read the manga.",

            "content": "So, I have somewhat weird routines in the morning. I need to yotube-surfs for at least one hour before start my day. It is when I found an interesting anime scene in someone amv. It's when a black-haired guy lick his girl's hands in stairs. This scene succesfully make me do some research in Google. And I found it, an awesome romcom anime named Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun.\r\nStory - 5/10\r\nSorry... but i can't find anything new in this whole series. A violent guy who got tamed by a shy girl. Too focus girl on studying who defeated by a \"never-studying boy\". A girl who didn't cometo class in her first week and end up having no friends. There's too much clich\u00e9 in this series. But, I don't take it seriously because it's romcom anime. It doesn't really annoying because what makes romcom anime fun and hilarious is the characters.\\n\\n\r\nBut again, this series storyflow is too classic for me. Let's say Strangers > Be friend > Vague relationship > Rival show up > Jealousy > Clash between them. Ugh, i have watch too much romance story looks like this. And for me, it's boring. One aspect which makes me finish this series beside dropping is, i love the characters. Shizuku and Haru saves this show for me.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, there are so many scene that makes me giggle and laugh. I just can't forget how they meet for the first time. xD\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters is what makes this show entertaining. Our 2 main characters, Haru and Shizuku, have unique personality. And as this show has a strong start, it makes the characters well-developed. How Haru and Shizuku changed from \"socially awkward\" to person who understand others is simply beautiful. I love how they complement each other.\\n\\n\r\nOne more aspect, the consistency of the characters. Even after all the teenage problems, they still be who they are. Shizuku with her score-on-top-of-everything, and Haru with his violence personality. I found it cool how the author makes his/her characters realistic. After all, natural behaviour isn't something easily changed in short span of time.\\n\\n\r\nVisual - 7/10\\n\r\nFor me, there's a huge gap between visual for action anime and visual for romcom anime. In romcom, we don't need battle scene or fluid movement. As long as it can helps building emotion, it will pass my criteria. That's why I have different parameter for this two genres. Okay, just forget my bullshit. I just pretending to be smart. xD\\n\\n\r\nVisual is something who support from the background, something who support build up emotion. In this show, it was nicely done. The character designs are great. And the art is impressive. There are so many funny faces in this show which makes me laugh, lol.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 7/10\\n\r\nI must admit that the opening song are typical shoujo anime (I don't watch it that much, though) and it's pretty average. And for the ending... ugh, I'm the type who close-before-ending-song person. But before I make this review, i watch it once and my thoughts are the same. Like the opening, it is an average ending song.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, I appreciate the soundtrack. I love how it makes funny scene funnier, and romantic scene more romantic. It helps build-up emotion in an elegant way.\\n\\n\r\nOkay that's it! Thank you for your time and attention. See you in my next review. ;p\\n",

            "content": "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun: It's Not My Little Monster\r\nI'm actually somewhat speechless at how underwhelming this series is. Skin deep, it's a pretty decent series with an interesting cast of characters, a somewhat intriguing plot in regards to Haru's back story, and has some rather amusing character interaction. However, I'd be lying to myself if I didn't call Tonari a disappointment. This series reminded me of a teenager going through puberty. It's so full of potential but it's just so damn awkward in quite a few ways.\r\nThe story of Tonari revolves around Shizuku, a rather studious girl that does nothing but study so that she getsthe best grades. She has no friends and has no interest in friends until one day, her teacher asks her to drop off some worksheets for Haru, a rebellious boy in her class that is serving a suspension for getting into a fight at school. However, as soon as the two meet, Haru becomes obsessed with Shizuku, essentially falling in love with her almost as soon as they meet. Hijinx ensue as the two of them have \"difficulties\" bonding, although still maintain a friendship/relationship throughout the series as well as make new friends. \\n\\n\r\nThat leads me to the characters, which were probably the strongest part of this series. Besides the two leads, we're introduced to Natsume, a beautiful troubled girl that struggles with interpersonal interaction but loves social networking, Sasayama, an eccentric baseball loving friend of Haru's from middle school, Chizuru, a shy girl that develops a crush for Haru after he stands up for her, and Kenji, a rather arrogant boy who associates himself with Haru but has his own clique of friends as well as develops an attraction for Shizuku. For the most part, there are many supporting characters in this series, each with their own groups. There are several other supporting characters such as Mitsuyoshi, Haru's uncle and Yuuzan, Haru's brother. While I found the characters to be strong in their presentation, I found the development of those characters to be lacking...severely. As this series progressed, I wanted to know more about the troubled relationship between Haru, Yuuzan, and their father. I wanted to know how Mitsuyoshi and Kyouko (not spoiling this) played a role in that. I wanted to know more about Shizuku's own rather odd family situation. Hell, I just wanted to know more about the entire supporting cast in general. However, instead of focusing on these things, the writers brush it off for more odd character interactions that mostly lead to nothing. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I had with this series was just how awkward it was with it's character interaction. While I know I said it was one of the strengths of the series, it was also one of the weaknesses. The relationship between Haru and Shizuku is just bizarre, mostly because they often change their minds about how they feel about each other. While I'm aware that considering they are both awkward individuals in the first place, it was rather confusing how both would tell each other how much they love each other during the series, but then nothing would happen and they'd act like they would break up. Honestly, it was hard to follow where the series was going with it. If nothing else, it made things kind of frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have complained about the characters development, I think where the series falls short with it was how it was paced. The pacing was just awful and a lot of the situations the characters would get into were quite forgettable. For example, I barely remember anything actually happening in the final three episodes. There were stretches during this series that were just so bland and so forgettable it makes me wonder why the writers didn't even try to delve into the character back stories. That's what was weird about this series. You could sort of feel how the characters felt toward each other when they interacted, but what was even happening in the story was forgettable. It seemed like it was essentially leading to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't say Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is a bad series. The characters were a lot of fun to watch and some of the interactions were downright hilarious. However, this series fell very short in it's story progression and character development...it showed. This series was downright awkward because it wasn't very strong for a comedy, it had dramatic elements that it seemed it barely wanted to touch upon, and the romance is very passive. This series essentially had a genre identity crisis, even though it tried to make it obvious that this was a romance series. It has me at a loss for who I'd recommend it to. If you like a mild romance with a couple that has a unique chemistry about them, I guess I'd recommend this. Unfortunately, while I want to say this would be an interesting series to watch, I cannot give it the strongest of recommendations. This is a series that is setup for a 2nd season and it badly needs one. I feel that if this series does have a 2nd season that cleans up what the 1st season left behind, it's worth a watch. However, until then, I'd say wait on watching this series until a 2nd season is released if you do plan on eventually watching this.",

Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun pretty much masters what it is supposed to be a shoujo rom-com slice of life.  \r\nThe characters act like high schoolers. The love is awkward at times because, that's exactly what's it's supposed to be, awkward love between awkward members of society. The main characters are social misfits with social ineptitude. What ensues make sense. This is where the comedy aspect comes in. The take this awkward approach to love to showcase the hilarity of how out of normthe characters are and used to poke fun at cliches. It definitely kept me laughing. But the slice of life aspect remains strong; the characters continue living on as normal. Rather than showcasing secret illicit romance rendezvous to hot springs, or other unbelievable likewise situations, like so many other high school romance animes do, they showcase the characters doing things like studying or just hanging out with one another. There are moments that make you laugh, that tug at your heart, that make you say \"aw\", just like real life.\\n\\n\r\nFor technical aspects the art is very good, and smooth flowing. I personally really favor the soundtrack of this anime. The main song has just a beautiful nostalgic feel to it. \\n",

            "content": "Bad boy meets lonely girl rom-coms are nothing new--they occasionally make for good comfort food, but having been done to death the way they have it's rare to find a series that's willing to look at its characters honestly rather than just putting an attractive loner on display to get the fawning fangirls a-squealin'. Thankfully, My Little Monster not only averts many of the stale stereotypes associated with its tired premise, it manages to make its leads some of the most believably lonely and isolated characters I've ever seen in a good long time. Love them or hate them, but we've all known kids likeShizuku and Haru. Some of us probably were those kids. Better still, they complement one another remarkably well, each filling in the other's deficiencies in surprisingly clever ways. This little gem of a series really does go to surprising lengths to set itself apart.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one word to describe the visuals of this series, it's colorful. The backgrounds and character designs are bright and lively, and yet they never stray so far from reality that it becomes a barrier against seeing these characters as real people. The animation itself isn't particularly high-end, presumably because it's adapted from a relatively little-known source manga, but it's good enough to get the job done. On a whole the show has a charming, playful aesthetic that's still earthy enough that it doesn't detract from the show's dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of this show's high points. It can dive into over-the-top territory with rowdy and energized blaring trumpets, only to turn around and perfectly accent a sentimental, contemplative moment with soft strings, hitting just the right level of sensitivity without ever coming across as corny. It's a tough task to pull off, made no less difficult by the dichotomous nature of the content. Suffice it to say that there's not a second in this show that doesn't deliver musically. On a side note, am I the only one who got a Peanuts vibe from a few of the show's quirkier pieces, because I swear the resemblance is uncanny.\\n\\n\r\nBad news for the dub lovers out there, this show is currently unlicensed, but I'm pleased to say that the Japanese track will fill your needs just fine. I have to give the voice actors credit for managing to bounce between over-the-top silliness and grounded drama without a hitch, often managing to carry their characters with surprising subtlety. I have a hard time critiquing a language I don't speak, but I still find Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Haru to be a pretty impressive stand-out performance. From his aggressive side to his silly blunt honesty to his thoughtful, serious side, Suzuki manages to tie them all together into one memorable main character and make it sound like the most natural thing in the world.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Haru, he's definitely not your typical male rom-com lead. Rather than the brooding, stone-faced rocks we're used to, he actively fawns over Shizuku to the point of obsession. Naturally, this makes him an enormous pain-in-the-ass to Shizuku, who's used to being left alone and doesn't know how to cope with the attention. Actually, Shizuku herself is much nearer the stereotypical male lead I just described, but she still carries just a hint of suppressed femininity. She's much more grounded in conventional sensibilities than Haru, but just as unsure of how to act in social situations. She keeps her head down and is more interested in grades than guys (or so she tells herself), and it irritates her to no end that Haru, who seems like a complete buffoon, tops her test scores effortlessly. Haru, by contrast, wants to make friends with all his heart, but his brash nature scares people away, and those who do choose to hang around him tend to have ulterior motives, furthering his general mistrust for those around him. He generally gets into fights for the right reasons, but that's not how the people around him see it. Both characters are plagued by loneliness, but for completely different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nNot that this show is all sentimental and serious all the time. Far from it, most of the show is actually really lighthearted and silly, built around Haru's antics getting on Shizuku's nerves, their friend Natsume overreacting and panicking when things get out-of-hand, etc. Thanks to the show's charming direction it's almost never too dark or uncomfortable (notice I said almost, but we'll get to that later). The style of humor, like many other things about this show, is refreshingly grounded, like the kind of silliness that happens between real friends bouncing off of each other naturally, while still injecting a little extra silliness as only anime can. Much like Princess Jellyfish, a lot of effort was put into making this show warm and welcoming, and even the secondary characters have some genuine effort put into them, particularly their new friend Natsume and Haru's old friend Kenji, both of whom start out as borderline stereotypes but grow into complex, flawed yet strong characters in their own rights over the course of the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one problem with creating truly believably flawed characters, it's that it becomes very hard to give such characters proper catharsis and making such an ending feel deserved. Haru in particular is a daunting character to work with, constantly straddling the line between a misguided but good-natured boy... and a borderline psycho-path. In the first episode he actually threatened to rape Shizuku, but it was so thoroughly tongue-in-cheek and he said it with such barefaced innocence that I couldn't help but wonder if he even knew how to insert Tab A into Slot B. Later that same episode he accidentally hurt Shizuku in a moment of passion while trying to come to her rescue, but she gave him a firm scolding for it and it seemed like he'd learned his lesson. And yet as the story progresses and we dig deeper into his pit of problems, he becomes progressively harder to sympathize with because by the end it's unclear whether he's made any progress from who he was at the start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI have a no-spoilers policy, and I think it's worked pretty well for me up to this point, but for this review it's hard to explain just how badly the show messes up his character arc without giving away a detail that comes up later in the story. Let's just say that there's one moment, you'll know it when you see it, where Haru comes dangerously close to crossing a moral event horizon. It was creepy and disturbing (heck, I'd actually related to his character up to that point), and then they never bring it up again. Once again, we're plagued with the problem of a series that's adapted from ongoing source material. Maybe they address it later on in the manga, maybe they don't, but either way it wasn't addressed in the show and that's what I'm reviewing. Shizuku's character arc is somewhat more refined in execution, but still a little too open-ended for comfort, especially in the context of her relationship with Haru, which constantly waffles about in typical will they or won't they fashion. By the end Natsume felt more like the heart of the story than either of them, she had a much stronger grasp on what's important in life. The conclusion was inconclusive and open-ended, saved only by the show's strong direction, which somehow managed to remain consistently charming from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most frustrating things a story can do is to reach for greatness and then stop halfway, and that's exactly what My Little Monster does. After putting so much effort into building up a realistically screwed up character, the show falls into the \"crap, I'm an adaptation\" pitfall and stops before it can help him out of the pit he's in. Still, its strong characterization cannot be ignored, and coupled with its strong atmosphere I think the show has enough going for it to merit a watch and hope for a second season.",

            "content": "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun [My Little Monster] is a Rom-Com that fails to deliver. It continues to go in circles while not coming forth and facing its problems. At the same time showing us meaningless love interest with the side characters. Will they? Won't they? Why haven't they?\r\nIt's a decent at most. I just fail to see, why others give it such high praise. If you enjoy, \u2018Rom-Com; than this is for you. Be warned 'Abuse' and 'Odd' situations ahead. I\u2019m a bit dumbfounded how I wasn\u2019t able to enjoy. I love Romances but when watching this one, I found myself struggling at times and leavingbriefly hoping I'd enjoy it later. The first episode was a great step forward towards on establishing a relationship but only took more steps back if anything. Never doing anything.\\n\\n\r\nA bit of spoilers a head. Gomensai. Read at your own risk.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe show is centered on Haru and Shizuku as they form a peculiar friendship of their own. From episode one, we're told Haru has a thing for Shizuku. Insisting to her that he \u2018Loves\u2019 her. Only to get rejected right there and then. There was no establishment that they were even good friends before hand but it was promising start nonetheless. As we got to see how their bond and relationship beginnings to form and unfold before our eyes. Both of them are stubborn as they try to come out their shells while making friendships with their classmates mainly Masahiro and Sasahara. I'm left at awe at times how some of the side characters fall in love with others just because of a simple action or meaningless small talk. \\n\\n\r\nWhen others try to give advice to Shizuku and Haru, I fail to see where they\u2019re coming. Feels forced, in hopes of only advancing the main love interest. There were cringe worthy moments, that could be questioned as abusive. Just a heads up.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:  7 | 6\\n\\n\r\nThe animation does have it's drop in qualities but it isn't too apparent. I like the characters designs for just about everyone, giving them all a distinct look. It's music does fit the tone at times during it's more dramatic situations which I found to be pleasant. However, the Opening and Ending OST aren\u2019t really all that great in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\\n\r\nHaru is the most intriguing character from the start and the driving force of the show. Lively, hot-headed, with a full head of steam. It's surprising how they don't address the fact that he enjoys, beating and wealing on others. That should have been more of focus rather than comedic relief. I didn't find it that funny, when he wailed on some people, which included his love interest at times.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Haru can be so dense and gullible. It blows my mind how a prodigy when it comes to exams can be like that. He\u2019s always seems to make act without giving it much thought on how it might affect others.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku is the studyholic placing it above anything or anyone else. Let it be family or friends, studying comes first. Through the progression of the show, she opens up to others but has great difficulty when it comes to Haru. She can\u2019t seem to figure him like her homework problems; they\u2019re are simple while he\u2019s a complex problem to her. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, I didn't find the side characters all that appealing. None then did anything to stick out. All were bland and poorly written. We have Natsume who the \u2018Baka\u2019 and the annoyance of the show. Due to her poor choices of posting on internet forums. Sasahara is just their to give advice if anything else while being a comedy relief. The show didn\u2019t let the side characters develop at all that much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nI found myself trying to watch this anime but had myself struggling often at times. The most I got out of it were from Haru goofy actions and behavior.  \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts/Overall: 5\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an unfinished Anime than this is the one for you. It a poor adaption which was made for watchers to read the Manga. It only rose questions like, \"Will those two end up together?\". Nothing was ever adress through the series. It set itself up for a Season 2 that won't likely come.",

I personally enjoy watching anime that goes in chronological order, and runs through as one big time line, so for me, this anime wasn't so good. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe art was good, but there isn't much to say about this, other than the graphics were high and very clear, although, the producers should work on the scenery and background, but overall, the art was good. \r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nThe actress for Mizutani did a good job expressing her true side of being serious when it came to studying.The other characters were average, but it was still good. I didn't really 'enjoy' listening to the opening and ending of this anime either, but the background music during the scenes of the anime were well put together.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe characters were very hard to understand. I couldn't understand what they were really thinking and what their thoughts were, especially Natsume. She was a very mysterious person that I never really understood. Other characters were well drawn and animated, although they went a little extra when it game to extra body movement, like the animation of one being frightened or scared.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nEven though this anime was 13 episodes, it felt like it took forever to finish, meaning that I didn't really enjoy this anime much at all. I finished watching it couple minutes ago, and I already forgot 95% of the things that just occurred in this anime. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nIf I had the chance to watch this anime again, I won't. I'm pretty sure if I watched it again, I would fall asleep watching it. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n7/10 because I'm nice.",

I have actually seen a screenshot posted on a social networking with a boy holding a girl and covering his mouth saying \"One peek and I rape you\".\r\nIn short I became curious and asked what anime was it taken from. And they answered Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun. As I began watching it, the anime is far from what I expected! (I expected it to be somewhat ecchi because of the screenshot.). But no, it was not ecchi and yet I fell in love with it making it the top anime of lastseason.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a socially challenged girl who cares nothing about but her grades and she is paired with an innocent troublemaker(ironic indeed). But the pairing worked out. The story may not be unique but the way the author develops the plot is really refreshing and is what you should look out for. The combination of comedy and romance without nudity and harem is exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design were also great! The quality may not standout at first but upon continuous watching, you will definitely fall in love with them especially Shizuku and Natsume.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, how can I describe it, it is awesome and near perfect. The sound is appropriate for the scenes. And it comes with different versions, at one scene they will play a piano version and on the next episode a guitar version of the same wondeful song plays. The soundtrack in the beginning of episode 3 is my personal favorite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Do I need to say more? Yes, I super enjoyed watching this anime. This made me a fan of the Rom Com genre. The plot progression is superb and I never failed to watch it upon release.\\n\\n\r\nYes. It is a perfect ten, from the story down to enjoyment. It seems like everything went perfect for this anime.

I really find the whole anime amusing especially when it involves an opposites attract kind of thing. Though I do admit that I'm probably one of those who share the same dislike for Haru, but then again he kinda carries the overall performance of this anime. However there was still that situation that wewould have wish that the character's would have been paired off with the right combination. Bueno, I think it's time that I present my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nGOOD 7:\\n\\n\r\nStory- I like the opposite attract thing the evolves tow unlikely character between a bad boy like Haru and a serious study bug like Shizuka. Though most of the scenario always involves Haru's insecurities and Shizuka's cold demeanor it does provide the direction that this anime was going.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- what makes it enjoyable is the even-thought the relationship between Haru and Shizuka is somewhat you would love to break it apart, it was still something that one will appreciate that the two seemly do go together as perfect opposites. But there was also the part where I wish that Sasayan would have also had a relationship with Asako.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Studio Brain's Base really did focus on the opposites attract genre, and director Hiro Kaburaki gave it more emphasis that it could have been much better if the supporting character's Sasayan and Asako could have been a good love team, but alas more focus was given on the conflicts that happens between Haru, Shizuka and Yamaken, then again no romance would be complete with out some party interfering which overall this anime deserves a seven.\\n\\n\r\nPOOR 3:\\n\\n\r\nArt- I really hated the illustrator's sense of fashion when it comes to the boy's uniform, though I would have forgiven the upper garment, it was the trousers that I hate, kinda have the retro 60's look. As for Shizuka, I would never understand as to why she was made to look dorky in plain clothes but cool in a school uniform, overall I really don't like how the illustrator's art for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- I be really honest, I like the VA's who did the character's but the songs whether it's the opening or the closing- I just hate it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFAIR 6:\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- at one point one would hate both Haru and Shizuka, Haru strikes me a bad boy who has the potential to be a boyfriend from hell,  which if he'll be in a relationship with me I'll make sure that I give him more than hell so much so that his grandchildren would feel it, beside like I said I'm not the type who allows a man to tell me what to do. Shizuka, is somewhat a kind of character that you'll admire for taking her studies seriously but there is one point that I would have wanted to whack her on the head with a hard paper fan for being too cold and inconsiderate. Asako, if I where her mom I would have confiscated her devices and smashed them in front of her. Now, since there are character's here that I admire like Sasayan, Yamaken, Chizuru and  Mitsuyoshi so even if the previously mentioned characters are somewhat you'll hate at one point but like in another point the , it was the after mentioned characters that made me give this category a rating of six.\\n\\n\r\nCARAMBA Y ARIBA!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "Romantic comedy is one of the most sought after genres of modern day. Tonari is a great example of this genre. Filled with enjoyment, hilarious laugh out loud moments and a good story, this anime does not disappoint. \r\nShizuku, a hard working student has her complete focus on her studies. She doesn't care for socializing and is content with getting the highest grades. Haru, on the other hand is a guy most feared in the school. His violent tendencies and domineering expression terrorize people and so he is deemed a loner. When Shizuku's teacher asks her to deliver an assignment to Haru, he thinks hehas made a freind in Shizuku. And then, surprising to all those watching, he confesses his love for her.\\n\\n\r\nAs their relationship developes, Shizuku's cold and uptight personality begins to change and Haru finds himself among friends who can look past his scary exterior and witness the purity of his heart.\\n\\n\r\nTonari is a very enjoyable anime. This is not a lovestory in which the main protogonists spend hours pining over the other. There aren't 'love me -love me not' insecure moments plundering all common sense in their minds. No, the straight forward nature of the characters is very refreshing. If they have something to share, they are quick to tell the other and so there is no room for frustrating misunderstandings. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime unlike most romance animes has granted it's characters with proper character development.  They all have a background story and a reason for how they act the way they do. The main hero and heroine are not completely obsessed with each other, instead they have a sound relationship with other people too. \\n\\n\r\nHaru is a very lovable character. He is very stubborn and persistent in what he wants and in this case he wants Shizuku. His genuine love for her is so adorable that numerous times I found my self unable to stop the involuntary 'awws' slipping from my mouth.\\n\r\nShizuku, a smart and highly independent girl is also a pleasant change from the shoujo heroines of the norm. Her mind isn't subdued with indecision and she doesn't let petty matters ruffle her, ofcourse the matter of Haru is different. She finds herself wanting to be in his company and caring for him.\\n\\n\r\nEven though, the love confessions our sprung quiet early in the anime, the love story is not rushed. Haru and Shizuku clash multiple times and yet they find their way back to each other.\\n\r\nThe art is good and the characters are easy on the eyes. The opening song is a typical shoujo anime opening song but the main background song is really good. It has a bittersweet feel to it that gives you a sense of nostalgia.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it is a fairly enjoyable anime, perfect for fans of romantic-comedy.\\n\\n",

Viewers think she's annoying coz she keeps changing her mind about the guy when they should just be kissing already, but this is actually what I really like about her. She doesn't rush into a relationship and actually think things through. \r\nOut of all the shoujo characters out there, she's the most realistic and practical. She's a strong independent woman who actually cares about her future, while other shoujo heroines have their heads up in the clouds all the time thinking about love. Like, these girls are still in high school!!! My gods, focus on yourstudies or you might end up making babies too early, not getting a job, and dying poor.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku is a strong woman, and this is why Haru falls in love with her.\\n\\n\r\nHaru, on the other hand, is a really surprising and eccentric character. At first, I thought the story was gonna be about a typical delinquent falls in love with a nerd trope, but there's actually so much more to it. Haru is the complete opposite of Shizuku in terms of personality (though, later on in the manga, it is revealed that he already has everything Shizuku wants), but this doesn't stop the two of them from being attracted to each other.\\n\\n\r\nTonari no Kaibutsu-kun has very vivid characters. Top it off with some good ol' comedy, what's not there to love?",

            "content": "My Little Monster is an amazing anime that started off with great potential, but finished with a very open and ambiguous conclusion. \r\nWhat makes the show so effective is its realism. Each character has very distinct personalities. Shizuku is strong-willed, independent, and very blunt and cold at times. This clashes with Haru's eccentric, open, and clingy personality. The show gets its charm in the beginning, by showing two characters with clashing personalities learning and growing from one another. Shizuku teaches Haru how to control his emotions. She teaches him to smile, to stop picking fights (or at least try), and to restrain his constant needfor her affection. In turn, Shizuku learns that there is enjoyment beyond studying. Haru's loyalty, lighthearted nature, and unconditional care for Shizuku opens her to feelings of affection. \\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning there are some truly wonderful moments: when Haru professes his love for Shizuku, when he kisses her by surprise, when Shizuku awakes on Haruku's lap and enjoys the moment instead of going to class, and when Shizuku professes her love for Haru again. These are incredibly moving moments, but the fire dies down as the two become lost in opposing expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe later episodes are interesting and fun, but there is no real progression in story. This is an excellent representation of Haru and Shizuku's relationship, but can become dull for the viewer. The two are lost, as most young lovers are. Shizuku truly loves Haru, but expects a quiet laid-back relationship, but Haru's dependency issues make him clingy and obnoxious. Haru, also lost as to what it means to be in a relationship expects Shizuku to be more attentive and responsive to him, instead feeling ignored by Shizuku's studying. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime has excellent art, music, characters, and story. It is one of my favorite shows because of its realism, comedy, and heart-touching moments. However, by the end the audience feels unfulfilled, much like the characters. Shizuku summarizes their relationship by saying \"Why? Why do we keep clashing? I'm guessing that we're out of sync somehow, but I don't know how to fix it. I don't know the right answer.\" Like her practice problems, she expects a simple answer, but is lost when she can't find one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend this anime, although you may feel unfulfilled toward the end. I doubt there will be a second season because I believe the producers want to leave the future open for viewer interpretation. In the real world, the two would have good moments and bad. they would learn and grow through their relationship, but more than likely their differences will put a strain on their love and they'll drift apart. I was honestly hoping to see Haru profess his love for Oshima to make Shizuku upset, or to crush her academically to provoke her. This is how I think the characters would at in real life, especially over time. But by leaving the ending open and vague, viewers can interpret the characters and their motivations and growth for themselves, leaving the possibility for a happy ending for all.",

The pacing is a little awkward and the ending leaves much to be desired since there are so many loose ends let unresolved or untouched. At the same time, I guess it kinda suits it. The plot is a bit jumpy and the main love interest goes back and forth, but sometimes real life can be like that too, so out of this anime's many faults, I can't list that as one of them.\r\nI just wish there was more done to explorethe characters to give some of them a bit more dimension. There quite a few that felt like they weren't characters, but just distracting background noise that didn't help move the plot except for one moment, and that was only when they were first introduced. Again, this is a pretty average anime that's best to not get your hopes up about when watching since there's some tension that builds up, but never gets resolved and more or less forgotten about a couple episodes later.",

            "content": "\"Why do you build me up buttercup, baby just to let me down?\"\r\nIs it just me or do those old song lyrics describe this anime quite aptly? It's a show that seems to promise to break all the conventions of a typical romance anime in its opening episodes, only to end up in the same place.\r\n\"Tonari no Totoro-kun\" is the story of this furry monster named Totoro who lives next to\u2026 oh hang on, wrong anime! *leafs through the notes* Ahh yes, here it is: \"Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\" is the story of this non-furry monster of a human named Haru who strikes up an unlikelyfriendship with his classmate, the cold and studious Shizuku.\\n\\n\r\nI took an immediate liking to \"Tonai no Kaibutsu-kun\". Its art style appeals to me, it's funny and charming, and the characters are interesting as individuals, but even more interesting when thrown together. The main girl Shizuka is unusually cold and analytical for a female character and struggles to display affection and other kinds of tender emotion. On the other side, we have Haru, who's a monster in the sense that he's wild, impulsive and often violent \u2026 and yet at the same time he's remarkably intelligent and open with his feelings. When you have these as the leading pair, then crazy things are bound to happen.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more, \"Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\" starts out determined to set itself apart from other romance anime. Do you get frustrated that the lead pair in these kind of shows are always dragging things out, never expressing their feelings for one another and keep leaving you wondering \"Will They? Won't They?\" until the very last episode or even beyond? Well here's a show where you don't even need to wait for the second episode to see a first kiss and a confession. By episode 3, this anime has covered enough ground for others shows of the genre to last the whole season. Where can it possibly go from there, I found myself wondering.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out the answer it gives is disappointingly similar to what we've all seen so many times before: nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nIf the typical romantic plot is like shuffling a couple of steps forward followed by a couple of steps back, then \"Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\" is like running very fast in big circle instead, recycling the plot points of its earlier episodes over and over again until it reached its episode count.\\n\\n\r\nThe result is, of course, the same. Is \"Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\" a better anime for taking an unconventional way to get to the same place as most others of its type? Probably not. I think this is partly due to its short length - the frustration of seeing the same thing over and over is, if anything, worse than seeing an anime drag its feet over the course of a 13 episode run. The sheer pace of the story required to sustain the short cycles also means that the anime feels a bit too plot driven - the twists and turns often undercuts the development of the characters and made them feel superficial.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're wondering why I don't rate this show lower, it's because at the episodic level, I still mostly enjoyed it. Even as the overarching plot became increasingly convoluted, I still found it entertaining to watch. And while the recurring plot points were predictable, I never quite knew what will happen in any given episode. I do think \"Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\" is a good anime but I'm really frustrated and disappointed that it's not a lot better. For an anime that does fulfill its potential, try \"Tonari no Totoro-kun\". Except the two anime aren't remotely similar.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating: +1.0 (good)",

            "content": "This is a really sweet and yet down to earth romantic comedy.While in other anime the protagonists are actively seeking out love, be it in a subtle or extreme manner, the romance in Tonari comes naturally. Mizutani is an interesting lead due to her apathetic attitude towards most things, including romance (which may come off tsunderish to some, but I'd argue against that). She cares more about her academic life than her almost-boyfriend, but not to an exaggerated degree, making her refreshing in comparison to the typical horny teenager protagonist that only thinks about getting laid. As for the second half of the couple, thereisn't much to say about him in comparison. Haru is a run-of-the-mill anime delinquent (that turns out to be the smartest student in school somehow), but he still remains fun to watch and his interactions with Mizutani are the highlight of the series, as you'd expect. All the side characters are very amusing to watch and provide a lot of the show's comedy which is genuinely funny and made me laugh out loud more times than I had anticipated from a RomCom.\\n\\n\r\nA noteworthy aspect of the series that absolutely amazed me was the fact that I found myself rooting for the side characters in the multiple love triangles that appear throughout the series even though they directly obstruct the main couple. Take that as a testament to the character's likeability.\\n\\n\r\nA point that could be viewed as a downside is the fact that the show stays lighthearted for all of its duration and never gets heavy with the drama like most romances. I personally think that made the anime better, but viewers expecting something more intense might get disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is the standard 12 episode length so there isn't much reason not to watch it, even if the ending is inconclusive and begs for a second season that I would most certainly love to see. If you want a serious, drama-filled romance then look for something else, but otherwise Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun has my recommendation.\\n",

Personally I like the manga more, but this is a very funny and overall enjoyable anime. It's got a lot of romance if you someone who's into that. \r\nThe main girl (Shizuku Mizutani) can be very dislikeable at times, but the overall romance is some of the best I've seen in my opinion. I REALLY love Haru Yoshida, he has the best personality throughout the whole anime. He's a huge mystery and it makes you wanna know what happened in his past. Healso acts so stupid, its funny.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, but I think they did kind of a bad job on the end, considering I read the manga and they chose to end the series like that.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Another good anime marred by a blunt ending \u2013  that is my final thought. For what it's worth, Tonari no Kaibustu-kun is a good shojo romance anime. I just feel they could have done so much more with it. At times it felt like they got stuck on 'unnecessary elements', causing a slow paced progression and ultimately unfulfilled ending. Nothing terrible happens, but rather you don't feel that the characters ever reach their expected destinations or got the promised resolution. I was content through the series, being curious how things would end with the various romantic interests; but alas, I feel cheated. I wantedmore.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the main cast, the two protagonists are polar-opposites. Shizuku (female) is calm, introverted and somewhat cold, whilst the Haru (male) is energetic, violent and impulsive. At times Shizuku's incisiveness gets a bit frustrating, but ultimately it serves as contrast between her and Haru's different personalities. Thankfully Shizuku is not a tsundere; I doubt she's any of the familiar 'deres'. Her biggest antagonistic battle is not as much the love interest between her and Haru, but rather the emotional and intellectual battle in her thoughts. Haru's battle is that of patience and undying love for Shizuku's indecisiveness. \\n\\n\r\nI would have given the show an 8, but the blunt ending ruined it for me. I should perhaps give it a 6, but I will judge the show on all its merits \u2013 both good and bad. Ultimately the last episode was a poor choice of script writing. The ending begs for a second series, yet none in sight. Apparently the mange is much more fulfilling. The anime ended while the manga was still being written, hence the poor ending. Reminds me of Ichigo 100% and Great Teacher Onizuka. In both cases the mange was superior because it ended properly. So read the mange after watching the anime. \\n\\n",

Just, 'Oh, well, let's make it the last episode, whatever'.\r\nIt was a nice idea. Not terribly original, but still good. The story line was a little wonky, with all the \"I love you, wait no I don't\", but I didn't really notice it until after. It was funny and sometimes beautifullyromantic. Really ruined only with the ending that wasn't there. At last for me.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say I disregard all the rest.

            "content": "It isn\u2019t very often I can watch a rom-com and genuinely believe the romance between the two main characters, then for the comedy to also not be on the ecchi side and still make me laugh. That\u2019s a pretty good rom-com.\r\nThe Short Version:\r\n(+)They get that kissing shit out in the first episode.\r\n(+)The comedy is pretty alright.\r\n(+)The main character actually thinks like a teenager. (You\u2019ll get what I mean when you watch the show)\r\n(-)Standard rom-com bullshit (Does she like me? Doesn\u2019t he like me?)\r\n(-)The soundtrack is very forgettable.\r\nThe Story (6/10): The story behind this show is an age-old classic. Girls like guy, guy likesgirl, and then we have to sit and watch them run around in a circle for the entire runtime and maybe just MAYBE get to see them kiss in the last episode. Not this show however they get that kiss out-of-the-way in the first episode, but you still have to deal with the endless running around in circles. As annoying as that is this show somehow manages it, and the relentless back and forth isn\u2019t as exhausting as something like Kimi no Todoke (BOOM!) and this is due to the story actually acting like it\u2019s placed in a high school setting, example; A girl says, \u201cI want to touch you.\u201d What the first thing that runs through your brain, it\u2019s that exactly thought that the protagonist thinks in the show and he shows it, so when the girl just puts her hand on his cheek he thinks, \u201cOh that\u2019s what she meant.\u201d See what I mean, the show acts like it\u2019s actually real. Making the back and forth, as I\u2019ve said a couple of times already, a lot more tolerable. In the latter half of the show however there\u2019s an entire sequence of events involving the relationships of a few side character and I can\u2019t help but feel like that\u2019s only there to fill time. The ending, sucks. There\u2019s no sort of romance conclusion with the two leads apart from, \u201cYeah we believe we love each other.\u201d Yeah didn\u2019t figure that out back at episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (7/10): The characters are pretty important considering the genre of the show and I can say that for all intents and purposes the characters fit their roles remarkably well, if differing only a bit from the standard clich\u00e9s.\\n\\n\r\nHaru Yoshida: Intimidating bastard when you look at him wrong and a bit of a bro-con (hehe).\\n\\n\r\nShizuku Mizutani: Egghead and bleeder of the nose.\\n\\n\r\nThere are about three or four other characters that are important to the show (But because MAL doesn\u2019t list them as Main, I\u2019m not going to talk about them individually) and they also serve their purpose well within the show. One thing I did like about Haru is that, while not immediately clear, is that the dude isn\u2019t at all adjusted to school, and because of that you get some pretty good comedy moments, like when he brings a chicken to school by hiding it in his shirt. That\u2019s about the level of the comedy, especially when Haru is invovled.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art & Sound (6/10) & (5/10): The art of the show is solid, exceptionally solid, for a three-year old show it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. Apart from that there\u2019s not a lot at all about the art to say, is good, that\u2019s all I can really tell you.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on the other hand is entirely forgettable I just finished the show not even an hour ago and I can\u2019t remember shit is terms of sound, the characters VA are good I was convinced that these were in fact the character\u2019s voices. Everything other part of the sound, excluding the OST, was alright.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this show?\\n\\n\r\nBetter than average rom-com that\u2019s for sure.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nYep. If you\u2019re looking for a better than average rom-com sure.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

It definitely isn't your everday run of the mill shoujo anime. \r\nStoryline-wise the anime tells us about a study-focused girl meeting with a kind-hearted yet violence prone guy and their everyday encounters with other characters that are also put in the spotlight. The story progression is slow but this is just the right pacing for the story. It sadly ends in a cliffhanger though.\r\nTonari no Kaibutsu-kun has clasiccal stunning shoujo backgrounds andcharacters. The artwork is unique and probably reminiscent to Bokura ga Ita. It is so colorful as expected for a shoujo anime. Its opening and ending themes animation is really catchy and colorful.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending themes of the show is worth remembering and also could easily become a favourite to many anime fans. The Background music during  conversations and events really suit the background and also elevates the mood.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the Characters of the story are notable. Shizuku's personality matched with Haru's is quite funny. Natsume's typical popular cheerful girl and also Sasayan's friendly guy personality added to the mix. Even the other characters that are part of the story could become your favorite. Character development is well presented that it does force the audience to watch a series of flashbacks but provides the right amount for the viewers to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you're not a fan of shoujo anime, this anime is definitely worth the watch especially if you like romance/comedy/slice of life. It nice mix of romance and comedy which are realistic although some are over edge but the hell it ain't interesting if you don't add some wouldn't it. I give this anime a rating of 9 in the enjoyment department.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is a good rom-com show and definitely deserves a lot of praise and a season 2.",

And somehow they all happen to be good looking. Makes one wonder how are they not popular.\r\nAnyway, as I said, the story with its light romance is so beautiful. Good comedy, great character stories, but pretty typical characters. Normal music and average animation.\r\nOkay so these are not spoilers, remember. Basically the story's course is that the girl doesn't want to be attracted to Haru because it works like a distraction in her studies and she can't make her gradessuffer more. What? I know. But she's not a complete bitch. You'll love her.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance takes a pretty realistic path. It seems that they're being unrealistically honest but the turns their relationship takes is very realistic. It's not based around a fairy tale setting or a romantic dream. It's much closer to real life where you're sure and unsure of things at the same time. Where you're in love but you're not displaying that. And everything isn't so smooth with all the fights and difference of opinions. It's a real and fun love story.\\n\\n\r\nBut after half a dozen episodes pass, you would sense they're overdoing things. Dude, that's enough time to reach a conclusion about whether it's a deal or not, especially when you got no other stuff or problem in the whole story. But it's overly stretched. At episode 8 sharp, I felt like \"Why is he even trying? Just throw that bitch aside and get another girl.\"\\n\\n\r\nI would say My Little Monster is an enjoyable anime you can pick up anytime, especially after you've braced some Clannad sort of stuff. It's got great comedy, a sweet romance, and beautiful characters.",

            "content": "*SPOILER-FREE*\r\nTL;DR: It might not be the most thought-provoking, and it's sometimes stupid, but I found this anime enjoyable and a pleasure to watch.\r\nWow, that was a lot better than I expected. When I went into this anime, I didn\u2019t know what I was watching at first. With the English title, \u201cMy Little Monster\u201d, the first thing my mind wandered to is Pok\u00e9mon because it\u2019s the abbreviated term for \u201cPocket Monsters\u201d. This isn\u2019t anything like that. \r\nInstead, you get a cast of diverse characters who are mostly hard to tell apart in appearance unless they\u2019re siblings; in which case, I usually give that a pardon. Withthese characters, they all had unique traits which some dispute saying that they don\u2019t change much, but in my opinion, that\u2019s a good thing. You don\u2019t drastically change that fast upon meeting a person. It takes a long time, and I think the show did the pacing of development well enough that I felt attached to almost all the characters. Some argue saying these characters are tropes which is sort of true, but I thought there was more substance behind it than that since there was reasoning behind it, and their chemistry overall was a result of that quirky concoction. Besides that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give too much more description into that because I truly believe that the characters\u2019 actions will speak far greater than my words.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this anime is quite simple. Just like a lot of romance anime, it is about two people falling in love. More than that though, I think one of the beautiful things about the romance and slice of life genres are the way that you can take it. There is the melancholy tragic backstory or the happy-go-lucky comedic storyline. This one is more of the comedic kind, but there is a bit of backstory given. Although none is anime-level tragic, I think it was nice that they put it in to give a bit of background for each of the characters. I am a person who believes that most disliked characters can be made more tolerable with a good character arc or backstory. Now, with that in mind, some characters don\u2019t receive as much development as others. With thirteen episodes, you can\u2019t ask for that and expect it on a silver platter. Overall, I believe that the story, although simplistic, was a refreshing type of storyline that put a unique twist on its comedic-romance/slice of life genre.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of score and animation, I can\u2019t say much about it since I found that it was rather simplistic and normal. I will say that I disliked the score. The score for me just did not fit the show well enough of what it could\u2019ve been, and to me, score is a huge factor of a show as it sets and amplifies the mood, so I was disappointed. Animation and art was about average. There weren\u2019t any scenes that stood out for me, but I will note that as usual, there are a ton of laughable funny faces. I think it adds to the comedic value of the show, and with the characters and general jokes, I think it did its job sufficiently. The seiyuu of the show were also unique in their own rights. I had no problem with any of their performances because I truly found them as a great fit for each of their characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime I feel does not have a high enough score for the amount of enjoyment I had watching it. It was truly a pleasure to watch, and it is one that I would put up with some of my other favourites from the genre like \u201cToradora\u201d (I can\u2019t name much more than that since I am usually more of an action/shounen type of anime viewer). Sure, it's sometimes childish and stupid, and the anime itself isn't thought-provoking and deep, but it's fun to watch. If you are considering watching this anime, I would say to watch it. It\u2019s only thirteen episodes, and I just found it amusing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8.4/10\\n",

            "content": "Initially this show showed a lot of promise early on in the first few episodes. It proved to have a prefect blend of comedy,wackiness,romance,and a lot of unpredictable reactions and scenes you would not see coming. All of this led me to absolutely love the series up until about episode 5-6.\r\nWhat was initially a perfect series to me up until episode 6 eventually turned to a complete waste 1/2 way through the series. If you want your memory of this series to be great and not utterly ruined for you i'd suggest stopping at about episode 5-6 and simply taking the storyline at that. Afterabout episode 6 the romance turns to almost complete apathy and spite for the main characters of the series and eventually develops into a weird Love triangle/square that just leads to very unhealthy character relationships border lining on psychological manipulation and sociopath like attributes of the main characters. The main protagonists constantly go back in forth admitting their love for eachother each episode which is cute at the beginning when it's genuine however 1/2 way through the series they continue to claim \"love\" but rarely interact with each other (never romantically) and become stand offish almost to the point where it seems like the love aspect becomes unhealthy and one sided becoming an elaborate lie. This series ends on Episode 13 but the ending itself is far from a conclusion. The series essentially ends at what many would consider the \"midpoint\" of the storyline which leaves one with a bad taste and the overall final episode feels a lot like filler with 0 plot. Essentially a great Start to a series with an absolutely horrid ending and downfall, However the first 1/2 is so good that ill still give it a 7 as i haven't seen many anime quite as unique as this one.",

            "content": "Please note that this is my first time writing a review so there might be flaws in this report. Also, there might be some mild spoilers ahead. \r\nAn amazing buddy-themed anime which turns out to be a romantic relationship or should I say, a romantic comedy. \r\nWelcome to this one-of-a-kind romantic comedy show called, \"My Little Monster\" or should you say \"Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\" (\u3068\u306a\u308a\u306e\u602a\u7269\u304f\u3093).\r\nThis anime follows a highschool girl named Shizuku Mizutani (I'm using the Western style of mentioning names though) who turns out to be quite geeky and emotionless. She has been interested in studying when she was still a kid. The storygoes when her adviser asks Shizuku to give some class printouts to Haru Yoshida, an eccentric young man who turns out to be some monster. While both of them have encountered, Haru declares that Shizuku and he are friends. This freaked Shizuku bit, so she carried on with her normal and peaceful school life. After she delivered her task, her adviser, once again, asks Shizuku to convince Haru to come to school as he will be expelled from the school premises. This causes Shizuku to have another encounter with Haru. Since they are \"friends\" after all, Haru agreed with Shizuku and this is where everything changes especially in Shizuku''s life. This is where their crazy, yet touching relationship happens. Tons of events happen in their relationship. New friends, new rivals, new circumstances and new cunnings start to clash. Now I'll start my review from here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI liked how thrilling Shizuku and Haru's relationship is with all of the bumps in their way. The plot may be tiresome, but with all of these circumstances happening, you're gonna need a deep laugh. Shizuku and Haru have some disagreements, but despite of this, they've changed their hearts severely. Haru has been chasing his own tail, while Shizuku has been changing her tunes. To be honest, their confessions were not that serious as you think and they haven't accepted each other yet until now. I'm guessing that from the ending that I've watched, this anime is a cliffhanger. The ending is quite abstract as you see. It's still the same issue between Shizuku and Haru although a few things have changed and they were able to enjoy a wonderful experience with one another though this is short. Not really what I've expected. I just hope a second season would come up to clear all of these misunderstandings, but my report is really late and will there be one with this time gap? Who knows? Maybe there could be one, but in a new generation. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is really great. Considering how they creatively come up with the opening and ending animations, it's a cream of the crop. Character designs may look bland, but it's still lively for a romantic comedy like this. The CG effects are really simple and unnoticeable. Overall, the art catches someone's eyes with all of this peculiarity.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great. Haruka Tomatsu really did a great job. She was able to create a perfect geeky and cunning voice for Shizuku. Asuna sounds totally different from Shizuku considering that they have the same voice actress, but I guess this is the secret for the voice actors/actresses.  Tatsuhisa Suzuki did a great job with Haru, voicing him with all of his gentle and touching voice. It's not really how a monster sounds like, but I guess this is good enough. The opening theme song is okay. It's quite a good start for an intro. The ending song is also okay. I mean, the song is a Christmas-themed song and only a few episodes are set during Christmas/New Year. It didn't really match the whole romantic theme, but the song is still appealing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the issue is still there between Shizuku and Haru, but there has been a slight character improvement. Shizuku became more friendly and interactive with others and Haru became more mature though some flaws still remain like his jealous side. Natsume became mature as well, especially with advice, though a kiddie side of her remains. Sometimes, her minds fly. Sasayan-kun remains the same. Yamaken keeps his cool, though he still has feelings for Shizuku. Yamaken's friends are still outrageous as usual. Oshima hasn't changed though she opens up even more. The rest are a bit bland. No resolution has been made yet to their stories. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe story may be tiresome and unmoving for some with all of these goosebumps, but this is what makes the anime more thrilling and exciting to watch. The anime will always make you smile with all of the outgoings of these characters. Still, it's a cliffhanging anime, and there is no particular resolution to this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIf you like romantic comedies, then step back and enjoy this show! The show will go all forth with all of the absurdity in this show. If you like a really touching and dramatic show, then this show is not your place. This show may be a bit clich\u00e9, but it'll turn out to be a wonderful experience for you! I have no particular description for this anime, but let's just say that this is a \"peculiar\" show with a tiny cute monster in it. ^^; \u3058\u3083\u306d\uff01",

            "content": "I like this anime. I do. It has a lot of elements that really work... and some that really don't. The main thing I love about this anime is the main character and his whole attitude. He is like a dog, lovable and loyal... until you piss him off, then it is all fangs. One of my favorite scenes is when a group of upperclassman kidnap the girl they see him hanging around with and take her to their classroom to \"get back at him.\" They are nice enough to her and really don't want to cause her trouble. She asks if she can studyand they say \"sure.\" When the MC gets there and bursts in... all hell breaks lose. He goes crazy. The main girl tells tries to pull him away before the fighting and tells him its alright... but in a rage he actually hits her in the face by accident. Hard. It was both funny and gave great insight into the character and that his protectiveness was a double edged sword. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems with this anime is the amount of wasted potential and the lack of depth. For example... the way the older brother acts is one built up and portrayed as a villain. It could EASILY have been a very interesting relationship and dynamic. Say... if his brother were the head of a gang and he made his little brother fight and do all kinds of terrible things to hurt people. It would add some context to why he is so adept at fighting and explain his bursts of unbridled rage. Then this girl comes along and changes him and the older brother doesn't like it so he has some of his goons kidnap her and the little brother has to save her while dealing with his past demons... instead what we get is a wishy washy love story with some really ridiculous turns. The amount of times they go back and forth with \"loving each other\" is dizzying. Just stick with it already!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, great anime. Worth a watch! Virtus Signum gives this an 8/10.",

            "content": "One thing that I have not yet noticed in other reviews or comments left about this anime is the abusive nature of Haru in this anime. It's definitely one of the most important points that seems to be left out. Having said that, I'll start from the beginning. \r\nThe character I least liked in this anime was Haru. This anime made me cringe and feel uncomfortable at times because of how many times stuff pointed to an abusive relationship, and it all came from Haru. Haru has the personality of a sociopath/psychopath and that can be seen many times throughout the anime. He is possessiveof Shizuku even though they aren't dating, hits her several times without apologizing, follows her everywhere she goes, tries to tell her what she can/can't do, and threatens to beat up anyone that comes near her. He also doesn't know how to properly behave in public and Shizuku tells him in an episode that if he behaves meanwhile she is at cram lessons, they'll go on a picnic. Shizuku also questions her love for Haru because of his weird personality and wonders if she can actually get over that. She even states that they seem to clash a lot and wonders why. In another episode, he licks her hand out of nowhere and Shizuku lectures him on personal boundaries and consent. She tells him the touch of a man that is not warranted by her first is repulsive. He then proceeds to get mad. He also threatens to beat up anyone that comes near her. \\n\\n\r\nQuotes by Haru: \\n\r\n\"One peep out of you and I'll rape you.\"\\n\r\n\"Shizuku's the one who keeps changing. I can only wonder if she's going to leave me behind one of these days. Makes me consider ripping off her arms and legs.\"\\n\\n\r\nQuotes by Shizuku: \"We won't get anywhere if I'm the only one doing the right thing.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't the typical rom-com I was expecting.  I won't spoil the ending, but the ending isn't actually an ending; it is just another episode that can be continued in a second season or by reading the manga. The only thing I liked about this anime is that Shizuku finally found friends but other than that Haru's personality ruined it for me. \\n",

            "content": "Many viewers, when first watching Tonari no Kaibutsu kun, believed that the show would turn to be a great success and enjoyment since the original manga for it was a success in the first place and receives much praise. However, as time passed and the first season (probably) ended, Tonari has left me feeling warm, but disappointed and unsatisfied. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nOne of the things that I enjoyed about this show was the pure innocence of it, how two misfits are slowly discovering the world of love. But I believe that it just stops right there. The whole series felt like one big filler, with someprogress for five minutes every three episodes. Yes, you read that right. They definitely got the comedy part right, I laughed my ass off so many times (\"Gorillas can communicate with their eyes!\"). But the romance between the main two characters was just so confusing, being indecisive and having slow progress. Even during the final episode, which may I say was a total disappointment, the furthest the two progressed was Shizuku saying how she wishes to have full affection for Haru, one day. The anime did have bright points, though. It gave off themes such as the importance of relationships in ones life. Tonari did manage to make me feel warm inside as well, so I'll give them points on that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nNatsume was easily my favorite character in this series. Her story may have been quite too much at times, but many people were able to relate to her story. Shizuku actually did some justice, she went from study bug to a study bug with feelings. Her indecisiveness irritated me a whole lot, though. Haru was absolutely adorable but he was rather confusing. His past with his brother was shoved in in order to explain his rash behavior. Needless to say though, he was an entertaining and unique character that's hard not to love. Yamaken brought excitement and a low-key love triangle between Haru and Shizuku, but it was obvious that he wouldn't have made too much of a difference. Still, seeing an elitist fall for a blatant study bug was rather adorable. Sasayan was a cutie, but really, what was the point of him? Have a crush on Natsume but then give up once he realizes she likes Mi-chan? I just wish he had more talk time because he did nothing much. These characters did bring liveliness and were relatable, so despite the wasted space some of them created, they were enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in Tonari was really pleasant, and did a pretty good job in bringing emotion in some of the more dramatic, emotional, and humorous parts. Nothing too applaud-able  though. It's not like I'd go and illegally download any of their OST's. The voice actors did a TREMENDOUS job. I seriously am satisfied with how each character was portrayed by each of them. They brought emotion to the characters and made the show much more interesting that way. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nYou definitely can't go wrong with the animation in this show. It was one of the reasons that I started watching it in the first place. The character's proportions are perfectly in tact, and their expressions were adorable and fun to watch. The scenery also was impressive at times and the whole thing was a treat to my eyes. Nothing too choppy or blurry, the character and setting design settled down the part of me that raged at the draggy plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nTonari no Kaibutsu kun was a treat for the eyes and the ears, but the plot dragged on for the whole series and left many of the viewer's questions unanswered, including many of mines. Hopefully a second season will be made, one where Shizuku's and Haru's relationship will pick up, but hopefully not too quickly. I recommend this show to those who enjoy a good laugh and some tender feelings of romance now and then. Don't expect too much, though.",

            "content": "\"just because you've seen the end of the road that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the journey in getting there\"\r\nThis quote simply means that this anime may have a sucky ending, but it has a variety of romance, comedy, drama, and cuteness that won't make you unpleasant. It may disappoint you in the end but it will still give you laughs, tears and smiles. The anime really depicts a very original japanese comedy. It is showered with the most craziest conclusions, honest opinions and emotional confessions about love; moreover, It has a cute title that is, My Little Monster.\r\nI won't tell you guys about theplot because you guys are probably tired on the repeated explanation on how the story goes. Instead, I will explain the things that you will encounter while watching this series. The story is well, let's face it, it's cliche, redundant, and a lofty show of legendary heart-warming scenes that will keep your heart racing with marshmallow flowers and butterflies in the stomach, but, it really is fun to watch. The whole series really made me happy and it wasn't boring. There are weird things in this anime like for example, green jokes coming out of nowhere, distracting movements of the characters and finally their facial expressions in facing the same nonsense everyday. The plot has some unpredictable stuff on it so I don't think people will keep saying,\" Oh, they will get together so easily since this is a fast pace anime\" but, NO. Just NO! There is a huge roller coaster and a wall before the two main characters get together. You will keep guessing and thinking on how things will go smoothly or how things will be a disaster in every episode of the show. Sometimes we can appreciate the weird things that are going on in this show and we can just say, \"Oh what the hell! that is too darn funny!\" And one more thing, this show is full of love triangles (take note love TRIANGLES) which means more unexpected characters will fall in love with each other. In short, it is a classic rom-com anime that will never get old.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is very modern. It's not something so old and cartoon-looking. It's more clean, neat and high definition (because obviously it was made last October 2012). Somehow, the drawings were inconsistent. The head sometimes gets deformed, the body is too big, the face sometimes is too small but, I don't want to stop watching this anime just because of the tiniest flaws. It's the story that really counts in every anime and that's what I really look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending was swell. It's not distracting or anything. It's not that half bad. The tune of the background music during each scene in the anime whether it is a dramatic scene, a happy and romantic scene, or a fight scene, it still sets the mood and it gives life to every scenario. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were simply amazing. From the weirdest ones to the coolest ones, they all have an outstanding performance and personality that completes the whole story. Some appears to be just an extra character but the truth is, they have important roles in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the whole series and honestly the ending was a bit of a rip off. Some questions weren't answered and some things didn't get fixed. It was a great experience but I wished the ending was good and well planned. The sudden ending and the well developed beginning didn't really go well together. Everyone wants a good ending in every anime but maybe we can't really have it all in life.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a good anime but not the best one yet. It's a shoujo anime so I think only a few people will appreciate its beauty. It has low rating because it didn't have a great ending. a lot of animes are like this, it started off smoothly and interesting but in the end you're just looking into a very fancy teddy bear but as soon as you get it, it will turn into ashes. So far, I've been thinking too much.. Why does Japan have to do the same thing in every anime. Well, that's life. If you're asking about my recommendation about this anime, I myself, can't answer that question. I don't want you guys to experience an empty feeling again but I only watched this because I'm already okay with those kinds of animes. But if you would like to see an anime that will keep your heart racing and give you a fun roller coaster ride then, you might as well try Tonari no Kaibutsu kun\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun was unexpectedly good. I mean, I read the synopsis and thought it might be \"OK\" but it was actually very fun to watch. With only 13 episodes it's an easy watch, and it's filled with a lot of great little moments.\r\nI'll start with the basic stuff. It had good artwork and animation. It had good music and sound. It had great characters, and an ok story... blah blah blah. It's not perfect, it's not horrible, it's average to great in most categories so it comes down to taste and preference. It's definitely not bad at all, and it has some intangible elementsthat make it very \"likeable.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is really a great character love story. Each of the cast has a slightly over exaggerated but common social disorder, and it's their grouping together that creates a really interesting and entertaining dynamic to watch. The focus isn't just the two main characters, they have a pretty interesting entourage as well. The general anime stereotypes are included, but they are not dominant factors in the delivery. There are plenty of refreshing moments and a few little surprises that make this anime series shine.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I loved most about this series is that it was very relatable to my teen years. I connected with a couple of the characters, and there were others that reminded me of people I have known or at least had observed. They each were unique and they never really acted out of character. The level of irrational teen behavior was never over exaggerated. In fact, it was pretty accurately done. Teens struggling with how they feel and how they think they should feel is a major theme of this story. I have to say that element was really well done, and they definitely get kudos on that point.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of this series really is the main story (the only real story for that matter). The love story/relationship between Shizuku and Haru is comedic without being too slapstick, and it's so wonderfully dysfunctional that I couldn't help but enjoy every moment of it. They complimented each other in such an interesting way that I couldn't get enough. It's definitely one of my favorite love stories now that I've seen it. I am not normally big on romantic comedies, but this was a good one.\\n\\n\r\nMy only real complaint is the open ending. I normally don't mind open endings, but it felt like there was going to be more. I don't want to spoil anything, but the only indication it was the end was Shizuku's inner monologue during the final scene (oh and do watch the short clip after the credits of the last episode, it's not an ending either but it's a little funny). I guess this is yet another teaser anime series that introduces you to a manga series, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a great series, and if you're not sure about it because it's a romantic comedy then you should still give it a shot. It's a good \"comedy\" and the romance is very light. In fact, it's more of a weird relationship story than a romantic comedy. Thumbs up!",

            "content": "The alternate English title for Tonari no Kabiutsu-Kun is My Little Monster. I know what you're thinking; another Anime where the generic main character gets a magical pet of some description that causes all kinds of mayhem, right? Wrong. Tonari no Kabiutsu throws off the shackles that burden a large portion of the Anime industry these days, and makes a great attempt at originality. \r\nThe Rom/Com genre has become infested with moe or cookie-cutter character types. Try and find a Rom/Com these days that has no Tsundere, no shy fragile girl, no genius girl etc, or of course the Ryu male lead - or allof them for some spicy harem-goodness. While you scramble to prove me wrong, I'd like to point your attention back to the Anime in question.\\n\\n\r\nMy Little Monster is a story about a introverted girl that appears to only care about her studies - quite frankly, she is plain - and a boy that by all accounts is the complete opposite: a quick-tempered, outspoken and violent young man with no regard for his education. The best part about the pair is that, by all accounts, they appear to be... human (revolutionary stuff, right?). I won't be 'that guy' and spoil the plot in a review, but the characters in this Anime truly feel genuine. They have no idea how relationships work, they seem fascinated by each other but appear unable to articulate their fascination. Dare I say... they are average, confused youths, and by golly is it refreshing. It's like taking a shower under a pristine waterfall on a hot day, like taking a random nap in the afternoon, like taking a wizz in the morning... you get the point. \\n\\n\r\nWhat more can I say? Thus far Tonari no Kabiutsu-Kun appears destined to leave a positive mark on Anime culture, here's hoping it helps to shift the industry out of its repetitious rutt it finds itself in. Watch it, follow it, enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10 - Highly polished, smooth visuals. Superb character emotion animation. \\n\r\nSound: 7/10 - Sound for me is the complete package. Intro song got on my nerves, and some of the sound effects were unnecessary, so it brought down the score.\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 - Too hard to judge after 4 episodes, but refreshing and intriguing so far. Watch this space.",

In school a boy named Haru Yoshida, sits next to Shizuku but rarely attends class. After Shizuku is tasked with delivering class printouts to Haru's home, she meets Haru, who immediately greets her as a friend, starting their new relationship.\r\nArt: I loved the art for this series it was loud, bright, and overall amusing. Most of the characters were visually appealing and were developed nicely.\r\nCharacter: Shizuku is the main female protagonist of the series and Ienjoyed watching her grow throughout in terms of warming up to people. Haru also made a very fitting male protagonist different from your usually cold male lead. There isn't a moment in the series where I have to question Haru's feelings for Shizuku from the beginning he is loyal to Shizuku and it was nice to see considering that most of the shojo's out here like to create a love triangle with two girls and one male. It was interesting to see the other way around. Other characters like Natsume a lonely girl who has problems making friends due to her intimidating beauty, and Sasahara who appears to be frienimies with Natsume will also keep the viewer highly entertained and wishing for a pair off sequel starring them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the series, it is one of my favorites. However the show ends with a huge cliffhanger so be prepared to pick up on the manga where the series leaves off. It is worth it. I promise!",

While it\u2019s not that funny it has a few good jokes here and there. One or two per episode but it keeps a very lighthearted tone that you can\u2019t help but smile.\r\nThe colorful, vibrant artwork adds to it. The characters are drawn in more realistic proportions giving the show a live action TV kind of feel. None of that bug-eyed, moe bullshit.\r\nNow here\u2019s the gimmick. Instead of boy meets girl, they deny each other\u2019s love for 12 episodes and confess at the end, they outright tell each other theirlove on the first episode. This was refreshing and kept my interest.\\n\\n\r\nB-But if they spill the beans already, what\u2019s there to watch? The conflict comes from the main couple dealing with their new emotions. They\u2019re both antisocial fucks. The main guy is childish, naive, and brutish. The girl is cold, distant, and just wants to study. They have really nice moments that make you root for them. There\u2019s a lot of nostalgia which I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s a manga adaptation so it ends abruptly so there\u2019s no cohesive plot over the 13 episodes. There are a lot of subplots with minor characters that never get resolved. The show can get too silly sometimes to take seriously, and the main guy can get a little irritating because he\u2019s so childish.",

No, in fact, I'm glad I found this anime. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWhy a 10, you ask? I review stories on how well it does on its genres. In this case, the romance and comedy were perfect for this anime. The romance side was very sweet, about Haru and Shizuku and them confessing to each other multiple times, but somehow failing because either Haru's an idiot or Shizuku can't answer. The comedy side is funny too, to the point where I laughhysterically at each episode on how stupid some characters are and their responses to a situation.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLike your typical rom-com anime, nothing too special. Colours were nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I review the sound, I usually listen to it alone because it's easy for me to forget. The OST is very nice, I saw a piano piece OST in the anime on YouTube and that felt very calming. The OP and ED fit the theme of the anime, being happy and lighthearted.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nHaru Yoshida, the protagonist who has a dark history of himself, being violent at others and fighting very often. He looks scary on the outside, but inside, he just wants to live like a normal high school student and of course, that wish was granted. A very kind character who would save his friends from the bad people, even to the point where he would kill them. Also, he's an idiot.\\n\\n\r\nMizutani Shizuku, the cold hearted genius who doesn't have any feelings such as happiness or sadness or loneliness until he meets Haru. In her world, studying is the #1 thing for her, anything other than that is unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed each episode of this anime, as it would either show the development of relationships between each other in the anime or something serious would happen. I wanted to watch this anime as I came back from school but sadly finished it in an instant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that is VERY SIMILAR to Kaichou wa Maid-sama, then this anime is JUST for you.",

            "content": "There were so many aspects of this show that I enjoyed, and some things I didn't. I didn't have high expectations of an anime that I knew nothing about going into it, and a cliche that had been used several times over and over. Before I knew it, I had finished this series in less than a day and wanted more!\r\nStory 9/10\r\nAs I said before, this is a cliche used often, and I've seen it all before. But never like this. This anime put a twist on the average \"girl-likes-boy-but-boy-doesn't-like-girl\". In fact, this anime took all of that and reversed it completely! The abusive andemotionless one was the girl, and the semi-annoying, head-over-heels character was the boy. Now, I'm only pointing these details out because, of all the romance animes I've watched, the timid character who seemed to be in love was in fact, the girl. I love how they took the stereotype of the obsessive girl and abusive boy and totally turned it around. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved everything about the art in this show. When I wasn't wishing I was Mizutani Shizuku because she's so darn cute, I was dreaming of the day when I found my Yoshida Haru. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters had so much depth!! Including the chicken! They did such a good job at keeping Shizuku emoitionless, and at some times, really rude. But while keeping her a certain way, the watcher also found out the reasons as to WHY she became this way. I'm also really impressed at how the main girl character did NOT have huge tits and boys lining up to bang her. It's really difficult to find a good romance anime without the female protagonist having huge bazoongas, but this anime did those shows justice!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime and I would probably watch it again. The only reason I would give it an 8/10 is because there were ONLY 13 EPISODES. I neeeed more!!",

            "content": "This review is going to contain minor spoilers regarding the plot development and characters. (in other words, you\u2019ll be fine)\r\nBefore I started my review, I had the obligation to read about what other people thought about the show and see if I can conclude with an unbiased review and just tell you really what the show is for what it really is. However, I learned that such a case wasn\u2019t viable to reviewing a show that instilled so much emotion. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for me to tell people that the show was objectively good or objectively fun, it just doesn\u2019t make sense. Take itfor what you will, but this review is going to simply be about why I thought this show was great and why you should give it a try: \\n\\n\r\nI decided to start with the shows greatest strength because I personally found this to have higher precedence than the story because the story\u2019s simple enough already. What TNKK did that most other slice of lifes I have seen in my life didn\u2019t was make the characters genuine. Each character cares about something that people can relate to and aren\u2019t merely tools to move the plot forward. In fact, it becomes the other way around.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cShizuku is a girl who finds happiness through studying which inevitably leads her to becoming this objectively straightforward person.\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cHaru is a boy who couldn\u2019t make friends most of his life due to his violent behavior in the past.\u201c\\n\\n\r\nIf one were to read these sentences alone, you\u2019d get the most generic characters that are no different from most kuuderes and tragic characters in mainstream anime. But put these characters together and you\u2019ll get the complexity essential to kickstart a story from their genuine relationship. One of the central themes of Shizuku when it comes to the relationship is whether or not she should embrace it over studying, which differs from Haru\u2019s willingness to simply be loved. It casts aside the rigid dichotomy of \u201cwho\u2019s right\u201d and \u201cwho\u2019s wrong\u201d, but rather \u201chow will it work?\u201d The show\u2019s core objective is different from many slice of lifes and relates more to shows like Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru where characters are everything. It\u2019s a show about genuine people coming together and developing from mere exposure to each other. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it even better is that this trope isn\u2019t restricted to the main characters, but the supporting characters just as equally. What TNKK likes to do is give each character an interest or way of life that they cherish like anybody else. Shizuku loves to study because she found that hard work pays off in the end, Natsume finds consolidation on the internet because it\u2019s hard making friends in real life, Sasahara likes soccer because it\u2019s fun, Yamaguchi adopts an elitist mentality to not try too hard since he comes from a rich background, and Haru does whatever he does to make friends simply because he wants to.\\n\\n\r\nIt is with this that the characters becomes easier for us to sympathize and makes us more inclined to take part in their decisions as well. Characters are seen constantly asking themselves a series of genuine questions on how they should behave, act, or think when interacting with other characters or just clashing in general, especially amongst Shizuku and Haru. We see that each character is its own person that you can\u2019t help but support or disagree with because they\u2019re relatable. It is also through these genuine interactions that we also get a lot of really really funny moments, which got me cracking up and grinning for a good hour each episode. The characters just made it easier to laugh, smile, and cry with them once you realize that they\u2019re not merely tools for your enjoyment, but symbolically people in their own right. No one breaks out of character, they simply are their characters. \\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, the show did not need to have a plot full of complicated twists, overdramatized themes, or fantastical elements to make it compelling. It simply just gave its characters the room to be themselves - to let them be the characters they were written to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are also very, very fitting for the show. It\u2019s mellow, but memorable. It doesn\u2019t try too hard to be something fantastic as it did not want to detract the importance of the scene itself. Once the song gets implanted into memory (which isn\u2019t hard because there aren\u2019t many) it will make you think back to the last significant event where the song played, indirectly piecing each scene together as something of intrinsic value to character development. I agree that the opening and ending songs weren\u2019t that great, but I didn\u2019t find that to be all that important if you were to only care about the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely, the same thing could be said about the art itself. Mellow, but memorable with a heavy focus on the characters before anything. I really enjoyed the minimalist style of the show, though most people can argue otherwise it\u2019s just my personal taste. The art is color and sometimes reminds me of paper mache. The best part about the art, for me, was the body language in that each facial expression or body movements embody what the person is feeling or thinking. This tied with passionate and awesome voice acting by the cast makes for comedic moments to its maximum potential. Faces will contort, stretch and swing with the character\u2019s voices, so every joke doesn\u2019t come off half assed. This also applies to when they\u2019re nervous, scared, sad, energetic, tired, etc. Though It wasn\u2019t anything special, I was very impressed with the studio\u2019s creativity and passion to adapting what the manga strived to do.\\n\\n\r\nNow to finally address the elephant in the room. If there\u2019s one thing that was extremely disappointing about this show is that it ends less than midway through the manga itself. It literally stops as the characters are developing and we\u2019re left with unanswered questions and no sign of a season 2 (which is probably 100% by now). Personally, I found budget to be the only reason this was a failure, but still enjoyed the ride nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nI think this show would be perfect for you if:\\n\r\nYou don\u2019t care that it stops midway\\n\r\nYou are more focused on characters than the plot itself\\n\r\nYou don\u2019t care if it\u2019s not anything extravagant\\n\r\nYou are a big fan of slice of life anime and want to try something different\\n\r\nDon\u2019t care about fan service\\n\r\nWant to laugh\\n\r\nAre my best friend :^)\\n\\n\r\nTake it for what you will, it\u2019s just my opinion based on what I\u2019ve felt and what other people felt when I showed this to them.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I found TNKK to be an indescribable experience that I can easily rate a 10/10 by merit and respectable writing in general. It doesn\u2019t rely on cute characters, fan service, \u201caccidents\u201d, cliches, or miracles to be interesting and does so in a very concise way that is easy to follow. If that isn\u2019t good writing, then I don\u2019t know what is. My favorite character overall was probably Haru just because of the purity in his actions and Natsume when it came to the comedy because her voice is just so funny. \\n\\n\r\nI feel that many people, regardless of my view and tastes but rather for one\u2019s interest in slice of life anime, should definitely give this show a try. MAL is an amazing place for people to share and exchange ideas, so I\u2019m glad to be one of the few people that gave a 10/10 review for this show. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR (for the lazy) The show is driven by the complexity of the characters than the story itself, which is what makes TNKK a genuine and respectable piece of work. It doesn\u2019t try to do anything too over the top, but will always do something different to get the viewer\u2019s attention, whether it\u2019s the art, music, comedy, or the characters themselves.",

I was expecting a good love story where these two complete opposite people would come together and become one. In the end did it really end up this way? Kind of? I guess episode 13 was possibly one of the worst endings to a series I've ever seen.. The ending and if there is no season 2 is just down right terrible. The episode was ok as it brought everyone together and they all did this thing for haru but? ehh..\r\nStory 7/10: Typical story about two complete opposites becoming one.. Throw inthe generic jealous here and there, throw in the awkward moment there along with a few sad/lovey dovey parts and you have yourself a anime! The story is about a child like minded person who begins to fall for this girl because he's afraid of being alone, while the girl is alone.. All she wants to do is study until she meets the main lead.. things progress and it starts of on a (from what I thought) a early relationship.. but was I wrong! Turns out it becomes into a \"Oh I like you, but you don't like me! But I don't like you now and you like me?!\" At some points I got very confused and zoned out because of how confusing and boring it got to be.. Overall it's a typical love story that will either be boring or bring something new.. But it neither! It was Eh.. At most!\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: I don't normally go for these types of anime and prefer to stick to another kind but I gave it a chance and I enjoyed it..\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: All the music and sounds where in the right place and nothing felt out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Typical nerd/study hard person falling for a bad boy type romance.. Really hated how childish Haru could be at some times and how none of them could express their feelings correctly.. The used the 3 magic words as a thing they could just throw in the air just for the heck of it.. Each character is bland and didn't really bring anything new to the anime scene.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: I got bored and confused at some times but I still enjoyed it..\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: Looking for a romance anime where you'll be confused half the time? Where you'll hate the main characters some time? Where you'll have mixed feelings and end up wondering where you went wrong in life?! Look no further! Overall if you're going to watch this anime.. Do it in one and get it out of the way! I'd recommend it but not if you're looking for a hardcore romance story where the main characters end up perfectly for each..",

            "content": "Refreshing, cute, and damn Haru is soo adorable...\r\nProbably one of my favorites shoujo manga. My little monster, the story seemed like any other clich\u00e9 we see in shoujo, the solitary girl, the nerd that pick the interest of a certain boy, well, it's close to it. This time, we get a solitary girl that care for nothing but her studies and get a great job to  live up to her mother expectations, and on the other hand a turbulent, very naive boy that get easily in trouble and looks for friends. Two people really different that meet and fall in love...so far, not reallydifferent to other shoujo right\u00a0? Well, no\u00a0!\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the two main characters don't beat around the bush about their relationship, being naive and romantically challenged with no experience, one single skip-beat and stare is enough to confess, but what I loved about this shoujo was how they approached love in the way it really is\u00a0: complicated. Sometimes, we can mistake love with compassion and safety and relief, the feeling you get when people ignore you or leave you aside because of fear and when the one person that accept you become you anchor.  Sure Haru is straight with is feeling, so is Shizuku, but as they learn more about each other they discover that feelings and love is much more complicated, and that sometimes love isn't just love. Between jealousy and envy, fear of loss and being ignored, plus the involvement of rivals, they went through the bad and the good parts of being in a relationship and learn what love really means. They give to each others, their tiny world extend and they're getting closer, accepting each other in a total honesty, and that's love, and it's not easy to reach, this total faith in the other...that's how this manga/anime evolve, not just between a one-sided love that beat around the bush to finally after the umpteenth chapter become mutual. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a very refreshing anime/manga until the very end, far from the old cliche that I've seen and read so far...pretty enjoyable.",

            "content": "I can only describe Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun in two words-Wasted potential. Tonari no kaibutsu-kun is an anime that i initially had high hopes for with its impressive 1st episode. It seemed promising considering how much depth and impact was put into its 1st episode and i was entranced and immediately drawn into this anime. However, what had drawn me in had eventually been abandoned in its subsequent episodes and it turned into a mediocre romance-shoujo anime.\r\nIn romance animes, i'd usually want to learn more about how the characters and their romance develop. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun's romance story does not even move an inch as theMCs engage in pointless back-and-forth romances. Why do these back-and-forth romances happen? Because of our dear MCs.\\n\\n\r\nMizutani Shizuku: Mizutani Shizuku is the female protagonist of this show and is \"addicted\" to studying. She does not to care about pointless things such as romance and friendship and only works hard for her academic grades.\\n\\n\r\nYoshida Haru: Yoshida Haru takes on the role of the male protagonist of this show. Foolish, socially inept and oblivious, Haru constantly creates trouble and is ostracized by society. Only the apathetic Shizuku does not ostracize him, making Haru fall in love with Shizuku.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the MCs seem interesting don't they? Well, that all goes to waste when the producers decide to embrace their personalities in the wrong way. Haru's oblivion provides him an inaccurate view of what love is, and Shizuku's addiction to studying makes her \"on-and-off\" about romance. I'm not gonna spoil but their \"romance\" unfolds in the most unpleasant way and is rather depressing to viewers like me.\\n\\n\r\nThere is so much more i can criticize about this anime but I'd end up making this an essay. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun laid the premise for an outstanding anime with great depth and interesting MC romance development, but all of this was tossed away for god knows what reason, what a shame.\\n",

I guess, to finisj it, I have to read the manga.\r\nThe story for me is just the same as the other anime that I have watch but I still find it enjoyable. Anime like Tora Dora which also have the same story but the characters are theone who makes it kind of unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. Of course, the anime is years old so I won't compare the art style on the art style of the newer ones. So I won't explain that much about the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is fine. I don't know what else I can say about the sound for this anime, the music is plain and I won't expect music playing in the background for some scenes in each episode unless its an anime with an action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were unique to me. Some characteristics are relatable. And also, character development on this one is surprisingly fast if you ask me. Its not like I hate it, honestly, I like it. Watch it and you know what I mean, I won't spoil anything with the exchange of your enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy watching this anime. And because I really enjoy it, I'll be rewatching it and aswell finish the manga just to find the true ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend watching it. But I guess, after watching this anime, you should read the manga to find the true ending. I just don't understand why can't they  give us season 2 of this anime but give as a live adaption movie this year. Its not like it will be much better if you just gave us season 2 instead of a live adaptation movie which I find unjoyable aswell bad in many ways.\\n",

Their chemistry is super funny because they always fight like cats and dogs. I enjoyed the side cast quite a bit, as they have unique personalities and they add even more humor to this anime. This animecan get a bit frustrating though because the romance between the 2 main characters is like a damn volleyball going back and forth. There's a good amount of love triangles and plenty of unrequited love to go around between the cast but I enjoyed this anime. If anything it's really funny with a solid cast and it does have some cute romantic moments in it.",

            "content": "Brain's Base anime? I just watched through 12 episodes without a thought. Never knew something would brought me so much feelings, although at first I thought the synopsis of the story make it a normal romance anime, I have never been so happy to be so wrong. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun really talks about a story of Shizuku Mizutani fickle feelings and Haru Yoshida a idiot, genius. It really has a first love kind of plot which makes it reminiscence of one's first love, bittersweet,conflicting, happy and sweet.\r\nTL;DR: You will not be disappointed by this love adventure between this two characters. Overall: 9/10 (above average comparedto other anime)  \\n\\n\r\n~Spoiler Alert~\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nI can really see the development of the story, from the first episode that first kiss. I could really see where this could go. However, a maiden's heart is confusing and deeply profound. Shizuki Mizutani was conflicting with her own feelings, which eventually lead to the happy ending everyone needed. However, I realize that the first kiss was to grab the audience attention from the start, the creators could have been more prudent and put the kiss in at perhaps episode 5 or 6 to reduce pacing and repetitive problems. The other characters in the story really helped to pace the story a lot better in the later part of the anime, making the anime not a generally failing one.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was decent compared to many of the other fall 2012 anime. Although the other more famous anime might have a slight edge over this one. It is really a good effort by the studio to have given this anime a lot of colour variation as compared to a anime that is just full of bright colours making it more obvious to show the difference between the tone and mood for different settings in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening is a happy and catchy tune. A symphony of drums and trumpet makes it so easy to just listen to the entire opening, a great pleasure. sung by Haruka Tomatsu also known as Asuna from Sword Art Online is definitely a great pleasure. The Ending is very festive theme, feels like a Christmas song, considering Christmas is about 2 weeks away, this is defintely a joyful and joyous song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 \\n\r\nThey are all generally enjoyable. Mizutani is cute in her ways, Haru is a weird \\n\r\nbut genius character which is also undeniably handsome. (not gay) Natsume is the cute girl that gets all the boys' attention, the gang with Kenji Yamaguchi, a rich asshole that likes Mizutani. (good thing Haru triumphs, would not have written this review if it was that asshole as protagonist)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nReally a good masterful piece that really brings forth the feelings of first love, and the struggle of a smart, tsundere girl with ponytail. I think that it distance itself from the normal rom-com anime which is a plus point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 \\n\r\nI would definitely recommend you to watch this anime, if you don't mind a wee bit of repetitive tsundering and idiot Haru. Would definitely watch again. ~",

            "content": "Please check the manga before deciding whether it is worth 10 star or not >.<\r\nHonestly I give 10/10 in respect for the manga and Rubico. ANd I may reviewing Tonari no Kaibutsu as OVERALL (which is mean I include the manga since it is impossible to review the story without finishing it imo)\r\nTonari no Kaibutsu-Kun is totally a masterpiece!\r\nThe bad thing about the anime series is that it was forcefully cut the story halfway (not even halfway! I am so damn pissed) when the line still far from mature. That last episode (which is not in the manga) was totally something that cut the animeand leave it hanging like hell.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, just finish the whole story instead of cutting it off and wondering if the second, the third season will come. It really a beautiful and emotional story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love the most?\\n\r\nThe character! I can't say enough how each of every character have their own portion in the story and they are linking each other in the most reasonable complicated way. Each character introduced nicely with their own background. Which is then their background make reasoning why their attitude towards other character. I cant believe Robico can think of something as detail as this. Remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nThe story! Yes it is awkwardly so beautiful. Haru and Shizuku is definitely the best couple in my entire anime universe. I am so damn jealous with them but I feel happy for them at the same time (just like Natsume-chan I would say)\\n\r\nYes! I was so connected with the series that after I finish the series in a day I continue finishing the rest 43 Manga Chapter in two nights)\\n\\n\r\nThe story and the relationship between Haru and Shizuku made me cry in joy. It is so beautiful *tears\\n\\n\r\nShizuku is truly a solid character. Very mature, independent, dependable, smart, carefree, but at the same time loveable, and unique. Haru is as strong as Shizuku as a character, they fill each other EXTREMELY WELL. What I love the most of them as a couple is that they are very frontal to each other in saying their feeling towards each other.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship develop NOT in a magical way and thats the reason why I am sticking with series the entire way. The romance flow. \\n\\n\r\nAnd honorable mentions to ALL SIDE CHARACTER.  All of them fill what kind of character that missing from Haru and Shizuku and fill all the hole (mention Sasahara, Natsume, Yamaken, Mitsu, Andou)\\n\\n\r\nWell...I cant tell you enough how GREAT is Tonari no-Kaibutsu-kun is. \\n\\n\r\nPLEASE, TO ALL OF YOU AUDIENCE....CONTINUE THE STORY FROM THE MANGA BECAUSE THE ANIME SERIES ENDED IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY. IT IS FAR FROM THE BEAUTY. NO JOKE.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWell I am actually a shounen manga but to be honest, Tonari no Kaibutsu is a shouju manga with a shounen influence illustration (what the hell am I talking, whatever) \\n\\n\r\nThings are so vivid and so lively and seriously not disappointing at all for regard of the manga works. It doesnt missing all the details the manga had from what I see as well.\\n\\n\r\nNBL Shizuku eyes are something that I cant get over with >.< Man she is so adoreable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI love Shizuku voice. It really ensemble her character in the most realistic way. It is easier for me to follow the manga after watching the anime. For Haru, I just think that his voice (seiyuu) a little bit too lively compared to what I feel from the manga. It should be better if he got toned down a bit but I still like it as well. \\n\r\nQ&A Recital, haha damn it bring a live to the series, seriously I really like the opening of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nDONT FORGET HOW GOOD IS\"TETSUKAZU NO KANJOU\" really connecting the feelings * I feel like crying again.\\n\\n\r\nI just finish the manga today and I still really sad that it comes to end like this. I just wish great manga or anime never ends. But yeah I don't want any conflict anymore in between Haru and Shizuku sooooo I will CONGRATULATE them from the bottom of my heart and close this series with peace T.T\\n\\n\r\nMASTERPIECE! Well done Rubico!  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nOkay, this is my first revieww on MAL so forgive any shoddily made points, but you've got to start somewhere.\r\nNow, I wouldn't call myself an expert on anime or manga by any means. I've been on MAL for a few years, and have been watching anime for a while before that, but there's hundreds of anime I've never even heard of, let alone seen yet. However, I've seen enough to know when an anime is bad - andthis is a bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\\n\r\nOkay, this is by far the weakest point in the show, so I'll get this out of the way first. You could save yourself a lot of time with this show, and watch episodes 1-2. After that, turn off your computer, because you've seen the full extent of the main plot.\\n\r\nRemember watching Dragon Ball Z as a kid? I do. Imagine burning through the episodes of the Frieza arc, watching Krillin's death, and feeling your heart racing as Goku charged up to turn Super Saiyain. Except he didn't turn Super Saiyan, he sat down in the grass and said \"Will I ever reach Super Saiyain? I do not know, but this sky is pretty\" and then got blown up. That's the plot. The two main characters never advance romantically past this point, they occasionally look at the next step, sometimes they'll even talk about it, but never will they set foot on it, because god forbid the plot advances in any damn way.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for the rest of the, dare I say, sub-plots. Everyone falls in love with each other at some point. Literally. This show redefines the love triangle, actually I'm pretty sure in the process it created the love octagon. Of course they never tell each other but, y'know, I think we're all used to that by now.\\n\r\nThe male lead has a troubled past hinted at by his estranged brother, which gets brought up and put to bed in the same episode, never to be mentioned again, and more or less the same thing happens to the female lead.\\n\r\nAll in all, the plot left me feeling disappointed and dragged this score into the dirt, after more or less everything else impressed me\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNow that's out of the way, let's move on to the best thing about this show. The first thing you'll realise about My Little Monster is that it's just enjoyable to look at. The characters could all be dressed as semi-eaten salmon carcasses and you'd still enjoy just watching it. \\n\r\nThis is what I believe slice of life art should like; while watching even the most mundane shit, plot-related or not, the blow is softened by active characters, attractive backgrounds, and there's something about a set of well-drawn eyes. Or maybe I'm just a little strange...\\n\r\nEither way, the art in this show is, in my opinion, worth the watch alone.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThere's not really much to say here that hasn't already been said in the other reviews, the music is above average and matches each scenario quite well, namely the brawling scenes and the emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nNow I don't particularly have anything against the characters in this show, in fact I quite like the side characters, they add a nice touch to the overall experience. Everyone feels different in their own way, not like some shows which copy-paste personalities until you feel like you're watching the Neo and Smith fight scene from Matrix Reloaded. Except Neo is also Smith, and they all blush at each other and call each other \"Smith-chan\".\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, I think my favourite character is Haru Yoshida, the male lead, and that's mostly because I like to think he's the only sane one in this world. He acts like a normal person for the first half of the show in a school where everyone has chronic social anxiety, and seeing him punch somebody with the force to rupture their spleen for living on the same planet as him is pretty entertaining in a mind-numbing kind of way. But despite his possibly psychotic behaviour, he tells the girl he likes he likes her, and then gets lead on like the pushover he turns into. He's dumb as a rock but the smartest person in school because anime, he's a god among men and has the strength of fifteen sexually frustrated gorillas because anime, and of course he has a harem as big as his hero-complex, because of course he does.\\n\\n\r\nThe same can't be said for Shizuku, the \"love interest\", if you call a few hugs and a joke kiss love. She spends the entire show putting everything before Yoshida, treating him like someone she barely even knows, and giving him the run-around by not clarifying on her love for him. She also says \"I need to think about our relationship\", and makes him wait a month. A MONTH. People have met and gotten married in less time. They are idiots, but that's why I believe it's a good comparison. She's cold, harsh, boring, selfish, self-centered, neglectful and all round a shitty person. The perfect catch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, maybe I was bit harsh on this show, after all anime is the same as any entertainment, it has to appeal to the biggest possible audience to make money, and unfortunately we live in a world where numbers matter more than creativity. Everybody's afraid to step out and try something new, and this is nothing more than another turd in the sewage pipe which that mentality has helped to build.\\n\r\nBut the wounds are still fresh from the disappointment this brought me. The reason is simple; I can see the potential, you and anybody else can see the potential if you watch it, but it's wasted, as it so frequently is lately. \\n\\n\r\nKeep the art, keep the sound, double the episodes and flesh out your characters, give us some payoff between the love interests, hell if you're feeling generous even give us a one-off OVA a year later showing them post-graduation. I would watch the shit out of that, but unfortunately, I don't see that happening. So this remains a disappointment to me.",

            "content": "Released in 2012. The ideal high school romance anime where the characters do a lot of monologue and their experience of love is highlighted in the show is a genre that was slowly shoved to the sidelines for a long time. The premise of the anime instantly grabs you. There is a girl who has no care for anything except her studies and a guy who is a brute but a gentle misunderstood soul. Their interaction was pretty fun to watch since the girl is the only person that can get close to the guy and the guy is annoying the hell out of thegirl. Little by little though, the relationship of the two gradually grows into something that is really adorable. The anime is pretty straight forward pretty much focusing on this story alone. That\u2019s right. There are no other love stories in the anime. Or rather, the anime was still building up one but it was surely not as important as the main love story. This was great thing because the story of the two characters is really fun to watch and their story might seem straight forward at first, but it eventually reveals some surprises you never expected the show to do. The characters are the ones that really made the show amazing. They\u2019re very interesting and utilized pretty nicely. Every character grows on you from the main to the side characters. Haru and Shizuku are just cute together and their character dynamic is pretty fun to watch. An unpredictable guy and girl who aren\u2019t fazed easily make for an interesting love story anime. This anime is not perfect and one of the reasons is because the primary focus of the show is the love story yet it was thinly spread out throughout the anime. There is a decent progression but the relationship of the characters are often dreadfully dragged that nothing satisfactory comes out of it. Majority of the episodes have the relationship on stand still going absolutely nowhere and you wait for a decent resolution only to be sorely disappointed. It was cute but thirteen episodes are too long for something cute that doesn\u2019t have much to tell. The character design is pretty decent. The characters have unique look to them.The animation is pretty decent as well. I say decent because there is enough to tell a story but you can see the quality differs from most episodes. One thing I noticed is the facial features often not having enough details in some episodes and there are scenes where just the mouth moves. The eyes don\u2019t even blink. The facial expressions are nicely animated though as well as the fight scenes. These are often the best moments. In the end I would say if you like romance go and watch this it\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s okay.",

            "content": "It was...all right.  The anime overall had very little driving plot, which can work out for an anime.  I'll reference Mushishi as a case-in-point.  This, however, is no Mushishi.  As in, there was no struggle to be had here, beyond the day in and day out life of the main characters (Shizuku, Haru and Asako).  This works early on as it establishes character personalities and traits, as well as their base motivations.  But then that's all there is.  Thirteen episodes of Shizuku and Haru falling, and then falling out, then falling in again, of love.  If youcan really ever call it that.  It's more along the lines of an infatuation, which is cute, but I see no further progress in their relationship past something like episode seven.  There is an introduction of a third interested party, but this love-triangle is only to distract you from the fact that nothing is actually happening.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime needs a second season.  I think they were perhaps leading up into getting one, but I've heard the sales haven't been good for this show, which is actually somewhat disappointing.  Maybe if they had given the fans some form of fulfillment there would be more people excited for this sort of series.  It's a good, solid and decent series.  Just don't expect anyone to get with anybody, and for characters you think to be relevant to drift away without a mention (like Shizuku's brother - only shown in a single episode being demonic).  There were too many loose strings by the end that the audience is left with absolutely zero fulfillment for their invested hours.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, this is a fun, quirky, and bright series.  I adored the opening.  The rooster was entertaining.  The characters and amusing mood shifts are worth the twenty minutes per episode.  Shizuku is a blessing and a cool, refreshing breeze to the heroines of other romantic animes; she sticks up for herself, doesn't just roll over when male characters get possessive, and she isn't, well, stupid to put it bluntly.  But failure to deliver on teased back story events, failure to give me a proper resolution, and a failure to uphold the base promise of a romance (characters actually getting somewhere in a relationship and us actually seeing that physically, somehow) makes My Little Monster a seven in my books.\\n\\n\r\nI hope the manga has that sense of fulfillment I'm looking for, as that's slated to finish up in August.",

She was, in essence, who I was through my school years. \r\nI loved the fact that she was not just another girl who fell in love at first sight, but rather was genuinely focused on her studies and tried so hard to keep her focus despite her growing crush on Haru.\r\nHaru, on the other hand, is wonderfully eccentric, not at all yet another knight in shining armour, ora perfect prince. He has faults that are utterly cute yet realistic, but his brunt honesty really drew me in as well. It doesn't hurt that something about his look also made me squeeeeeal (those eyes! that floppy hair! that mischievous yet innocent smile!)\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to be a fun, light watch, a very good rom-com. While it didn't give me any deep life lessons, it was well worth watching for a little reminisce about my school days.",

This anime was a very good one, so please, make another season. I have fallen in love with Mizutani, Shizuku. I enjoyed the story very sincerely, how a girl, who is very deep in her studies, but then falls in love with a trouble maker. The thing is Haru, said he loved her,but he didn't mean it like that, yet. Therefore later on, Mizutani, Shizuku fell in love with him, but Haru does not love her like that.She say's she'll wait for him to fall in love with her. Then a few months pass by, she realizes her grades have took a toll, do to her feelings, towards another human. So she then has time to talk to him, and tell's him she's not attracted to him anymore, but the time she said that, Haru fell in love with her. Then another boy has came into the picture, which Haru knows of, therefore Haru get's jealous and suspicious. Kenji Yamaguchi, the other boy, has fallen in love with Shizuku, and they have cram school together, but before that Shizuku thinks it out, and tells Haru he has nothing to worry, because she's in love with him. Later on they meet up, the day after new years and she, thinks to herself, she wishes one day where she can look beside her and feel affection for the boy standing beside her. Thank you this was my review, the story was very brilliant, please make a season two. It's also weird how I have fallen in love with Shizuku. That will be all, Thank you, also I dream of an Anime world to exist. Also to have the same Love story, but it's impossible. So I get depressed and sometimes cry. Oh it's weird for a 14 year old boy to cry isn't it.",

            "content": "Why do I sometimes think of Shakespeare's \"Taming of the Shrew\" when I see the chaotic and misunderstood yet super cute relationship between Shizuku and Haru? Maybe because it sometimes feels like the two protagonists are struggling to come to terms with each others feelings in quite ridiculous ways! I grew to really like the characters and themes of this anime, and even though I haven't finished watching it yet, I think it deserves a review.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis anime really surprised me with its originality, it's not quite the cute lovey dovey story of high school students. Shizuku is a self-focused study freak who, at first,is forced to deliver school handouts and messages to Haru, who is known to be a serious troublemaker. He mistakes her actions as acts of friendship and starts following her around everywhere. Little does Shizuku realise that she slowly starts falling for Haru, and the rest of the story is about how these characters come to terms with their feelings. Thrown into this romance are some hilarious and silly moments, especially because Haru and Shizuku are almost polar opposites, so they end up confusing themselves over whether they like each other. The mix of comedy and romance makes this anime very easy to watch, particularly because the story itself is driven from the eccentricity of the characters and their nature, so you really get comfortable with the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are what really make this anime special: you've got your opposite two protagonists (a girl who loves studying and has only ever cared about grades, and a misunderstood delinquent of a boy who is actually craving for friendship on the inside). On top of that you have a bunch of interesting friends: a shy school-rep who doesn't fit in with her peers, a cute classmate who cherishes her online communities and a baseball player who just goes with the flow. What is unique here is that although everyone in this anime is different in their own right, they all have the desire to make and maintain friends (except Shizuku, who then slowly realises the value of friendship). Even beyond romance, one of the key themes of this anime explores what it means to be a friend; and I think on that level, although the characters are ostensibly hilarious together as a group of friends, you really get to learn how they feel as they develop these bonds with each other. I really loved the character development in all the characters in this anime, particularly in Haru and Shizuku! And don't forget our beloved rooster that Haru just decides to bring in to school... he also has some exciting moments lol!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI thought the characters were nicely drawn, their expressions and looks definitely suited their inner character whilst maintaining the elegance of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI actually noticed that the background music in this anime is extremely adorable and comical. It feels like if I played that music and went for a walk down the park that a random Haru look-alike holding a rooster will pop out of nowhere! And the opening theme song is super cute, gets me hyped for each episode haha!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nGotta love this complicated but very intriguing romance story that's chock-a-block full of awkward and hilarious moments! I just loved the characters and I loved the drama that they created between themselves. I was surprised at how I kept watching episode after episode non-stop, maybe because it is not your ordinary school romance, which I kind of like seeing.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for something refreshing with a large variety of characters and a whole lot of romance and friendship drama, then this is perfect for you, so do check it out!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Scrolling down the Shoujo genre on My Anime List, I stumbled upon a rather interesting show from 2012. The slice-of-life/shoujo/school anime promised a cute romance and good comedy in 13 episodes. Question is, did the anime actually hold on to the things it promised? \"My Little Monster\" is quite unusual for an anime title but as such, it clearly caught my attention. \r\nPLOT AND STORY LINE \ud83d\udcdc\r\nMost of the shoujo anime we know involve one shy and socially awkward character on one, and a popular and outgoing character on the other side of the romance. But what happens if neither of the characters is sociallyawkward nor shy, but still don't have any friends because of their 'special' behavior? Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun gives the answer in a fresh anime atmosphere that really shows that the producers tried to make a different shoujo show.\\n\r\nIn the middle of the story we have Mizutani Shizuku, a rather apathetic girl who cares about one thing only-her grades. But her cold nature would soon start to fade after she meets the violent troublemaker Yoshida Haru. Much to her surprise, there is a lot more to Haru than just his violent behavior, which she would eventually find out after the two become really close.\\n\r\nEven though Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun differs from other shoujo anime in terms of characters, other elements are still present. So, you get for example, not one, but two love triangles involving the main characters in only 13 episodes. Which brings us to the next point-the ROMANCE.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to that, it is like TNKK committed a serious crime in the shoujo world by putting a clear love confession right in the beginning. I know, shocking right? To think that a shoujo anime character would confess his/her feelings right in the beginning and so omit confusion and awkward moments between the two main characters, is absolutely barbaric (*meme material*). Kidding, even though one side of the romance is clear, the other one gets pretty confused not knowing what to do with the new feelings and so ruins all the potential the show actually had.\\n\r\nFrom there on, the show literary goes nowhere. The main story line gets all messed up, the romance part slowly fades as the main characters grow further apart and all that leads to a unfinished story that had the chance to hit it big. I don't know what happens in the manga later on, but they could've at least made a decent season finale. In this way we are literary left with nothing.\\n\r\nOn thing that Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun did extremely good, is the comedy. Haru is an extremely funny  character and all he does is just hilarious. So, you might not enjoy the story and the romance of the anime that much, but it is perfect if you just want to chill and have a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69\\n\\n\r\nJust as it happens in a lot of the other shoujo anime, most of the characters in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun have superficial personality and a minimum of (or even non) character development. Just the two mains, Shizuku and Haru had more depth in their personalities and some detail in character, but the rest is just...meh. Asako was the annoying side-kick, Kenji the pitiful side-kick, Yuuzan (Haru's brother)who was about to put some drama in the anime but nothing actually happened in the end, and there was Sasahara, who literary showes up every here and there but doesn't actually contribute to the story. I was also annoyed by Shizuku so I won't be talking about her, but I did love Haru. As said, he is a hilarious character that contributed the most to the comedy factor of the anime. He also doesn't get any character development but I like him just the way he is.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udcbb\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the animation was quite satisfactory and enjoyable to watch but it was the style of the anime that made it look this good. Especially the detail in the character design like hair and eyes and the backgrounds were so amazingly done. I certainly loved it and thumbs up for that.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION  \ud83d\udccc\\n\\n\r\nDespite having the potential to be an amazing anime different form other shoujo shows, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun remains an average show whose story literary goes nowhere. No story development also means no development for many of the superficial characters. Still, TNKK had an ace up its sleeve and it was the main character of the anime-Haru. He was the reason I actually liked the show and the reason why most of us might actually enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend it, but it is still a fine anime that won't be a waste of your time if you actually gave it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nwww.worldofanimegirl.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Love is spontaneous, love is unexpected: it has no pattern and cannot be forecast. It is that very nature of romance, that makes it exciting, disconsolate, and serene in an unlikely combination, whose variety makes it irrefutably the spice of life.  Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (My little monster) is a charming slice of life drama, that emphasizes the atypical strangeness surrounding love and romance- and if you let it- can take your breath away. My little monster is a show blessed with a great cast of interesting characters, a beautifully composed soundtrack, well drawn art and animation - and unlike a great many romcoms- asupporting cast that has it's own interesting conflicts and struggles; however, despite all those positives, the show still somehow disappointed me, ultimately leaving me winded, a screeching voice at the back of my mind saying, \u201cis that-- it?!?\u201d. \\n\r\n      Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\u2019s biggest issue lies in it\u2019s plot. Before I really begin to hammer this story with my abusive comments, I have to establish the fact that I hold the Manga in the highest esteem, and my disappointment solely lies in what could have been. My little monster, despite all its\u2019 resources, suffers from hollowness. Every good story has a heart- a central message that the plot runs on. For Tonari no kaibutsu-kun, the story was forcibly skinned from the body, leaving a hollow imitation of the original plot. It runs in the same order as the source, but is missing its limbs. It laughs and cries, despite the fact that it does not feel. The story was all in all disturbing to me, like seeing an uncomfortably life-like humanoid in the place of a human being. As disappointing as this was however, it was not a surprise. The mistranslation of a book to video is a trend in film work, so this was only natural from that perspective; although, it was unexpected for an anime adaption of a manga, as traditionally- in my experience- very little is lost in translation from the two mediums. The case here was very different, as I have made clear, as the anime managed to lose the entire purpose and central idea of the story: which, in turn, has caused a fair amount of rust to set into a piece of work that originally shined with brilliance. \\n\r\n       A corroded plot aside, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun excels in its characters and their relationships. Despite a rather light-hearted and trepid plot, due to missing elements from the manga, My Little Monster\u2019s characters are still lovable, interesting, and relatable to the viewer. Their awkwardness and irregular behavior add depth and allow what would have been a typical, simplistic, slice of life love comedy to hold the viewer\u2019s attention and keep them interested despite of a seemingly motionless plot. From Shizuku\u2019s anti-social, emotionless attitude and unwavering intent on studying, to Haru\u2019s rambunctious mood swings and social awkwardness; My Little Monster has two very strange \u201cmonsters\u201d at the helm of the story. The captivating ups and downs of two people opening their hearts for the first time manages to redeem a directionless plot, and capture the audience\u2019s attention in the moment. \\n\r\n      The spotlight of this show however, belongs to a well composed score that perfectly parallels the emotions and mood of the story. Where the music really shines in My Little Monster, is in the pretty moments, when it gets to express a quiet and gentle romance in the serene sounds the score provides: whether it be on the stairs overlooking the sunset over the city, or on a bright afternoon sitting atop the school rooftop gazing up at the sky, our protagonists are given beautiful backdrops of sound to match the feelings in their hearts. It is able to draw the audience much closer into the feelings of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\u2019s characters, and allow us to associate with its individuals through more than just sympathetic thoughts, but through empathetic feelings. The music does have its flaws though, much of which is not the fault of the composer but rather the editor. The introduction of suspenseful music in encounters are misused due to the show\u2019s failure to visualize it, leaving the viewers feeling the tension from the score, then feeling confused due to not actually seeing any conflict to match the mood created by the soundtrack. This is caused by some lousy arrangements which cut short much of the material needed to detail the conflict that this music was originally made for. \\n\r\n      The art for Tonari no Kaibutsu kun isn\u2019t especially new or unique, nor is it ridiculously high quality animation like what you would expect from a Kyoto animation project, but still manages to be perfect without trying too hard. The characters look precisely as they should, reflective of their respective personalities and look distinct but not ridiculous (I\u2019m terribly happy to see them avoid rainbow colored hairstyles), all of which add to the realism of the work, which was honestly a good decision. A show\u2019s art can either make it serious and grim, or light hearted and cheerful. Much like Director Hayao Miyazaki (as he stated once in an interview regarding the anime industry suffering from otaku), I personally believe that unrealistic portrayals of the characters that make up our lives in anime are hard to relate to and generally meaningless. So every little detail and effort that goes toward making a story more realistic and relatable is a good effort. So, despite a lack of extravagance and showiness, My Little Monster\u2019s art is still the best it can be for the story of life it wishes to tell. \\n\r\n     Overall, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (the anime) has a lot going for it: a nice source to draw the plot from, a good array of characters, superb music, and art that is suitable and nice to look at. However, because of bad overall editing, and a failure by the director to understand the central message of the original work, it is nothing but a pretty face concealing a bland interior. This show, despite how lost it is, will make you feel happiness, anger, and sadness, but will leave you disappointed with all the questions you still need answered by the end. It will make you love the characters that star in its story, but won\u2019t manage to give them a satisfying send-off. What would have been a hugely successful, two seasons long anime with twenty five episodes per season, became one thirteen episode long chunk of the manga that would fail to have a clear reason and conclusion. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is not dreadful, it is by all means a lovely appetizer, an antipasti to spark our appetite and get us ready for the main course. That big meal being the manga written by author Robico, which concludes the story of the characters viewers will grow to feel attached to by the end of this slice of life, shoujo anime. Lets just say that TNKK is going to disappoint you: no viewer ever wants to watch something full of potential fall onto its back, there is nothing to be disappointed about if you never get your hopes up, so in a way, because of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\u2019s beautiful music, art, general concept, and how much it got me to care about its characters, I was far more disappointed than I would have been had I not cared at all. So despite it lacking the criteria of a great story as a standalone TV show, it still deserves to be recognized as a good stepping stone to the source content, and appreciated for what it does do well as the appetizer that it is.",

            "content": "Very cute anime with good progression in each episode! Watching the first episode will definitely grasp your attention immediately. The first episode is one of the quickest progressions in any anime I've seen. A liking of someone, a confession and a kiss all in the first episode! The main element of this anime is it's comedy as well as the comical pairing up between a study bug and someone with no social cues nor social intelligence. They couldn't be any more different, but at the same time couldn't be any more similar in that they are both lonely. \r\nThe main character Haru is very directwith his feelings towards Shizuku. He is often misjudged for his actions but he is genuinely a kind and loving person. His love for Shizuku is extremely great. Shizuku on the other hand is forced to make a decision between her studies and her love for Haru. In this sense, it is quite relateable in the real world where people are often pressured into choosing one over the other. Shizuku, through her character development in the anime, slowly learns to discover that this is not necessarily the case. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime explores how loneliness is a very depressing situation to be in through the characters of Haru, Shizuku and Natsume each for their very own reasons. Haru because of his erratic behaviour, Shizuku by choice and Natsume because of her superior kawai-ness to her fellow classmates, leading to her being singled out. Also Natsume is one of the most kawaii characters ever in the anime universe! \\n\\n\r\nAn example of Haru's erratic nature is when he started a fight with a stranger telling them how \"gorillas could communicate with their eyes\" haha! Another funny thing with this anime is its unpredictability. When you think the characters take one step forward in their relationship, they go 2 steps backwards! \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful. The piano soundtrack (especially the main one) is very beautiful and soothing. It really matches the scenes. Overall a very enjoyable anime! The ending isn't bad but reading the manga will give a sense of completeness!",

I was full of hope from those first 4-5 chapters, but it just lead nowhere from there.

And to top it off, we get another final episode that seems like goddamn filler. Worst episode of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I loved this shit. The comedy was great, the characters lovely, and all the other sides of the story other than the relationship between the two mains was soooo good. \\n\\n\r\nAltogether, loved it, but still a lot of wasted potential. If it was handled properly this could have gone up to the level of Toradora, but since that was not the case, it just became another fairly allright romcom. Still, would recommend it.",

            "content": "(Mild-spoilers discusses romance between the main two characters - but that should be obvious from the synopsis)\r\nSUMMARY\r\nThe series starts out well for the first 5 episodes but soon falls apart, as the male lead reveals himself to be an insensitve and somewhat abusive character, with no personal development or redeeming himself as the show goes on. This is despite the female lead becoming a more developed charcter in contrast. The series is not helped by the fact that after episode 13 the manga still continues on, leaving no room for closure in the show. It would've been great if things could've been completely wrapped upbut as it I wouldn't recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW\\n\r\nFirstly, the show starts off really well. Both leads are presented as interesting characters. Shizuku Mizutani is a headstrong, academic and competitive girl - focussing on her studies more than anything else around her, including even friends. Haru Yoshida on the other hand is a deeply troubled young man, who although smart himself, seems to have very deep rooted social and behavioural issues and has isolated himself from others. As the two spend time together viewers are treated to moments of charm and sweet supporting interactions between the two, where two socially inept characters become closer. Surprisingly for a shoujo anime the main charcters often talk very open and honestly about how they feel towards each other and their own thoughts. The first 2 episodes are great examples of this, with virtually little misunderstadning, mumblings or cliches. Though in stark contrast there are moments of violent and threatening outbursts from Haru that really throw things off later on.\\n\\n\r\nHaru's verbal threats to others are quite shocking, as well the threats of violence - they are extreme given the contexts. At times Haru is fighting to stick up for others being bullied which is an endearing trait, and at other times he is fighting and threatening others with harm as he becomes possessive over Shizuku. The switch in behaviour would be great if the narrative decided to follow a really sinister plotline, or a comedic romance plotline - but as it jumps between the two it becomes really jarring.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku ends up falling for Haru, and the devlopment of the attraction is well presented from her perspective. At no point do you feel this is contrived by overt gestures or tropes. As the story progresses you soon realise the two really don't have a clue as to what a \"healthy\" relationship should be. However as things develop Shizuku find's herself having to manage Haru's jealousy and anger (and violent outbursts) - it gets to point where she ends up having to bargain with him often(\"If you behave and promise not to fight, I'll go out on a date with you\"), as well as dealing with his forced physical approaches.\\n\\n\r\nOver the 13 episodes Shizuku is the only one that really show's some personal growth, while Haru remains the same as always - never seeming to be able to redeem himself or improve his behaviour, which is a shame. Maybe this could be addressed if there was ever a season 2 (note the manga goes further from where the anime ends).\\n\\n\r\nSpecial mention should go the supporting characters - especially the ditsy Asako Natsume and likeable Souhei Sasahara. All are well realised, and display their own want's and desires. Asako's arc towards the end is worth special mention - and lightens the mood on the rest of Shizuku-Haru's relationship. You also can't help but feel there is a deep secret that would explain Haru's behaviour - and the screen time given to Haru's brother, Yuuzan Yoshida, hints at that but sadly not explored. This ends making it very difficult to empathise with Haru for most of his behaviour.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise the quality is good, no over excessive use of still screens and the sound is fair with a good slection os supporting music that sets the moods for scenes really well.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nOn the whole, I would've really liked the idea of two socially awkard people that are not sure what a healthy relationship looks, but end up with one being in an abusive and controlling relationship. Unfortuantely, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun really misses the boat on this. What could've been a great exploration of two people finding love, lust, jealously, friendship, romance, fear, anger... is instead just a bit of a narrative mess with only Shizuku ever \"trying\", and the male lead being insufferable throughout. I would avoid this one.",

The main characters are Shizuku, a social shut-in who is obsessed with studying, and Haru, a juvenile delinquent who was suspended on the first day (and this isn't the first time either). \r\nI am a sucker for slice life anime that have a story surrounding romance.  I saw a few snippets of the show in a YouTube video and the art style jumped out at me as very visually appealing.  The little details I got about the series made me want to watch more and so Idecided to give the show a shot. \\n\\n\r\nI want to start off by saying My Little Monster is a decent show.  I really loved the color palettes for both the characters and the backgrounds.  The voice acting is pretty solid and the soundtrack if pretty moving.  It also has some legitimately funny moments in the show and as Japanese comedy typically doesn't translate into laughs for me, that's an accomplishment.  The side characters are also not merely window dressing.  Moreover, while all the characters exemplify some pretty well worn tropes (the completely socially muted, the pretty girl without friends, the vanilla best friend, the rich-attractive rival), they also give a fair bit of depth so that no one is too stereotypical among the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the series suffers from is both bad pacing and too few episodes to accomplish its narrative, which is ultimately why I can't give this show anything over a \"Good\" rating.  The story goes back and forth with the two characters confessing for their feels, with the other having swung the other way and being unsure/confused.  It felt like a see-saw that when finally the other parties feel like reciprocating the emotion, the other one is at the opposite end of feelings. And perhaps that is what the series is going for, that these two people, for as much as they go back and forth really do like the status quo of the not-quite-dating relationship. If that's the case, its very well-done but it also is a bit unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I also do like that we have two character archetypes as the main love birds and both are socially absent minded for different reasons, there are points where I have to try and struggle to remember why these two actually like each other.  In fact, although I am not one of these \"best girl/best guy\" proponents, the romantic rival vying for Shizuku's affections seems like a much better fit and indeed person than Haru.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the series length, there simply isn't enough to have a complete narrative.  Shizuku is obsessed with studying but there is no real great explanation for why she has sacrificed nearly all social relations for this goal.  We never find out what really is driving this compulsive need to the best.   With Haru it is hinted that he has a pretty traumatic past but we only gets very brief glimpses in it, and certainly not enough to understand his terror at his brother.  And the final episode...\\n\\n\r\nThere are no spoilers to say that it literally resolves nothing.  If anything, it could be compared to the infamous filler episodes in shonen in that it does really nothing to advance the plot and just involves some crazy hijinks involving Haru, a rooster and a lightning bug.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed My Little Monster, which again I have to say I did, I'd recommend watching Tora Dora, which does a much better job with the opposites-attract motif. The premise is a lot more interesting, the narrative is much better developed and you legitimately root for two to get together.",

The characters in the anime don\"t know what love is and are trying to figure it out themselves. Add in a female main who only cares about her grades and a guy main character who is a thug with a good heart in the inside. The story is very sloppy and very repetitious as it keeps back peddling every episode. I understood that you are trying to be unique but i mean come on, i want development and progress. The art was standardand the music was OK. I actually really enjoyed all the characters a lot ass they were unique and refreshing. However their lack of development was the only thing bothering me with the character. In general i see what they were trying to get at with this anime, but due to the sloppy story and the lack of character development it wasn't as good. Even though i have been bashing the anime, there are people that think that the story was well done in a sense. So all i can say is try it out and see if you like it.\\n\\n",

Especially our main male love interest is a very comedic and intriguing person, making decisions which lead to hilarious outcomes, keeping the anime somewhat refreshing. The other characters are rather bland though, and our main female love interest isn't particularly revolutionary.\r\nThe sound and art are fine, but they aren't anything special, nor do they add to the experience.They do the job just fine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the enjoyment is okay, but you shouldn't expect anything too interesting.

To my understanding the manga actually has a ending to it so i would say to read the manga first that way you know whats up cause i dont and im gonna go read the manga after i write this short review cause lets be real you dont need someone writing a whole damn essay to tell you if its good.",

            "content": "Contains spoilers\r\nWhat exactly was My Little Monster? A bowl full of potential poured down the drain. A group of characters who would be interesting to watch in many kinds os stories, if well developed, but it wasn't the case here.\r\nFirst of all I'm letting Oshima the class rep out of this because she entered the story late, didn't do anything useful and then left, even if Shizuku narrated in the first episode that she had \"a lot to talk about her\".\r\nOut of the main 5 characters, Sasayan is by far the least developed. As being part of the group, he is expected to have arole in the story, but it just passes around him. He's a friendly baseball player, and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nNow with the ones who had some kind of arc, Yamaken surprised me. I first thought he would be just a douchebag antagonist, but his view of the world changing when he fell in love with Shizuku was the most interesting thing in the later episodes. He doesn't stop acting like a sociopath, though. The only result of these changes is being the third-wheel of the main couple, but for some reason he just gives up in the end.\\n\r\nThe main guy, Haru, has a rough backstory with his brother, father and deceased aunt. That influenced him to be the way he is with Shizuku, but what about the \"evil brother's evil plan\"? Forgotten, just like Yuzan, who vanishes after his third appearance.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Shizuku, the protagonist, I've got to say she changed A LOT. She was cold, emotionless, felt no remorse regards anything and only cared about her studies. She stopped being like that, experienced new sensations, and found a new way of living in general... in the first 3 episodes. All of it is discarded. She comes back to study, being like a robot for the rest of the season. Sometimes she goes out to do something else, only when the story forces her to do so (like when a friend is in serious trouble). A lot happens to imply that she is changing her way of being, like the conversation she had with Yamaken at the library. But what exactly changes? In every episode, she has a \"Yeah it would be fun to date Haru\" moment, and then she goes back to being a study-slave. Damn, even in vacation she doesn't stop solving math problems. And what is the reason why she is so obsessed with being the best one in school? What are her motivations? We never know. Same with her brief family introduction.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the most wronged character, the bookmark girl Natsume, the main reason I started watched this show. Having a cheerful, best girl personality, you are expected to like her, and I did. But her story is like a car who loses its track, crashes into a gas tank and explodes.\\n\r\nWe see her as a cute girl who is excluded from society and doesn't have any friends in real life. Her main goals is to be friends with Shizuku and Haru and having them be together. In the mid-season she falls for Min, Haru's cousin, and tries to show him her feelings. When she does this in new years party, all she gets is a silent rejection and a depressing, solitary walk home. This could be where Sasayan might be handful, but he decides to leave her suffering alone. And what was the point of her story? Like most of the other ones', it has no conclusion, just suffering after suffering without any changes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to say about the last episode? Horrifying. After Nagoya went missing and most of the characters met again, I thought it would be a chance for something to happen. But nothing actually happens. Yamaken has a chance to make a move but he just leaves. His last encounter with Shizuku on the streets, such as all the characters' meeting, was meaningless. The last scene with the stagnated main couple was also awful, and makes you think that they're now worse than when they started. Natsume doesn't getting a talk with her crush's unfinished business and being bullied by some pervs for the rest of the episode, just to end the season walking back with Sasayan after a pointless search, was by far the worst thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this anime isn't trash, nor a very bad one. It's just meaningless, the characters have no actual development and their stories are pointless. I enjoyed some scenes and some of it was funny, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "I LOVED THIS ANIME. I haven't marathoned an entire series in one sitting in a while; I watched the first two at a club screening, then later restarted the series and ended up finishing all 13 episodes in a row. I'm wondering why I haven't heard about Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (TNK) before. Watching this showed me what a romance slice of life anime could do to your heart; it pulled at my heartstrings so, so much, and there were so many moments when I thought/said to myself \"that's so... sweet.\" Typically when I start new anime the first episode doesn't enthrall me too much; usuallyit's after seeing episode 2 that I really want to see the rest. But TNK was riveting from the very beginning. It was surprisingly pretty fast-paced. In 13 episodes a lot happens. A myriad jewels of friendship and love brim in the air. The pot is full, like, all the time.\\n\\n\r\nHARU YOSHIDA. This kid. He's so damn innocent! A delinquent who avoids going to school because other students fear him. Tends to get into fights easily. Has no friends. Doesn't understand a lot about the world. But I loved all of it. The seiyuu work was done brilliantly to convey his range of emotions, from inquisitiveness to anger to bashfulness. Watching him and the other main character, Shizuku Mizutani, was enough to make me glued to the screen. Both characters grew up with basically no friends, Haru as I explained, and Shizuku because she only cared about her grades. I've never seen a person, in real life, literature, film, or anime that's as diligent as she is. I must say she's either highly motivated or just plain obsessed. Anyways, human psychology plays a huge part in this anime. As both Haru and Shizuku are new to the sociable setting, it's not surprising that when they befriend each other as their first true friends this friendship evolves into something greater. As obvious as it may seem, it's not that simple. Robico delved very deeply into the emotions and inner thoughts of Shizuku as she struggles to understand her new feelings. As she tries to examine her relationship with Haru and not just her grades. Human love is a very powerful emotion. I'll just say that it doesn't only involve these two in TNK. The ways it can affect and change people. As an introverted person myself who finds it difficult to interact comfortably with most people, I could understand all too painfully this endearing couple. However, I've never experienced \"true\" love, whether one- or two-sided, so TNK was enlightening in a way.\\n\\n\r\nThere seems to be a prevailing theme and motif of human bonding in the anime universe. I wonder if that's a byproduct of adolescent society of Japan -- for whatever reasons, they appear to cherish social interaction, friendship and love. SO MANY (and this is a good thing, a magnificent thing; it's always wondrous to gaze at on the screen) anime series deal with this in some way, no matter the genre, whether it's shounen or slice of life or what have you. It's amazing -- I'm glad, actually that I entered this amazing universe relatively late, when I was more mature and able to understand the plots and characters. If I had begun my anime journey in elementary or middle school, I would have watched some anime without truly being able to appreciate and adore it. Anime, unlike its prevalent stereotype, is NOT puerile and childish. There is a plethora of anime out there with deep, dark, poignant, salient themes vis-\u00e0-vis the human condition and mankind as a whole. Other mediums like literature and film may do the same, and I know being a former bibliophile myself; but anime -- but anime, like raise it on a platform to the heavens above and call down the empyrean lightning -- for anime does it so blindingly well! American television in terms of emotive quality is like a child compared to the god standards of anime. TNK showed me this fact in 13 episodes. And this oh so endearing fact is not just contained to 13 episodes, but rather in the tens of thousands within the anime universe.\\n\\n\r\nNow back to TNK. The soundtrack was also done very well. I really liked the recurring track Tetsukazu no Kanjou (don't look it up until you've finished the anime if you want the full viewing experience). In all scenes, the music matched the emotions superbly, and the fade-outs of sound were done superbly as well. The opening was okay. The ending was one of those endings that surpasses the opening, which doesn't happen often, but all things concerned the ending was undesired, for whenever it came up it meant the episode was over. I WANT MORE TONARI NO KAIBUTSU-KUN ANIME. I'm definitely going to read the manga now. 13 episodes was 13 episodes of sheer magnificence, but still too few for my liking. Just like how Angel Beats! ended after 13 episodes and Tokyo Ghoul ended after two seasons of 12 episodes each and God Eater ended after 13 episodes and... for those with remaining material, I beseech the anime industry to make more seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation done by studio Brain's Base. I'm starting to dislike the part 1, \"Rate the Anime\" section above the review because, for example, the quality of an anime's art is largely influenced by the studio's budget and its own style of animation. ufotable, for instance, reaches a near-photographic level of visual quality sometimes and in my opinion does the best job at in-depth detail to the art (i.e. Fate/Zero, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, God Eater). On the other hand, Studio Pierrot did Naruto and Bleach and since those are long-running shounen they couldn't pay too much detail to the art like they did with Tokyo Ghoul, which is a 2-cour anime and was animated very well. Now Brain's Base (notable for Durarara!!, Baccano!, and others) draws its characters more flatly and with less attention to detail, but if it could animate its works better it would, obviously. So I'm saying that if I were to compare the art of TNK to the likes of ufotable, it's not that good, but taken at eye level -- when I'm watching it, that is -- it's still good. Honestly the animation doesn't matter that much, once you encounter the different characters and the plot it's just the conduit through which such elements are presented. It's not what's truly important.\\n\\n\r\nIf TNK has flaws, I'd say it's its length (too short, as I mentioned earlier), the mediocre opening, and... and, I think that's it. TNK is such a lovely story of two formerly friendless people trying to understand what it means to love another in a romantic way. I thank Robico, Brain's Base, and everyone else involved with the creation of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun. Anime like this makes me want to be a better man, to understand other humans better, and ultimately to watch more anime to see if I can experience more of the emotions I felt when watching it.",

But trivial drama that I just never found particularly interesting kept bogging it down. Whenever it took a serious tone, I found myself quickly losing interest. And it was serious more often then I preferred.\r\nThe romance was strong in the beginning and had a great pace. But then the writers chose to take a giant step back in our leads blossoming relationship followed by episode after episode of relationship stalling, and I just didn't enjoy that. Our leads were too cute and fun together for thereto be any reason for keeping them apart for so long.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters were a bit of a let down for me. I never found Shizuku particularly interesting, although I never hated her either. Apart from Oshima, I never felt particularly connected to any of Shizuku and Haru\u2019s friends. I just never really cared about any of them.\\n\\n\r\nBut Haru was so wild and crazy that I couldn\u2019t help but love him. He\u2019s the reason I stuck it out all 13 episodes. I probably wouldn\u2019t have finished this series if it hadn\u2019t been for him.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is pretty standard for this type of anime. I neither loved it nor hated it.\\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion:\\n\r\nThis anime started out great. Things were light and fun and unpredictable. But then the storyline became kind of tedious, and I didn\u2019t enjoy it much after that. I won't say this anime was a total disappointment, because there is a lot about it I enjoyed. But I can't say I absolutely loved this series either. For me, it's a bit of a mixed bag.",

Haru was so cute and super sweet to Shizuku and he tried to get her to hang out with him but all she cared about was her studies. I thought that throughout the anime she would learn that school isn't everything and that it's okay to miss some answers on tests, but she didn't. There were some instances where she would let loose but then her final grade would be one point less then what she wanted it to be and she would bury herself back in books and shutHaru and everyone else out. I just felt like the anime ended very abruptly. For instance, I was happy when one of the side characters finally confessed her love to another, but it never showed what happened after that. I was waiting so long for her to confess her love and when she finally did, I didn't get to see his response. I would have enjoyed this show a little more if there was more romance and less complaining. The creators didn't go wrong with the comedy though. I was laughing through the entire show.\u00a0",

            "content": "Doomed by possibly the worst couple I've seen in anime- and I've watched Oreimo.\r\nHere's the thing about high school romcoms like My Little Monster: they pretty much live or die on the quality of the main couple. That's why shows like Lovely Complex or Kimi ni Todoke succeed despite not necessarily doing anything to re-invent the wheel, so to speak. On that note, I ask 3 simple questions. Is the protagonist likable? Is the main love interest likable? Is their chemistry good? In the case of this particular show, it's a resounding 0 for 3.\r\nLet's start with the main character, Shizuku. She likes to studyand is generally cold to others around her. Not off to a great start. But what's worse is how much the author attempted to make the connection between the two. As if it is literally impossible to take school seriously and be a decent human being. It was honestly borderline insulting. And as far as development, don't get your hopes up. Overall, just a really, really poor main character.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the main love interest, Haru. Aka the \"monster\" in the title. He is wild delinquent, and apparently that characteristic was supposed to explain away all his abhorrent behavior. He inexplicably falls in love with our charmless protagonist and things go from bad to worse for his character. A brief overview of some of his actions to follow: he essentially threatens to sexually assault Shizuku, aggressively stalks her, gets violently jealous anytime a guy as much as talks to her, gets into fights because of this, accidentally punches her and draws blood twice, and in one instance when he's in the dog house licks her hand when she is handing him something. Really think about that last one. Another human being, whom do not want licking your hand, suddenly doing so out of the blue. *shudders* But, like Shizuku, this is all sort of shrugged off, like it's just \"Haru being Haru, what a goofball\". And again, if you're wondering about development, don't get your hopes up. Overall, maybe the worst love interest I've come across in the genre.\\n\\n\r\nBut you might be thinking, hey, maybe they're not super likable, but they could be cute together. Noooope. Individually they're pretty awful, and yet they somehow find a way to come together to make something even worse. None of their interactions are the least bit endearing or natural. Do you know that \"aww\" feeling you get watching a cute anime couple? Whatever the opposite of \"aww\" is, that would described this couple. My ideal fanfiction for this series would be for one of them to move to the other side of the planet and never see the other again. But for now, I'll just be satisfied knowing they have yet to invade our screens for a 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point you might be asking why I devoted so much time to talking about the main couple. And the answer to that is there just isn't much else going on. Haru's brother showed up at one point to try to get him to return home and one of Shizuku's friends had a crush on Haru's older cousin, but neither of those story-lines went anywhere interesting. So, like I said at the beginning, the whole anime basically hinged on the main couple.\\n\\n\r\nBut as far as the art and sound go, they were both solid. The OP was quite catchy and colorful in particular. I don't really have any strong thoughts on the VA's performances, but they were at least adequate. The character designs were pleasant to look at, but maybe not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\ntl;dr: awful, awful, awful main couple turn what would've been an average high school romcom into the worst shoujo I've had the displeasure of watching.",

            "content": "The rooster was, hands down, my favorite character.\r\nUm, this anime... well, it was different. It wasn't totally unique, but I can say that I've never seen anything quite like it. I guess let's start with the art and sound. The art style is sort of sketchy, at least in its environmental elements. The colors were very saturated, so it did make many of the scenes quite beautiful, but I think overall, the art style was simplistic. That isn't a bad thing, though. The sound was average. That's all.\r\nOkay, the story. It was kind of nonexistent. There was an element of storytelling happening with the twomain characters since they had a romance going on, but other than that, the plot didn't have all that much direction. I'm not saying that's a negative, but this isn't an anime you can come to for a good story. It's just an anime where you'll hang out with the characters until it ends.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they're probably simultaneously the best and worst parts of this anime. On the slightly negative side, they weren't consistent characters at all. Their motivations and feelings changed at the drop of a hat, so it made it difficult to keep up with each character and who they were. On the other hand, they were also all very entertaining. There was enough character development and backstory in this anime to keep me interested in them and coming back for more. \\n\\n\r\nWhat would I do to make this anime better? I really don't know because the charm of it might be lost should it become more consistent, but at the same time, it isn't as good as it could've been. I think that maybe the characters' stories were book-ended too soon. It felt like the anime left them in the middle of their development, so that was sort of disappointing. I don't know if I'd recommend this anime to anyone, but it was interesting for the duration that I watched it for. Do with that what you will, and if you do decide to watch it, be prepared for a whole lot of weird.",

It would've been better if there were a second season. The story overall seemed very promising at first, yes, it's one of those teenage high school love stories but seeing it started off with an unconventional approach, it kept me engaged and eager to commit to it. HOWEVER, my biggest qualm is that (spoiler alert) one of the most interesting side plots about Natsume and Mi-chan-san was completely unresolved, the ending was very lacklustre. I had hopedthere would be at least some sort of acknowledgement from Mi-chan-san about Natsume seeing the connection between them was mildly hinted throughout the episodes, but when it ends with nothing, it makes me wonder if all the subtlety laid path between the two was necessary. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame because aside from the ending, the overall quality of the anime is quite good. I like the art style and all the character designs; the VA for Shizuku did a great job, and for all the animes that work with the standard formula of including pets to add appeals, having a rooster instead of a cutesy neko or puppy is quite unconventional. It wouldn't be a title that I'd recommend to people who want to watch a high school romance (as opposed to \"Ao Haru Ride\" or \"Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou\" if you are looking for this genre, highly recommended), but it does merit a 7 star at least.",

This is the reason I'm really glad that this is the anime I chose to return back to the anime world that I truly do love. To be honest, it's been a while, since I've watched such as entertaining anime with such likable characters. This is one of the few in which I just find myself truly smiling and laughing at some moments, and truly feeling for the characters that are introduced. \r\nAnd that's just from the first five episodes! \r\nWith the endless mass of cliche romcoms that currently populate the animeworld, it's difficult to find one that knows how to execute the story properly. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nWhile it isn't the most unique of story lines, it certainly brings a breath of fresh air. A studious, loner girl accidentally meeting an innocent, misunderstood bad boy? This is the type of story that could go wrong, yet TNK handled it in a way that made go very very right. I like how it doesn't rush things between the characters, and it keeps the viewers interested because there really is still mystery even though it balances it with the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nIt's cliche done  in all the right ways. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nI really do like the art style. It's not anything special, but I like how the characters were animated. The colors are bright, but not too bright. Also, I really like the backgrounds for some reason. Although, I really do have a soft spot for how Haru was animated, so there's that. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nWhile the OP and ED won't make it on my favorites, they are still catchy. I won't mind watching them each time I watch an episode of this anime. I like the background music, so that's a plus. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that the characters are definitely what drives this anime to be how good it is.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku, despite being supposedly unfeeling, is one of my favorite anime protagonists. She's not annoying, and it's hard not to understand her. The scenes which portray her confusion just makes me smile and want to cheer her on. \\n\\n\r\nHaru, on the other hand, is definitely my favorite male protagonist at the moment. I'm positive that it's difficult not to fall in love with his idiocy and innocence. This character just has so much HEART. He is the type of character that I would love to meet in real life. It's strange how from the first episode, I'm undeniably attached to Haru. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, including Mi-chan, Asako, Yuuzan, and the others are all pretty interesting, and I can hardly wait to get to know them better. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nIf it isn't obvious enough already, I really really enjoy this anime. It makes me smile. Not just laugh because of jokes, but actually legit smile. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nI'd give it a 10, but there's still something lacking. Plus, I'm still on the fifth episode, so who knows? It can only go downhill or uphill from here on out. \\n",

But the story..\r\nWhen I started watching the first episode I fell in love with it, but as I continued watching the episodes they got more boring to me, the story was slow paced, tbh it didn't make almost any progress at all.They got to the same point where they started.But the weirdest thing is that usually in romance animes the kiss comes in the last episodes, but in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun it was the otherway around. And that was probably the main reason why I fell in love with the first episode, but the other episodes were a total let down for me. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this helped. Thanks for reading! :) \\n\\n",

You really get a chance to like the characters and enjoy their journey to find their love in each other and the supporting characters are fun and interesting enough to enjoy watching alongside Mizutani and Haru.\r\n The art was good and I liked the style that the characters were drawn in. It wasn't overtly shojo, with the obnoxious proportions and eyes, and no one seemed too over the top, which works considering that it is a simple high schoollove story. \\n\r\nIn general I really enjoyed this anime. The only thing about it that I didn't really care for was the ending. It didn't really tie up all the loose ends that I was expecting and the OVA was random and didn't give me anything extra to add to the actual story either. I think a second season would be a great way to fix that problem, and give the viewer more insight to what really happens after the end of this show.",

While the story itself falls short of its potential, the originality of the characters makes up for its short comings.\r\nWhile other examples of the genre spend entire seasons getting to confessions, this show wastes no time. Unfortunately it doesn't fully commit and meanders around for the rest of the season only picking up at the end.\r\nThe saving grace of the show would have to be its characters. The unpredictable Haru and the deadpan Shizuku make a great foil for each other. Supporting them is a cast of charactersthat are at home in any love-comedy. I would have liked to see more back story into the supporting cast, but with a limited 13 episodes in which to work, the idea to focus on Haru and Shizuku is ultimately the correct one.\\n\\n\r\nWith and ending that just screams \"2nd Season.\" I'm sure we'll have a chance to experience how this oddball couple's relationship will mature. If you are a fan of love-comedies, do not pass this one up.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I believe Tonari no Kaibutsu-Kun deserves the 8.00+ that it currently has (audience exposure), I cannot give it that rating in my review due to the incomplete nature of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable 7.",

            "content": "Well, at first, I wasn't interested in this anime at all... \r\nHe was in my list to watch and then, I found out that he was on Netflix and suddenly I became curious. The episodes are good and somewhat fun, but I think the development of the characters are really poor. The anime was appealing to me because of the fact that Shizuku was a cold hearted girl, who didn't care for friends or romance. But later in the episodes, she became someone who really frustrated me, with all the confusing attitude. In the other hand we have Haru, who is a \"delinquent\" and areally open hearted boy. He definitely got my heart. He is a little confusing in the beginning, but he became into a really sincere character and is what saved the anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nHaru is fun and caring, he is the opposite of Shizuku. So this makes you think the obvious: Haru will change her.\\n\\n\r\nI was hoping that too. \\n\\n\r\nBut what I saw was a back and forth pre-romance that didn't make me happy. Shizuku was so cold sometimes that I was ready to punch her in the face and sometimes I wanted her to be cold again. The relationship with Haru (for me) didn't move to another level. The other characters are good in their ways, like Natsume who truly wanted to be a friend for Mizutani or Ooshima, who also likes Haru, but didn't tried to ruin the couple or something. But nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that is bad, because it isn't. It's good to watch, but you can't expect good romance. The story has everything to be a very good piece: awesome art, sound, characters... But I guess that it's a little hard to develop a pretty story in 13 episodes. The only solution is reading the manga, that I guess can complete all the holes that exists in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, for me, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun it's an anime to kill time.\\n",

There was a strong comedy appeal within the story which was good, and it keep you interested.  I believe the story held a very strong meaning, however it seems as if it dragged on to a incomplete end. In my opinion, if this had been a longer series with a better outcome, I would have enjoyed it much more. I gave the storya 8 because I felt as if the ending was not done well at all. What I am saying is that if you want to watch a happy ending try watching something else, In  Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun you will find little to no resolve.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I loved the art style, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music was catchy, but got slightly annoying over time. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I thought the characters in the story where slightly bland. The characters would develop and then in the next episode simply throw away said development. The relationship between characters did not seem to change much after the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun was a decent anime. It had its ups and downs, and its horrible ending.\\n\\n\r\nI give this a overall of 7. This is only my opinion, if the series had a better ending, or stronger plot twist it would be much, much better. Although I had to keep in mind that this was simply a romantic comedy series with no major drama. If you are bored and looking for anything to watch, I would reccomend Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun.",

Well, I could say that this anime doesn't live up to the expectation as I hope. Why? Here's the reasons why I personally did not like this anime.\r\n1. The closure/ending\r\nAt least Toradora! and Chuu-2 Byo have proper closure for their story, where at least they did not leave the plot hanging at an unsatisfying point. Both main character has actually made their resolution and at least we can see wheretheir relationship can go on. But in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, it is unfortunately a no. The relationship between Haru and Shizuku didn't meet up my expectation. I can't be sure that I can see where their relationship is going, as it did not progress at all!..\\n\\n\r\n2.The plot\\n\r\nAs I said before, I can't see any clear progress that they made. Maybe it is my mistake because I'm comparing this anime with Toradora!. What's more, even the last few episodes didn't stress out anything between them at all, instead showing how Shizuku is getting more familiar with Yamaken and how Yamaken had developed special feelings towards Shizuku. Somehow, I even forgot about the relationship between Haru and Shizuku and actually rooting for Yamaken instead. Fuck me right?\\n\\n\r\nI only dislike this anime because of these reasons. Other aspects are acceptable by me. The art is good, and the comedy and humor always made me burst out of laughter. The side characters also play their role well in the story as I can see their significance in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, those who expect to watch a storyline similar to Toradora! or Chuu-2 Byo will probably will get disappointed. Or maybe not? I don't know. Watch it yourself, and judge it yourself. This is only my opinion. \\n",

            "content": "Story: The first episode to the anime is very interesting. There's a girl named Shizuku Mizutani who is basically your \"wants to be on top of everyone when it comes to grades in her school\" type of chick. Everything seems to go according to her plans until the day she has to drop off homework for a student who's new to the school but hasn't shown up to classes yet named Haru Yoshida. He was known for his violent behavior in his younger years, but as soon as he meets Shizuku, he just turns out to be flat out weird. In fact, he starts cherishingher for being different from everyone else. Then, when he kisses her, Shizuku ends up on a coming of age journey of a lifetime. And what I basically just explained was the first episode. The rest of the series is just \"There's a problem, the couple fights, and there may or may not be a resolution to it.\" To me, that formula is boring. Where are the getting closer moments? There are barely any, and that's disappointing for a romance anime. If you're into that whole thing, I won't stop you from watching, but if you're not, you'll be pretty disappointed. Score: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I guess the only thing the anime has going is the animation. It's basically it's own staple, and that's what makes My Little Monster unique. It's cute, and it's also very clean. It has this stenciled touch that matches the stenciled world that Shizuku thinks she belongs in, and I believe that the anime should tell the story in the main character's point of view and how the main character views the world. 10/10 successful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The in-show soundtrack is pretty bland except for the love theme between Shizuku and Haru. It's pretty cute when it comes to their personalities clashing together. The other scores seem either out of place or they're just not what I imagined for this anime at all. However, when it comes to the opening and ending, I just think they're not catchy in the slightest. They're just generic in general, and I can't stand it at all. Pretty disappointing I guess. Score: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is one of the first times since beginning to watch anime again that I cannot stand the main character at all. Shizuku is the stereotypical studious girl but done to the maximum degree with makes her extremely boring as hell. She even gets to the point where she's angry because she can't study, but you know she wants to express her feelings to Haru. God, I can't stand people like that! Then, you have her new friends. Natsume is the girl who does not have many real friends because she claims her real home is the Internet. She also gets low grades...but she's cute? I appreciate her supportive nature at times, but she could just be annoying mostly. Sasahara is the kind baseball player, but he doesn't really deliver much character into the group of friends. I think he's cute, but there's nothing much that'll make me say, \"Why should I care about you?\" Yamaken becomes a main side character for no reason whatsoever. If his only purpose is to break the couple up, then that makes this like any other generic romance shoujo ever. If there are only two characters I like they are, of course, Haru and Mitsuyoshi. Haru is your innocent weirdo who has a tragic past and wants to do right in the world. Plus, he has a pet rooster that he hid in his shirt in the second episode. How do you not? Mitsuyoshi is Haru's guardian and everyone else's guide. He's where the purest humor comes from. However, I can't say that those characters are the saving grace though. Score: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The factors that I just explained do play a major factor when it comes to enjoying the show. There are moments though when the show is funny, but the more you get into the series, the more the jokes start to get old, and it's just not that fun anymore. The characters are your tropes and don't really bring much to the table, and the couple is a little deadpan, making you feel bad for Haru nonetheless. My enjoyment rate would have to be 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well, I pretty much said what there is to be said here. Story: pretty much goes in useless circles. Art style is the best thing. Sound needs major creativity improvement. Character needs to be more broad. And all of that would make better enjoyment for the audience. Last score: rounded 6/10",

But it's not exactly that (spoilers ahead) - What I feel is that this series is full of back and forth and there have been times when I get so frustrated with the main girl character. There's no character development in her. Maybe just a little. \r\nMy point is that, upon watching this anime I was looking forward to seeing the development at the ending and hopefully she wouldbe with the guy. But it didn't happen. No progress.\\n\\n\r\naside from those two, others were charming.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, aside from the storyline, i was pleased with the artwork. The animation is a quality you would like to see. \\n\\n\r\noverall, if you want to watch an anime with romantic development where the couple get together or apart, steer clear of this anime. But I would recommend this to those who like to see a light hearted romcom.",

            "content": "This is definitely a good romantic comedy, or should I say comedic romance?  I can't because it feels half and half...  Anyways, the story revolves around the Haru and his developing relationship with Shizuku and the group of friends that these two socially unique people create. \r\nTo be honest the main romance doesn't really get anywhere after a third way through the anime, but it guess its that sense of confused and conflicted young love that helped support the anime, but most of time you just find the main character's love for one another conflicting with their own desires, intentions, and worries whichdoesn't get resolved at all.  There are some side romantic plot points but they don't get anywhere either, I get you could say their is a lack of closure for everything in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a really strong point in this anime, they make you laugh and are so interesting and complex.  Their uniqueness keeps you watching and with how they interact with each other, as well as how they conflict with each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, art and sound are definitely no problem and are pretty great in presenting the anime.  My one issue with the anime is that I would've liked for everything to be resolved with character development and romances.  There were too many things left just hanging out there.  When the anime ended for me, I felt an empty feeling that longed for closure between all the characters.    That's the only tragic flaw I felt for this anime so I won't let that get in the away of my rating... The anime was hilarious, emotion grabbing, and entertaining, but felt unfinished.  If you can handle the empty feeling that this anime will leave you with go ahead and watch it with the hope that It I will be filled in the future, otherwise still watch it and endure it's flawed amazingness and suffer with me.  Everything aside, I give it 8.7/10",

            "content": "This has honestly been for me, one of the most enjoyable animes. I found this one while on a wild search for something new, something that could compare to Toradora (one of my die hard favorites).\r\n  I came upon Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun because it was in the new list of anime on Animefreak. I studied the art, hardly looked at the two characters on the picture they were showing me, and basically told myself it wasn't going to be what I was looking for. I can't even begin to tell you how wrong my pitiful assumption was.\r\n  I won't sit hereand explain the story to you, or give you any kind of spoilers, but let me tell you why you'll enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\n1) If you're like me, and you're looking for something new and different, this is it. I love any anime that makes me smile and gives me a good laugh all in one. I've caught myself actually chuckling at things that go on or situations they present to me. I'll tell you, this hardly ever happens because I feel like what they usually want me to laugh at isn't believable or amusing.\\n\\n\r\n2) This is not your typical story about a delinquent and a girl who's all into her studies. The two main characters, Shizuku and Haru, have much more going for them. I've never seen a main girl who was so blunt and straight to the point, it was as refreshing as it was shocking. Haru at first comes off as someone who's strange and you can't tell what's going on in his head, but he's smart and has more beneath the surface.\\n\\n\r\n3) This anime keeps you so interested, that even the background characters or side characters who's names you don't know keep you entertained or make you smile. I never thought I would be someone who enjoyed side characters, but there are at least three in this anime that excite me when they pop up on the screen.\\n\\n\r\n4) I can be a bit picky about the styling of an anime, or how the art is drawn, but this one is definitely my sort of thing. It isn't generic, and it isn't over the top with colors bursting in your face. Their limbs are a bit long, but that isn't something you'll pay so much attention to that it bugs you. I had a friend of mine tell me it reminded him of a Code Geass style, but I don't see it whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoy plots where many characters are falling in love or have crushes? Oh god, you will love this. This anime has so much of that, it's bursting with it all over the place. They do it in such a quirky way that it doesn't make you uncomfortable, and you may (like I do), want characters to be with both options.\\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line is that I thoroughly recommend this anime. To miss this would be a loss, and I think you'll be missing out on some strong feelings for it and some good chuckles.",

Over the course of the series they struggle with their feelings for each other and Haru gets jealous when another boy takes an interest in Shizuku even though she tells him that she has nofeeling for him.\\n\r\nThis may be a shojo anime but that doesn't mean you have to be a girl to enjoy it; the characters are fun, especially Haru who is constantly providing a laugh with his behaviour. In her own way Shizuku is fun too as she is almost the opposite of Haru. There might not be much of an ongoing plot but that doesn't matter as the characters day to day lives are entertaining and realistic enough to be believable without being boring. The animation is distinctive and looks pretty good. Overall I'd say this series is worth watching; especially as it can currently be watched legally online on Crunchyroll.\\n\r\nThese comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",

Sadly, their relationship doesn't progress that much throughout the show, and it never gets to the point where they specifically consider themselves a couple, or kiss (with mutual consent) for that matter. Although after the final episode, it is pretty safe to conclude that they will become (or are) a couple at that point.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a very entertaining watch, that's why I rate it 8/10 even though the ending wasn't satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nA second season (or perhaps some special episodes) would be a nice addition, making it a very nice show.

For example, instead of walking out of a classroom to exit the building, he'll simply jump out of the window; and I'm not even exaggerating.

There one student whose name is Shizuku. She usually too herself and all about studying and pretty much to the point / cold person. Her life started to change when she meets another student named Haru. He is a violent person that end up fighting people. They meet up when the teacher ask Shizuku to give some homework to Haru. Haru first hated Shizuku because he thought she was from the school, but after that he wantedto become friends and started to treat her as a friend. Shizuku confused by Haru weird interaction learn that Haru doesn't have any friend. So the story focus on these two where one become less cold and the other person become more capable and non violet type person.\\n\\n\r\nRating time: \\n\\n\r\nPlot: The plot progression was slow. The main focus of this anime seemed more slice of life then it was romance. The pacing was a little weird and when they needed to fill in back story they put it near the end it seemed. I give this  a 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation was alright, quirky here and there. I didn't have anything bad to say about it. It wasn't ecchi so it not like they would be putting in 100%. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I watched the anime in Japanese dub. The sound was fine, the voice acting was interesting choice but I liked it. The music was not annoying. I give it a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The character concept was interesting. I like the idea of basically two character that were not really popular trying to get together kind of thing. And some of the friends that came along with them were also not very popular at all. Most of the time it was people that were not very liked or had friends. So for introduction it was good. The development of the character was interesting, but sometimes it felt like they restarted their progress and that got a little annoying. You don't really find out about 2 other character development. They develop but didn't finish. I think they needed more to flush out the character more, but still not bad. 7.5-8 / 10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall with bias: After watching it all and giving my individual rating I would give it a 7 out of 10. I enjoyed the anime and the character were interesting, but nothing amazing. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Tough one. I think it popular anime and some people might enjoy it more than I would. I would recommend researching and looking at clips from episode one and see if you would like it. So I would say maybe lol.\\n",

I was in shock! They were...lightning fast with establishing our leads and their relationship with each other! They were fucking amazing!!\r\nEpisodes 3 and 4 arent as good as the first two but theyre not...terrible. Altho you can start to see this show slowing down and turning into...just...every other frustrating romance anime ever made. \r\nEpsodes 5,6,7,8,9 are some of the most torturous experiences of my life. These episodes are HORESHIT!!!! THEYRE TERRIBLE!!! THEYRE FRUSTRATING TO WATCH!!! IM PISSED OF!!! And the worst part is that they mean NOTHING TOTHE STORY!!! THEYRE FUCKING FILLERS!!!! I am afraid to watch another romance anime after hearing BlackCriticGuy describing these episodes as going back to the roots of the genre. Oh my god...this genre is so bad...its...its shit! How am I ever gonna be excited to watch another romance anime?? I mean...Im watching Kare Kano next directed by hideaki ano and made by studio gainax back when it was good! Nothing's wrong will ever happen...but...what about the other romance anime? These episodes scarred me.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 10 isnt as bad as those horseshit, but its not as good as the other good episodes either. The last few minutes are fine. Theyre...not bad! However the rest of the episode is just pointless shit. Urgh!\\n\\n\r\nEpsiode 11,12,13 are good! They were charming and cute! They take away from haru and shizuku's relationship a bit for friendship and bonding! Theyre good! Not much else to say since these episodes will never be as meaningful, well written, and romantic as the first two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHaru is cute and is very understandable. He's emotional and you get why he would love someone like shizuku. He does point out her despicable attitude and I like that!\\n\r\nShizuku has two guys crushing on her, one is haru and the other is this blonde hair kid who's confused to why he likes her. He's pretty irrelevant. Shizuku is...boring, bland, heartless, sometimes courageous, and overall unlikable. While the show does explain why these two would fall in love with one another, it doesnt make its main girl likeable or shit even interesting! I've survived this romance through Haru. If you like her, I dont care.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is extremely likeable! They're the reason why the last few episodes are so enjoyable. Not much else to say except I just love watching them. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nAnimation is above average due to the characters not being too complicated. But obviously no where near as good as toradora's animation.\\n\r\nArt is a little dif than what Im used to which is nice. Shizuku's character design is ridiculously bland and I think they made her too much of a loser! Does it really make sense to have her dress like an old lady, have her friends point it out and then have her be embarrased about it? It would fit her character if she says I dont give a shit! Also, HARU IS SUPER CUTE AND HIS VOICE FITS HIM PERFECTLY!!! The character designs represents the characters pretty well! But seriously tho does shizuku really have to be that bland? \\n\\n\r\nRomance:\\n\r\nThe first two episodes are so gosh darn romatic!! But the story fucked it up and by the end the romance doesnt go anywhere...the cute girl even points it out how theyre making no progress right after those 5 agonizing episodes!!! THIS FEELS LIKE A REALLY BAD ATTEMPT AT META ROMANCE ANIME!!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would still recommend you watching this anime even tho I gave it a 4. I a lot of people seem to like this anime just fine so maybe you will too. Join the crowd and enjoy an anime! Its just...not for me. Those 5 episodes are shit...peace out.",

Yea....and this anime represents them for all the wrong reasons.\r\nThe story is your typical fan-fare for a Shoujo anime Plain looking girl falls for brutish handsome boy.  The whole story line is absolutely forgettable. The fact that the Author decided to leash down the characters so much as to not deviate to far from the whole Studying plot line was a terrible idea.\r\nThe Art and the Sound designis the only real selling point for this show. I could never really pinpoint and problems with the art style. All the Characters were very well designed and unlike most shows it seemed like they had a least a bit of a wardrobe. The voice acting seemed to have been spot on for all characters. Though the Opening and Closing songs is less then Memorable to me at least.\\n\r\nNow the Characters my god they are the most reprehensible pieces of trash. The only truly good characters in this show are Kenji Yamaguchi, and Asako Natsume Because they are the only one that seem to grow in any way. With them being only side characters does not bode well for any show.\\n\r\nWhere the hell do i begin with Haru. Besides Hell which is where he will go when he actually kills someone in this show. He's absolutely Insane there is no redeeming this Scum bucket. I get it it's Shoujo and he's that way by design but Jesus would find it easier to let Lucifer back into Heaven. In 13 episodes his Growth should be more acquainted to a Heart rate monitor. It spikes up then dives back down and it repeats it self over and over again until he eventually Flat-lines. \\n\r\nShizuku is a little bit better but she almost as detestable. Make up your mind already the moment you think shes finally going to move forward the Whole Studying plot Reels her right back into place. \\n\r\nIf your looking for a good Shoujo anime look elsewhere but of you have sometime to kill, feel free.",

I'll try my best to avoid spoilers :3\r\nThe story revolves around two \"quirky\" individuals. Shizuku, the bookwormian species with the \"anything other than studies can die\" attitude and Haru, a complete nut job who gets his butt kicked outta school on the very first day for punching a dude threatening to punch...another dude, that's a cool chain effect  though.\r\nThe two meet when Haru pulls her into an alley i think, my memories are a bit hazy ,and decides to go to his little\"sports centre\"? dunno it's where they usually hang at so yeah. And Shizuku realises that his so called \"friends\" are using him and utterly fails to tell them with full - hearted metal scream. instead she \"insists\" that they stop (pfft , like that would work)\\n\\n\r\nthey threaten her and Haru steps in to be the hero. Basically\\n\\n\r\nThe odd duo continues to stride along life liking a stepping stone , each day filled with more boredom on behalf of Shizuku and more chaos on behalf of Haru. eventually Haru starts to like her and Shizuku agrees to form a makeshift love. (temporary)\\n\\n\r\nHaru, being the idiotic delinquent he is still manages to get the highest in class which pisses Shizuku off i wont be stating the reason why.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's Nagoya, one of the ONLY normal characters in the ENTIRE SHOW. anyways i hope the review didn't seem like too much of mess. i know i can cause a few catastrophe\"s when i write stuff but im just trying to refrain myself from writing swear words\\n\\n\r\noverall: the characters are weird and whacky and gives off that \"gnarly\" vibe, the story is decent enough to understand and enjoy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

From the first episode it is unconventional but that is what makes it great. \r\nStory: Shizuku, cold, indifferent and intelligent. Haru, childish, violent and spontanious. These two very different characters first encounter leads to Haru to confess his feelings for her. The story progresses as the two characters slowly become friends and the trials that face them in their journey. \r\nArt/Sound: In all honesty, I am going to quit typing this block unless something really sticks out. So far this anime has nothing special about it when it comes to artwork or sound.\r\nCharacters: Okay,here is where the fun begins. With the two characters, my first thought it that it will be boring as hell. You have an emotionless character and one that is eccentric. I mean how the hell do you plan to develop them, how will they grow? And you know what, this studio accomplished that. They went with a cliche story but unconventional characters. Each episode is unique. Both of the characters are funny in their own way. And there are some episodes where I am laughing to the point where I am about to cry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: This here is a unique romcom. Highly unconventional. Completely different than others. The only thing I did not like about it, is the back and forth between them and their feelings for each other. It was hella annoying at times. But besides that, the characters are amazing. The show is hilarious and it is worth watching.",

            "content": "This is one of those anime that has a promising start, yet as series goes on, it keeps getting worse and worse. Even me, pretty much a newbie otaku, can see that. The anime basically ended at about 6 or 7 episodes, and the rest is filled with what i perceive as fillers. \r\nThis story is about Yoshida Haru, a delinquent who is socially awkward and just wants to have friends, and Mizutani Shizuku, a cold, apathetic girl who only cares about grades and studying. At first, its really interesting, because rather than the usual, 'I hate him, but slowly i love him, but ican't tell him how i feel because i don't want to ruin everything' cliche in romance, Yoshida basically already confessed and kissed the heroine at the first episode. They're both such an interesting characters in a romance anime because of how honest they are with each other, rather than the usual hiding the feelings things. This is the downfall, because basically, in about 7 episodes, both of the main characters already confessed both of their feelings to each other, and after that the anime ran out of content and just shows the side characters romance, and the rivals trying to steal them.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the anime can do much better in the story department. As the anime ends in season 13, there's still many questions that haven't been answered, and events that should've been happened, but instead, they make the last 3 or 4 episodes to be pretty much a filler. As example, we pretty much still doesn't know anything about Yoshida's family and Yuzan, it feels like after the Yuzan Arc ends, they all just forgot about him. There's also the thing about the romance between the side characters, between Natsume, Sasahara, and Mi-chan. They pretty much just ended it in cliffhanger. It feels like they're trying to squeeze as many content and Arc in 13 Episodes, but pretty much never finished each of them, making it feels like its just a filler, if you know what i mean. Also, we didn't even get a date/picnic scene that should've been happened in Episodes 13, but instead, they decided to make it another filler. The story could've been great if they just focused on finishing one or two arcs, rather than squeeze as much Arc as possible. It should've been about Haru and Shizuku from Episode 1 through 13.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Personal Rate: 8\r\nOverall rate based on the different characteristics: 8\r\nTonari no Kaibutsu-kun is based on a shoujo manga... It's important to mention it before embarking on this series. I didn't AT ALL when starting this. I was just looking for something cute in-between the numerous shounens I was watching and reading at the time. It clearly appeared however that the story was heading somewhere but that It would never manage to conclude at the end of the 13 episodes. That's when I checked it on the web and discovered this was a shoujo adaptation.\r\nSo beware: IF YOU WANT SOMETHING WITH A CONCLUSION, AVOID THIS.\r\nI've seensome pretty low rates here and the main complain in those, is that the story's incomplete. That is totally justifiable... and frustrating as well. I'm still angry with the OVA adaptation of Angel Sanctuary I saw some years ago. You end up wondering what was the point.\\n\\n\r\nThis being said, here goes my review knowing that I didn't know what this anime was about. I just randomly selected the series based on the art expecting something cute.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's always complicated to rate the story of a slice of life shoujo manga. Frankly, you're not here for the plot. You're in for the cute: boy meets girl, girl meets boy. \\n\r\nThere's absolutely nothing to it. It's pretty conventional plot-wise. Nothing new under the sun, but I can't rate this badly. After all, it's slice of life, and life overall is nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complain would be that they stayed too faithful to the original manga, and I got that at the end. I was hoping for a semblance of conclusion for all our characters even if some things were left open but we got none of that, hence the frustration expressed in some reviews. Basically, it stops at a certain point in the manga and if you want to know the rest... well you'll just have to buy the volumes...\\n\\n\r\nIs there any point in buying the DVDs unless you're a hardcore fan? BIG NOPE.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's gorgeous. I think it's important to mention how pretty the whole series look. Too often in shoujo adaptations, the art goes down the drain and looks cheap. It's particularly frustrating since most shoujo mangas are all in the atmosphere and emotional connections they create and not on the plot i.e you can get away with drops in art quality in shounens because most of the time, the story's mostly plot-driven. In shoujos, it's mostly character-driven so if the art sucks, well it's difficult to draw your viewers in. I still prefer shoujos in black and white, but here is a rare instance where the art is almost as good as the original material.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's good. Though nothing memorable here. I listened to the opening and ending once and then skipped them altogether. Not really my thing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's were this series does a very good job. \\n\\n\r\nHaru is certainly the weirdest bishounen I had the chance to stumble upon. He's hot-blooded, violent, naive, sometimes cute, blunt, and behaves like a kid constantly throwing tantrums. It should make for a pretty annoying character but somehow, it works. \\n\r\nThere's an underlying sadness in his character, but the anime doesn't develop his backstory. All we know overall is that after he met Shizuku, his life changed for the better. She forces him to behave which given how much of a wacko he is, is an achievement in itself.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku on the other side has one thing for herself: she likes to study and basically her whole life revolves around this. I could particularly relate because as she said it: Grades are easier to handle than people. People = complications.  She's the tsundere in this weird couple I guess, though even as she opens up a bit after meeting her weirdo, she remains faithful to herself. Grades come first. She's a pretty refreshing character. I'd have expected her to be cryptic once she figured out she is attracted to Haru, but nope, she is just as honest, and blunt as him.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Haru is such a mad man, that although she loves him ( and let's be honest here, love indeed defies logic), he's a piece of work. He's a bit of beast and it takes patience and tricks to handle him.\\n\\n\r\nWould you stay with a guy who is so difficult to handle that he hit you in the face 3 times by accident because he just couldn't behave? Well that's Haru. It certainly makes for an entertaining watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also  a bunch of secondary characters whom I won't bother to talk about. But overall, It's nice to have shoujo characters that although corresponding to certain stereotypes ( Haru is gorgeous while Shizuku is pretty average) still manage to surprise you. All the secondary characters are well-drawn as well. The girls don't enter into the bitch category just like the boys don't go into the typical rival box. It's NICE.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nI really fell in love with the story. Arguably it's really common as said earlier. But all the characters make a nice bunch. It's cute and often weird ( Haru's pet is a chicken named Nagoya. I mean seriously?!) but it isn't too cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm mostly a shounen and seinen person as far as mangas and animes go. But I enjoy the cute a lot in-between and too often, shoujos I enjoyed reading turned up too corny in their anime version on top of being ugly compared to their manga counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nThat is really not the case here. It's cute obviously and there's some cheesy lines as well but it's made in such a way that you avoid the cringe altogether. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nOnce I made peace with the fact that this was just an anime made for the studio to promote the manga, I was able to truly enjoy myself because I had no expectations of a conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nI repeat, if you have no intention of reading the manga after... Don't bother. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's a good introduction to the series if you're curious. You can watch it to see if your curiosity's raised enough to read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI got some Kare Kano (one of my favorite shoujo manga) vibes regarding Haru at times: Like Arima Soichiro, Haru has a dark past and has got good grades without being obsessed about them and is in love with a girl obsessed with being first. The comparison however stops here. \\n\\n\r\nThe manga is 13 volumes long and from what I've checked so far, it doesn't go as dark as Kare Kano and remains pretty light throughout. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure it's gonna become one of my \"comfort manga\" when I feel a bit down. I'll be sure to read the whole series once I get my hands on the volumes which lucky for me, have already all been published where I live.\\n\\n\\n",

I'll try my skills to improve.\r\nSo let me start. You can tell that I'm into romance and comedy genres simply because I rated it high. At the first episode of this anime, it really catches my interest though some of the scenes were kinda weird. Not knowing, I'm loving it. Of course if this is a romance anime, there's two main characters just like the other anime does. Mizutani Shizuku whoonly wants to study and maintain her grades high, until she met this guy named Haru Yoshida, seated next to Shizuku but because he's always absent since the school began, Shizuku forces to deliver classroom printouts to him which leads into the start of the romantic epic scenes. It's also has other cast that makes this show exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great, though I don't like the portrayed of Haru or the main male protagonist that much. But all in all, the art was pretty good. Also, the sounds is well done. It's just simple that suits every scene that it should be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall? For me, It's outstanding. If you love to watch rom-com, better watch this anime. I hope this short review of mine become useful for those who'll going to watch TNKK. Well, somehow.",

            "content": "Overview: Sometimes just spending time with someone is worth more than the world. This anime is a coming of age story first, and a romance story second. What does it mean to be friends or lovers? What is important to me? Am I happy with who I am right now? Will I be left behind by everyone else? This anime takes a more realistic version of outcast characters becoming friends or more for the first time while dealing with the pressures of high school. \r\nSound: The OST is beautiful. It gives a similar feeling to the OST in One Punch Man. \r\nCharacter: The characters areunique and memorable. The mellow female lead was a very nice change of pace from the usual anime female leads. Side characters are given some attention as well -- the side female character ended up becoming my favorite. The only qualm I have is that the main male character's backstory is still confusing even though time was spent trying to flesh it out quite a few times. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I think the art is average.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There isn't much story as not much time passes in the course of the anime and it is more geared towards being a slice-of-life. At least to me, this anime is more about the characters and their development. Since there isn't much of a story, there isn't really an end to the anime, rather it is left open ended. Almost as if we got a peek at a small portion of the characters' lives, and that things and feelings will continue to change as their lives go on.\\n\\n\r\nOther: This anime was a lot better than I thought it would be. The cover image with the chains deterred me away from watching this anime originally. I'm glad I decided to watch it, even if it is many years later.",

I think that manga side of story was better then anime, because some characters are described differently in manga, the story kiiiiiinda goes otherway and is still ongoing.\\n\r\nI was sad to see that there probably won't  be season 2 first of all because there were some parts in anime that were not explained well at all, so it definitely deserves second season so that some gaps could be filled.\\n\r\nOther then that everything else was good.

The comedy is great especially because of the conflicting but cute personalities of Shizuku and Haru, alongside their new found friends. The graphics and art work were good and it followedthe plot of the manga so well - skipping only a few things, and properly too - so there are not weird gaps in it. I loved this anime and hope they release the second season soon. I would recommend anyone who loves rom-com anime, or even just comedy (because I myself am not a romance anime lover - but I thought it was so funny and cute, so it got me to venture into more romance anime)!",

So I'm just saying I'm not the a reviewer as much as a person who just likes to watch anime and read manga/light novels.\r\nReview: My Little Monster is a good concept to see two different characters to go through these emotions in a relation ship- but is it a good anime? Well it is but isn't at the same time. \r\nReason one, the anime is 13 episodes to never explain on how well it conclude and go back in fort in relationship wise, now the anime was running asthe manga was going as well. But as for the relationship going back and fort is kind of annoying but it shows that two people with different personalities can't be perfect- or can they? Same with Toradora!- two people, different actions, but it has more episodes to explain itself then My Little Monster.\\n\\n\r\nAsk yourself this. Would you feel the same if Toradora if it was 13 episodes and not telling the full story? Kinda like Deadman Wonderland where they tell you at the end to go and read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nNow- move aside that... Do I like the anime? Kind of- like I said before, it's nice and all but not many episodes to explain itself. The music is nice, characters are great in their own, art style as well, story, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga however explains a lot more and is actually enjoyable. More explaining, but it sometimes doesn't focus on our main characters, but it does go on to say- they need to learn to work together. I won't explain nor tell you to read the manga but if you want to see what happened after everything in the anime- read it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRating: Now my full rating for the anime is just \"meh\" (5-7/10)\\n\r\nThe anime could be better if explained to our main characters focused- yet it is still a good-ish anime, I will only say it could have been better if they published it after the manga was done so we can see the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nSimple Answer: Just read the manga... It's better, honestly...",

I love how the two main characters, Shizuku and Haru, have completely different personalities from each other, which is what I like to see in a romantic comedy. I like how it's slightly different from usual romantic comedies. Usually you get long, boring scenes where both characters are either holding hands, hugging or even have the odd kiss - it frustrates me sometimes and gets rather boring, but I find Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun to be different and much moreenjoyable. I love the balance of humor and romance - there are odd bits that really make me laugh. I really want there to be a Season 2 because I'm sure this series needs to progress and it was finished on a cliffhanger, kind of. I hope that the two supporting characters, Natsume and Sasahara, will have more of their story told in Season 2, if there was going to be one. In the end Tonari No Kaibutsu-kun really is an anime that you have to see!",

I don't like how so very early on both of them were forcing love into the equation. I mean talk about moving fast, slow ya roll now!\r\nI like that it was not the kind of anime where everyone else has issues and those issues brought the main character closer. This was not that kind of anime. AndHaru did have a rival.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is kind of like Maid Sama, the last six episode of that anime, just this anime had more episode and didn't cram the triangle in toward the end. So yeah it was a fairly good anime, not something I would really re-watch though.",

            "content": "My Little Monster is a show about two high school students (Shizuku and Haru) who meet each other and change each other\u2019s lives; which, you know, big deal. Haru has been absent from class for a long time now because of his past bad behavior, and Shizuku gets tasked with bringing him back to class. The series then concerns him their relationship to each other, and how each of them grows from that.\r\nHaru is seen as a scary, impulsive thug who glares at everyone. Shizuku is the serious, responsible type who always studies. But they each have hidden sides to them that the series thenexplores. Part of the fun of the show is finding out about those hidden sides to their personalities. My main focus here will be the main relationship between these two characters, and their general attitudes toward not only each other, but toward the world. Most of the comedy of the series comes from the clash between their viewpoints, and also a clash between their desires and the constraints of the \u201cnormal\u201d world.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most interesting thing about the Haru character is his enthusiasm. At the beginning of the series, he\u2019s hiding out from school. He beat up some upper classmen and  got suspected; but his suspension had been lifted, and he simply refused to go. When he meets Shizuku, he escapes by jumping out a window. But later on, he accosts her and stops her from leaving. The truth is: he\u2019s curious, he\u2019s anxious about school; he wants to go. His tough exterior actually hides a soft, rather inquisitive nature. He wonders out loud that since Shizuku brought him his school papers, it must be because they\u2019re friends; and he later asks her school was. His knowledge of friendship, of school, of all sorts of things, seems to be derived from media; he yearns to experience it for himself. Shizuku is the excuse he gives himself to attend school, but soon enough we see how important going and being there is for Haru. He earnestly believes in the significance of the rituals of youth; he wants to make friends so they can all hang out together after school, wants to meet them in the weekend, wants to live out his high school life the way it\u2019s supposed to be done. But, again, he\u2019s too weird, a little too intense, to get along with other people; in the end, only Shizuku seems to be able to handle him.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku, on the other hand, is a loner by choice. She comes across as cold, unfeeling, and stuff like that. But really she\u2019s also as intense as Haru is. She focuses all her energy on her studies. She\u2019s not interested in what happens around her, or what other people say, or that she might be missing out on some better life. For her, high school is just a thing she has get through, make good grades in, and get an amazing job later on. Which, fine; that\u2019s actually a pretty great way to look at it. But immediately the show takes great care to show another side to her. Although she tries not to get involved in Haru\u2019s problems, she cares too much to let things pass. She\u2019s blunt and says what she wants, sometimes without thinking of the consequences, as when she calls out Haru\u2019s friends for not treating him right; her truth-telling can be brutal. But Haru\u2019s presence radically changes how she perceives her life. There\u2019s a beautiful moment in the school rooftop (where else?) where she falls asleep. When she wakes up, Haru\u2019s there watching her; it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s ever skipped class. She allows herself to relax, to feel the moment around her, to know why it might be an important experience, \u201cmy world is growing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s refreshing about these two characters is how these characters aren\u2019t tortured souls without any clue about their real feelings. In the first two episodes, both characters have confessed to each other. Just like any good old-fashioned romantic comedy, a bunch of complications pop up; romantic rivals, past wounds, etc., just to put off what is inevitable. But I loved how sure they all were of their feelings. I\u2019ve seen so many shows where the characters are completely clueless or never have the courage to say anything about what they feel that it becomes annoying. Haru and Shizuku may be clueless as to how to navigate the world and deal with people, but they are remarkably sure about their feelings; and honestly it\u2019s thanks to that that the series remains solid and engaging. Haru and Shizuku are characters who are weird, too intense, to fit in \u201cnormally\u201d with everybody else. They\u2019re people who can\u2019t turn off their personality just to fit in. The show, almost imperceptibly, allows them to build a world for themselves. By the final episodes, our main characters have found people who care about them, even though they themselves remain as stubborn and as weird as they started.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame that we\u2019ll probably have to wait for a sequel to find out what happens in the romantic lives of these characters, but that\u2019s okay. The show has the confidence to basically end on a totally filler episode because we\u2019ve already learned to love the characters and love to spend time with them. Perhaps a second season will introduce more drama into their life, perhaps not. The series allows our main characters to feel some new emotions, have their lives be changed, all without too much angst or anything like that. Haru and Shizuku have learned to enjoy themselves.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is a feel-good romantic comedy. It's interesting characters and all the events they're involved in leave you excited, interested, laughing, and ready for more.\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nOverall, this show had a very good story. With each episode you'd learn more about the characters and their backgrounds as well as seeing how their unique relationships develop. I tend to enjoy stories like this where there's no ultimate driving force and you don't know what to expect next. Unfortunately, this show had a quite unsatisfying ending, giving the story aspect the lowest of my scores.\r\nArt (10/10):\r\nThe artwork in this anime is fantastic. Everything is smooth, theintro has a unique style that made it memorable, and there's many different outfits and styles thrown in, making it very artistically appealing. I can't think of a part of this anime where I didn't like the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\r\nAll the music and sound effects are very well implemented throughout the show. The intro song is highly enjoyable and the voice acting is fantastic. The only thing I didn't particularly like was the ending song, but that's mostly personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nThe characters are really what made this one for me. There's not a huge amount of main characters in it, but each character has their own personality that dictates what they do in each unique situation. Haru is easily the most unique character and contributes a great deal of intrigue to the anime. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll leave it there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime thoroughly from start to finish. I couldn't stop watching until I was done. Once I was done, I was left wanting more (both because of the end and how fantastic the show was). I can't wait for the OVA.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nThis show is one I could enjoy over and over, so anyone willing to watch a romantic comedy, this show is for you. Hope this is helpful. Feel free to give me suggestions on how I can improve my reviews from how I did this one.",

            "content": "About the STORY\r\nA whole different approach with love story with a very romantic confession right off the very first episode. It\u2019s not only about love but more importantly it\u2019s also about friendship and some of the hardships of teenage school life. The romance, drama, and even comedy are so well-balanced.\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nOne of the few unconventional things in the series is the not so \u201ctypical\u201d characters. No more the old school \u201cwaiting for them to realize their feelings\u201d or \u201cconfessing their love\u201d as both protagonists know that they love each other right from the very start. Even their bickering is not common. Their love storyis definitely not the conventional which makes the series so exciting. Not only the protagonists who are so interesting but almost all the characters which is quite rare nowadays with the long lists of romantic comedy series. \\n\\n\r\nAbout YOSHIDA HARU\\n\r\nThe male protagonist is the most interesting about the series. I could even say his personality is the combination of the different and common types of male lead which makes him quite rare. His weird antics, naivety, and mysteriousness make him even more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nAs it is one of the latest animes of 2012, the animation is also one of the best; the character designs, the lay-outs, and it is very fashionable as well. The characters are also one of the most gorgeous I\u2019ve seen. Plus, the background music makes the romantic moments even sweeter. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nDefinitely the best romantic series I\u2019ve seen since Kimi ni Todoke and Kaichou wa Maid-sama! Not your ordinary romantic comedy because there\u2019s substance in the story. You surely will laugh, fall in love, get inspired, and be amazed by this new kind of romantic comedy.\\n",

            "content": "If I had to describe Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, I would say: \"Haru sad. Haru smash! And that chicken looks delicious.\" To put it frankly, there's not much else to this anime.\r\nTonari no Kaibutsu-kun is an interesting anime in that it's not the typical shoujo template where the female MC is overly insecure and seems to be head-over-heels for the dreamy male MC. However, this does not cover for the fact that there is no strong storyline. \r\nThe basic story is about Shizuku, a high achieving and studious high school girl who lacks some sort of companionship. One day at school, she is randomly asked tolook after a particularly violent individual by the name of Haru. Typical to a shoujo plot, Haru feels comfortable around Shizuku and his violent tendencies seem to subside, though he still has his violent outbursts. As a result of being around him, Shizuku learns that Haru can be a caring guy. This is where the \"plot\" takes off. While Haru is determined to win Shizuku's heart, she is unsure of her own feelings for Haru. That's pretty much it. The main pitfall of the anime is that there are a few interesting arcs but the characters do not develop as a result of those experiences. In other words, the stories just fizzled away. \\n\\n\r\nDue to the fact that Shizuku is sorting out her own feelings, there is not much romance happening in the anime. I do have to say that I got excited in the beginning of the anime for the romance but as the story dragged along, there was no progression in the romance. The drama does pick up near the end of the anime but like the other parts of the show, it just fizzled away. By the last episode, I felt that the main characters made no progress in their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in Kaibutsu-kun is okay at best. There were moments that I chuckled but I did not find myself rolling around laughing at any time. Most of the comedic elements stem from Haru's childish actions and Shizuku's nerdy behaviour. There are a group of side characters who provide some comic relief but Haru's and Shizuku's comedy moments are better. \\n\\n\r\nMost of my praise for this anime would be for Shizuku. She has her insecurities but unlike other shoujo anime, she is not lovey-dovey for the good-looking male lead Haru. She knows her priorities and is not afraid to give others a piece of her mind. If I had to compare her to another shoujo female character, I would say she is the introvert version of Misaki from Kaichou wa Maid-sama!. Unarguably, Shizuku has the most character development in the anime. \\n\r\nHaru is like a violent man-child, though when he does some introspection, he slips into his more mature self. His redeeming trait is that he is not afraid to show his affection for Shizuku. Nevertheless, I particularly did not like his violent tendencies as most of them were unwarranted. Further, the writers failed to provide a substantial story as to why he is such a violent person. Maybe then I would be able to sympathize with his actions. Until then, I did not find Haru as a very likable character. \\n\r\nOut of the relatively large cast of side characters, Natsume and Yamaguchi stand out the most. Natsume has her own little anxiety to deal with and personal attraction to sort out. Yamaguchi's arc was the more interesting story in the anime as it brought some romantic spice to the show.\\n\\n\r\nKaibutusu-kun's art is good. The characters were nicely outlined which seemed to make them pop out of the screen. I also liked the vibrant colour palette. I would have preferred that Shizuku sport a long-hair look rather than the double ponytail. It would have made her 10x cuter. The animation was also good. The OST was forgettable. It was not particularly outstanding but not by any means annoying. The OP felt like the intro to a game show in a way, which was pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime seems good for anyone who wishes to relax and not have to think about the characters or thematic elements. For romance fans, this anime is definitely not for you as you will be left disappointed. This may be a popular anime but I would only recommend Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun only if you have nothing else better to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSince I have a dissenting opinion, I would love to hear the other side to this anime! Let me know what you liked about this anime or what you disliked about it!",

            "content": "Within the first few minutes of the show, I felt bombarded with clear signals of mental instability within almost every main character. I immediately started getting annoyed, thinking that my decision to watch a seemingly corny high school anime as an adult was going to be as bad a decision as I had warned myself it would be (I genuinely mean no offense by that whatsoever! Just a joke!). I thought, \"Oh great, it's going to be another unhealthy romance all dolled up to make it look like stalking is cute.\" But.... as I kept on going (because there was just something about this relationshipthat I needed know) I started to realize that that was the theme. It was supposed to be about those kids - the ones who were a little off, or didn't seem to have any friends. Among all other shows I've seen, this one (imo) did the most accurate job at successfully creating an anime for the outcasts. It's about feeling normal for once amongst a sea of people who think you're not. \\n\\n\r\nThese kids are all so lonely, so awkward, so goofy, socially unacceptable (whether for good or bad reasons) that it had me thinking about my own judgements on others, and especially about myself. What was really wrong with these kids? Why were they not accepted? They have the same worries and fears as the others. Once they find each other, we start to see them learn the same lessons as their peers, only they seem to be more aware of the fact that they're experiencing something simple (such as happiness, jealousy, and friendship). In other words: they're growing up. And because of the fact that they're a little late to the party, they're perceptive enough to notice what's happening. It's both comical and a little sad.\\n\r\nIn their own clumsy way, the main characters stumble through lessons of love, friendship, growing up, and some important life lessons. It's absolutely adorable, completely relatable, and it's quite funny.\\n\\n\r\nAnother majorly refreshing plus is the fact that the main female, despite the main dude's attempts to control her actions, remains a strong and independent individual. Instead of the average anime girl who falls head over heels for the bad boy and would do anything he asks without question, Shizuku tells Haru straight-up that he has no right to tell her what to do. I love it! \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd I know, I'm totally over-thinking this... but I just felt something so deep in watching this anime. If you have ever felt like you were not accepted, or like friendship could never be possible for you, I can almost guarantee you will find something relatable in here. Whenever I think about my own social awkwardnesses I just tell myself, \"Haru would be my friend\" :3 I just want to stress that this isn't your average romance story. It's about being a little bit weird (or, in some cases *coughHarucough* a lot a bit weird), and figuring that out yourself, and then learning that it's ok. That's what I like most about it. They don't look at Haru's violent outbursts as normal. They know it's wrong, he knows it's wrong, but they recognize the fear in him and stand together and help each other out. It truly is about friendship and getting to know those friends. The fact that there's a cute romance story on top is just an added bonus! \\n\\n\r\nI just wish they had focused more on the oddities of each person, and put more of an emphasis on those little details that make them so relatable to those of us who have gone through similar things. This is really the only reason I don't give it a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I absolutely adore it.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I watched before I read",

Before, if you didn't notice any metaphors or symbolism, there was nothing to this that was special. Great It was enjoyable; Nothing else to it. \r\nThen you get to the metaphors. The crawfish thatHaru gets for shizuku. The part where Haru \"walks in front of Yama\"(I have still yet to figure this one out fully), the rooster (the rooster is a stretch), etc. All this brings a whole new understanding to the character's typical anime personalities. It helps you realize the true relationships and helps you connect them better. \\n\\n\r\nThese metaphors are better than anything in English literature that I have read (mainly because I hate english literature anyhow), not only because they make sense, but also because they are easy to spot and help you think, but not too easy to spot so it's not like an annoying beating over the head.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why, it can be a 7.9 -10; I prefer 10. \\n\r\nDO NOT AVERAGE THE RANGE. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",
