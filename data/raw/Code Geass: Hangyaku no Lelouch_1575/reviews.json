            "content": "I was incredibly skeptical about Code Geass at first, but I'm very pleased to say that I was greatly surprised.\r\nSTORY - Before I saw this series, it was described to me on multiple occasions as \"Death Note with mechas.\" After seeing it, however, I am inclined to disagree. The similarities between the two series are superficial at best, and though I can see why people would draw the comparison, I don't really think that dis/liking one means that you'll dis/like the other. But anyway, unlike Death Note, I wouldn't say that the story in Code Geass is particularly notable or unique. It's actually rather straightforwardand even a little cliche, but that's exactly why this is such a well done series -- the barebones storyline is handled in a refreshing and new way that grabs the viewer's attention. There are enough twists and turns involved to keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is excellent and nothing feels rushed or drawn out. Indeed, the progression up to the conclusion is especially brilliant. (It's a cliffhanger &quot;ending,&quot; but oh, it's just a fantastic cliffhanger.)\\n\\n\r\nThe series is also appealing in its uncanny ability to mix genres. Yes, this is a mecha series, but it really doesn't have to be. Yes, CLAMP did the character designs and there are some very shoujo elements (read: homolust), but there are very shounen rivalries and some pretty epic battle scenes too. Everybody wins! Additionally, because of the number of characters, the story allows for a number of small subplots. I was very happy with how this was handled in particular because all of the subplots relate and affect the main plot directly, whether by revealing some bit of information to both the characters and the viewer or by pushing forward interesting character development. Everything is well thought out and wonderfully executed, so despite the fact that &quot;strong-willed person with plans to change the world receives mysterious power that helps facilitate his goals&quot; isn't a very unique storyline... Code Geass makes it work.\\n\\n\r\nAlso. Code Geass utilizes the &quot;best friends trying to kill each other&quot; plotline, and I'm a sucker for that plotline.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The characters in this series are rather varied. Some are very plain and one-dimensional, while others have an amazing complexity to them that makes them very life-like. I'll be honest. I've become somewhat infatuated with Lelouch as a character (and am rather biased as a result). To me, he is very much a human character -- he has emotions, opinions, a unique point of view, and some very serious flaws, all of which make him incredibly easy to relate to and to sympathize with. He is easily the most complex character in the series, and he feels real to me, even with his supernatural powers and his genius-level intellect. This ability to make the audience relate to him is also probably the series' greatest strength and the main reason why the story is able to remain relevant and interesting despite the fact that there aren't too many new ideas plotwise.\\n\\n\r\nSuzaku would probably be second in line for complexity after Lelouch, though his sense of justice might be called cliche at first (along with Nunnally's and Euphemia's), and his hax-level physical prowess is somehow harder to accept than Lelouch's genius-level intelligence. It's harder to appreciate Suzaku's depth at first, partially because he is presented as Lelouch's main obstacle and the audience's sympathies are with Lelouch, but a great deal is revealed about his character throughout the course of the series, and he becomes an amazing foil to his rival. Their conflicting ideologies and philosophies are fascinating if you really look into it, and gay as it sounds, they really do compliment each other very well.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the rest of the cast seems to fall into typical archetypes -- there's your adorable little sister, your mad scientist and his assistant, your cheerful schoolgirls, your best friend, your most loyal soldier, your second-in-command, your village idiot, your... really creepy lesbian girl? Despite the generic-sounding descriptions, most of the characters are actually pretty fun, or at the very least, interesting. C.C. provides snarky commentary. Shirley spreads innocent schoolgirl love. Nunnally is so moe you'll die. Jeremiah is a good butt of all jokes. Little bits of backstory are tossed in here and there to separate them from the crowd, but it's never enough to actually intrude, and the wide range of characters lets you settle into the world pretty well too; after all, what universe is complete without an animal mascot that shows up now and again?\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - I wasn't too impressed with CLAMP's character designs at first (noodleboys!), but as always seems to be the case, they gradually grew on me, and I remembered just how pretty X was. CLAMP just knows how to make everyone look amazingly sexy, male or female. I really loved how they did all of the facial expressions in the series though, especially for Lelouch. Seriously, that guy had some of the most awesome crazy expressions, some of the most amazingly touching sadface expressions, and of course, some of the most amusing WTF expressions. The mecha designs for the Knightmare Frames were also pretty awesome. I dig the whole rollar blade thing, and some of the technologies they come up with are neat, if a little over-the-top. The animation is fluid and smooth for the most part and very few things stood out as being bad.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Initially, I wasn't particularly fond of any of the OP/EDs for Code Geass except the first ending by ALI PROJECT because 1) they're awesome, and 2) Yuki Kajiura's style seemed to suit the series very well. The screaming violins both convey the high status of Britannia and the intensity of the emotions in the series. The rest of the themes seemed lackluster in comparison, but though I was never a huge fan of FLOW, &quot;COLORS&quot; kind of grew on me after a while. The final insert song, &quot;Innocent Days&quot; by Hitomi is pretty nice as well. Very thoughtful, very poignant, very fitting. The background music during the series was negligible for the most part; there is some pretty generic battle build-up type music and other appropriate, but rather typical, themes. Still, there's some neat classical/opera stuff, and the &quot;All hail Brittania!&quot; theme is definitely awesome.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - I've seen all of Code Geass subbed and most of it dubbed. Although I was incredibly turned off by Johnny Yong Bosch's role as Lelouch initially, it kind of grew on me, and now I think it fits well enough, though I do wish he'd change his voice a little more when Lelouch is Zero (make it a little deeper?). Suzaku's dub voice surprised me with how appropriate it was too. One of the things I really wish we could replicate in English though, is the subtle differences in manners between characters, between Lelouch and Suzaku at various stages of their lives, and between Lelouch and Zero. In Japanese, when Lelouch and Suzaku are children, they refer to themselves with &quot;boku&quot; and &quot;ore&quot; respectively. As teenagers, the pronouns are swapped, with Lelouch using &quot;ore&quot; (Zero uses &quot;watashi&quot;) and Suzaku using &quot;boku.&quot; Euphemia uses &quot;watakushi.&quot; I'll skip the grammar lesson (go wiki &quot;Japanese pronouns&quot;), but suffice to say that these differences provide a lot of very interesting insight into each of the characters. It's really too bad English isn't nearly as interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the voices in the dub are pretty average, perhaps the low end of average, with a stereotypically high-pitched girly voice for Nunnally that is amazingly annoying, and very forgettable voices for virtually all the female characters (Milly, Shirley, and Kallen all kind of sound the same). I was very impressed with Lloyd's dub voice though, even if nothing will ever amount to his amazing original voice, which is uh, amazing! Seriously. One of the most amusing voices I've ever heard. Jun Fukuyama's voice for Lelouch I found to be a bit too deep/old sounding initially, but that grew on me as well, and I really love the badassity of his voice for Zero. Suzaku's original voice sounds a little generic at first, but it grows with his character. There's a good bit of Engrish in the Japanese version as well, which is always fun. I don't think you can ever get tired of their &quot;Yes, my lord(o)!&quot; or their &quot;All hail Britannia!&quot;\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say the original is damn awesome, and the dub is pretty watchable -- always a plus, right?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I really love this series, and I definitely did not see that happening. Honestly, I found the first episode incredibly underwhelming: the opening sequence made it look like a series I wouldn't be interested in watching at all, and all of the expository really turned me off...but the second episode? That was so much more epic than I could have ever predicted, and I was pretty much won over after that. I'm just a sucker for chess analogies, I guess! Seriously though, good story, good characters, good animation, and good music! Mechas, politics, rivalry and comradery, strained friendships, love and hate, complex ideologies, and blowing shit up! What more could you want? :D\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass is one of my favorite anime. Why? It's filled with so much action, bombastic dialogue, and has such eye-catching visuals that it tops the charts in entertainment value. This is an exciting and epic anime and it's over the top. \r\nFor some people, the plot, characters, and music alone is bad enough to make the show unwatchable. For others, the high action, flashy animation, and drama will be more than enough to make the show a favorite of all time though I like everything about Code Geass. \r\nStory: Lelouch Lamperouge appears to be a typical high school student at Ashford Academy in theBritannian controlled Area 11 (formerly named Japan.) But he's actually a prince in the Britannian imperial family, and seventeenth in line to the throne. He develops a hatred for the emperor of Britannia and the entire imperial establishment, vowing to one day destroy them for the death of his mother and cripple of his sister. After an encounter with a mysterious young woman named C.C., Lelouch gains the power of Geass, which grants him the ability to force anyone to do what he wishes. With this ability, Lelouch becomes a mysterious figure named Zero and begins his battle against the Britannian Empire. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass have too many loose and cliff hanging ends. The end are always left unexplained, leaving the viewer with questions not only about various subplots but also about several key elements of the storyline. However, what makes up for this is the plot and character developments. Every episode is surprising and leave you eager to watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems Code Geass mainly focus on the drama, emotion, and the heart-breaking moments. Geass ends up being not so much a story with a certain plot and characters but rather a series of exciting, exaggerated but well-crafted, incredulous and definitely memorable scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters, are so great and awesome that it's hard to stop enjoying them. There are characters that are a goody too shoe, outright intolerable that will make you want to strangle and kill them off the show. The characters are all so great that something unexpected might happen to them. There are also characters that are naive, filled with too much hate and/or love but in the end, you'll have a character you like or maybe even love. My favorite character, of course, are C.C., Kallen, and Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Another good thing about Code Geass is its high production values and colorful animation. The character designs, created by CLAMP, are great and well drawn. The animation may not be great but it is detailed, vivid, and lively. The fights aren't as smooth or fluid as it could be but it's flashy, colorful, which is very much fitting considering the nature of the series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting also plays a role in the show's success. Characters like Zero and Suzaku may be outrageous or cliched but their voice actors fit the characters so well that they are able to sell the characters. One of my favorite voice actor, Jun Fukuyama, does a great job playing the key character of Lelouch/Zero. His performance, especially how well he change from the carefree high school student to the more sinister and manipulative rebel is vital to keeping the series enjoyable and entertaining. Fukuyama is usually playing two characters and does it absolutely convincingly. There's nothing to complain about of the music either as the background music is very good and it fits right in it. The openings for Code Geass are my favorite. It's very paced and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've seen Geass more than 5 times in a row already. (Not counting season 2)  This is a nice, great anime. With the non-stop action, you'll be wanting to see which side will win and lose. For one moment you can be smiling, then crying the next. Happens to me sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Code Geass is a awesome  anime that will surely gather different opinions from viewers and other reviewers other than myself. I've seen and heard a lot of people saying SUNRISE has done an awesome job and it's not because of the use of mecha, action or drama, but rather how effectively it appeals to that certain aspect of anime that is not often addressed and yet is one of the main purposes of anime: entertainment. If your main interest in anime is in the quality of the storytelling or the characters, then Geass is probably not for you. However, if you're in it to have fun or for some good laughs, then take a look at this anime. You wont be disappointed. Indeed Geass is a rare accomplishment.",

            "content": "Alright, its taken me since April to reach this point so I may as well dispense with any further delays and say it outright.  Code Geass:  Lelouch of the Rebellion is not a masterpiece, it isn\u2019t a great show nor is it a very good one.  What it is is a marginally good television program that takes concepts and characters from a wide variety of successful anime productions from the last decade and stitches them all together into twenty-five episodes of vulgarity and excess, a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a production that has the cold manufactured feel of a product of a focusgroup rather than of a motivated team of creative individuals.\\n\\n\r\nLet me take a step back for a moment, because the truth of the matter is that Code Geass brought with it a genuinely compelling concept, one that could have done wonders if the creators at Sunrise had known what the hell they were doing.  It takes place in an alternate universe where a version of the British Empire called Britannia, through various quirks of fate, manages to endure and thrive into the 21st century.  After witnessing the assasination of his mother and having his and his sister\u2019s lives ruined by his father, an exiled Britannian prince living under the assumed name Lelouch Lamperouge, out of a desire for revenge against the emperor, rises to become a revolutionary leader in an occupied Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThis concept could have gone in any number of directions and in the right hands could have been turned into something truly remarkable.  Unfortunately Goro Tanaguchi and his team at Sunrise either didn\u2019t realize the potential of what they\u2019d come up with or were simply too caught up in making a commercially successful product to care.  For, you see, although the basic premise survived to see the light of day it has been chained to and obscured by a wide variety of disparate concepts and ideas, none of which add anything of substance to the proceedings.  This is a program that wants to be a mecha action series at the same time it wants to be a war drama at the same time it wants to be a romance/harem series at the same time it wants to be a high school comedy while above all else its trying to be Death Note with a copy of V for Vendetta in its pocket.  It all gives the impression of a program that\u2019s so terribly frightened of being disliked by any one subset of the anime fandom that it rushes to appeal to every conceivable kind of viewer and as a result is never truly exceptional at any of the things it attempts.\\n\\n\r\nGiant robots, for example, are thrown in for no better reason than to draw in and satisfy the needs of the giant robot fandom.  I don\u2019t have anything against mecha per se but neither do I have any great love for it leaving me rather indifferent to it overall.  All I ask is that it adds something to the experience, that there is some concrete purpose for their presence motivated by the narrative, that the giant robots aren\u2019t merely props easily interchangeable with any other fantastical weaponry.  Full Metal Panic provides, in its continuity, a fairly detailed justification for how its variation on the giant robot concept came into being.  Patlabor provides a similarly believable rationale as well.  Ride Back would have had a wonderful thematic connection to its motorcycle/robot hybrids had the creators had the sense to utilize a specific scene outside of the end credits.  Code Geass has no such virtue.  The \u201cKnightmare frames\u201d come across as a ploy just as empty and cynical as Gonzo\u2019s additions of giant robots to their adaptations of Kurosawa\u2019s Seven Samurai and Dumas\u2019s The Count of Monte Cristo.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself runs into trouble fairly quickly.  In the first episode, Lelouch is inspired to begin his campaign against Britannia when he obtains a supernatural ability called Geass from a mysterious girl wearing a tight-fitting straitjacket.  This ability allows him to control the will and actions of anyone he chooses with very few actual limitations.  All he needs is direct eye contact with his intended victim and that\u2019s it.  By comparison the Death Note has a whole page full of rules and restrictions on its use.  As a result, a lot of Death Note\u2019s intrigue is generated from the various ways Light Yagami finds to work with or around those rules.  The Geass is almost too powerful by comparison.  As a result it makes his decision to start a rebellion in Japan as a means of gaining revenge against his father in Britannia seem a very roundabout way of doing things.  It would seem more effective to simply hop a plane home, Geass his way past security to get to his father and that would be the end of it.  Its not like Lelouch doesn\u2019t accomplish much the same thing with his brother Clovis at the end of the second episode.  Of course, if Lelouch were to actually follow the course simple logic would dictate then he wouldn\u2019t have started his rebellion and Code Geass wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to indulge in enough overblown spectacle to shame Michael Bay.\\n\\n\r\nThis problem is further compounded by the revelation in the second episode that Lelouch is some sort of super-genius strategist.  It\u2019s never explained to any degree where his ability comes from, whether the creators want the viewer to assume that its some sort of blood inherited trait or that he was simply educated on the subject.  The most the viewer is allowed to understand is that Lelouch\u2019s \u201cstrategic brilliance\u201d has something to do with the fact that he\u2019s good at chess, which, if you actually accept that, only explains a fraction of the schemes that he devises.  In the end, as a character Lelouch comes across as little more than a plot devise, a strategy generating machine that provides the series with its single greatest source of overblown spectacle.  \\n\\n\r\nOut of the rest of the cast the only character who made, or I should say had the potential to leave in impression on me was the anti-Britannian rebel Kallen.  She receives an entire episode devoted to her background as the daughter of a Japanese mother and a Britannian father.  Much is made of her identification with the Japanese side of her parentage and how her deceased brother figures into things and there is indeed potential for something interesting here.  Unfortunately nothing is ever done with any of these elements.  Everything that was brought up in that episode is quickly shelved and never brought up again. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that a good portion of the issues I have with the show stem from the fact that Code Geass possesses all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the skull.  The result is a heavily calculated experience where the hands of the creators can be clearly seen picking and choosing which ideas or scenarios would have the greatest impact regardless of whether or not they make any sense (coincidences are invoked to the point of absurdity).  The first episode alone depicts an ethnic cleansing (a scenario the series portrays twice in its first season) and a bloody mass suicide sure to satisfy the more ghoulish members of the viewership.  Fanservice is plentiful and obvious with only a scant few female cast members escaping the first season with their dignity, if they ever had any to begin with.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things there isn\u2019t really a whole lot I can complain about.  The animation is smooth well done.  The color scheme employed can be a little too bright and cheery for its own good with purple mechs and a city that is lit with pink lighting at night but that is a minor complaint overall.  Character designs come courtesy of CLAMP so if you like their artwork you\u2019ll like what you see here.  If you don\u2019t like CLAMP then there isn\u2019t anything in Code Geass that will convince you otherwise.  The soundtrack, credited to Hitomi Kuroishi and Kotaro Nakagawa, isn\u2019t anything spectacular but it is nonetheless serviceable.  It is a competent presentation overall, if only.",

            "content": "Directed by Goro Taniguchi, arguably one of the best directorial talents left at studio Sunrise, and written by his Planetes screenwriter Ichiro Okouchi, Code Geass promised to be a true epic series in the making. An interesting alternate history, a lead character that promised to evolve into a ruthless rebel seeking revenge against the father and the country that ruined his and his sisters life and a dash of mecha added into the mix for good measure. So why did it turn into such a complete circus? An absolute mess of jumbled ideas never touched upon in any way that isn`t absurd or laughable, acast of characters who constantly degrade into utter imbeciles and a constantly re-shuffled plot. By the half-way mark of Code Geass, it`s as if focus changed from creating an actually riveting series, to essentially seeing how stupid they could take the whole thing and see how many viewers would go along with the ride.\\n\\n\r\nStory: While Code Geass had an interesting premise that seemingly got off to a good start, it`s unfortunate the creators of the show had no idea how to handle the mass of ideas they had, or perhaps they simply didn`t care. New plot elements are introduced while at the same time are others are pushed back and delayed, sometimes by many episodes, and sometimes taken out of the show entirely, left to be settled in the 2nd season yet to air. The writing completely flat lines half way through and instead of the gripping and fast paced war/revenge story we had, we then dive headfirst into utterly inane romance drama with a resolution so incredibly bone headed that the series has almost turned into a comedy. As the series moves on, almost as if the romance was a checkbox on a &quot;to do&quot; list of the plot, the series gradually builds up again, making you think it may yet recover, despite the still omnipresent idiocy, but the show sees fit to deliver a &quot;plot twist&quot; so completely over the top and ridiculous, the writers have wrecked absolutely everything that the series had built in it`s first half, only to deliver one of the most stupid and pathetic twists in recent years. I can`t imagine the writers had any other intention rather than having the audience laugh at the absurdity of it all. The series seems to want to be so many things at the same time. It wants to be a gripping war story, a drama about revenge, it wants to include romance and tragedy, but without foregoing humour. Unfortuntely it was unable to do any of these right.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music wise, the show's soundtrack doesn't impress much if you're familiar with Kotaro Nakagawa. His music here is essentially a rehash of mostly every other show he's done and remixed into one soundtrack. The only stand out area are the vocal tracks by Hitomi and Mikio Sakai, but even those are all too familiar if you're aquainted with their previous works. As far as the OP and EDs go, Colors by FLOW is a great accesible song, and Hitomi no Tsubasa by Access is perfectly catchy in that &quot;I wouldn't admit in real life that I like this&quot; way. The rest of the shows selections vary from the uninspired (2nd ED), to mind numbingly awful (ED1 and it's usual Ali Project rehash and the often hated OP2).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:Just as the plot of the series completely crumbles midway through the series, so do the characters. Completely intolerable and annoying side villains are introduced while other much more interesting ones are left to languich and not to reappear until much later. The constantly annoying Suzaku throughout the show is barely even a character, so much his personality and intentions are a joke. Some characters have their personal development completely eradicated from the series, again only to delay it into a second season, while most are barely given even a cursory look, including even supposedly main antagonists. Worst of all is Lelouch, whose descent into a sort of machiavellian evil was purportedly the series main selling point (Episode 1 &quot;the day the devil was born&quot;), is reduced to an utter half wit, commiting imbecilic mistake after another and constantly proving to be all talk and nothing more. A complete let down in every sense.\\n\\n\r\nValue: A seemingly promising series that eventually degrades into nothing more than fanservice and idiocy. Whatever points the series seemed to want to make in it`s first half are utterly invalidated by it`s second. The lack of any sort of resolution, for anything in the series is as confusing as it is aggravating. Being made to wait 4 months for a completely lackluster &quot;ending&quot; only to find out we`ll have to wait even more for any kind of resolution is ridiculous. Knowing that a second season is in the making is irrelevant, there needs to be some kind of payoff for sitting through 25 episodes of this, and all we are left with is having to wait for another 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As far as rating this show as an enjoyable new series with promise from a once great director, I`d be hard pressed to give it anymore than a 4. Nevertheless, the shows stupidity and constant excesses at least made it worth watching for a few laughs. Laughing at it of course, not with it. Sunrise seems to be stuck in a rut in terms of how it plans out and executes it`s shows. Mai Hime, Mai Otome, and now Code Geass and unfortunately they don`t seem likely to want to change that formula. I expected much more from the people behind this show, a complete shame.",

            "content": "A new Gundam series is being announced! Naruto: Shippuden is finally beginning! KyoAni is doing something new! RomeoXJuliet!\r\nThese are titles that attract us to the newest animes, but Code Geass, much like our beloved Suzumiya Haruhi was (and is) a fall/winter sleeper success. This anime, backed by Sunrise, director Goro Taniguchi (s-CRY-ed, Gun X Sword) and scriptwriter Ichiro Okouchi (Azumanga, RahXephon, Eureka 7) showcases an excellent engine of entertainment. \r\nStory \r\nA key part of any mecha/action anime. Code Geass is set in an alternate reality in which it appears the American Revolution during the late 1700s was quelled and Britain went on to conquer therest of the Americas. Thus, the Holy Britannian Empire became the world's largest superpower, covering 1/3 of the world. On August 10th, 2010, a.t.b, Japan is conquered by the Empire, renamed to Area 11 while her people are designated as 'elevens' and have their rights stripped. Thus begins the story of Code Geass, the tale of Lelouch Lamperouge, eleventh prince of the Empire and his ambition to obtain revenge on the Empire through whatever means necessary. Through the use of this alternate reality setting, we&rsquo;re definitely given something out of the ordinary. Code Geass brings a new spice to an old genre. Code Geass hops along with an arc to arc system with a few lighthearted episodes to mix things up. The story builds with each arc (obviously) to the climax. Although the rising action allows for few breaks, the viewer is never overwhelmed with information or under whelmed by a standstill. As each arc progresses to its end, we&rsquo;re given answers to previous questions yet new ones always arrive &ndash; it&rsquo;s this sense of mystery that really gives Geass its draw for attention.\\n\r\nPros: Intriguing political, action, dramatic and moral oriented story. The questions never stop &ndash; the viewer is always left wanting to discover and see more. Light hearted episodes here and there, placed very well (ex..The School Festival).\\n\r\nCons: A few scenes may turn people off on the series &ndash; something parts may seem excessively strange (read: some to some people). Again, I&rsquo;d like to reiterate that for a mecha fan, I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;ll be watching this for either story or super awesome mecha battles &ndash; you&rsquo;ll get both from this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe main characters are all extremely well devised by the hands of the all female group, CLAMP. Besides their high aesthetic appearance, each character harbors a separate and distinctive personality essential to the story. For example, Lelouch and Suzaku, opposing main characters and best friends both suffer from a very Machiavellian, &quot; Do the ends justify the means,&quot; syndrome. Lelouch is willing to do anything to further his goals however Suzaku remains wary of what must be done and what should be done. Code Geass shows us the characters inside the mechs; they're not clean cut: &quot;I fight to protect someone I care about.&quot; Each character must weigh the morality of their options as influenced by their past where the correct decision may place them farther from their goals. \\n\r\nPros: Large cast of balanced characters providing a wide arrange of personalities and moral conjectures. Characters are quirky and enjoyable.\\n\r\nCons: Only the main characters matter; anyone else is pushed to the sidelines (i.e. their stories are never a main focus).\\n\\n\r\nThe Battles\\n\r\nCode Geass delivers during its extremely well devised battle scenes. Battles seem as if they were an entirely seperate anime; lines are drawn, ace pilots face off and the battlefield is real. Geass takes a new twist on &quot;main-characters-destroy-grunts-then-whoever-else-battles&quot; and puts us right in the intensity. As said above, there is a large array of characters, interesting on both the &quot;good&quot; side and the &quot;bad&quot; side (which is which is up to you). The battlefield pits them against each other in a deatch match where we know one has to lose yet we are sympathetic to characters on both sides. This sort of conflict draws out the most amazing and interesting battles you can get from a mecha series of this time. Battlefields are led by commanders (obviously) who must make judgements based on his or her opponents's tactics and information - the strategem of battles only adds to the entertainment. The complexity and chaos of a battle give the illusion that you are watching a real war happening right before your eyes.    \\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\r\nNot much to say here; Sunrise puts money into this, characters look great, mechs look great, everything looks great. However, the art design may put some people off; characters are very tall and lanky (as expected from CLAMP) while grunt mechs are generally unimpressive. Overall though animation is on the high end of the spectrum even during low budget episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nCode Geass is probably one of the few mecha anime's that will appeal to more than just action fans. Battles are kept to a minimum: the main attraction consists of Japanese nationalism against foreign invaders, their actions which undoubtedly cause bloodshed in the name of peace. One of the themes I enjoyed was the balance between cause and effect. Characters were constantly victims of their and others&rsquo; actions this although a given in the real world seems to slip past many other story boards.",

            "content": "Yet another review for the highly acclaimed Code Geass. I believe this is the 98th review C.G would\u2019ve received; but I can\u2019t help but review this even if so many others have. \r\nHow does such a blatant horribly written show gorging with clich\u00e9s and plotholes ever be compared to the likes of or considered as Death Note\u2019s rival? I suppose it's because both shows were aired at the same time in Japan. I suppose it's because of \"how uncanny\" the resemblance between the two anti-heros are. And I suppose it's because they feature \"the ends justify the means\" views and morals. I startedwatching because of the many reviews that has praised this and the amount of people who recommended this for people who liked Death Note. And so I watched it. And regrettably so. \\n\\n\r\nMeet Lelouch Lamperouge. Former prince of the Britannian Empire, previously named \u201cLelouch Vi Britannia\u201d. He and his younger sister, Nunnally had left the royal family after their mother had been brutally assassinated many years ago and they now live on campus on Ashford Academy, where he also goes to school at. One day, he comes across a beautiful girl named C.C or C2 who gives him the power of Geass which is located in his left eye. His Geass allows him control people and make them do any of his bidding once. He uses this power to crush the Britannian Empire and under the alias \u201cZero\u201d he leads the Black Knights, a terrorist organisation, and sets out to free the world from Britannia\u2019s clutches.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder how many clich\u00e9s we already encountered in that paragraph. We have the \u201csecretly a prince\u201d clich\u00e9, the \u201cschool environment\u201d clich\u00e9, the \u201cmysterious and beautiful girl\u201d clich\u00e9 and the \u201crevenge on killing my mommy\u201d clich\u00e9. And that\u2019s just the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just one big mess. It had more plot holes than the ozone layer. They just keep adding and adding to the plot but do nothing about it. To keep up with the \u2018story\u2019 I had to constantly read the episodes summaries in Wikipedia, which I never had to do with any other series. And quite frankly, this has got to be the most boring series ever. I bet if they took out the mecha part of this the show would\u2019ve been a flop. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. We have a number of characters in this show, whom are mostly ineffective and does not add to the story whatsoever. Why the need for so many characters? Throughout the whole series I think I remembered 5 characters out of a cast of 50+. The White Knights didn\u2019t do much; neither did the Chinese government and where the hell did that guy who I assume is the glasses-girl-who\u2019s-madly-in-love-with-Princess-Euphemia boyfriend come from?!\\n\\n\r\nLelouch has got to be the most overrated character ever. We\u2019re told he\u2019s smart but so far all I\u2019ve seen is that he\u2019s good at chess. His strategies are bland and under explained to the point where logic seemed to be extinct when coming up with them, as if he just guesses the next move to take correctly.  And he is the worst anti-hero I\u2019ve come across. The way tactlessly kill innocent humans isn\u2019t justified to well either. It was quite a bore to see him \u2018use\u2019 people, but not actually manipulate him; like getting close to them and puppeteer them in such a way that angers the viewer. But instead, the viewer doesn\u2019t feel anger towards Lelouch for being such a bastard prick who play with people because he DOESN\u2019T play with them. The viewer feels nothing: no anger, no sadness nor even excitement as he continues killing people. In other words, he fails at being an anti hero. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing. The Geass. He can make any person do his bidding once. And that\u2019s about it. He doesn\u2019t try to find any way around the Geass, how he can use it or anything of that nature. Totally boring. \\n\\n\r\nNormally having different art styles is one of the plus sides of anime. However, the art in this had me cringing. The characters are disturbingly anorexic, all of them being 6ft tall and 40kg heavy. It was just ridiculous. The noses are undefined and oddly shaped, as for the rest of their sack of bones of a body. The animators weren\u2019t afraid to show scantily clad woman at the drop of a hat either. Ecchi in this show managed to exceed that of a sleazy harem, and fan service covered just about every minute of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can salute Code Geass for is the music. They manage to skilfully implement everything from jazz music to marching band trumpets in the show. However the openings were a bit of a let down, with average J-Pop taking the spot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I believe this just seems to be an anime where the creators tried to throw in as many clich\u00e9s as they can possible and tried to make it an intelligent anime but have failed miserably. Have I mentioned how BORED I was from this? I\u2019m surprised how masochistic I\u2019ve become and actually watched 15 episodes of R2 before it became too much and dropped it.",

            "content": "Code Geass is set in a alternate reality where the Britannian Empire has conquered more than one third of the world and counting, and that includes Japan. In said Japan, now called \"Area 11\" - and its inhabitants \"elevens\" -, a Britannian student named Lelouch Lamperouge finds himself thrown into a cycle of events that ultimately leads to him gaining a power known as the \"Geass\", a power allowing him to force anyone to obey any order he gives to them. Together with his hate for Britannia, he uses his newfound powers to gain followers and eventually bring forth a war against the oppressive BritannianEmpire.\\n\\n\r\nThe story skips along at a fast pace, taking the viewer through one event after another, spending neither too little time nor too much time on each event. And skipping has a more literal meaning here too; the story tends to take small jumps here and there, not explaining the events in between until a bit later. This may come off as a little confusing, but it's also a nice way of keeping you wondering what's going on and what's going to happen next. It doesn't lack twists and turns either, and especially towards the end will you get some unexpected yet pivotal twists.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I love about Code Geass is that it frequently delves into subplots, something which would've normally been bad for a two-season series. However, despite their initial prospects of irrelevancy towards the main story, in the end they serve a purpose in the grand perspective, either by moving the plot forward or by presenting character development. These subplots also help keep the show a refreshing and interesting watch.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that there's a lot of ideology in the picture, both on a political and a personal level. The Britannian Empire has their share of - in my opinion - wrong beliefs. The most obvious one is the racism they're displaying towards the inhabitants of the territories Britannia has conquered - or Numbers, as they call them. They also follow social Darwinism, which is basically the principle of natural selection implemented into human society. Stupid beliefs, if you ask me. But not everyone thinks so, it would seem.\\n\\n\r\nThe more intriguing ideologies are found when we move down to the personal level, though, with Lelouch and Suzaku's differing beliefs being the root of a ideological conflict. While their goals are more or less the same, they differ in their views on which methods should be used to accomplish the goals - Lelouch believes that the end justifies the means no matter what, while Suzaku believes that peace by murder is wrong. This conflict between two best friends (when not in battle) is a really interesting one, because it is so representative of the moral conflict that's presented - who is good, and who is bad? Britannia - or Zero? Decide for yourself who you want to sympathize with.\\n\\n\r\nMany people have compared Code Geass with Death Note, saying that it is the same, just with mecha. While it is easy to see where that is coming from, it is only on the surface that this is true. Both series' main characters are very intelligent and analytical fellows who believe that the world must be changed through bloodshed, and they both have some supernatural power. But that's all there is to it. Aside that they're as different as day and night. As a character and human being, Lelouch is a thousand times more believable than Light, mostly because he is explored much more than Light is; all we got to see in Death Note was Light's intelligence and analytical capabilities, while in Code Geass we actually get to explore Lelouch as a human, and partake in his emotional experiences, be it love or interaction with his friends, victory or defeat. And aside the two of them, I couldn't really find any similarities between the two shows. Hence, you may like one and not the other, so if you've watched Death Note and did not like it (:o), you may still like Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass also presents a huge array of supporting characters. Some are more one-dimensional and clich&eacute; than others, yet they all have their defined personalities and roles in the story. Some of them are developed in a great way, and come off as believable during their exposition. The subplots mainly focus on them, and either develops the characters or the story, and it's interwoven with the main story in a truly great way.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass, both story- and character-wise, builds up more and more towards the end; the impending climax becoming more and more evident after each and every episode. Finally, in the last two episodes, the fuse has run out, and the bomb blows. In the end however, what one will see is the smoke and not the results of the big explosion; you are left with one massive cliffhanger that'll make you long for - no, need to watch the second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are done by CLAMP, and anyone who've watched or read one of their works will know what to expect in this department: Tall and lanky characters. It's a style that may be new and unusual for many, but it really grows on you, and you can't help but think that it looks good enough, even though their proportions are off. The animation isn't anything spectacular in other departments, but it's good. Great special effects and detailed surroundings help on the aesthetic pleasure too, and aesthetics is something which is important to me when I watch an anime. The coloring is fresh and vivid, however often too much so; at times it could've probably gained from having a darker color tone. Nevertheless, it was well done. The action scenes are made out well, with smooth animation and great mecha movement, and just the right effect of chaos that's needed during intense battles. There is some reusing of the &quot;Geass-effect&quot;; the special effects they use when Lelouch uses the Geass, and while cool the first few times, it gets a bit annoying in its persistence.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, I'm a sucker for the type music they used in Code Geass. Utilizing voices instead of instruments makes for an experience that I just fall completely for, and several insert songs make it even better. Some background themes are reused a lot, but my, are they effectual. The opening and ending themes aren't especially noteworthy, unless you're a fan of the artists performing the songs, that is. The first ending theme is made by Ali Project, and I have to say, I've grown to like their style a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass can be summarized to an anime that doesn't produce anything that's over the top or exceptional, but it does give us is one helluva experience with great characters, intriguing ideologies as well as a twisted plotline that ends in a cliffhanger so massive it could kill you!",

            "content": "Probably one of the most blatantly obvious train-wrecks of bad writing in the history of serial visual narrative production, shamefully destroying its own at first stimulating concept of alternate reality with awful characterizations, extremely weak script and cheap developments that only serve the purpose of working as a &ldquo;shock-factor&rdquo; to keep the audience entranced beyond the notice of a very clear lack of sequential planning.\r\nHonestly speaking, the show is certainly fun and even held itself within certain quality standard during the irregularly interesting initial 11 episodes but as characters exponentially lose their own minds and personalities we are nothing else but witnesses of the nowclassical conceptual phrase in entertainment: &ldquo;jumping the shark&rdquo;. By the badly plotted twist in its &ldquo;praised by the masses&rdquo; stage 22 the series barely keeps itself as dirty and trashy fun that that makes you willingly embrace the filth of Japanese animation: the very price of marketing in a ridiculous attempt at dramatic storytelling that takes to oblivion without any justification its own suspension of disbelief. \\n\\n\r\nThe core problem is, of course, Lelouch. Some may argue it&rsquo;s hard to portray a genius but in the end it&rsquo;s as simple as keeping him from committing underdeveloped mistakes just for the sake of progressing the chronicled history. Not to mention how the rest of cast just acts without any justification whatsoever and never lives up to their indicated development or makes any attempt at decently stopping their inevitable crash into mediocrity. Nevertheless I got to admit that despite her poor dialogs Cornelia remained amazingly likeable, and that must say something about the value hidden in the idea of her original concept.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, with the lack of any real literary theme so to speak besides the hilariously exploitative Machiavellian motivation of its ridiculous excuse for a lead, the show honors the words of director Goro Tanigushi and exists as just an excuse to create a &ldquo;hit show&rdquo; to appeal both males and females. He succeeded for sure, shame it was at the cost of all the artistic merits of the finalized production.",

            "content": "Some people like to attribute Code Geass's success to the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Personally, I'd like to think that it succeeds (critically) despite the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Code Geass manages to establish a believable backdrop from which it launches a compelling plot along with motivated and realistic characters, something that has been missing from the last few Gundam series produced by Sunrise.  It injects a plot where the focus is finally on the characters and the events surrounding them, rather than the machines that they use to fight.  In fact, it could besaid that Code Geass only qualifies as a mecha anime due to the existence of the machines - they are in no way integral to the plot nor its development anymore than a tank or any other weapon that the characters may be using (aside from the mysterious &quot;Geass&quot; itself).\\n\\n\r\nGeass's plot is strengthened by its attention to detail in the geopolitical climate that the series quickly establishes from the get-go.  While the setting isn't too unique for a futuristic mecha (world divided between multiple superpowers, belligerent native populations fight to reestablish their cultural identity, etc.), the way the events are interwoven with one another sets itself up as being above the status quo.  Code Geass also manages to ask some of the questions that other futuristic plots seemingly neglect, either through purposeful avoidance or just through sheer ignorance.  From a political / sociological perspective, the setting and the development are especially engaging, posing questions on the topics of nationalism, racism, genocide, and the rules of war to the audience.  While you shouldn't expect any profoundly new ideas to arise from the series, the fact that the writers and creators did weave these ideas into the ongoing plot makes the world both more realistic as well as more theoretical at the same time, providing both an environment for the characters to exist in as well a philosophical establishment that they can debate.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the writers do not merely craft a beautiful world and leave it alone - instead, they focus much of their attentions, especially in the latter half of the season, towards physically and metaphysically deconstructing the world, both in the direct, tangible actions of the characters as well as the moral questions surrounding their resolve and trains of thought.  Such is the development of the actual plot of Code Geass: fluid, dynamic, and engaging.  While not entirely unpredictable, the plot's development is seamless in terms of being able to logically move from one event to another, such that the implications of a &quot;cause and effect&quot; paradigm can be observed.  At the same time, the plot is also not so simplistic as to be a &quot;Point A -&gt; Point B -&gt; Point C&quot; formula.  Instead, we witness the joining and interweaving of multiple, distinct plot lines, which at first glance are independent of one another, but towards the end fuse into one.  Then, Code Geass throws us a curveball, and splits the strands again, preparing us for the upcoming Season 2....\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest relative strength of Code Geass when compared to most other action / mecha anime are its characters and the way they develop.  Sunrise made the intelligent decision of contracting CLAMP to design the characters, since they are both visually and emotionally appealing to a wide array of audiences.  Internet messageboards are usually torn between the main protagonists and side characters of the story, each holding one above the others for a personal reason that they see within each one of them.  In addition, the side characters are not there merely for ornamentation - even the seemingly minor characters at the sides of the main few are given room to develop with their own storylines and reactions, such that we are never really compelled to dismiss characters as merely being &quot;filler fodder&quot;.  Prepare to be intrigued by these individuals - from the psychological coldness of Lelouch, to the restrained idealism of Suzaku and Kallen, to the overall question mark that is C.C.  The reactions of the individuals combine to form distinct, evolving psychological profiles, allowing the series to be populated by a cadre of multifaceted individuals.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Code Geass is extremely successful from a storytelling perspective, it does have its faults, especially on the technical side.  Plain and simple, the fight scenes were not too impressive.  That is not to say that they were awful, but the mecha and battle scenes definitely did not compare tot he fluidity of the script nor the depth of the characterization.  In addition, especially towards the latter third of the season, the plot does take a few freedoms with regards to suspension of disbelief, as well as falling into the trap of rapidly switching between &quot;tragically dramatic&quot; to &quot;comically relieving&quot; scenes.  However, these are minor problems, especially the &quot;bloated plotlines&quot;, which fixes itself by the end of the series.  I also would not recommend this series to mecha addicts who are genuinely more interested in awesome combat scenes between mechas, since Code Geass will not live up to your expectations.  However, for the rest of you, even if you have never considered picking up a mecha anime to watch, pick up Code Geass, it is sure to not disappoint.",

            "content": "Code Geass is one of those series that can inspire praise, hatred or mere ridicule, depending on what is expected or what can be tolerated. Curiously, I find entirely valid reasons behind each of those reactions. There's still a bit of this and that, to put it bluntly, but perhaps the lines aren't quite as clear as they seem.\r\nIn short, I enjoyed the series and still find that its virtues and sheer fun factor outweigh its objective flaws, but I'm worried about the future. Whether or not the inevitable sequel picks up the slack, addresses existing concerns or drops the ball completely is something thatonly Sunrise knows at this point. In any case, we might as well enjoy what we can.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is melodramatic and ambitious enough. Lelouch, the protagonist, is embarking on a personal quest through the use of his intellect and a mysterious power, motivated by personal revenge and morally ambiguous altruism. The setting is divided into two spheres, the edgier world of military/politics and the more carefree environment of the Ashford academy, with their respective casts of characters. There's a clear element of mecha action here as well, even if it's not really the main attraction and doesn't dominate the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace is definitely fast and unrelenting...perhaps it's all a bit much for Lelouch's and the story's own good, though, as things turn out. The writing and direction can be uneven during the weaker moments, but are absolutely thrilling at their best. Most of it develops quite nicely, with some general predictability and a few genuine surprises that keep things interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest concerns are certain major twists which threaten to overwhelm the viewer, if they are not enjoyed or understood. Intentional and unintentional humor, such as Pizza Hut's sponsorship or many over the top sequences, can be occasionally distracting as well. I personally felt that the basic focus is never lost, however, when all is said and done, in spite of a few undeniable blunders or red herrings.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, we've only seen half the story and, for better or for worse, the upcoming sequel has the responsibility of providing true resolution. Or at least trying to do so in an interesting way, whether it fails or succeeds at it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nProduction values are good and tend to stay consistent. I've never been a CLAMP fan, mostly due to unfamiliarity, so their original character designs for Code Geass -while distinctive and attractive- don't really impress me too much. They may also look strange from certain angles. The mechanical designs are just fine for the show's purposes, with a couple of particularly well done models. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe music is appropriate and mostly unobtrusive, whether the mood is serious, exciting, relaxed, mischievous, dramatic or tragic. Not exactly the best soundtrack I've ever heard, as a few tracks could use more variety. The opening and ending themes are quite well done, as a rule, and tend to fit the show. Naturally, your mileage may vary here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nFor someone who is often accused of being a copycat there are certain nuances to Lelouch's personality that set him apart, such as his emotional range and a sense of humanity emerging from his internal conflicts or character flaws. Predictably, the protagonist himself carries the show on his back and receives the most development, which is good since he does deserve much of it and this makes him an interesting subject of study. Having said that, said development has at least one major drawback: it may not be what people are expecting and finding certain events relatively disappointing or even anti-climatic is quite possible. Suzaku, who also plays an important role as Lelouch's foil, has a self-righteous personality and his interference can be very annoying to witness. He does have some complexity though, even if it's still a hard sell for those who find themselves sympathizing with Lelouch/Zero. C.C. herself is mysterious enough, as we've only seen bits and pieces of information regarding her background thus far, but remains an intriguing and generally fun character by virtue of her interactions with Lelouch. \\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters tend to get some attention too, with interesting results in the major cases whether you appreciate their fates or not. The big issue for me is that the cast of characters might seem a bit too large as the show goes on, with a couple of unnecessary additions towards the later half that tend to delay, limit or rush development. Still, this is the kind of show where such size makes sense on paper given its scope, but as a result we will have to wait for the sequel in order to see if a few questionable plot threads are continued, resolved or at least replaced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Code Geass, even though I wasn't entirely convinced about certain plot twists and openly laughed along with certain sequences or developments, was certainly entertaining and rarely boring. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, I appreciated both the genuinely well-done portions and several of the more absurd scenarios. The show is not a masterpiece by any means, nor is it going to please every sector of the audience that it will initially attract. I'd still be perfectly happy to recommend it to those who haven't seen it.",

            "content": "There some mecha's that achieve near brilliance, and others that are rendered useless in their awkward failure. Code Geass is neither of this. \r\nI started Code Geass as soon as the first episode aired.. Yes, I have enjoyed it very much. But to my surprise, on the arrival of the 13th episode, Code Geass took the anime industry by storm. Like a moth to a flame, people crowded the anime and simply worshiped it(God knows how many CC fans are being born as of this moment). Much as Ive enjoyed Code Geass, it does not do justice to be considered what it is today. Infact I feel its popularity is similar to FMA, both are highly enjoyable but nowhere near being the masterpiece people claim it to be.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is not a sight to behold, but rather a sight to gather thousands of fans within only barely dozen of episodes. Spectacle, after all, is Code Geass specialty, not subtlety, so enjoying the sum of the parts sometimes requires dispassionate detachment or at least blind belief. But whether you think Code Geass is absurd or lacking originality, Code Geass is one of the most fun and engaging anime's in recent memory, as long as you don't think about it too hard.\\n\\n\r\nJapan, being defeated by the empire of Britannia, whose territory reaches nearly one third of the world thanks to their high-tech war machines called Knightmares, was renamed to Area 11. Britannia swiftly depraved the Elevens(Japanese) of their pride, rights and isolated them from the migrating citizens of Britannia, leaving them to poverty.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where our main boy steps in. Lelouch, a young former prince of Britannia who was known to have passed away, not to mention a cheap ripoff of Light Yagami from Death Note.  During a battle between the Britanna and a scarce amount of rebelling Elevens, Lelouch finds a capsule containing a naked woman, who gives Lelouch Geass, a mysterious ability that can control any human simply by looking them in the eyes and speaking his commands. And because that it just so happens that Lelouch has this great animosity for the Brittania, he plans to single handedly face the tyrant. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch under the alias of Zero, becomes a hope to the elevens and a threat to Britannia.\\n\\n\r\nIts hard not to compare Lelouch from Yagami Light of Death Note. But if you can get past it, you'll find out something more. Coming with a tragic past pre-installed, it may seem that Lelouch is your typical apprehended teenager(Gundam anyone?). But Lelouch in a way, is a revenge-driven genius who would dare to go against the world to reach his goals and doesnt endlessly desires to just die without a fight.  He even has the discernment for seizing control of the situation and directs the terrorist group by radio, controlling them and anticipating the moves of the Britannian forces like it was a game of chess.\\n\r\nIt isnt entirely plausible how is still able to manage a double life and lead the Japanese to victory. But it does provide Lelouch moments to look more sympathetic and less unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah thats pretty much what you need to know. Lelouch battles Britannia with the help of the ever so gullible and disposable Japanese. Oh and I forgot to mention Suzaku,an Eleven who is his childhood friend, siding to Britannia. They both basically the want the same thing, only they have different methods. Lelouch wants to rid of Britannia to make the world easier for his sister to live in, Nunally. Suzaku, on the other hand, wants to climb the ladders of Britannia, and gradually change it to good from the inside. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a ton going on in these first five episodes, and the pacing is rapid-fire.  Add in a truly epic stage, some awesome battles, and just a dash of comedy to keep things from getting too dark, and it's really hard to see where this show can go wrong from here. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is majestic, in terms of entertaining. The plot twists are so twisted that it becomes endless and absurd. Every episode ends in marvelous cliffhangers that can make you get a garotte wire and strangle yourself for an entire week until the next episode comes out and makes you do the same thing all over again. It just keeps getting better and better.\\n\\n\r\nThe actions are also a treat. From assault to massive warfare, Code Geass is impressively detailed. The contest between Britannia and the Eleven are as breathtaking as they are thrilling, while the individual battles are supremely well choreographed.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass has so many things working in its favor that it becomes easy to overlook some of its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is completely convincing and fulfills the shows &quot;mecha plausibility&quot; quotient well besides than the roller blading war machines. Moreover, few if any prior shows have as effectively integrated the tacky yet refined movements of the robots as they do here. CLAMP did the designs here so be sure to expect it to be excellent(and have arms, which have uncanny ability to stretch an extra three feet)\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fluid. It always depicts the sound perfectly. Be it a gunshot or a whole building crumbling down, it is nicely executed. The background effects are also a plus. You get to hear a bunch of insects flying around or birds chirping.\\n\r\nIt gives a rather credible atmosphere partnered by a perfect atmospheric melody. The clarity of the sound effects definitely supports the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is no slouch either. It can easily persuade you of the emotion of each characters tries to convey, even supporting characters are given enough to time to emote.\\n\\n\r\nThe results are predictably impressive, even genre-defining. However as good as Code Geass is in terms of spectacle, the show does hit a few dud notes in terms of plot and characterization. But put together with visual flair, it&rsquo;s a winning combination that helps to ensure Code Geass is a roller coaster experience of thrilling intensity.\\n\\n\r\nJust like Da Vinci Code, it is &quot;preposterously entertaining&quot;.It is safe to say that anyone who's interested in action or mecha will go bananas over Code Geass.",

But once I sat down and watched code geass I was really impressed at how good it was.\r\nStory: The story of this anime is one of the best I've seen and it is highly enjoyable. At the end of every episode I had the urge to quickly watch the next because of how incredible this show was giving you all this conflict and plot twists at would just leaveyou shocked. I could feel the intensity of the situations at times and not many shows can do that. Another plus is that it was not 100% mecha and it has its elements of mystery in it because of the actual geass power. And the story is not yet over since they give you an ending that just breaks your heart knowing that you're gonna have to wait a couple months to figure out what happened. Cliffhangers are EVIL!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: CLAMP, not everyone likes their style of drawing but in my case I am a nut for CLAMP so I found this show's animation really good. The colours were so bright and pretty for an anime that IMO is rather dark and serious. All the robots looks great and have flashy and pretty designs to them, the Lancelot looks SO COOL XD\\n\\n\r\nSound: The only thing that I didnt find outstanding about the show was the music, some of the background songs I kinda disliked since it seemed like it wasnt really fit for the moment. But overall it was still good. I guess I should comment at how great Lelouch's seiyuu did a great job playing him.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Lelouch is probably one of the main reasons I like Geass, the conflicts he suffers and how he plays some of the other characters is just awesome. Suzaku on the other hand, I dont really like how he is trying to achieve his plans and should just die v_v but thats what makes geass good since it allows me to really get attached to the characters and grow to love or HATE them. Oh and C.C = win.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have really enjoyed watching Geass it has given me one of the best storytelling and even some really cool action as well. And with the new season coming my excitement has once again returned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Geass is one of the best mecha shows out there and if you are a mecha fan this show has a lot of other aspects that will definitely draw you in. This is one of the best shows out there and should not be missed by anyone. In my case, I'm just glad season 2 is coming out soon.",

            "content": "The other reviews available here cover a lot of details, so this will be a somewhat brief overview that will concentrate only on the main aspects, without spoilers.\r\nCode Geass is a good anime that I recommend to watch. However, it has its hits and misses.\r\nStory\r\nCompared to many other anime items I've watch, Code Geass's plot twists and unfolds with shocking pace compared to the usually expected sluggishness found in most 20+ episode series. The 25 episodes of the first season would have been enough to supply like 75 episodes One Piece style (no offense to OP: I like it no less than Code Geass).\r\nThis, however,placed its toll on the story's coherence. Near the end, it might even become somewhat confusing, as if the authors looked at all the possible outcome scenarios and picked the most shocking ones, without paying much attention to how well they would fit. I can't confidently say if its a good or a bad thing, I guess we'll only know for sure after season 2. So far, I'd easily give it a 10 for pace and courage in plot twisting, but after seeing it all I think I'll place some penalty to emphasize that the story could use some more work when it comes to adequacy.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI'll be honest: I don't like CLAMP's character design, not even one bit. I'd prefer any Satoshi Kon's or Katsuhiro Otomo's movie characters to it any day. I like the characters to look realistic, and here I see typical bishounen boys and comparably cute girls. No wait, boys are apparently more cute here. Much so. Cause all of them look like, you know, androgynes. And size differences between, say, Lelouch's frame and Emperor's frame are shocking.\\n\r\nI'm actually surprised how can these boys even move so fast with those frail limbs.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is very good, though, action scenes are fluid and detailed. Also, lots of blood, many deaths. Be aware.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMusic is fast and catchy, very fitting for a story like this. I didn't like it much, though, except for the second opening starting midway through the series. Rest of the sound work is fine, if you don't count somewhat annoying voices and public domain samples used in several scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nTough to say. On one hand, characters are active and vivid. On another, they can annoy you easily (easily!). Some characters could use more development, some abandoned their development whatsoever. Some you will wish didn't die, some you will definitely wish to have died.\\n\\n\r\nWhat definitely contributes to my own displease is that the characters are very easy to make a decision no matter how major and complicated the matter is, which makes their actions seem less natural and more &quot;eh, they totally saw that coming&quot; throughout. Moreover, while many of the main characters' motives are deep and somewhat disturbing, all their thoughts are immediately relevaled, leaving less to think through and analyze, which makes it easier to understand than something like Evangelion, but at the same time detracts from long term enjoyability. There is little point in solving riddles when you're given an answer before you even have a chance to realize that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it looks like the entire cast of main and supporting characters was composed of Mensa members. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOne undisputable factor such fast paced story usually contributes to is the thrill. That's right, Code Geass is thrilling, interesting and unpredictable, with numerous comedy elements, little fan service and fascinating action scenes. Just what I like in series like this. A well deserved 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nCode Geass is an enjoyable watch, clever and surprising. However, its story leaves something to be desired, in both possible senses.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, don't watch the Recaps together with the main episodes: they disrupt the pace without contributing any new content. Better use them instead of rewatching in case you want to refresh the memories of the events happened. Specials (the non-animated shorts) can be watched at any time, provided you won't watch them before the corresponding events in the main series.",

            "content": "Code Geass is definitely a very popular anime, no denying that, but I wouldn't exactly call it a master piece, but it is however, a fun and entertaining show, you just don't need to put too much thought into it.\r\nSTORY: Once upon a time, there was a famous animation company that decided to mash up as many genres as they can to make an anime that would try to appeal to as many anime fans as possible.\r\nThe end result was Code Geass, and it was a success, popularity wise.\r\nBut before I get on to the actual review I have to say honestly, I really likethis anime, but it can pretty much ruin the fun of the anime if you try to look at it objectively, but that being said, it's hard not to since this anime tries way too hard to appeal to too many genres that fans are into.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the story itself is quite interesting, an alternate reality where England, now named Brittania, has taken over the world and just really hates Japan to the point of ethnic cleansing (It's a little unsettling to say the least). But the main focus of the anime is about a royal family member castaway, Lelouch Lamperouge, trying to get revenge on his father, the leader/king of Brittania for the murder of his mother. So yeah, essentially the story is just another revenge story, nothing too original (How are revenge stories so damn popular I will never know).\\n\\n\r\nBut the anime starts to show its short comings, and really early on. The anime tries to make you assume that Lelouch is a genius solely upon him being good at chess, with no other reason, he's genius cause he's a beast at chess, that's it.\\n\r\nThere's no character build up to show he's a genius other than playing chess (But I would not know since I don't play chess, maybe it really does make you a genius, maybe I need to try it out before making this judgement).\\n\\n\r\nAnd besides being a genius, he receives a power which allows him to control people's minds, once per person, called Geass (Get it? Because the show is also called Code \"Geass\"), which by the way, is the best used character/plot device in the anime, and it's entertaining how Lelouch uses it in dangerous situations or when he's trying to outsmart his foes.\\n\r\nHowever, the way he obtains just seems that not enough thought was put into it, in other words, kinda lazy, he meets a girl in a strait jacket being chased by the military, and bam! Mind control powers.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also where you also should realize a major plot hole in the early episodes, with his mind controlling powers, he could get his revenge in a heart beat, but that's not fun to watch at all, but if he could simply kill off one of his family members easily in less than three episodes (Don'y worry, that character's death is just another way to advance the plot), what's keeping him from getting his father like that too?\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, Lelouch isn't really a likable character (His comes off being arrogant and is just a calculating and sadistic bastard), but the rest of the cast though, have a little more going on for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe benefactor of Lelouch's power, C.C. (Pronounced C2) may not be terribly interesting herself, but like myself, she's just there to watch the whole show play out and snack on pizza (Fun fact, this anime was endorsed/sponsored  by a pizza company). \\n\r\nIn fact I would've been fine if her character just died on the first episode (Spoiler: she gets shot in the head), it would've been more interesting to see Lelouch figure his powers all on his own anyway. But apparently, she must have been a favorite of the creators of the anime, enough so they keep her to mess a round with Lelouch and eat pizza, so at least she's amusing.\\n\\n\r\nChildhood friend and some what frienemy of Lelouch, Suzaku, is arguably a better protagonist than Lelouch and was developed into his character much better than Lelouch too, but his focus on what he wants to do isn't exactly clear (I want to save Japan/I want to be a knight for britiania, blah, blah, blah), and though his character development is better than what Lelouch's was, it can be arguably be called lazy, because most of it was through flashbacks to his past, though later episodes are more enjoyable due a girlfriend he gets.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the real stars of the anime are the genres that are ungracefully crammed together.\\n\\n\r\nIt tries to be school life anime, a harem, an action anime, ecchi anime, psychological anime (TRIES to, it isn't), romance anime, and a mecha anime all at the same time, but if you look down at the core of this anime and try to piece it together, you'll realize it's a gigantic mess.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially how this anime tries to integrate mecha (Get it? Because it's called Code Geas... wait, don't the majority of mecha anime have the name of a mecha in it's title? Gurren Lagann or any Gundam for example) into the story, they're just literally there to just be cool and to be used as weapons of war, nothing more, absolutely nothing more. Shallow is a better word to describe it than lazy.\\n\r\nThe anime would honestly be just as effective without the mechs (Apparently the creators are aware of this because two of the manga series have no mechas in them), in fact, it isn't a mecha anime.\\n\r\nA mecha anime is a mecha cause one of it's major focuses is on it's robots, Code Geass focuses on anything else but the mechas, they're there just to appeal to mecha fans, so really there's no point what so ever for the mechas to even exist in this anime, they're just cool to throw in because they're giant robots.\\n\\n\r\nBut, there is one thing this anime knows what it is, a loud cluster f**k of many gernres, and despite that it's not a great anime, it's fun to watch and at least pretend that it knows what it's trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: For me, this is best part of the whole anime, it looks great, the girls are hot, the boys are pretty, everyone wins, plenty of eye candy for all.\\n\r\nEspecially for fans of clamp, who were generous enough to do the character designs.\\n\r\nThe mechas look cool enough, but the stupidest parts on them are the wheels slapped on them, they look so ridiculous. But the action scenes more than compensate for them.\\n\r\nBut other than that, this a gorgeous looking show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Both the Japanese and English voices are great, but I only watched the english dubbed due to my own preferences.\\n\r\nJohnny Young Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Steven Blum, Kate Higgins, and so many more top notch notable voice actors are in this anime, but of all of them, Johnny is damn good as Lelouch and Yuri's Suzaku is a great compliment to Johnny's performance.\\n\r\nEach theme music is enjoyable and what you'll except for a mainstream anime, though the back ground music doesn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Very entertaining and fun to watch.\\n\r\n+ Good looking characters designed by Clamp, and great animation overall.\\n\r\n+ Good english dub, Johnny Bosch's Lelouch is arguably one of his best performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Can be faulted for trying too hard to appeal to multiple audiences by shallowly cramming genres together.\\n\r\n- There's honestly there's no point of the mechas other than to be used as weapons to fight.\\n\r\n- Weak character development, C.C. honestly feels thrown in.\\n\r\n- Lots of plot holes\\n\\n\r\nDespite what I have said in this review I would still recommend this to any one.\\n\r\nAnd I'm surprised I didn't reference Death Note once in this review... Wait a minute... Damn, so close.",

            "content": "(this review will cover elements from R2 and R1)\r\nThere will probably be a large amount of people who will look at the score I gave code geass and click the \"not helpful\" button without even bothering to read the first few lines of this review. If this is you, I don't believe you should bother reading this review in the first place, since your mind is obviously not going to be changed. And also, this review is all my own opinion, the large majority of you will probably enjoy code geass a lot, but if you want to hear a different opinion then go aheadand read the review. \\n\\n\r\nIntelligent anime. Its probably one of my favourite types of anime. It's so much nicer to get enthralled, shocked, and mindblown by an anime rather than to turn your brain off and enjoy a bunch of generic bullshit that basically copies every other mildly successful show in its genre. Unfortunately however, for every actually intelligent anime there is an equal number of, if not even more shows for which their intelligence is only superficial. While you may not (and probably won't) agree, I believe code geass is one of these shows. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first heard of code geass, it was described to me as \"death note with mechs\". Although the manga was a lot better, I actually enjoyed death note, and I dove into code geass hoping for another helping of interesting characters, and a relatively well paced and clever plot. For me, code geass was just a huge load of cliches, underdeveloped characters, and extremely convenient coincidences all wrapped up together to make a quite lackluster anime. Although I'm not going to go over every single little thing, since that would take forever and I'm too lazy, code geass had almost as may plot holes as mirai nikki (although that also has a mean score over 8, so that shows you something)\\n\\n\r\nIt's very surprising how people try to compare lelouch and Light, or the strategic planning that both shows supposedly have. While they were often unrealistic and sometimes made no sense, the plans in death note obviously had a lot of though put into them, and the dialogue passing between Light and L was interesting enough to keep you engrossed in the story. However, all that the so called \"strategy\" in code geass equates to is \"My mech is bigger and more badass than yours.\" the large majority of battles the black knights face in this anime are won by lelouch procuring a new bigger and more powerful weapon that they use to eliminate the opposition. And when he actually does any real planning it's consisted of lelouch conveniently guessing the opponents next moves as if he's some kind of psychic. As the show goes on he seems to putt less and less logic into his plans. Especially the way they escaped the britannian empire by all dressing up as zero. That was less like a carefully derived strategy and more like something and more like a retarded idea lelouch came up with after he'd had one too many beers. If the britannians honestly couldn't come up with a way to thwart that, then it's no surprise they got outsmarted.\\n\\n\r\nAnother annoying Element of code geass is the characters. Unless its a show with an above average amount of episodes, or one that is not character driven, good shows often take the route of keeping the cast of characters smaller, and developing those characters further. However, code geass prefers to go to down the path of piling on so many new and completely useless characters that don't garner the slightest bit of interest from the viewer or develop the plot in any reasonable way that you forget the name of anyone who's not a main character. The white knights did fuck all, in fact you only knew the names of a few of them, and this was true for a large amount of the cast. a result of this many of the characters got so little development and focus that I couldn't care less what happened to them at all. Even lelouch who is the main character gets stuck with a cliched \"mah parent(s) were killed omg so sad and compelling\" backstory, and thats it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, all of the characters look like lanky anorexic beat sprouts who need to go and eat some big macs, but apart from that it was nothing special, and typical for an anime of its time. The sound quality was actually quite good during the actual episodes, however the openings and endings were just boring J-pop that I skipped every time I watched an episode.\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to mention is the fanservice, and this was definitely a lot more prominent in R2. Kallen in her knightmare shot from very suspicious camera angles, Kallen in the shower, and Kallen and CC doing a variety of other things to please the otakus and their penises. It's disheartening that even a so called intelligent anime like code geass ended up throwing in enough fanservice to make an ecchi harem anime jealous. It may have had plot, but it was hard to notice it with kallen's ass getting shoved in your face for half of every episode.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the series does not drop below a four, it must have its good points. Despite him being a lot less intelligent than people make him out to be, lelouch was at some points relatively interesting to watch, unlike all the other characters. And although I found the majority of all the episodes boring, the final few episodes of each season piqued my interest a bit (Dat spinzaku), and I didn't mind watching them, although R2s ending is a bit overrated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I though that although it had its moments, code geass was overall overrated and slightly below average. although some people reading this will understand what I'm going on about, the majority of people who have seen code geass enjoyed it a lot, and the chances are that you will too. However, I personally would not recommend code geass, and I think there are much better anime you could spend your time watching. For alternate recommendations, if you haven't already seen death note (which is unlikely) go and watch it, or for another mech anime try neon genesis evangelion.\\n",

            "content": "The most succinct way to describe Code Geass is to call it a cross between Death Note and MEGAS XLR/Gurren Lagann with a generous helping of your average ecchi harem SOL romantic comedy and a dash of Evangelion thrown into the mix. Does it work? Not exactly. Code Geass is one of those shows that brings a lot of good stuff to the table but fucks it up in so many ways once the script comes into question. There are more plot holes here than there are potholes on the Grand Central Parkway, and whether or not that's hyperbole is entirely up for you todecide. Despite all of this, I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I actually DO happen to like and enjoy both seasons of Code Geass to the point where I would actually go out of my way to have both seasons on DVD or Blu-ray (provided that Funimation actually gives it a release any time soon >_>). With that said, my enjoyment can only go so far.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just start off with what REALLY gets my goat with this show because there's a lot of that stuff that just doesn't sit right with me one way or another. First up, there's the character designs. Believe it or not, the character designs were the very reason why I never bothered watching Code Geass when it was on [adult swim] way back in 2008/2009. Whilst I do happen to like CLAMP's mangas (i.e. X/1999, Chobits), it's their artwork that just doesn't sit right with me. Why am I mentioning this? Well... CLAMP was contracted to do the original character designs for Code Geass and nothing more. I don't know about you, but I'm not too fond of lanky pretty boys with long arms and big eyes, girls with small waists and melons that realistically should make them collapse under their weight, etc. I'm more of a fan of Naoki Urasawa or Inio Asano's artwork than I am CLAMP's from a character design standpoint. Thankfully, not every character on the show is drawn like such (i.e. Charles zi Britannia), but our boys Lelouch and Suzaku are and we see more of them than we see Charles so... yeah. Why can't we have humans that look like regular humans? I don't fucking know, but it is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to another problem I have: fan service. As much as I love my lascivious animated women, the fan service in Code Geass got to a point where I was wondering if I was watching Rosario Vampire again. Any time that there was a serious moment going on where shit was about to go down, in pops Shirley changing into her swimsuit or a shot of Kallen's ass, or Kallen entering a conference room in a bath towel because she wanted to yell at Lelouch, or some other bullshit like that. Yeah... I'm not a huge fan of the girls in this show barring C.C., Cornelia, Euphemia, and a couple of others if only because of the fact that virtually every girl in this show is no better than a fan service character. Would you believe me if I told you the fan service got to a point where there was an out-of-place masturbation scene? Well, there is. When did this show turn into End of Evangelion? I don't know, but that's another story.\\n\\n\r\nGoing off on a tangent, another problem that Code Geass has is the fact that it just loves to jump between all that plot-heavy rebellion stuff with light-hearted slice-of-life school stuff and let's just say that in between the fan service and this crap, I had a hard time deciding which was a bigger buzzkill. As stupid as the actual plot of the show got at some points, it certainly managed to keep me engrossed until the episode ends, I load up the next episode, and I see Suzaku and Lelouch chasing a cat for 20 minutes. I'm not even joking, that was actually the plot for an entire episode. You know, it's moments like these that make me see why the uber elitists here on MAL tout Legend of the Galactic Heroes as a superior alternative to Code Geass. At least that show managed to maintain a consistent tone throughout the entire narrative. Of course, there are a lot of reasons why LOGH isn't high on my priority list, but let's not get into that.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of writing, Code Geass has some of the most glaring plot holes that I've ever come across. It took me a while to actually pick up on them since I was too caught up in my own enjoyment to actually bother analysing the show crtically but when you actually use your critical faculties whilst watching this show, you start seeing more and more stuff to use as snark bait. For example, Lelouch's \"Geass\" power is so unbelievably broken (broken as in \"overpowered,\" mind you). He can only issue a command once to any individual, but that command is absolute. Basically, Lelouch has the ability to turn anyone into his slave if he so chooses. Sure, there are some arbitrary rules thrown into the mix as a half-hearted attempt to balance out his powers but really... you have to wonder why Lelouch didn't just order a whole bunch of people to be his slaves until he did something else.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of Geass, the way it's handled is just so bizarre. Geass is supposed to be absolute, but shit like sheer willpower and even a kiss from a sexy green-haired chick can override its influence on you depending on what the episode demands (that last one is not a joke; that's how the R2 actually gets going). At one point in R2, there's a \"Geass Canceller\" introduced but it's only given to a character who seems to suffer from a severe case of multiple personality disorder and he only bothers using it whenever he wants to. Now, Geass users are prone to having their powers go rogue and this actually does happen to Lelouch at some point. However, this plot point was quickly dealt with and we never hear from it again. Even if you factor in all the other Geass users, the entire conflict surrounding Code Geass feels meaningless at some points. The entire show could've been condensed to 12-15 episodes had Lelouch actually made better use of his powers and there was less bullshit along the way. Alack, that's another story of what could've been.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Lelouch, the characters here in Code Geass are so variable in terms of quality. Motivations change at the drop of a hat, characters that were once likeable become complete assholes, and even at that point, the writing behind the bulk of these characters just isn't good most of the time. Let's just say this: Lelouch may very well be a genius, but the anime certainly doesn't do a good job of showing any sort of actual intelligence on his part. In fact, Lelouch may very well be the predecessor of Kirito when it comes down to how perfect he apparently is (right down to the harem of girls waiting to drop their panties and bend over; thankfully, Lelouch has no time for these hoes).\\n\\n\r\nThe only indicator we actually have for him being a genius is the fact that he's a chess master and that he somehow has the gift of clairvoyance. Any time some major shit's about to go down, he's able to predict certain events with such a remarkable degree of accuracy to the point where you gotta wonder if Charles and Marianne had Lelouch while a voodoo witch doctor was delivering him. Now, despite his genius status and how he's able to weasel himself out of almost any situation, the guys at Sunrise decided to not make him 100% perfect. He gets cocky and because of this, he makes some REALLY stupid decisions over the course of the show. He ALWAYS ends up letting his emotions get the better of him in battle whenever shit doesn't pan out the way he wants to, he kills off potential allies whilst sparing enemies, and he gets caught up in completely unnecessary battles because of his apparent lack of foresight. Seriously, this guy doesn't seem to understand what back-up plans are and the only reason why he ever makes it out in the first place is because of some \"ingenuity\" on the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nNow with Lelouch's failings out of the way, let's talk about Suzaku. A lot of people hate him, but I don't. In fact, I'm rather fond of him at some points if only because of his relationship with Lelouch. What I don't particularly like is the fact that Suzaku is apparently trying to change the system from the inside but he ends up becoming a rank-and-file soldier who effectively slaughters his own people despite the fact that he wants to save them. Question: if he really wants to change the system from the inside, why doesn't he become a politician? Okay, maybe there's some kind of Britannian law that prevents Japanese people from getting into politics but the fact still remains that he's so stupid to the point where he fails to realise that he's NOT helping his own people by becoming a person who's contractually obligated to slaughter the Japanese for whatever reason. People rag on him for his idealistic views, but there are a lot of great characters who have idealistic views on whatever (i.e. Kenzo Tenma from Monster) so that alone isn't enough to make him a bad character. If you really want to give him shit, bitch about how he's incapable of realising that he's NOT helping his own cause whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't exactly much to speak of either... at least, in a positive manner. For one thing, there's Nina Einstein... and let's just say that I can't wait to read a fan fiction where she dies a mercilessly brutal death. She has to be one of the most irritating and infuriating characters out there, and she's the one who's responsible for that out-of-place masturbation scene. We have Kallen, whose potential is overshadowed by the size of those melons and that ass of hers. We have C.C. who's quite a hilarious snarker but she's not really good for anything except plot conveniences, fan service, and Pizza Hut product placement. We have Nunnally, an irritating paraplegic who has no use outside of being a damsel-in-distress with a brother complex. There's also a pot-pourri of other characters but I'm not about to waste more of our time talking about them.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the shit I've said about Code Geass in general, the first season on its own was quite entertaining (provided that you don't think too much and just let your inner filthy casual run wild), and it did manage to do some stuff right. For starters, the dynamic between Lelouch, Suzaku, et al was quite lovely and if anything, it's that very relationship that made the ending to the first season that much more intense. The second season on the other hand takes everything I didn't like about the first season and then dials that shit up to 11. We have MORE unlikeable characters (lookin at you, Rolo!), MORE inconsistent characterisation, and MORE disjointed storytelling with all the plot holes you've come to know and love. Oh, and let's not forget the fan service! You know how much I love seeing Kallen's knockers or that sweet ass of hers.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the second season is a HUGE drop in quality compared to the first one. Now despite all of that shit I said before, what I really hated about the second season was just how slow it actually was. Say what you will about the first season, but at least it felt like shit was actually progressing from point A to point B. I'm not even joking when I say that I came close to dropping the second season twice because I was so bloody bored out of my mind. Was there stuff happening? Well, yeah but nothing of consequence actually occurs until the final ~6-7 episodes of the season. As strange as it sounds, the second season actually did get off to something of a decent start and it was obvious as to where it wanted to go with the story but it just took so fucking long for ANYTHING of substance to happen. What happened in the meantime you ask? Mecha battles for the sake of having mecha battles, plot twists that would only make sense to someone who's hogging the blunt for too long, and character interactions that just make you wonder if this really was the same show as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAmazingly enough though, people seem to give this season a pass purely because of that ending. I'm not gonna lie, Code Geass has one of the most intense and ultimately satisfying conclusions of anything I've ever watched. However, that alone isn't enough to excuse all of the bullshit that went on in this season. Yeah, the second season doesn't have as much slice-of-life bullshit as the first season but R2 made up for that deficiency with all of this bad writing. For starters, characterisation is worse here, and I don't even think Sunrise was trying to hide it anymore. For example, we have Lelouch who HATES Rolo because he's not Nunnally and he intends to use Rolo and then kill him once he's outlived his usefulness. However, Rolo ends up kicking the bucket at some point and then apparently, Lelouch loved him like a brother all along even though there was no such interaction that went down between the two which would imply anything of the sort. Suzaku on the other hand ends up doing a complete 180 on his original characterisation. Remember that idealistic idiot who didn't realise he was killing his own people by being a rank-and-file soldier instead of becoming an idealistic politician trying to change the system from within? Well he was all like \"fuck that shit\" and only cares about the end result rather than the means used to achieve them. On the one hand, at least he acknowledges that he was being an idiot but on the other hand, that gets rid of the one trait of his I actually liked.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the plot twists, they just really got stupid after a while. I mean, the first season was flawed to high heaven but the plot twists still managed to get me on the edge of my seat until the mood was killed by Bulma, wait I mean Kallen. For example, we find out that Marianne (Lelouch's mother) didn't really die but she was alive all along. Right before she was about to die, she somehow developed a Geass that allowed her to transfer her soul into another body. I'm not making a single word of that up. Can you smell the contrivance anywhere in this whatsoever? Let's not forget how Charles apparently sent Lelouch and Nunnally so that they'd be safe or some bullshit like that (even fans of Code Geass can see the plot holes in this one) or how despite being a racist and cold-hearted jackass for 90% of the show's run, Charles was actually a good guy the entire time. Yeah, I don't buy a single lick of any of this. Oh, and that's not even getting into how Lelouch could apparently control GOD of all things with the sheer power of his own Geass.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, this show is amazing, right? It's so brilliantly written, so gripping and enthralling and it's a master of manipulating your emotions whilst keeping you on the edge of your seat for more! The characters are the best of their kind, and I wait for the day when common literature could even hope to push out characters as brilliant as Lelouch, Suzaku, and Rolo. Oh God, I couldn't type any of of that with a straight face. From a critical standpoint, Code Geass is BAD. There's no two ways around it, it's a bad series in general. This show really knows how to keep it real, real stupid that is. You know what though? All of this stuff combined isn't enough to dampen my enjoyment whatsoever. I mean, for all that Code Geass got wrong, it must've done *something* right along the way. How else could it have gotten so popular in the first place? A lot of the reasons why I enjoy this show are superficial in the first place. The mecha battles were enthralling (by my standards, anyway), Lelouch's hammy behaviour kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the dubbing across both the English and Japanese tracks was absolutely spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake: if you try to take this show seriously, you *will* hate it. The biggest reason why so many people adore Code Geass in the first place is because of the so-called \"rule of cool.\" Code Geass is one of those shows that just oozes awesomeness (well, by my standards anyway) and at some points, it had me cheering on all of the senseless stupidity just like I do whenever I'm watching Gurren Lagann (yeah, it really does get THAT dumb at some points). Code Geass is the functional equivalent of a Michael Bay movie in anime, except it actually gets some more stuff right that Michael Bay would otherwise get wrong. For one thing, it's actually entertaining to watch for a good ~65% of its run as opposed to the gut-wrenchingly appalling pacing that usually makes his movies painful to watch after the first hour (I'm looking at you, Age of Extinction!). Hell, even if you don't find this show cool in the slightest, you'd definitely have a fun time snarking at how stupid it gets. It would be hard NOT to find a reason to enjoy this programme to some marginal degree.\\n\\n\r\nNow where does this leave Code Geass? Well, I'm painfully aware of its shortcomings but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it. For what it's worth, Code Geass isn't a show that's average in the slightest. If it can evoke all kinds of of reactions out of people, it would only make sense for anyone to give this show a shot and see what they'd get out of it. Besides, it's good popcorn material if you're in the mood for something stupid that you can watch with friends while eating pizza. I mean, the uber elitists and hipsters here on MAL would beg to differ but this show ISN'T the worst thing to come out of humanity. That, my friends would be Kodomo no Jikan but that's another review for a different day. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

Did I mention it is over-hyped? Even for fanboys of this anime it must be over-hyped. With a fairly good story it tries to become a mecha version of Death Note and I suppose it succeeds to some extent, but not in a very intriguing manner really. The story has many twists and turns and it is quiteentertaining at times, but the story can't save this anime from its characters.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character of this anime is bad, not even Lelouch is any good most of the time. Mostly because he's so overplayed. However Lelouch is nothing compared to Kurkrurururugi Suzaku. I was on the verge of dropping this anime at each and ever episode, even while watching the very last episode, because of Kurukgukgururui Suzaku, he was not fabulous to say the least. Apart from these two characters the rest of them were no catches either, I don't really feel like going through a list of bad characters so I'm just going to generalize and say they were the usual generic stereotypical blobs on screen fresh from the \"generic steretypical anime character factory\" that they copy and paste into their storyboard.\\n\\n\r\nDid you notice the CLAMP influences? Of course you did, I don't have anything against CLAMP, they've done XXXholic, but really? CLAMP in a shounen? No.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this animes screenplay is an abomination, which leaves character interaction between the incredibly boring characters wanting in such a terrible manner that it drags this entire anime down.",

            "content": "Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is a yaoi mecha animu noted for its clever and original plot. It became the cancer of /a/ for the whole summer of 2008. The show was created when Pizza Hut, thinking they could get a bigger piece of the Japanese global market, began writing and producing what would eventually become a new anime that would include innovative and brand-new elements never seen before in the genre: giant robots, large-scale military invasions, heaps upon heaps of still-attractive bishie corpses and more tits than a Playboy shoot. These were all included in an effort to attract a wider audience. Theshow was largely subsidized by Japan, so the show also features a staggering amount of the bullshit post-war propaganda that Japan has so desperately tried to feed the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place in an alternative-history world where Japan has gotten pwned by the Holy Empire of Britannia thanks to the latter's giant rollerskate-wearing robots, which are clearly more effective than tanks and other conventional weapons\u2014an absurdity, as we see later on that rocket-launchers can fuck them up. Despite having killer-cool mecha (and lots of female military officers with e-size tits), Britannia is still just a bunch of British Francophone Nazis, who want to take over the world and do what Hitler would have done had he not put bullets in his head. And because the Japanese love them some historical revisionism almost as much as increasingly bizarre sex practices, they have taken great pains to ensure that no one notices that Britannia is doing everything the Japanese did to the Chinese during World War II. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch Lamperouge is the repulsively unlikable main character\u2014a pretentious bitch who lives his life in the lap of luxury, surrounded by beautiful women whom he has absolutely no attraction to. This self-indulgent lifestyle apparently is not enough for the spoiled aristocratic cunt, so for the sake of the plot (and nothing else) he one day wakes up with a terrible case of butthurt over the way the Japanese people are being treated. He enthusiastically joins up with the local Japanese revolutionaries, but because he didn't have an invitation he had to convince them that he was worthy. Reluctant to admit his sexual preferences, Lulu (his nickname\u2014as if you didn't think he was gay already) was suddenly accosted by a green-haired bitch everybody thought to be dead\u2014in doing so, he promptly receives unique paranormal superpowers called \"Geass\" (m0re liek \"Gayass\", amirite?). \\n\\n\r\nThings get needlessly complicated when it turns he's the son of the Emperor of Britannia himself, but because Lelouch is so noble and true to his word, he sallies forth to perform heroic acts for great justice against his father's evil political state. He does so with the pretentious insistence that he, a strategic genius, can never be defeated, despite getting his ass handed to him about every other episode. \\n\\n\r\nHis fianc\u00e9 is Suzaku Kururugi, a green-eyed, brown-haired Azn (because clearly Azns always have green eyes and brown hair) who has decided to join the Britannians because he firmly believes in his childhood ideals. Although the two are engaged to be married, they only fight when they're inside their Mechs because they don't know they're actually not enemies... kinda like another anime you may have seen. Lelouch declares himself the defender of justice, calling himself \"Zero,\" a name and number which the Japanese seem to have a weird fetish for. After creating the Black Knights as a kind of pathetic vigilante group, he starts to fight back against his own nation. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the course of the show (and again, for no particular reason), Lulu finds his awesomely hot sister Euphemia, who professes a pressing need for white and fluffy storyline development. Lulu objects, but after being offered to get into her sister's panties (no, srsly, there's that one episode where he says his sis was his first love) he readily reconsiders. The two of them gather a whole lot of people in a closed stadium surrounded by armed military men\u2014always an auspicious start for creating a \"white and fluffy world.\" While there, Euphemia asks Lulu to go to a dark backroom, where he accidentally her, causing the bitch to spontaneously go where Harry Truman pussed out and give some Japs the smackdown they so richly deserve. She grabs herself a gun and starts to party down like a pro. \\n\\n\r\nLulu, in order to hide the fact that he made such a colossal error, kills her, causing yet another needless character death (there are several in this anime and it's not even done by Gainax). Use the JewTube link to catch all the filthy action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JQ4sWzXPiA\\n\\n\r\nHe then proceeds to go on an epic rampage against the Britannians and doesn't afraid of anything. He raises a huge fucking army, and almost takes over Japan, before his army of inept morons goes down in spectacular failure and start to lose the second Lelouch leaves to go save his useless, whiny, blind, cripple loli sis. Lelouch's army apparently forgot there's a reason why Britannia controls 2/3rds of the world. \\n\\n\r\nWhen he arrives to the place he thought he'd find his worthless cunt of a sister, a challenger appears to start the decisive battle...and the WHOLE MOTHER FUCKING SEASON ENDS RIGHT THEN AND THERE. \\n",

            "content": "I was incredibly skeptical about Code Geass at first, but I'm very pleased to say that I was greatly surprised.\r\nSTORY - Before I saw this series, it was described to me on multiple occasions as \"Death Note with mechas.\" After seeing it, however, I am inclined to disagree. The similarities between the two series are superficial at best, and though I can see why people would draw the comparison, I don't really think that dis/liking one means that you'll dis/like the other. But anyway, unlike Death Note, I wouldn't say that the story in Code Geass is particularly notable or unique. It's actually rather straightforwardand even a little cliche, but that's exactly why this is such a well done series -- the barebones storyline is handled in a refreshing and new way that grabs the viewer's attention. There are enough twists and turns involved to keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is excellent and nothing feels rushed or drawn out. Indeed, the progression up to the conclusion is especially brilliant. (It's a cliffhanger &quot;ending,&quot; but oh, it's just a fantastic cliffhanger.)\\n\\n\r\nThe series is also appealing in its uncanny ability to mix genres. Yes, this is a mecha series, but it really doesn't have to be. Yes, CLAMP did the character designs and there are some very shoujo elements (read: homolust), but there are very shounen rivalries and some pretty epic battle scenes too. Everybody wins! Additionally, because of the number of characters, the story allows for a number of small subplots. I was very happy with how this was handled in particular because all of the subplots relate and affect the main plot directly, whether by revealing some bit of information to both the characters and the viewer or by pushing forward interesting character development. Everything is well thought out and wonderfully executed, so despite the fact that &quot;strong-willed person with plans to change the world receives mysterious power that helps facilitate his goals&quot; isn't a very unique storyline... Code Geass makes it work.\\n\\n\r\nAlso. Code Geass utilizes the &quot;best friends trying to kill each other&quot; plotline, and I'm a sucker for that plotline.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The characters in this series are rather varied. Some are very plain and one-dimensional, while others have an amazing complexity to them that makes them very life-like. I'll be honest. I've become somewhat infatuated with Lelouch as a character (and am rather biased as a result). To me, he is very much a human character -- he has emotions, opinions, a unique point of view, and some very serious flaws, all of which make him incredibly easy to relate to and to sympathize with. He is easily the most complex character in the series, and he feels real to me, even with his supernatural powers and his genius-level intellect. This ability to make the audience relate to him is also probably the series' greatest strength and the main reason why the story is able to remain relevant and interesting despite the fact that there aren't too many new ideas plotwise.\\n\\n\r\nSuzaku would probably be second in line for complexity after Lelouch, though his sense of justice might be called cliche at first (along with Nunnally's and Euphemia's), and his hax-level physical prowess is somehow harder to accept than Lelouch's genius-level intelligence. It's harder to appreciate Suzaku's depth at first, partially because he is presented as Lelouch's main obstacle and the audience's sympathies are with Lelouch, but a great deal is revealed about his character throughout the course of the series, and he becomes an amazing foil to his rival. Their conflicting ideologies and philosophies are fascinating if you really look into it, and gay as it sounds, they really do compliment each other very well.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the rest of the cast seems to fall into typical archetypes -- there's your adorable little sister, your mad scientist and his assistant, your cheerful schoolgirls, your best friend, your most loyal soldier, your second-in-command, your village idiot, your... really creepy lesbian girl? Despite the generic-sounding descriptions, most of the characters are actually pretty fun, or at the very least, interesting. C.C. provides snarky commentary. Shirley spreads innocent schoolgirl love. Nunnally is so moe you'll die. Jeremiah is a good butt of all jokes. Little bits of backstory are tossed in here and there to separate them from the crowd, but it's never enough to actually intrude, and the wide range of characters lets you settle into the world pretty well too; after all, what universe is complete without an animal mascot that shows up now and again?\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - I wasn't too impressed with CLAMP's character designs at first (noodleboys!), but as always seems to be the case, they gradually grew on me, and I remembered just how pretty X was. CLAMP just knows how to make everyone look amazingly sexy, male or female. I really loved how they did all of the facial expressions in the series though, especially for Lelouch. Seriously, that guy had some of the most awesome crazy expressions, some of the most amazingly touching sadface expressions, and of course, some of the most amusing WTF expressions. The mecha designs for the Knightmare Frames were also pretty awesome. I dig the whole rollar blade thing, and some of the technologies they come up with are neat, if a little over-the-top. The animation is fluid and smooth for the most part and very few things stood out as being bad.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Initially, I wasn't particularly fond of any of the OP/EDs for Code Geass except the first ending by ALI PROJECT because 1) they're awesome, and 2) Yuki Kajiura's style seemed to suit the series very well. The screaming violins both convey the high status of Britannia and the intensity of the emotions in the series. The rest of the themes seemed lackluster in comparison, but though I was never a huge fan of FLOW, &quot;COLORS&quot; kind of grew on me after a while. The final insert song, &quot;Innocent Days&quot; by Hitomi is pretty nice as well. Very thoughtful, very poignant, very fitting. The background music during the series was negligible for the most part; there is some pretty generic battle build-up type music and other appropriate, but rather typical, themes. Still, there's some neat classical/opera stuff, and the &quot;All hail Brittania!&quot; theme is definitely awesome.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - I've seen all of Code Geass subbed and most of it dubbed. Although I was incredibly turned off by Johnny Yong Bosch's role as Lelouch initially, it kind of grew on me, and now I think it fits well enough, though I do wish he'd change his voice a little more when Lelouch is Zero (make it a little deeper?). Suzaku's dub voice surprised me with how appropriate it was too. One of the things I really wish we could replicate in English though, is the subtle differences in manners between characters, between Lelouch and Suzaku at various stages of their lives, and between Lelouch and Zero. In Japanese, when Lelouch and Suzaku are children, they refer to themselves with &quot;boku&quot; and &quot;ore&quot; respectively. As teenagers, the pronouns are swapped, with Lelouch using &quot;ore&quot; (Zero uses &quot;watashi&quot;) and Suzaku using &quot;boku.&quot; Euphemia uses &quot;watakushi.&quot; I'll skip the grammar lesson (go wiki &quot;Japanese pronouns&quot;), but suffice to say that these differences provide a lot of very interesting insight into each of the characters. It's really too bad English isn't nearly as interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the voices in the dub are pretty average, perhaps the low end of average, with a stereotypically high-pitched girly voice for Nunnally that is amazingly annoying, and very forgettable voices for virtually all the female characters (Milly, Shirley, and Kallen all kind of sound the same). I was very impressed with Lloyd's dub voice though, even if nothing will ever amount to his amazing original voice, which is uh, amazing! Seriously. One of the most amusing voices I've ever heard. Jun Fukuyama's voice for Lelouch I found to be a bit too deep/old sounding initially, but that grew on me as well, and I really love the badassity of his voice for Zero. Suzaku's original voice sounds a little generic at first, but it grows with his character. There's a good bit of Engrish in the Japanese version as well, which is always fun. I don't think you can ever get tired of their &quot;Yes, my lord(o)!&quot; or their &quot;All hail Britannia!&quot;\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say the original is damn awesome, and the dub is pretty watchable -- always a plus, right?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I really love this series, and I definitely did not see that happening. Honestly, I found the first episode incredibly underwhelming: the opening sequence made it look like a series I wouldn't be interested in watching at all, and all of the expository really turned me off...but the second episode? That was so much more epic than I could have ever predicted, and I was pretty much won over after that. I'm just a sucker for chess analogies, I guess! Seriously though, good story, good characters, good animation, and good music! Mechas, politics, rivalry and comradery, strained friendships, love and hate, complex ideologies, and blowing shit up! What more could you want? :D\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass is one of my favorite anime. Why? It's filled with so much action, bombastic dialogue, and has such eye-catching visuals that it tops the charts in entertainment value. This is an exciting and epic anime and it's over the top. \r\nFor some people, the plot, characters, and music alone is bad enough to make the show unwatchable. For others, the high action, flashy animation, and drama will be more than enough to make the show a favorite of all time though I like everything about Code Geass. \r\nStory: Lelouch Lamperouge appears to be a typical high school student at Ashford Academy in theBritannian controlled Area 11 (formerly named Japan.) But he's actually a prince in the Britannian imperial family, and seventeenth in line to the throne. He develops a hatred for the emperor of Britannia and the entire imperial establishment, vowing to one day destroy them for the death of his mother and cripple of his sister. After an encounter with a mysterious young woman named C.C., Lelouch gains the power of Geass, which grants him the ability to force anyone to do what he wishes. With this ability, Lelouch becomes a mysterious figure named Zero and begins his battle against the Britannian Empire. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass have too many loose and cliff hanging ends. The end are always left unexplained, leaving the viewer with questions not only about various subplots but also about several key elements of the storyline. However, what makes up for this is the plot and character developments. Every episode is surprising and leave you eager to watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems Code Geass mainly focus on the drama, emotion, and the heart-breaking moments. Geass ends up being not so much a story with a certain plot and characters but rather a series of exciting, exaggerated but well-crafted, incredulous and definitely memorable scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters, are so great and awesome that it's hard to stop enjoying them. There are characters that are a goody too shoe, outright intolerable that will make you want to strangle and kill them off the show. The characters are all so great that something unexpected might happen to them. There are also characters that are naive, filled with too much hate and/or love but in the end, you'll have a character you like or maybe even love. My favorite character, of course, are C.C., Kallen, and Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Another good thing about Code Geass is its high production values and colorful animation. The character designs, created by CLAMP, are great and well drawn. The animation may not be great but it is detailed, vivid, and lively. The fights aren't as smooth or fluid as it could be but it's flashy, colorful, which is very much fitting considering the nature of the series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting also plays a role in the show's success. Characters like Zero and Suzaku may be outrageous or cliched but their voice actors fit the characters so well that they are able to sell the characters. One of my favorite voice actor, Jun Fukuyama, does a great job playing the key character of Lelouch/Zero. His performance, especially how well he change from the carefree high school student to the more sinister and manipulative rebel is vital to keeping the series enjoyable and entertaining. Fukuyama is usually playing two characters and does it absolutely convincingly. There's nothing to complain about of the music either as the background music is very good and it fits right in it. The openings for Code Geass are my favorite. It's very paced and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've seen Geass more than 5 times in a row already. (Not counting season 2)  This is a nice, great anime. With the non-stop action, you'll be wanting to see which side will win and lose. For one moment you can be smiling, then crying the next. Happens to me sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Code Geass is a awesome  anime that will surely gather different opinions from viewers and other reviewers other than myself. I've seen and heard a lot of people saying SUNRISE has done an awesome job and it's not because of the use of mecha, action or drama, but rather how effectively it appeals to that certain aspect of anime that is not often addressed and yet is one of the main purposes of anime: entertainment. If your main interest in anime is in the quality of the storytelling or the characters, then Geass is probably not for you. However, if you're in it to have fun or for some good laughs, then take a look at this anime. You wont be disappointed. Indeed Geass is a rare accomplishment.",

            "content": "Alright, its taken me since April to reach this point so I may as well dispense with any further delays and say it outright.  Code Geass:  Lelouch of the Rebellion is not a masterpiece, it isn\u2019t a great show nor is it a very good one.  What it is is a marginally good television program that takes concepts and characters from a wide variety of successful anime productions from the last decade and stitches them all together into twenty-five episodes of vulgarity and excess, a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a production that has the cold manufactured feel of a product of a focusgroup rather than of a motivated team of creative individuals.\\n\\n\r\nLet me take a step back for a moment, because the truth of the matter is that Code Geass brought with it a genuinely compelling concept, one that could have done wonders if the creators at Sunrise had known what the hell they were doing.  It takes place in an alternate universe where a version of the British Empire called Britannia, through various quirks of fate, manages to endure and thrive into the 21st century.  After witnessing the assasination of his mother and having his and his sister\u2019s lives ruined by his father, an exiled Britannian prince living under the assumed name Lelouch Lamperouge, out of a desire for revenge against the emperor, rises to become a revolutionary leader in an occupied Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThis concept could have gone in any number of directions and in the right hands could have been turned into something truly remarkable.  Unfortunately Goro Tanaguchi and his team at Sunrise either didn\u2019t realize the potential of what they\u2019d come up with or were simply too caught up in making a commercially successful product to care.  For, you see, although the basic premise survived to see the light of day it has been chained to and obscured by a wide variety of disparate concepts and ideas, none of which add anything of substance to the proceedings.  This is a program that wants to be a mecha action series at the same time it wants to be a war drama at the same time it wants to be a romance/harem series at the same time it wants to be a high school comedy while above all else its trying to be Death Note with a copy of V for Vendetta in its pocket.  It all gives the impression of a program that\u2019s so terribly frightened of being disliked by any one subset of the anime fandom that it rushes to appeal to every conceivable kind of viewer and as a result is never truly exceptional at any of the things it attempts.\\n\\n\r\nGiant robots, for example, are thrown in for no better reason than to draw in and satisfy the needs of the giant robot fandom.  I don\u2019t have anything against mecha per se but neither do I have any great love for it leaving me rather indifferent to it overall.  All I ask is that it adds something to the experience, that there is some concrete purpose for their presence motivated by the narrative, that the giant robots aren\u2019t merely props easily interchangeable with any other fantastical weaponry.  Full Metal Panic provides, in its continuity, a fairly detailed justification for how its variation on the giant robot concept came into being.  Patlabor provides a similarly believable rationale as well.  Ride Back would have had a wonderful thematic connection to its motorcycle/robot hybrids had the creators had the sense to utilize a specific scene outside of the end credits.  Code Geass has no such virtue.  The \u201cKnightmare frames\u201d come across as a ploy just as empty and cynical as Gonzo\u2019s additions of giant robots to their adaptations of Kurosawa\u2019s Seven Samurai and Dumas\u2019s The Count of Monte Cristo.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself runs into trouble fairly quickly.  In the first episode, Lelouch is inspired to begin his campaign against Britannia when he obtains a supernatural ability called Geass from a mysterious girl wearing a tight-fitting straitjacket.  This ability allows him to control the will and actions of anyone he chooses with very few actual limitations.  All he needs is direct eye contact with his intended victim and that\u2019s it.  By comparison the Death Note has a whole page full of rules and restrictions on its use.  As a result, a lot of Death Note\u2019s intrigue is generated from the various ways Light Yagami finds to work with or around those rules.  The Geass is almost too powerful by comparison.  As a result it makes his decision to start a rebellion in Japan as a means of gaining revenge against his father in Britannia seem a very roundabout way of doing things.  It would seem more effective to simply hop a plane home, Geass his way past security to get to his father and that would be the end of it.  Its not like Lelouch doesn\u2019t accomplish much the same thing with his brother Clovis at the end of the second episode.  Of course, if Lelouch were to actually follow the course simple logic would dictate then he wouldn\u2019t have started his rebellion and Code Geass wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to indulge in enough overblown spectacle to shame Michael Bay.\\n\\n\r\nThis problem is further compounded by the revelation in the second episode that Lelouch is some sort of super-genius strategist.  It\u2019s never explained to any degree where his ability comes from, whether the creators want the viewer to assume that its some sort of blood inherited trait or that he was simply educated on the subject.  The most the viewer is allowed to understand is that Lelouch\u2019s \u201cstrategic brilliance\u201d has something to do with the fact that he\u2019s good at chess, which, if you actually accept that, only explains a fraction of the schemes that he devises.  In the end, as a character Lelouch comes across as little more than a plot devise, a strategy generating machine that provides the series with its single greatest source of overblown spectacle.  \\n\\n\r\nOut of the rest of the cast the only character who made, or I should say had the potential to leave in impression on me was the anti-Britannian rebel Kallen.  She receives an entire episode devoted to her background as the daughter of a Japanese mother and a Britannian father.  Much is made of her identification with the Japanese side of her parentage and how her deceased brother figures into things and there is indeed potential for something interesting here.  Unfortunately nothing is ever done with any of these elements.  Everything that was brought up in that episode is quickly shelved and never brought up again. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted that a good portion of the issues I have with the show stem from the fact that Code Geass possesses all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the skull.  The result is a heavily calculated experience where the hands of the creators can be clearly seen picking and choosing which ideas or scenarios would have the greatest impact regardless of whether or not they make any sense (coincidences are invoked to the point of absurdity).  The first episode alone depicts an ethnic cleansing (a scenario the series portrays twice in its first season) and a bloody mass suicide sure to satisfy the more ghoulish members of the viewership.  Fanservice is plentiful and obvious with only a scant few female cast members escaping the first season with their dignity, if they ever had any to begin with.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things there isn\u2019t really a whole lot I can complain about.  The animation is smooth well done.  The color scheme employed can be a little too bright and cheery for its own good with purple mechs and a city that is lit with pink lighting at night but that is a minor complaint overall.  Character designs come courtesy of CLAMP so if you like their artwork you\u2019ll like what you see here.  If you don\u2019t like CLAMP then there isn\u2019t anything in Code Geass that will convince you otherwise.  The soundtrack, credited to Hitomi Kuroishi and Kotaro Nakagawa, isn\u2019t anything spectacular but it is nonetheless serviceable.  It is a competent presentation overall, if only.",

            "content": "Directed by Goro Taniguchi, arguably one of the best directorial talents left at studio Sunrise, and written by his Planetes screenwriter Ichiro Okouchi, Code Geass promised to be a true epic series in the making. An interesting alternate history, a lead character that promised to evolve into a ruthless rebel seeking revenge against the father and the country that ruined his and his sisters life and a dash of mecha added into the mix for good measure. So why did it turn into such a complete circus? An absolute mess of jumbled ideas never touched upon in any way that isn`t absurd or laughable, acast of characters who constantly degrade into utter imbeciles and a constantly re-shuffled plot. By the half-way mark of Code Geass, it`s as if focus changed from creating an actually riveting series, to essentially seeing how stupid they could take the whole thing and see how many viewers would go along with the ride.\\n\\n\r\nStory: While Code Geass had an interesting premise that seemingly got off to a good start, it`s unfortunate the creators of the show had no idea how to handle the mass of ideas they had, or perhaps they simply didn`t care. New plot elements are introduced while at the same time are others are pushed back and delayed, sometimes by many episodes, and sometimes taken out of the show entirely, left to be settled in the 2nd season yet to air. The writing completely flat lines half way through and instead of the gripping and fast paced war/revenge story we had, we then dive headfirst into utterly inane romance drama with a resolution so incredibly bone headed that the series has almost turned into a comedy. As the series moves on, almost as if the romance was a checkbox on a &quot;to do&quot; list of the plot, the series gradually builds up again, making you think it may yet recover, despite the still omnipresent idiocy, but the show sees fit to deliver a &quot;plot twist&quot; so completely over the top and ridiculous, the writers have wrecked absolutely everything that the series had built in it`s first half, only to deliver one of the most stupid and pathetic twists in recent years. I can`t imagine the writers had any other intention rather than having the audience laugh at the absurdity of it all. The series seems to want to be so many things at the same time. It wants to be a gripping war story, a drama about revenge, it wants to include romance and tragedy, but without foregoing humour. Unfortuntely it was unable to do any of these right.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music wise, the show's soundtrack doesn't impress much if you're familiar with Kotaro Nakagawa. His music here is essentially a rehash of mostly every other show he's done and remixed into one soundtrack. The only stand out area are the vocal tracks by Hitomi and Mikio Sakai, but even those are all too familiar if you're aquainted with their previous works. As far as the OP and EDs go, Colors by FLOW is a great accesible song, and Hitomi no Tsubasa by Access is perfectly catchy in that &quot;I wouldn't admit in real life that I like this&quot; way. The rest of the shows selections vary from the uninspired (2nd ED), to mind numbingly awful (ED1 and it's usual Ali Project rehash and the often hated OP2).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:Just as the plot of the series completely crumbles midway through the series, so do the characters. Completely intolerable and annoying side villains are introduced while other much more interesting ones are left to languich and not to reappear until much later. The constantly annoying Suzaku throughout the show is barely even a character, so much his personality and intentions are a joke. Some characters have their personal development completely eradicated from the series, again only to delay it into a second season, while most are barely given even a cursory look, including even supposedly main antagonists. Worst of all is Lelouch, whose descent into a sort of machiavellian evil was purportedly the series main selling point (Episode 1 &quot;the day the devil was born&quot;), is reduced to an utter half wit, commiting imbecilic mistake after another and constantly proving to be all talk and nothing more. A complete let down in every sense.\\n\\n\r\nValue: A seemingly promising series that eventually degrades into nothing more than fanservice and idiocy. Whatever points the series seemed to want to make in it`s first half are utterly invalidated by it`s second. The lack of any sort of resolution, for anything in the series is as confusing as it is aggravating. Being made to wait 4 months for a completely lackluster &quot;ending&quot; only to find out we`ll have to wait even more for any kind of resolution is ridiculous. Knowing that a second season is in the making is irrelevant, there needs to be some kind of payoff for sitting through 25 episodes of this, and all we are left with is having to wait for another 25 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As far as rating this show as an enjoyable new series with promise from a once great director, I`d be hard pressed to give it anymore than a 4. Nevertheless, the shows stupidity and constant excesses at least made it worth watching for a few laughs. Laughing at it of course, not with it. Sunrise seems to be stuck in a rut in terms of how it plans out and executes it`s shows. Mai Hime, Mai Otome, and now Code Geass and unfortunately they don`t seem likely to want to change that formula. I expected much more from the people behind this show, a complete shame.",

            "content": "A new Gundam series is being announced! Naruto: Shippuden is finally beginning! KyoAni is doing something new! RomeoXJuliet!\r\nThese are titles that attract us to the newest animes, but Code Geass, much like our beloved Suzumiya Haruhi was (and is) a fall/winter sleeper success. This anime, backed by Sunrise, director Goro Taniguchi (s-CRY-ed, Gun X Sword) and scriptwriter Ichiro Okouchi (Azumanga, RahXephon, Eureka 7) showcases an excellent engine of entertainment. \r\nStory \r\nA key part of any mecha/action anime. Code Geass is set in an alternate reality in which it appears the American Revolution during the late 1700s was quelled and Britain went on to conquer therest of the Americas. Thus, the Holy Britannian Empire became the world's largest superpower, covering 1/3 of the world. On August 10th, 2010, a.t.b, Japan is conquered by the Empire, renamed to Area 11 while her people are designated as 'elevens' and have their rights stripped. Thus begins the story of Code Geass, the tale of Lelouch Lamperouge, eleventh prince of the Empire and his ambition to obtain revenge on the Empire through whatever means necessary. Through the use of this alternate reality setting, we&rsquo;re definitely given something out of the ordinary. Code Geass brings a new spice to an old genre. Code Geass hops along with an arc to arc system with a few lighthearted episodes to mix things up. The story builds with each arc (obviously) to the climax. Although the rising action allows for few breaks, the viewer is never overwhelmed with information or under whelmed by a standstill. As each arc progresses to its end, we&rsquo;re given answers to previous questions yet new ones always arrive &ndash; it&rsquo;s this sense of mystery that really gives Geass its draw for attention.\\n\r\nPros: Intriguing political, action, dramatic and moral oriented story. The questions never stop &ndash; the viewer is always left wanting to discover and see more. Light hearted episodes here and there, placed very well (ex..The School Festival).\\n\r\nCons: A few scenes may turn people off on the series &ndash; something parts may seem excessively strange (read: some to some people). Again, I&rsquo;d like to reiterate that for a mecha fan, I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;ll be watching this for either story or super awesome mecha battles &ndash; you&rsquo;ll get both from this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe main characters are all extremely well devised by the hands of the all female group, CLAMP. Besides their high aesthetic appearance, each character harbors a separate and distinctive personality essential to the story. For example, Lelouch and Suzaku, opposing main characters and best friends both suffer from a very Machiavellian, &quot; Do the ends justify the means,&quot; syndrome. Lelouch is willing to do anything to further his goals however Suzaku remains wary of what must be done and what should be done. Code Geass shows us the characters inside the mechs; they're not clean cut: &quot;I fight to protect someone I care about.&quot; Each character must weigh the morality of their options as influenced by their past where the correct decision may place them farther from their goals. \\n\r\nPros: Large cast of balanced characters providing a wide arrange of personalities and moral conjectures. Characters are quirky and enjoyable.\\n\r\nCons: Only the main characters matter; anyone else is pushed to the sidelines (i.e. their stories are never a main focus).\\n\\n\r\nThe Battles\\n\r\nCode Geass delivers during its extremely well devised battle scenes. Battles seem as if they were an entirely seperate anime; lines are drawn, ace pilots face off and the battlefield is real. Geass takes a new twist on &quot;main-characters-destroy-grunts-then-whoever-else-battles&quot; and puts us right in the intensity. As said above, there is a large array of characters, interesting on both the &quot;good&quot; side and the &quot;bad&quot; side (which is which is up to you). The battlefield pits them against each other in a deatch match where we know one has to lose yet we are sympathetic to characters on both sides. This sort of conflict draws out the most amazing and interesting battles you can get from a mecha series of this time. Battlefields are led by commanders (obviously) who must make judgements based on his or her opponents's tactics and information - the strategem of battles only adds to the entertainment. The complexity and chaos of a battle give the illusion that you are watching a real war happening right before your eyes.    \\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\r\nNot much to say here; Sunrise puts money into this, characters look great, mechs look great, everything looks great. However, the art design may put some people off; characters are very tall and lanky (as expected from CLAMP) while grunt mechs are generally unimpressive. Overall though animation is on the high end of the spectrum even during low budget episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nCode Geass is probably one of the few mecha anime's that will appeal to more than just action fans. Battles are kept to a minimum: the main attraction consists of Japanese nationalism against foreign invaders, their actions which undoubtedly cause bloodshed in the name of peace. One of the themes I enjoyed was the balance between cause and effect. Characters were constantly victims of their and others&rsquo; actions this although a given in the real world seems to slip past many other story boards.",

            "content": "Yet another review for the highly acclaimed Code Geass. I believe this is the 98th review C.G would\u2019ve received; but I can\u2019t help but review this even if so many others have. \r\nHow does such a blatant horribly written show gorging with clich\u00e9s and plotholes ever be compared to the likes of or considered as Death Note\u2019s rival? I suppose it's because both shows were aired at the same time in Japan. I suppose it's because of \"how uncanny\" the resemblance between the two anti-heros are. And I suppose it's because they feature \"the ends justify the means\" views and morals. I startedwatching because of the many reviews that has praised this and the amount of people who recommended this for people who liked Death Note. And so I watched it. And regrettably so. \\n\\n\r\nMeet Lelouch Lamperouge. Former prince of the Britannian Empire, previously named \u201cLelouch Vi Britannia\u201d. He and his younger sister, Nunnally had left the royal family after their mother had been brutally assassinated many years ago and they now live on campus on Ashford Academy, where he also goes to school at. One day, he comes across a beautiful girl named C.C or C2 who gives him the power of Geass which is located in his left eye. His Geass allows him control people and make them do any of his bidding once. He uses this power to crush the Britannian Empire and under the alias \u201cZero\u201d he leads the Black Knights, a terrorist organisation, and sets out to free the world from Britannia\u2019s clutches.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder how many clich\u00e9s we already encountered in that paragraph. We have the \u201csecretly a prince\u201d clich\u00e9, the \u201cschool environment\u201d clich\u00e9, the \u201cmysterious and beautiful girl\u201d clich\u00e9 and the \u201crevenge on killing my mommy\u201d clich\u00e9. And that\u2019s just the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just one big mess. It had more plot holes than the ozone layer. They just keep adding and adding to the plot but do nothing about it. To keep up with the \u2018story\u2019 I had to constantly read the episodes summaries in Wikipedia, which I never had to do with any other series. And quite frankly, this has got to be the most boring series ever. I bet if they took out the mecha part of this the show would\u2019ve been a flop. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. We have a number of characters in this show, whom are mostly ineffective and does not add to the story whatsoever. Why the need for so many characters? Throughout the whole series I think I remembered 5 characters out of a cast of 50+. The White Knights didn\u2019t do much; neither did the Chinese government and where the hell did that guy who I assume is the glasses-girl-who\u2019s-madly-in-love-with-Princess-Euphemia boyfriend come from?!\\n\\n\r\nLelouch has got to be the most overrated character ever. We\u2019re told he\u2019s smart but so far all I\u2019ve seen is that he\u2019s good at chess. His strategies are bland and under explained to the point where logic seemed to be extinct when coming up with them, as if he just guesses the next move to take correctly.  And he is the worst anti-hero I\u2019ve come across. The way tactlessly kill innocent humans isn\u2019t justified to well either. It was quite a bore to see him \u2018use\u2019 people, but not actually manipulate him; like getting close to them and puppeteer them in such a way that angers the viewer. But instead, the viewer doesn\u2019t feel anger towards Lelouch for being such a bastard prick who play with people because he DOESN\u2019T play with them. The viewer feels nothing: no anger, no sadness nor even excitement as he continues killing people. In other words, he fails at being an anti hero. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing. The Geass. He can make any person do his bidding once. And that\u2019s about it. He doesn\u2019t try to find any way around the Geass, how he can use it or anything of that nature. Totally boring. \\n\\n\r\nNormally having different art styles is one of the plus sides of anime. However, the art in this had me cringing. The characters are disturbingly anorexic, all of them being 6ft tall and 40kg heavy. It was just ridiculous. The noses are undefined and oddly shaped, as for the rest of their sack of bones of a body. The animators weren\u2019t afraid to show scantily clad woman at the drop of a hat either. Ecchi in this show managed to exceed that of a sleazy harem, and fan service covered just about every minute of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can salute Code Geass for is the music. They manage to skilfully implement everything from jazz music to marching band trumpets in the show. However the openings were a bit of a let down, with average J-Pop taking the spot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I believe this just seems to be an anime where the creators tried to throw in as many clich\u00e9s as they can possible and tried to make it an intelligent anime but have failed miserably. Have I mentioned how BORED I was from this? I\u2019m surprised how masochistic I\u2019ve become and actually watched 15 episodes of R2 before it became too much and dropped it.",

            "content": "Code Geass is set in a alternate reality where the Britannian Empire has conquered more than one third of the world and counting, and that includes Japan. In said Japan, now called \"Area 11\" - and its inhabitants \"elevens\" -, a Britannian student named Lelouch Lamperouge finds himself thrown into a cycle of events that ultimately leads to him gaining a power known as the \"Geass\", a power allowing him to force anyone to obey any order he gives to them. Together with his hate for Britannia, he uses his newfound powers to gain followers and eventually bring forth a war against the oppressive BritannianEmpire.\\n\\n\r\nThe story skips along at a fast pace, taking the viewer through one event after another, spending neither too little time nor too much time on each event. And skipping has a more literal meaning here too; the story tends to take small jumps here and there, not explaining the events in between until a bit later. This may come off as a little confusing, but it's also a nice way of keeping you wondering what's going on and what's going to happen next. It doesn't lack twists and turns either, and especially towards the end will you get some unexpected yet pivotal twists.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I love about Code Geass is that it frequently delves into subplots, something which would've normally been bad for a two-season series. However, despite their initial prospects of irrelevancy towards the main story, in the end they serve a purpose in the grand perspective, either by moving the plot forward or by presenting character development. These subplots also help keep the show a refreshing and interesting watch.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that there's a lot of ideology in the picture, both on a political and a personal level. The Britannian Empire has their share of - in my opinion - wrong beliefs. The most obvious one is the racism they're displaying towards the inhabitants of the territories Britannia has conquered - or Numbers, as they call them. They also follow social Darwinism, which is basically the principle of natural selection implemented into human society. Stupid beliefs, if you ask me. But not everyone thinks so, it would seem.\\n\\n\r\nThe more intriguing ideologies are found when we move down to the personal level, though, with Lelouch and Suzaku's differing beliefs being the root of a ideological conflict. While their goals are more or less the same, they differ in their views on which methods should be used to accomplish the goals - Lelouch believes that the end justifies the means no matter what, while Suzaku believes that peace by murder is wrong. This conflict between two best friends (when not in battle) is a really interesting one, because it is so representative of the moral conflict that's presented - who is good, and who is bad? Britannia - or Zero? Decide for yourself who you want to sympathize with.\\n\\n\r\nMany people have compared Code Geass with Death Note, saying that it is the same, just with mecha. While it is easy to see where that is coming from, it is only on the surface that this is true. Both series' main characters are very intelligent and analytical fellows who believe that the world must be changed through bloodshed, and they both have some supernatural power. But that's all there is to it. Aside that they're as different as day and night. As a character and human being, Lelouch is a thousand times more believable than Light, mostly because he is explored much more than Light is; all we got to see in Death Note was Light's intelligence and analytical capabilities, while in Code Geass we actually get to explore Lelouch as a human, and partake in his emotional experiences, be it love or interaction with his friends, victory or defeat. And aside the two of them, I couldn't really find any similarities between the two shows. Hence, you may like one and not the other, so if you've watched Death Note and did not like it (:o), you may still like Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass also presents a huge array of supporting characters. Some are more one-dimensional and clich&eacute; than others, yet they all have their defined personalities and roles in the story. Some of them are developed in a great way, and come off as believable during their exposition. The subplots mainly focus on them, and either develops the characters or the story, and it's interwoven with the main story in a truly great way.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass, both story- and character-wise, builds up more and more towards the end; the impending climax becoming more and more evident after each and every episode. Finally, in the last two episodes, the fuse has run out, and the bomb blows. In the end however, what one will see is the smoke and not the results of the big explosion; you are left with one massive cliffhanger that'll make you long for - no, need to watch the second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are done by CLAMP, and anyone who've watched or read one of their works will know what to expect in this department: Tall and lanky characters. It's a style that may be new and unusual for many, but it really grows on you, and you can't help but think that it looks good enough, even though their proportions are off. The animation isn't anything spectacular in other departments, but it's good. Great special effects and detailed surroundings help on the aesthetic pleasure too, and aesthetics is something which is important to me when I watch an anime. The coloring is fresh and vivid, however often too much so; at times it could've probably gained from having a darker color tone. Nevertheless, it was well done. The action scenes are made out well, with smooth animation and great mecha movement, and just the right effect of chaos that's needed during intense battles. There is some reusing of the &quot;Geass-effect&quot;; the special effects they use when Lelouch uses the Geass, and while cool the first few times, it gets a bit annoying in its persistence.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, I'm a sucker for the type music they used in Code Geass. Utilizing voices instead of instruments makes for an experience that I just fall completely for, and several insert songs make it even better. Some background themes are reused a lot, but my, are they effectual. The opening and ending themes aren't especially noteworthy, unless you're a fan of the artists performing the songs, that is. The first ending theme is made by Ali Project, and I have to say, I've grown to like their style a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass can be summarized to an anime that doesn't produce anything that's over the top or exceptional, but it does give us is one helluva experience with great characters, intriguing ideologies as well as a twisted plotline that ends in a cliffhanger so massive it could kill you!",

            "content": "Probably one of the most blatantly obvious train-wrecks of bad writing in the history of serial visual narrative production, shamefully destroying its own at first stimulating concept of alternate reality with awful characterizations, extremely weak script and cheap developments that only serve the purpose of working as a &ldquo;shock-factor&rdquo; to keep the audience entranced beyond the notice of a very clear lack of sequential planning.\r\nHonestly speaking, the show is certainly fun and even held itself within certain quality standard during the irregularly interesting initial 11 episodes but as characters exponentially lose their own minds and personalities we are nothing else but witnesses of the nowclassical conceptual phrase in entertainment: &ldquo;jumping the shark&rdquo;. By the badly plotted twist in its &ldquo;praised by the masses&rdquo; stage 22 the series barely keeps itself as dirty and trashy fun that that makes you willingly embrace the filth of Japanese animation: the very price of marketing in a ridiculous attempt at dramatic storytelling that takes to oblivion without any justification its own suspension of disbelief. \\n\\n\r\nThe core problem is, of course, Lelouch. Some may argue it&rsquo;s hard to portray a genius but in the end it&rsquo;s as simple as keeping him from committing underdeveloped mistakes just for the sake of progressing the chronicled history. Not to mention how the rest of cast just acts without any justification whatsoever and never lives up to their indicated development or makes any attempt at decently stopping their inevitable crash into mediocrity. Nevertheless I got to admit that despite her poor dialogs Cornelia remained amazingly likeable, and that must say something about the value hidden in the idea of her original concept.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, with the lack of any real literary theme so to speak besides the hilariously exploitative Machiavellian motivation of its ridiculous excuse for a lead, the show honors the words of director Goro Tanigushi and exists as just an excuse to create a &ldquo;hit show&rdquo; to appeal both males and females. He succeeded for sure, shame it was at the cost of all the artistic merits of the finalized production.",

            "content": "Some people like to attribute Code Geass's success to the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Personally, I'd like to think that it succeeds (critically) despite the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Code Geass manages to establish a believable backdrop from which it launches a compelling plot along with motivated and realistic characters, something that has been missing from the last few Gundam series produced by Sunrise.  It injects a plot where the focus is finally on the characters and the events surrounding them, rather than the machines that they use to fight.  In fact, it could besaid that Code Geass only qualifies as a mecha anime due to the existence of the machines - they are in no way integral to the plot nor its development anymore than a tank or any other weapon that the characters may be using (aside from the mysterious &quot;Geass&quot; itself).\\n\\n\r\nGeass's plot is strengthened by its attention to detail in the geopolitical climate that the series quickly establishes from the get-go.  While the setting isn't too unique for a futuristic mecha (world divided between multiple superpowers, belligerent native populations fight to reestablish their cultural identity, etc.), the way the events are interwoven with one another sets itself up as being above the status quo.  Code Geass also manages to ask some of the questions that other futuristic plots seemingly neglect, either through purposeful avoidance or just through sheer ignorance.  From a political / sociological perspective, the setting and the development are especially engaging, posing questions on the topics of nationalism, racism, genocide, and the rules of war to the audience.  While you shouldn't expect any profoundly new ideas to arise from the series, the fact that the writers and creators did weave these ideas into the ongoing plot makes the world both more realistic as well as more theoretical at the same time, providing both an environment for the characters to exist in as well a philosophical establishment that they can debate.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the writers do not merely craft a beautiful world and leave it alone - instead, they focus much of their attentions, especially in the latter half of the season, towards physically and metaphysically deconstructing the world, both in the direct, tangible actions of the characters as well as the moral questions surrounding their resolve and trains of thought.  Such is the development of the actual plot of Code Geass: fluid, dynamic, and engaging.  While not entirely unpredictable, the plot's development is seamless in terms of being able to logically move from one event to another, such that the implications of a &quot;cause and effect&quot; paradigm can be observed.  At the same time, the plot is also not so simplistic as to be a &quot;Point A -&gt; Point B -&gt; Point C&quot; formula.  Instead, we witness the joining and interweaving of multiple, distinct plot lines, which at first glance are independent of one another, but towards the end fuse into one.  Then, Code Geass throws us a curveball, and splits the strands again, preparing us for the upcoming Season 2....\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest relative strength of Code Geass when compared to most other action / mecha anime are its characters and the way they develop.  Sunrise made the intelligent decision of contracting CLAMP to design the characters, since they are both visually and emotionally appealing to a wide array of audiences.  Internet messageboards are usually torn between the main protagonists and side characters of the story, each holding one above the others for a personal reason that they see within each one of them.  In addition, the side characters are not there merely for ornamentation - even the seemingly minor characters at the sides of the main few are given room to develop with their own storylines and reactions, such that we are never really compelled to dismiss characters as merely being &quot;filler fodder&quot;.  Prepare to be intrigued by these individuals - from the psychological coldness of Lelouch, to the restrained idealism of Suzaku and Kallen, to the overall question mark that is C.C.  The reactions of the individuals combine to form distinct, evolving psychological profiles, allowing the series to be populated by a cadre of multifaceted individuals.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Code Geass is extremely successful from a storytelling perspective, it does have its faults, especially on the technical side.  Plain and simple, the fight scenes were not too impressive.  That is not to say that they were awful, but the mecha and battle scenes definitely did not compare tot he fluidity of the script nor the depth of the characterization.  In addition, especially towards the latter third of the season, the plot does take a few freedoms with regards to suspension of disbelief, as well as falling into the trap of rapidly switching between &quot;tragically dramatic&quot; to &quot;comically relieving&quot; scenes.  However, these are minor problems, especially the &quot;bloated plotlines&quot;, which fixes itself by the end of the series.  I also would not recommend this series to mecha addicts who are genuinely more interested in awesome combat scenes between mechas, since Code Geass will not live up to your expectations.  However, for the rest of you, even if you have never considered picking up a mecha anime to watch, pick up Code Geass, it is sure to not disappoint.",

            "content": "Code Geass is one of those series that can inspire praise, hatred or mere ridicule, depending on what is expected or what can be tolerated. Curiously, I find entirely valid reasons behind each of those reactions. There's still a bit of this and that, to put it bluntly, but perhaps the lines aren't quite as clear as they seem.\r\nIn short, I enjoyed the series and still find that its virtues and sheer fun factor outweigh its objective flaws, but I'm worried about the future. Whether or not the inevitable sequel picks up the slack, addresses existing concerns or drops the ball completely is something thatonly Sunrise knows at this point. In any case, we might as well enjoy what we can.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is melodramatic and ambitious enough. Lelouch, the protagonist, is embarking on a personal quest through the use of his intellect and a mysterious power, motivated by personal revenge and morally ambiguous altruism. The setting is divided into two spheres, the edgier world of military/politics and the more carefree environment of the Ashford academy, with their respective casts of characters. There's a clear element of mecha action here as well, even if it's not really the main attraction and doesn't dominate the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace is definitely fast and unrelenting...perhaps it's all a bit much for Lelouch's and the story's own good, though, as things turn out. The writing and direction can be uneven during the weaker moments, but are absolutely thrilling at their best. Most of it develops quite nicely, with some general predictability and a few genuine surprises that keep things interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest concerns are certain major twists which threaten to overwhelm the viewer, if they are not enjoyed or understood. Intentional and unintentional humor, such as Pizza Hut's sponsorship or many over the top sequences, can be occasionally distracting as well. I personally felt that the basic focus is never lost, however, when all is said and done, in spite of a few undeniable blunders or red herrings.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, we've only seen half the story and, for better or for worse, the upcoming sequel has the responsibility of providing true resolution. Or at least trying to do so in an interesting way, whether it fails or succeeds at it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nProduction values are good and tend to stay consistent. I've never been a CLAMP fan, mostly due to unfamiliarity, so their original character designs for Code Geass -while distinctive and attractive- don't really impress me too much. They may also look strange from certain angles. The mechanical designs are just fine for the show's purposes, with a couple of particularly well done models. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe music is appropriate and mostly unobtrusive, whether the mood is serious, exciting, relaxed, mischievous, dramatic or tragic. Not exactly the best soundtrack I've ever heard, as a few tracks could use more variety. The opening and ending themes are quite well done, as a rule, and tend to fit the show. Naturally, your mileage may vary here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nFor someone who is often accused of being a copycat there are certain nuances to Lelouch's personality that set him apart, such as his emotional range and a sense of humanity emerging from his internal conflicts or character flaws. Predictably, the protagonist himself carries the show on his back and receives the most development, which is good since he does deserve much of it and this makes him an interesting subject of study. Having said that, said development has at least one major drawback: it may not be what people are expecting and finding certain events relatively disappointing or even anti-climatic is quite possible. Suzaku, who also plays an important role as Lelouch's foil, has a self-righteous personality and his interference can be very annoying to witness. He does have some complexity though, even if it's still a hard sell for those who find themselves sympathizing with Lelouch/Zero. C.C. herself is mysterious enough, as we've only seen bits and pieces of information regarding her background thus far, but remains an intriguing and generally fun character by virtue of her interactions with Lelouch. \\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters tend to get some attention too, with interesting results in the major cases whether you appreciate their fates or not. The big issue for me is that the cast of characters might seem a bit too large as the show goes on, with a couple of unnecessary additions towards the later half that tend to delay, limit or rush development. Still, this is the kind of show where such size makes sense on paper given its scope, but as a result we will have to wait for the sequel in order to see if a few questionable plot threads are continued, resolved or at least replaced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Code Geass, even though I wasn't entirely convinced about certain plot twists and openly laughed along with certain sequences or developments, was certainly entertaining and rarely boring. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, I appreciated both the genuinely well-done portions and several of the more absurd scenarios. The show is not a masterpiece by any means, nor is it going to please every sector of the audience that it will initially attract. I'd still be perfectly happy to recommend it to those who haven't seen it.",

            "content": "There some mecha's that achieve near brilliance, and others that are rendered useless in their awkward failure. Code Geass is neither of this. \r\nI started Code Geass as soon as the first episode aired.. Yes, I have enjoyed it very much. But to my surprise, on the arrival of the 13th episode, Code Geass took the anime industry by storm. Like a moth to a flame, people crowded the anime and simply worshiped it(God knows how many CC fans are being born as of this moment). Much as Ive enjoyed Code Geass, it does not do justice to be considered what it is today. Infact I feel its popularity is similar to FMA, both are highly enjoyable but nowhere near being the masterpiece people claim it to be.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is not a sight to behold, but rather a sight to gather thousands of fans within only barely dozen of episodes. Spectacle, after all, is Code Geass specialty, not subtlety, so enjoying the sum of the parts sometimes requires dispassionate detachment or at least blind belief. But whether you think Code Geass is absurd or lacking originality, Code Geass is one of the most fun and engaging anime's in recent memory, as long as you don't think about it too hard.\\n\\n\r\nJapan, being defeated by the empire of Britannia, whose territory reaches nearly one third of the world thanks to their high-tech war machines called Knightmares, was renamed to Area 11. Britannia swiftly depraved the Elevens(Japanese) of their pride, rights and isolated them from the migrating citizens of Britannia, leaving them to poverty.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where our main boy steps in. Lelouch, a young former prince of Britannia who was known to have passed away, not to mention a cheap ripoff of Light Yagami from Death Note.  During a battle between the Britanna and a scarce amount of rebelling Elevens, Lelouch finds a capsule containing a naked woman, who gives Lelouch Geass, a mysterious ability that can control any human simply by looking them in the eyes and speaking his commands. And because that it just so happens that Lelouch has this great animosity for the Brittania, he plans to single handedly face the tyrant. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch under the alias of Zero, becomes a hope to the elevens and a threat to Britannia.\\n\\n\r\nIts hard not to compare Lelouch from Yagami Light of Death Note. But if you can get past it, you'll find out something more. Coming with a tragic past pre-installed, it may seem that Lelouch is your typical apprehended teenager(Gundam anyone?). But Lelouch in a way, is a revenge-driven genius who would dare to go against the world to reach his goals and doesnt endlessly desires to just die without a fight.  He even has the discernment for seizing control of the situation and directs the terrorist group by radio, controlling them and anticipating the moves of the Britannian forces like it was a game of chess.\\n\r\nIt isnt entirely plausible how is still able to manage a double life and lead the Japanese to victory. But it does provide Lelouch moments to look more sympathetic and less unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah thats pretty much what you need to know. Lelouch battles Britannia with the help of the ever so gullible and disposable Japanese. Oh and I forgot to mention Suzaku,an Eleven who is his childhood friend, siding to Britannia. They both basically the want the same thing, only they have different methods. Lelouch wants to rid of Britannia to make the world easier for his sister to live in, Nunally. Suzaku, on the other hand, wants to climb the ladders of Britannia, and gradually change it to good from the inside. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a ton going on in these first five episodes, and the pacing is rapid-fire.  Add in a truly epic stage, some awesome battles, and just a dash of comedy to keep things from getting too dark, and it's really hard to see where this show can go wrong from here. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is majestic, in terms of entertaining. The plot twists are so twisted that it becomes endless and absurd. Every episode ends in marvelous cliffhangers that can make you get a garotte wire and strangle yourself for an entire week until the next episode comes out and makes you do the same thing all over again. It just keeps getting better and better.\\n\\n\r\nThe actions are also a treat. From assault to massive warfare, Code Geass is impressively detailed. The contest between Britannia and the Eleven are as breathtaking as they are thrilling, while the individual battles are supremely well choreographed.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass has so many things working in its favor that it becomes easy to overlook some of its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is completely convincing and fulfills the shows &quot;mecha plausibility&quot; quotient well besides than the roller blading war machines. Moreover, few if any prior shows have as effectively integrated the tacky yet refined movements of the robots as they do here. CLAMP did the designs here so be sure to expect it to be excellent(and have arms, which have uncanny ability to stretch an extra three feet)\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fluid. It always depicts the sound perfectly. Be it a gunshot or a whole building crumbling down, it is nicely executed. The background effects are also a plus. You get to hear a bunch of insects flying around or birds chirping.\\n\r\nIt gives a rather credible atmosphere partnered by a perfect atmospheric melody. The clarity of the sound effects definitely supports the anime very well.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is no slouch either. It can easily persuade you of the emotion of each characters tries to convey, even supporting characters are given enough to time to emote.\\n\\n\r\nThe results are predictably impressive, even genre-defining. However as good as Code Geass is in terms of spectacle, the show does hit a few dud notes in terms of plot and characterization. But put together with visual flair, it&rsquo;s a winning combination that helps to ensure Code Geass is a roller coaster experience of thrilling intensity.\\n\\n\r\nJust like Da Vinci Code, it is &quot;preposterously entertaining&quot;.It is safe to say that anyone who's interested in action or mecha will go bananas over Code Geass.",

            "content": "At first when i heard of how great Geass was and then I learned it was a mecha show, I was a bit reluctant to watch it since I am not a big fan of mecha. But once I sat down and watched code geass I was really impressed at how good it was.\r\nStory: The story of this anime is one of the best I've seen and it is highly enjoyable. At the end of every episode I had the urge to quickly watch the next because of how incredible this show was giving you all this conflict and plot twists at would just leaveyou shocked. I could feel the intensity of the situations at times and not many shows can do that. Another plus is that it was not 100% mecha and it has its elements of mystery in it because of the actual geass power. And the story is not yet over since they give you an ending that just breaks your heart knowing that you're gonna have to wait a couple months to figure out what happened. Cliffhangers are EVIL!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: CLAMP, not everyone likes their style of drawing but in my case I am a nut for CLAMP so I found this show's animation really good. The colours were so bright and pretty for an anime that IMO is rather dark and serious. All the robots looks great and have flashy and pretty designs to them, the Lancelot looks SO COOL XD\\n\\n\r\nSound: The only thing that I didnt find outstanding about the show was the music, some of the background songs I kinda disliked since it seemed like it wasnt really fit for the moment. But overall it was still good. I guess I should comment at how great Lelouch's seiyuu did a great job playing him.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Lelouch is probably one of the main reasons I like Geass, the conflicts he suffers and how he plays some of the other characters is just awesome. Suzaku on the other hand, I dont really like how he is trying to achieve his plans and should just die v_v but thats what makes geass good since it allows me to really get attached to the characters and grow to love or HATE them. Oh and C.C = win.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have really enjoyed watching Geass it has given me one of the best storytelling and even some really cool action as well. And with the new season coming my excitement has once again returned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Geass is one of the best mecha shows out there and if you are a mecha fan this show has a lot of other aspects that will definitely draw you in. This is one of the best shows out there and should not be missed by anyone. In my case, I'm just glad season 2 is coming out soon.",

            "content": "Code Geass is the most overrated anime on the top 20 list.  \r\n  Although it has a fast-paced plot with quite a few surprises along the way (which is why I finished 25 episodes), I cannot help but feel that it was a complete waste of time.\r\n  It seems to me that the creators of Geass sit together, with trend analysis graphs and bar charts on the table, pick out popular elements of the recent years and just throw them into this anime.\r\n  So at the end, we get a villain as the main character (Death Note?), lots ofmoral dilemmas,  lots of angst and shocks, but no real focus or passion in the story.  Characters are 2-dimensional and boring, their actions are completely driven by the plot.  And the plot tries its best to deliver as much angst and surprises as possible just for the sake of it.\\n\\n\r\n  If you haven't watch it yet, don't waste your time.  And if you really have to try, trust your own feeling and forget about all the hype.  Drop it when you are bored.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The other reviews available here cover a lot of details, so this will be a somewhat brief overview that will concentrate only on the main aspects, without spoilers.\r\nCode Geass is a good anime that I recommend to watch. However, it has its hits and misses.\r\nStory\r\nCompared to many other anime items I've watch, Code Geass's plot twists and unfolds with shocking pace compared to the usually expected sluggishness found in most 20+ episode series. The 25 episodes of the first season would have been enough to supply like 75 episodes One Piece style (no offense to OP: I like it no less than Code Geass).\r\nThis, however,placed its toll on the story's coherence. Near the end, it might even become somewhat confusing, as if the authors looked at all the possible outcome scenarios and picked the most shocking ones, without paying much attention to how well they would fit. I can't confidently say if its a good or a bad thing, I guess we'll only know for sure after season 2. So far, I'd easily give it a 10 for pace and courage in plot twisting, but after seeing it all I think I'll place some penalty to emphasize that the story could use some more work when it comes to adequacy.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI'll be honest: I don't like CLAMP's character design, not even one bit. I'd prefer any Satoshi Kon's or Katsuhiro Otomo's movie characters to it any day. I like the characters to look realistic, and here I see typical bishounen boys and comparably cute girls. No wait, boys are apparently more cute here. Much so. Cause all of them look like, you know, androgynes. And size differences between, say, Lelouch's frame and Emperor's frame are shocking.\\n\r\nI'm actually surprised how can these boys even move so fast with those frail limbs.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is very good, though, action scenes are fluid and detailed. Also, lots of blood, many deaths. Be aware.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nMusic is fast and catchy, very fitting for a story like this. I didn't like it much, though, except for the second opening starting midway through the series. Rest of the sound work is fine, if you don't count somewhat annoying voices and public domain samples used in several scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nTough to say. On one hand, characters are active and vivid. On another, they can annoy you easily (easily!). Some characters could use more development, some abandoned their development whatsoever. Some you will wish didn't die, some you will definitely wish to have died.\\n\\n\r\nWhat definitely contributes to my own displease is that the characters are very easy to make a decision no matter how major and complicated the matter is, which makes their actions seem less natural and more &quot;eh, they totally saw that coming&quot; throughout. Moreover, while many of the main characters' motives are deep and somewhat disturbing, all their thoughts are immediately relevaled, leaving less to think through and analyze, which makes it easier to understand than something like Evangelion, but at the same time detracts from long term enjoyability. There is little point in solving riddles when you're given an answer before you even have a chance to realize that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it looks like the entire cast of main and supporting characters was composed of Mensa members. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOne undisputable factor such fast paced story usually contributes to is the thrill. That's right, Code Geass is thrilling, interesting and unpredictable, with numerous comedy elements, little fan service and fascinating action scenes. Just what I like in series like this. A well deserved 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nCode Geass is an enjoyable watch, clever and surprising. However, its story leaves something to be desired, in both possible senses.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, don't watch the Recaps together with the main episodes: they disrupt the pace without contributing any new content. Better use them instead of rewatching in case you want to refresh the memories of the events happened. Specials (the non-animated shorts) can be watched at any time, provided you won't watch them before the corresponding events in the main series.",

            "content": "Code Geass is definitely a very popular anime, no denying that, but I wouldn't exactly call it a master piece, but it is however, a fun and entertaining show, you just don't need to put too much thought into it.\r\nSTORY: Once upon a time, there was a famous animation company that decided to mash up as many genres as they can to make an anime that would try to appeal to as many anime fans as possible.\r\nThe end result was Code Geass, and it was a success, popularity wise.\r\nBut before I get on to the actual review I have to say honestly, I really likethis anime, but it can pretty much ruin the fun of the anime if you try to look at it objectively, but that being said, it's hard not to since this anime tries way too hard to appeal to too many genres that fans are into.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the story itself is quite interesting, an alternate reality where England, now named Brittania, has taken over the world and just really hates Japan to the point of ethnic cleansing (It's a little unsettling to say the least). But the main focus of the anime is about a royal family member castaway, Lelouch Lamperouge, trying to get revenge on his father, the leader/king of Brittania for the murder of his mother. So yeah, essentially the story is just another revenge story, nothing too original (How are revenge stories so damn popular I will never know).\\n\\n\r\nBut the anime starts to show its short comings, and really early on. The anime tries to make you assume that Lelouch is a genius solely upon him being good at chess, with no other reason, he's genius cause he's a beast at chess, that's it.\\n\r\nThere's no character build up to show he's a genius other than playing chess (But I would not know since I don't play chess, maybe it really does make you a genius, maybe I need to try it out before making this judgement).\\n\\n\r\nAnd besides being a genius, he receives a power which allows him to control people's minds, once per person, called Geass (Get it? Because the show is also called Code \"Geass\"), which by the way, is the best used character/plot device in the anime, and it's entertaining how Lelouch uses it in dangerous situations or when he's trying to outsmart his foes.\\n\r\nHowever, the way he obtains just seems that not enough thought was put into it, in other words, kinda lazy, he meets a girl in a strait jacket being chased by the military, and bam! Mind control powers.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also where you also should realize a major plot hole in the early episodes, with his mind controlling powers, he could get his revenge in a heart beat, but that's not fun to watch at all, but if he could simply kill off one of his family members easily in less than three episodes (Don'y worry, that character's death is just another way to advance the plot), what's keeping him from getting his father like that too?\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, Lelouch isn't really a likable character (His comes off being arrogant and is just a calculating and sadistic bastard), but the rest of the cast though, have a little more going on for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe benefactor of Lelouch's power, C.C. (Pronounced C2) may not be terribly interesting herself, but like myself, she's just there to watch the whole show play out and snack on pizza (Fun fact, this anime was endorsed/sponsored  by a pizza company). \\n\r\nIn fact I would've been fine if her character just died on the first episode (Spoiler: she gets shot in the head), it would've been more interesting to see Lelouch figure his powers all on his own anyway. But apparently, she must have been a favorite of the creators of the anime, enough so they keep her to mess a round with Lelouch and eat pizza, so at least she's amusing.\\n\\n\r\nChildhood friend and some what frienemy of Lelouch, Suzaku, is arguably a better protagonist than Lelouch and was developed into his character much better than Lelouch too, but his focus on what he wants to do isn't exactly clear (I want to save Japan/I want to be a knight for britiania, blah, blah, blah), and though his character development is better than what Lelouch's was, it can be arguably be called lazy, because most of it was through flashbacks to his past, though later episodes are more enjoyable due a girlfriend he gets.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the real stars of the anime are the genres that are ungracefully crammed together.\\n\\n\r\nIt tries to be school life anime, a harem, an action anime, ecchi anime, psychological anime (TRIES to, it isn't), romance anime, and a mecha anime all at the same time, but if you look down at the core of this anime and try to piece it together, you'll realize it's a gigantic mess.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially how this anime tries to integrate mecha (Get it? Because it's called Code Geas... wait, don't the majority of mecha anime have the name of a mecha in it's title? Gurren Lagann or any Gundam for example) into the story, they're just literally there to just be cool and to be used as weapons of war, nothing more, absolutely nothing more. Shallow is a better word to describe it than lazy.\\n\r\nThe anime would honestly be just as effective without the mechs (Apparently the creators are aware of this because two of the manga series have no mechas in them), in fact, it isn't a mecha anime.\\n\r\nA mecha anime is a mecha cause one of it's major focuses is on it's robots, Code Geass focuses on anything else but the mechas, they're there just to appeal to mecha fans, so really there's no point what so ever for the mechas to even exist in this anime, they're just cool to throw in because they're giant robots.\\n\\n\r\nBut, there is one thing this anime knows what it is, a loud cluster f**k of many gernres, and despite that it's not a great anime, it's fun to watch and at least pretend that it knows what it's trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: For me, this is best part of the whole anime, it looks great, the girls are hot, the boys are pretty, everyone wins, plenty of eye candy for all.\\n\r\nEspecially for fans of clamp, who were generous enough to do the character designs.\\n\r\nThe mechas look cool enough, but the stupidest parts on them are the wheels slapped on them, they look so ridiculous. But the action scenes more than compensate for them.\\n\r\nBut other than that, this a gorgeous looking show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Both the Japanese and English voices are great, but I only watched the english dubbed due to my own preferences.\\n\r\nJohnny Young Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Steven Blum, Kate Higgins, and so many more top notch notable voice actors are in this anime, but of all of them, Johnny is damn good as Lelouch and Yuri's Suzaku is a great compliment to Johnny's performance.\\n\r\nEach theme music is enjoyable and what you'll except for a mainstream anime, though the back ground music doesn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Very entertaining and fun to watch.\\n\r\n+ Good looking characters designed by Clamp, and great animation overall.\\n\r\n+ Good english dub, Johnny Bosch's Lelouch is arguably one of his best performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Can be faulted for trying too hard to appeal to multiple audiences by shallowly cramming genres together.\\n\r\n- There's honestly there's no point of the mechas other than to be used as weapons to fight.\\n\r\n- Weak character development, C.C. honestly feels thrown in.\\n\r\n- Lots of plot holes\\n\\n\r\nDespite what I have said in this review I would still recommend this to any one.\\n\r\nAnd I'm surprised I didn't reference Death Note once in this review... Wait a minute... Damn, so close.",

            "content": "(this review will cover elements from R2 and R1)\r\nThere will probably be a large amount of people who will look at the score I gave code geass and click the \"not helpful\" button without even bothering to read the first few lines of this review. If this is you, I don't believe you should bother reading this review in the first place, since your mind is obviously not going to be changed. And also, this review is all my own opinion, the large majority of you will probably enjoy code geass a lot, but if you want to hear a different opinion then go aheadand read the review. \\n\\n\r\nIntelligent anime. Its probably one of my favourite types of anime. It's so much nicer to get enthralled, shocked, and mindblown by an anime rather than to turn your brain off and enjoy a bunch of generic bullshit that basically copies every other mildly successful show in its genre. Unfortunately however, for every actually intelligent anime there is an equal number of, if not even more shows for which their intelligence is only superficial. While you may not (and probably won't) agree, I believe code geass is one of these shows. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first heard of code geass, it was described to me as \"death note with mechs\". Although the manga was a lot better, I actually enjoyed death note, and I dove into code geass hoping for another helping of interesting characters, and a relatively well paced and clever plot. For me, code geass was just a huge load of cliches, underdeveloped characters, and extremely convenient coincidences all wrapped up together to make a quite lackluster anime. Although I'm not going to go over every single little thing, since that would take forever and I'm too lazy, code geass had almost as may plot holes as mirai nikki (although that also has a mean score over 8, so that shows you something)\\n\\n\r\nIt's very surprising how people try to compare lelouch and Light, or the strategic planning that both shows supposedly have. While they were often unrealistic and sometimes made no sense, the plans in death note obviously had a lot of though put into them, and the dialogue passing between Light and L was interesting enough to keep you engrossed in the story. However, all that the so called \"strategy\" in code geass equates to is \"My mech is bigger and more badass than yours.\" the large majority of battles the black knights face in this anime are won by lelouch procuring a new bigger and more powerful weapon that they use to eliminate the opposition. And when he actually does any real planning it's consisted of lelouch conveniently guessing the opponents next moves as if he's some kind of psychic. As the show goes on he seems to putt less and less logic into his plans. Especially the way they escaped the britannian empire by all dressing up as zero. That was less like a carefully derived strategy and more like something and more like a retarded idea lelouch came up with after he'd had one too many beers. If the britannians honestly couldn't come up with a way to thwart that, then it's no surprise they got outsmarted.\\n\\n\r\nAnother annoying Element of code geass is the characters. Unless its a show with an above average amount of episodes, or one that is not character driven, good shows often take the route of keeping the cast of characters smaller, and developing those characters further. However, code geass prefers to go to down the path of piling on so many new and completely useless characters that don't garner the slightest bit of interest from the viewer or develop the plot in any reasonable way that you forget the name of anyone who's not a main character. The white knights did fuck all, in fact you only knew the names of a few of them, and this was true for a large amount of the cast. a result of this many of the characters got so little development and focus that I couldn't care less what happened to them at all. Even lelouch who is the main character gets stuck with a cliched \"mah parent(s) were killed omg so sad and compelling\" backstory, and thats it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, all of the characters look like lanky anorexic beat sprouts who need to go and eat some big macs, but apart from that it was nothing special, and typical for an anime of its time. The sound quality was actually quite good during the actual episodes, however the openings and endings were just boring J-pop that I skipped every time I watched an episode.\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to mention is the fanservice, and this was definitely a lot more prominent in R2. Kallen in her knightmare shot from very suspicious camera angles, Kallen in the shower, and Kallen and CC doing a variety of other things to please the otakus and their penises. It's disheartening that even a so called intelligent anime like code geass ended up throwing in enough fanservice to make an ecchi harem anime jealous. It may have had plot, but it was hard to notice it with kallen's ass getting shoved in your face for half of every episode.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the series does not drop below a four, it must have its good points. Despite him being a lot less intelligent than people make him out to be, lelouch was at some points relatively interesting to watch, unlike all the other characters. And although I found the majority of all the episodes boring, the final few episodes of each season piqued my interest a bit (Dat spinzaku), and I didn't mind watching them, although R2s ending is a bit overrated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I though that although it had its moments, code geass was overall overrated and slightly below average. although some people reading this will understand what I'm going on about, the majority of people who have seen code geass enjoyed it a lot, and the chances are that you will too. However, I personally would not recommend code geass, and I think there are much better anime you could spend your time watching. For alternate recommendations, if you haven't already seen death note (which is unlikely) go and watch it, or for another mech anime try neon genesis evangelion.\\n",

            "content": "The most succinct way to describe Code Geass is to call it a cross between Death Note and MEGAS XLR/Gurren Lagann with a generous helping of your average ecchi harem SOL romantic comedy and a dash of Evangelion thrown into the mix. Does it work? Not exactly. Code Geass is one of those shows that brings a lot of good stuff to the table but fucks it up in so many ways once the script comes into question. There are more plot holes here than there are potholes on the Grand Central Parkway, and whether or not that's hyperbole is entirely up for you todecide. Despite all of this, I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I actually DO happen to like and enjoy both seasons of Code Geass to the point where I would actually go out of my way to have both seasons on DVD or Blu-ray (provided that Funimation actually gives it a release any time soon >_>). With that said, my enjoyment can only go so far.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just start off with what REALLY gets my goat with this show because there's a lot of that stuff that just doesn't sit right with me one way or another. First up, there's the character designs. Believe it or not, the character designs were the very reason why I never bothered watching Code Geass when it was on [adult swim] way back in 2008/2009. Whilst I do happen to like CLAMP's mangas (i.e. X/1999, Chobits), it's their artwork that just doesn't sit right with me. Why am I mentioning this? Well... CLAMP was contracted to do the original character designs for Code Geass and nothing more. I don't know about you, but I'm not too fond of lanky pretty boys with long arms and big eyes, girls with small waists and melons that realistically should make them collapse under their weight, etc. I'm more of a fan of Naoki Urasawa or Inio Asano's artwork than I am CLAMP's from a character design standpoint. Thankfully, not every character on the show is drawn like such (i.e. Charles zi Britannia), but our boys Lelouch and Suzaku are and we see more of them than we see Charles so... yeah. Why can't we have humans that look like regular humans? I don't fucking know, but it is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to another problem I have: fan service. As much as I love my lascivious animated women, the fan service in Code Geass got to a point where I was wondering if I was watching Rosario Vampire again. Any time that there was a serious moment going on where shit was about to go down, in pops Shirley changing into her swimsuit or a shot of Kallen's ass, or Kallen entering a conference room in a bath towel because she wanted to yell at Lelouch, or some other bullshit like that. Yeah... I'm not a huge fan of the girls in this show barring C.C., Cornelia, Euphemia, and a couple of others if only because of the fact that virtually every girl in this show is no better than a fan service character. Would you believe me if I told you the fan service got to a point where there was an out-of-place masturbation scene? Well, there is. When did this show turn into End of Evangelion? I don't know, but that's another story.\\n\\n\r\nGoing off on a tangent, another problem that Code Geass has is the fact that it just loves to jump between all that plot-heavy rebellion stuff with light-hearted slice-of-life school stuff and let's just say that in between the fan service and this crap, I had a hard time deciding which was a bigger buzzkill. As stupid as the actual plot of the show got at some points, it certainly managed to keep me engrossed until the episode ends, I load up the next episode, and I see Suzaku and Lelouch chasing a cat for 20 minutes. I'm not even joking, that was actually the plot for an entire episode. You know, it's moments like these that make me see why the uber elitists here on MAL tout Legend of the Galactic Heroes as a superior alternative to Code Geass. At least that show managed to maintain a consistent tone throughout the entire narrative. Of course, there are a lot of reasons why LOGH isn't high on my priority list, but let's not get into that.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of writing, Code Geass has some of the most glaring plot holes that I've ever come across. It took me a while to actually pick up on them since I was too caught up in my own enjoyment to actually bother analysing the show crtically but when you actually use your critical faculties whilst watching this show, you start seeing more and more stuff to use as snark bait. For example, Lelouch's \"Geass\" power is so unbelievably broken (broken as in \"overpowered,\" mind you). He can only issue a command once to any individual, but that command is absolute. Basically, Lelouch has the ability to turn anyone into his slave if he so chooses. Sure, there are some arbitrary rules thrown into the mix as a half-hearted attempt to balance out his powers but really... you have to wonder why Lelouch didn't just order a whole bunch of people to be his slaves until he did something else.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of Geass, the way it's handled is just so bizarre. Geass is supposed to be absolute, but shit like sheer willpower and even a kiss from a sexy green-haired chick can override its influence on you depending on what the episode demands (that last one is not a joke; that's how the R2 actually gets going). At one point in R2, there's a \"Geass Canceller\" introduced but it's only given to a character who seems to suffer from a severe case of multiple personality disorder and he only bothers using it whenever he wants to. Now, Geass users are prone to having their powers go rogue and this actually does happen to Lelouch at some point. However, this plot point was quickly dealt with and we never hear from it again. Even if you factor in all the other Geass users, the entire conflict surrounding Code Geass feels meaningless at some points. The entire show could've been condensed to 12-15 episodes had Lelouch actually made better use of his powers and there was less bullshit along the way. Alack, that's another story of what could've been.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Lelouch, the characters here in Code Geass are so variable in terms of quality. Motivations change at the drop of a hat, characters that were once likeable become complete assholes, and even at that point, the writing behind the bulk of these characters just isn't good most of the time. Let's just say this: Lelouch may very well be a genius, but the anime certainly doesn't do a good job of showing any sort of actual intelligence on his part. In fact, Lelouch may very well be the predecessor of Kirito when it comes down to how perfect he apparently is (right down to the harem of girls waiting to drop their panties and bend over; thankfully, Lelouch has no time for these hoes).\\n\\n\r\nThe only indicator we actually have for him being a genius is the fact that he's a chess master and that he somehow has the gift of clairvoyance. Any time some major shit's about to go down, he's able to predict certain events with such a remarkable degree of accuracy to the point where you gotta wonder if Charles and Marianne had Lelouch while a voodoo witch doctor was delivering him. Now, despite his genius status and how he's able to weasel himself out of almost any situation, the guys at Sunrise decided to not make him 100% perfect. He gets cocky and because of this, he makes some REALLY stupid decisions over the course of the show. He ALWAYS ends up letting his emotions get the better of him in battle whenever shit doesn't pan out the way he wants to, he kills off potential allies whilst sparing enemies, and he gets caught up in completely unnecessary battles because of his apparent lack of foresight. Seriously, this guy doesn't seem to understand what back-up plans are and the only reason why he ever makes it out in the first place is because of some \"ingenuity\" on the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nNow with Lelouch's failings out of the way, let's talk about Suzaku. A lot of people hate him, but I don't. In fact, I'm rather fond of him at some points if only because of his relationship with Lelouch. What I don't particularly like is the fact that Suzaku is apparently trying to change the system from the inside but he ends up becoming a rank-and-file soldier who effectively slaughters his own people despite the fact that he wants to save them. Question: if he really wants to change the system from the inside, why doesn't he become a politician? Okay, maybe there's some kind of Britannian law that prevents Japanese people from getting into politics but the fact still remains that he's so stupid to the point where he fails to realise that he's NOT helping his own people by becoming a person who's contractually obligated to slaughter the Japanese for whatever reason. People rag on him for his idealistic views, but there are a lot of great characters who have idealistic views on whatever (i.e. Kenzo Tenma from Monster) so that alone isn't enough to make him a bad character. If you really want to give him shit, bitch about how he's incapable of realising that he's NOT helping his own cause whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters aren't exactly much to speak of either... at least, in a positive manner. For one thing, there's Nina Einstein... and let's just say that I can't wait to read a fan fiction where she dies a mercilessly brutal death. She has to be one of the most irritating and infuriating characters out there, and she's the one who's responsible for that out-of-place masturbation scene. We have Kallen, whose potential is overshadowed by the size of those melons and that ass of hers. We have C.C. who's quite a hilarious snarker but she's not really good for anything except plot conveniences, fan service, and Pizza Hut product placement. We have Nunnally, an irritating paraplegic who has no use outside of being a damsel-in-distress with a brother complex. There's also a pot-pourri of other characters but I'm not about to waste more of our time talking about them.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the shit I've said about Code Geass in general, the first season on its own was quite entertaining (provided that you don't think too much and just let your inner filthy casual run wild), and it did manage to do some stuff right. For starters, the dynamic between Lelouch, Suzaku, et al was quite lovely and if anything, it's that very relationship that made the ending to the first season that much more intense. The second season on the other hand takes everything I didn't like about the first season and then dials that shit up to 11. We have MORE unlikeable characters (lookin at you, Rolo!), MORE inconsistent characterisation, and MORE disjointed storytelling with all the plot holes you've come to know and love. Oh, and let's not forget the fan service! You know how much I love seeing Kallen's knockers or that sweet ass of hers.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the second season is a HUGE drop in quality compared to the first one. Now despite all of that shit I said before, what I really hated about the second season was just how slow it actually was. Say what you will about the first season, but at least it felt like shit was actually progressing from point A to point B. I'm not even joking when I say that I came close to dropping the second season twice because I was so bloody bored out of my mind. Was there stuff happening? Well, yeah but nothing of consequence actually occurs until the final ~6-7 episodes of the season. As strange as it sounds, the second season actually did get off to something of a decent start and it was obvious as to where it wanted to go with the story but it just took so fucking long for ANYTHING of substance to happen. What happened in the meantime you ask? Mecha battles for the sake of having mecha battles, plot twists that would only make sense to someone who's hogging the blunt for too long, and character interactions that just make you wonder if this really was the same show as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAmazingly enough though, people seem to give this season a pass purely because of that ending. I'm not gonna lie, Code Geass has one of the most intense and ultimately satisfying conclusions of anything I've ever watched. However, that alone isn't enough to excuse all of the bullshit that went on in this season. Yeah, the second season doesn't have as much slice-of-life bullshit as the first season but R2 made up for that deficiency with all of this bad writing. For starters, characterisation is worse here, and I don't even think Sunrise was trying to hide it anymore. For example, we have Lelouch who HATES Rolo because he's not Nunnally and he intends to use Rolo and then kill him once he's outlived his usefulness. However, Rolo ends up kicking the bucket at some point and then apparently, Lelouch loved him like a brother all along even though there was no such interaction that went down between the two which would imply anything of the sort. Suzaku on the other hand ends up doing a complete 180 on his original characterisation. Remember that idealistic idiot who didn't realise he was killing his own people by being a rank-and-file soldier instead of becoming an idealistic politician trying to change the system from within? Well he was all like \"fuck that shit\" and only cares about the end result rather than the means used to achieve them. On the one hand, at least he acknowledges that he was being an idiot but on the other hand, that gets rid of the one trait of his I actually liked.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the plot twists, they just really got stupid after a while. I mean, the first season was flawed to high heaven but the plot twists still managed to get me on the edge of my seat until the mood was killed by Bulma, wait I mean Kallen. For example, we find out that Marianne (Lelouch's mother) didn't really die but she was alive all along. Right before she was about to die, she somehow developed a Geass that allowed her to transfer her soul into another body. I'm not making a single word of that up. Can you smell the contrivance anywhere in this whatsoever? Let's not forget how Charles apparently sent Lelouch and Nunnally so that they'd be safe or some bullshit like that (even fans of Code Geass can see the plot holes in this one) or how despite being a racist and cold-hearted jackass for 90% of the show's run, Charles was actually a good guy the entire time. Yeah, I don't buy a single lick of any of this. Oh, and that's not even getting into how Lelouch could apparently control GOD of all things with the sheer power of his own Geass.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, this show is amazing, right? It's so brilliantly written, so gripping and enthralling and it's a master of manipulating your emotions whilst keeping you on the edge of your seat for more! The characters are the best of their kind, and I wait for the day when common literature could even hope to push out characters as brilliant as Lelouch, Suzaku, and Rolo. Oh God, I couldn't type any of of that with a straight face. From a critical standpoint, Code Geass is BAD. There's no two ways around it, it's a bad series in general. This show really knows how to keep it real, real stupid that is. You know what though? All of this stuff combined isn't enough to dampen my enjoyment whatsoever. I mean, for all that Code Geass got wrong, it must've done *something* right along the way. How else could it have gotten so popular in the first place? A lot of the reasons why I enjoy this show are superficial in the first place. The mecha battles were enthralling (by my standards, anyway), Lelouch's hammy behaviour kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the dubbing across both the English and Japanese tracks was absolutely spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake: if you try to take this show seriously, you *will* hate it. The biggest reason why so many people adore Code Geass in the first place is because of the so-called \"rule of cool.\" Code Geass is one of those shows that just oozes awesomeness (well, by my standards anyway) and at some points, it had me cheering on all of the senseless stupidity just like I do whenever I'm watching Gurren Lagann (yeah, it really does get THAT dumb at some points). Code Geass is the functional equivalent of a Michael Bay movie in anime, except it actually gets some more stuff right that Michael Bay would otherwise get wrong. For one thing, it's actually entertaining to watch for a good ~65% of its run as opposed to the gut-wrenchingly appalling pacing that usually makes his movies painful to watch after the first hour (I'm looking at you, Age of Extinction!). Hell, even if you don't find this show cool in the slightest, you'd definitely have a fun time snarking at how stupid it gets. It would be hard NOT to find a reason to enjoy this programme to some marginal degree.\\n\\n\r\nNow where does this leave Code Geass? Well, I'm painfully aware of its shortcomings but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it. For what it's worth, Code Geass isn't a show that's average in the slightest. If it can evoke all kinds of of reactions out of people, it would only make sense for anyone to give this show a shot and see what they'd get out of it. Besides, it's good popcorn material if you're in the mood for something stupid that you can watch with friends while eating pizza. I mean, the uber elitists and hipsters here on MAL would beg to differ but this show ISN'T the worst thing to come out of humanity. That, my friends would be Kodomo no Jikan but that's another review for a different day. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

Did I mention it is over-hyped? Even for fanboys of this anime it must be over-hyped. With a fairly good story it tries to become a mecha version of Death Note and I suppose it succeeds to some extent, but not in a very intriguing manner really. The story has many twists and turns and it is quiteentertaining at times, but the story can't save this anime from its characters.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character of this anime is bad, not even Lelouch is any good most of the time. Mostly because he's so overplayed. However Lelouch is nothing compared to Kurkrurururugi Suzaku. I was on the verge of dropping this anime at each and ever episode, even while watching the very last episode, because of Kurukgukgururui Suzaku, he was not fabulous to say the least. Apart from these two characters the rest of them were no catches either, I don't really feel like going through a list of bad characters so I'm just going to generalize and say they were the usual generic stereotypical blobs on screen fresh from the \"generic steretypical anime character factory\" that they copy and paste into their storyboard.\\n\\n\r\nDid you notice the CLAMP influences? Of course you did, I don't have anything against CLAMP, they've done XXXholic, but really? CLAMP in a shounen? No.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this animes screenplay is an abomination, which leaves character interaction between the incredibly boring characters wanting in such a terrible manner that it drags this entire anime down.",

            "content": "Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is a yaoi mecha animu noted for its clever and original plot. It became the cancer of /a/ for the whole summer of 2008. The show was created when Pizza Hut, thinking they could get a bigger piece of the Japanese global market, began writing and producing what would eventually become a new anime that would include innovative and brand-new elements never seen before in the genre: giant robots, large-scale military invasions, heaps upon heaps of still-attractive bishie corpses and more tits than a Playboy shoot. These were all included in an effort to attract a wider audience. Theshow was largely subsidized by Japan, so the show also features a staggering amount of the bullshit post-war propaganda that Japan has so desperately tried to feed the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place in an alternative-history world where Japan has gotten pwned by the Holy Empire of Britannia thanks to the latter's giant rollerskate-wearing robots, which are clearly more effective than tanks and other conventional weapons\u2014an absurdity, as we see later on that rocket-launchers can fuck them up. Despite having killer-cool mecha (and lots of female military officers with e-size tits), Britannia is still just a bunch of British Francophone Nazis, who want to take over the world and do what Hitler would have done had he not put bullets in his head. And because the Japanese love them some historical revisionism almost as much as increasingly bizarre sex practices, they have taken great pains to ensure that no one notices that Britannia is doing everything the Japanese did to the Chinese during World War II. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch Lamperouge is the repulsively unlikable main character\u2014a pretentious bitch who lives his life in the lap of luxury, surrounded by beautiful women whom he has absolutely no attraction to. This self-indulgent lifestyle apparently is not enough for the spoiled aristocratic cunt, so for the sake of the plot (and nothing else) he one day wakes up with a terrible case of butthurt over the way the Japanese people are being treated. He enthusiastically joins up with the local Japanese revolutionaries, but because he didn't have an invitation he had to convince them that he was worthy. Reluctant to admit his sexual preferences, Lulu (his nickname\u2014as if you didn't think he was gay already) was suddenly accosted by a green-haired bitch everybody thought to be dead\u2014in doing so, he promptly receives unique paranormal superpowers called \"Geass\" (m0re liek \"Gayass\", amirite?). \\n\\n\r\nThings get needlessly complicated when it turns he's the son of the Emperor of Britannia himself, but because Lelouch is so noble and true to his word, he sallies forth to perform heroic acts for great justice against his father's evil political state. He does so with the pretentious insistence that he, a strategic genius, can never be defeated, despite getting his ass handed to him about every other episode. \\n\\n\r\nHis fianc\u00e9 is Suzaku Kururugi, a green-eyed, brown-haired Azn (because clearly Azns always have green eyes and brown hair) who has decided to join the Britannians because he firmly believes in his childhood ideals. Although the two are engaged to be married, they only fight when they're inside their Mechs because they don't know they're actually not enemies... kinda like another anime you may have seen. Lelouch declares himself the defender of justice, calling himself \"Zero,\" a name and number which the Japanese seem to have a weird fetish for. After creating the Black Knights as a kind of pathetic vigilante group, he starts to fight back against his own nation. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the course of the show (and again, for no particular reason), Lulu finds his awesomely hot sister Euphemia, who professes a pressing need for white and fluffy storyline development. Lulu objects, but after being offered to get into her sister's panties (no, srsly, there's that one episode where he says his sis was his first love) he readily reconsiders. The two of them gather a whole lot of people in a closed stadium surrounded by armed military men\u2014always an auspicious start for creating a \"white and fluffy world.\" While there, Euphemia asks Lulu to go to a dark backroom, where he accidentally her, causing the bitch to spontaneously go where Harry Truman pussed out and give some Japs the smackdown they so richly deserve. She grabs herself a gun and starts to party down like a pro. \\n\\n\r\nLulu, in order to hide the fact that he made such a colossal error, kills her, causing yet another needless character death (there are several in this anime and it's not even done by Gainax). Use the JewTube link to catch all the filthy action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JQ4sWzXPiA\\n\\n\r\nHe then proceeds to go on an epic rampage against the Britannians and doesn't afraid of anything. He raises a huge fucking army, and almost takes over Japan, before his army of inept morons goes down in spectacular failure and start to lose the second Lelouch leaves to go save his useless, whiny, blind, cripple loli sis. Lelouch's army apparently forgot there's a reason why Britannia controls 2/3rds of the world. \\n\\n\r\nWhen he arrives to the place he thought he'd find his worthless cunt of a sister, a challenger appears to start the decisive battle...and the WHOLE MOTHER FUCKING SEASON ENDS RIGHT THEN AND THERE. \\n",

            "content": "\"I was dead until the moment I met you. I was a powerless corpse pretending to be alive. Living without power, without the ability to change my course, was bound to a slow death.\" -Lelouch Lamperouge\r\nPreface: \r\nI've been debating a review of Code Geass for a while now, and I was really unsure of where to start, given how expansive the story is, and how immense the cast of characters is coupled with everything that I have to say about it. So, that said, this will be a two part review, one for Code Geass part one, and one for R2. \r\nOverview: \r\nLet me firstdispel the dismissive \"Code Geass is just Death Note with mechas\" saying: It's totally different. Similarities can be drawn between tons of shows in which supernatural powers are bestowed upon the main characters, along with their aspirations of changing the world. It's a sleight against this show to say that it's just a rip of Death Note, when in fact, they actually premiered the same season. \\n\r\nCode Geass is set very straight up- You've got Lelouch Lamperouge, an exiled member of the royal family of Britannia, out for revenge against his father, Charles, the Emperor of Britannia. Britannia being the greatest military power and empire since the days of Alexander the Great, Lelouch is powerless to take action against this seemingly insurmountable enemy, until a mysterious benefactor, a girl named C2, bestows the \"Power of the King\", otherwise known as Geass upon him, giving him the ability to finally wreak the vengeance he so desperately seeks. His power is one that enables him to give someone he can make eye contact with a single command that they must obey. With this, he's out to change the world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nQuick stuff first:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 (5 Animation, 2 Character design)\\n\\n\r\nCLAMP character design, and everything that comes along with it: skeletal bodied characters with enormous eyes and a lot of wild hair designs, but not Yugioh or anything. Sunrise did quite a good job animating this show, though. Juicy explosions, fluid fight scenes, and solid key frames. Character design consistency is very high quality throughout, with no loss of detail at any time. \\n\r\nThe mechas look great, and while many designs are reused for the no-name mechs, the named ones are pure awesome, very unique, and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (7 for Voice Acting, 2 for OP and ED)\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people really seem to hate the 2nd OP by Jinn, Kaidoku Funou, but I thought it was appropriately energetic for the rising action. The 1st OP and both ED are fine, nothing really interesting, but not worth skipping. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is on another level in this show: Johnny Yong Bosch leads an all star cast, with names like Yuri Lowenthal as Suzaku Kururugi, Michelle Ruff as Euphemia, Liam O\u2019Brien as the mad scientist Lloyd Asplund, Crispin Freeman as Jeremiah \"Orange Boy\", the great Megan Hollingshead as Viletta, and the Major herself, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as Cornelia, and others. \\n\r\nProps to Funimation for putting this incredible group of VA together. They really made the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nStory: 8 \\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to encompass and accurately describe the collective of characters in an ensemble show like Code Geass. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has a comparably large cast, who are also very intricately worked into the plot. So many characters make an impact that it'd be impossible to list all of their complex interactions with one another and on the plot itself in this review, so instead of Kicking Logic to the Curb and Doing the Impossible, I'm going to stick with the mains. \\n\\n\r\nTo best understand the characters, we need to first examine their dynamic. Our setup is as described above, a classic revenge tale, Son vs the Father. Lelouch, exiled after the death of his mother, Marianne, at the hands of Charles, flees and lives in secret among the once proud, now subjugated Japanese people, known as \"Elevens\". He and his younger sister Nunnally, who was crippled and blinded after the attack on their mother, are taken in by the family of Suzaku Kururugi, the best friend and ideological opposite of Lelouch. \\n\r\nYears later, Lelouch, in his guise as a bored high school student, gets wrapped up in a terrorist group operating in Area 11, known as the Black Knights, plot to steal a secret weapon away from Britannia. A series of mishaps later, and Lelouch finds out that the weapon is not inanimate, but a green haired, straightjacket wearing witch named C2. Lelouch sets her free, and she grants him a power, the power of Geass- the absolute control of another being, with the rules outlined above. \\n\\n\r\nThe dynamic between Lelouch and Suzaku is definitely the most interesting. As previously stated, they form not just a symbolic Friend/Brother against each other dynamic, but also one of an Anti Hero, Anti Villain. Both make some seriously morally ambiguous choices, both have their tortured past, struggles in the present, but most importantly; their goal for the future. This is what drives their ideological differences.\\n\\n\r\n\"A victory won through detestable means is no victory at all\" - Suzaku in a nutshell.\\n\r\n Suzaku is a hound of the military. He believes that change brought on by violence and conquest is wrong, and that the racist and oppressive Britannian government should be changed from within, his eventual goal to rise to a position of high military power and use it to influence the outcome of the future. Suzaku's strengths lie in his unwavering loyalty to his ideals, and his almost stupidly overpowered/unparalleled strength in combat, particularly that in mechs.\\n\r\n-- (interesting, in that he starts out as a common footsoldier, and is rescued by Lloyd to be a test subject for an experimental mech, which then turns his complete ignorance of mechs into a godly fighting machine. We'll chalk it up to untapped natural talent.)\\n\r\nSuzaku has a tendency to blindly follow his orders, believing it's for the good of his goals, and by proxy, the Japanese- so long as they're at least partly in line with his thoughts. He takes part in many questionable operations, and begins to have self doubt, which really shows the inner conflict in the character. Outwardly, he's always the knight of justice, but inwardly, he has his own darkness, and doubts about whether what he's doing is right or wrong.\\n\r\nSuzaku is easy to hate at the beginning, for being so foolhardy and unflinchingly loyal, uncompromising. However, he shows a true hero's arc, and improves vastly in R2.\\n\\n\r\n\"A life that lives without doing anything is the same as a slow death.\"\\n\\n\r\nLelouch, on the other hand; new powers in hand (eye) is finally equipped to fulfill his dual goals of revenge against his father and his idea of world peace, so that Nunnally can live in a kinder, gentler world. Where they differ is in the methodology. Lelouch plays at rebellion like a game of chess, (symbolism intact). The very image of Zero is that of the king piece in chess, (C2's uniform in R2 is also the image of the queen) and while not the strongest piece, is definitely the most important. Lelouch knows his limitations; namely the physical, and fighting hand to hand. He knows that his intellect and Geass power are his best means of fighting, and uses them to set up and manipulate everyone around him, much to the chagrin of Suzaku. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch may use manipulation, murder, and other detestable methods to achieve his goals, but he's the absolute definition of the Anti Hero. Noble goals taking ambiguously evil or callous means of fulfillment. Despite his cold, calculating Zero personality, or his ever scheming \"normal\" identity, Lelouch has nothing if not a noble goal in mind- everything he's done, his Raison D'etre is his sister, Nunnally. His life is unimportant in the face of making the world a place that his sister can live in without constant fear for her life. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the antagonistic relationship that Lelouch and Suzaku share is as thusly: they serve as foils to each other, the White Knight with the dark past, and the Black King who looks to a bright future. An eternal struggle of brother against brother, friend against friend, and an intense underlying conflict of ideals vs the facade of an outwardly friendly relationship. Cat and Mouse, but who's which?\\n\\n\r\nThe many other characters in the show form a true ensemble, as I said. Screen time is split up very appropriately between the many different threads of the story, keeping parts in suspense when necessary, and most importantly: keeping all the different plotlines up to date where you're not constantly having to keep up with \"What year is this?\" \"Is this the past or present?\u201d For as many subplots as are going on screen in a single episode, Code Geass manages to stay on top of them, keep them relevant, and important to the outcome of the story. The supporting cast has as many scenes as many \"main\" characters from other, lesser shows. They get their fair share of the time, and the story never felt weaker for it. \\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers from here on*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is a very watchable and engaging series, for the most part. It is one of those stories though, that ends up being a jack of all trades and a master of none with how it tries to fit in a lot of themes, with some success and some failure. What I did not like about Code Geass was namely three things: inner universe inconsistency (which I'll get into), tonal inconsistency, and lastly, the fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass has a great setup for a gripping plot, and a lot of fodder to work with. It takes its time explaining many concepts, and never felt rushed, at all. However, there are some obvious filler episodes (giant pizza anyone?) and some plotholes (some of which are patched up in R2, but that has no bearing here.)\\n\\n\r\n1. Inner Universe Inconsistency\\n\r\n--The Geass power is explained to have these rules: \\n\r\nA) Can only be used once\\n\r\nB) Eye contact required\\n\r\nC) Person having Geass used on them will perform *to the best of their abilities/physical capabilities the command issued**\\n\r\nD) The order will be carried out as long as dictated\\n\r\nE) The subject loses all memory of actions carried out under the effects of Geass\\n\r\nFinally, F) No one can resist his command, but someone can resist Geass by sheer force of will... (When convenient to the plot)\\n\\n\r\nR2 aside, Rule A stands. Rules B and D are also always true. The issues arise with rules C, E and F.\\n\r\nThe writers played fast and loose with the rules of Geass, bending it to their will when they've written themselves into a corner. Geass comes across as Deus ex Machina in many moments in the first series, and while a cool power, it's sometimes cheapened by its misuse or obvious \"why didn't you just use Geass to do 'x'?\"\\n\r\n2. Tonal Inconsistency\\n\r\n--All throughout Code Geass, we're treated to a lot of different themes and ideologies. This often comes out as a mish mash of conflicting ideas at inopportune moments. There will be a dark war drama going on, with characters dealing with loss of life, regret, ambivalence about the choices they made and how it affects the future, from victorious highs to the crushing blows of defeat, it swings appropriately. However, interspersed with this gritty narrative will be scenes (or entire episodes) of light hearted comedy bordering on a slice of life tangent. We just went from watching people get brutally mowed down by the hundreds to some schoolkids at a festival with a giant pizza mishap. Alternate comedy with some fanservice moments (Kallen, Viletta) and it really breaks up the pacing and more importantly, atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\n3. Fanservice\\n\r\n--Plain and simple, they really beat you over the head with Kallen and Viletta's bodies. Compromising situations, poses, and just really sexually suggestive scenes. I felt they were very unnecessary in an otherwise very serious drama because they didn't add anything to the plot; detracted from it, minorly, because it was harder to take it seriously when they arose during tense and dramatic moments. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass was both a real joy and really infuriating to watch. Chalk that up to how it was written, maybe, but overall it's a \"good\" show. This season really amounts to a 10.5 hour long exposition and setup for R2, the more emotionally charged, and consequence-filled half of what's a really great story.\\n\\n\r\n+Great MC\\n\r\n+Good supporting cast\\n\r\n+Very entertaining, keeps you guessing\\n\r\n+Voice Cast is among the best\\n\r\n+Great Anti hero/ Anti villain dynamic\\n\r\n+Detestable villains\\n\\n\r\n+/- couple of filler episodes\\n\\n\r\n- Plot holes (some are not apparent until R2)\\n\r\n- Annoying side characters\\n\r\n- Unnecessary fanservice\\n\r\n- Tonal inconsistency\\n\r\n- Inner universe inconsistency\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\r\nYes, I would recommend Code Geass. R2 is by far the stronger part, but part 1 is very enjoyable on its own, and necessary to the overarching story.\\n",

            "content": "Death Note meets Gundam Wing. Nonetheless, the fusion between the two animes can only underestimate the greatness that is Code Geass. Yes, this series is jammed-packed with attractive characters, battle scenes, bloodshed, slight romance, and even a little supernatural dose to add to a stereotypical anime. However, Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion is not as stereotypical as it may seemed at first glance.\r\n~[S T O R Y]~ [9]\r\nInitially, I became attracted to the series through the hyperactive fandom that has spread vastly throughout the world of the internet. Only then did I realize that I could not longer resist watching this show. Indeed,I had my doubts that it would've been a lame rip off of Death Note meets Gundam Wing. Little did I know how wrong I was. A conspiracy between governments, rebellion and anarchy, advanced technology that may be deemed impossible to ever exist in our world, the raw emotion that bounces from one character to another, a small dosage of supernaturality that does little to ruin the storyplot...Code Geass has done well. Breathtaking twists are evident in the series to an extent where the viewer can be grateful that no supernatural assistance was needed. The story flowed as smooth as water. There was not one moment where I felt bored or even regretted watching the series. Even the use of chess metaphors and mythological analogies made the storyplot more interesting. Indeed the show was nothing but a game. Everyone was played. The characters, the world...even the viewers' minds were played! But that was what made Code Geass interesting. It kept us guessing on purpose, like we were part of the game all along!\\n\\n\r\n~[A R T]~ [8]\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I did not give the Art section the same mark as the other categories was the opening theme. It literally used the same animation profusely except it just switched the order of clips around. Every other manga at least alters the opening theme thoroughly until it does not meet its previous ones. But the opening theme appeared as though it were low-budget, like the creators were procrastinating on changing the opening theme a few times and decided to alter it a little by adding in new clips which introduced new characters we would be acquainted with later on in the series. Other than that, everything else about the art was quite intriguing. The paintings in the museum were a little ostentious but in a nice, presentable manner. The essence of CLAMP was illuminated in the character designs, but it did not change the great appeal of each character's personality. The emotions expressed were drawn well. You could taste the insanity radiating off of Nina's face and the hatred off of Suzaku's face. Well done indeed.\\n\\n\r\n~[S O U N D]~ [9]\\n\\n\r\nThe scores for the anime's soundtrack was fitting for every scene. We could slight feel the suspense, the nostalgia, and even the burning hatred through the music selected on different scenes of the show. The action sounds were not cheesy. The dramatic sounds were ones to not laugh at. Truly the musical scores lived up to the rank I have given them.\\n\\n\r\n~[C H A R A C T E R]~ [9]\\n\\n\r\nIt's understandable how attractive protagonists would surely attract more fans. But I did not fall under Lelouch's apparent spell. Yet I can say that I was bewitched by his hunger for superiority, not to mention locked in the mystery of his past and his intentions. A young, masked vigilante holding the fate of Britannia and Japan in the palm of his hand? It may sound overrated, but his techniques cannot be explained in words. All of the characters left my mind boggled: how do they feel about this situation? what are they going to do? Throughout the series, it felt as though I was able to understand every character and his or her motive. Furthermore, the dramatic scenes displaying the raw emotion reciprocated between different characters was surely not ones to miss. The development was beautifully done. At times even a viewer can sense the vulnerability, the cravings, the sorrow, and the power to know and conquer in each and every character. I applaud with joy.\\n\\n\r\n~[E N J O Y M E N T  &amp;  O V E R A L L]~ [9]\\n\\n\r\nThis series should not be underestimated. Do not judge a book by its cover here. The only way an anime like this could be altered is through the observation of biased fandoms. Before reading reviews or hearing the opinions of others, be sure to examine the series first before considering anything else. For I assure you reader that, unless you prefer some ecchi delight or dull storylines, you won't be disappointed. This series teaches a valuable lesson: that we live to fight for something, and how we fight gives everyone around us a sense of who we are. So be careful what you fight for, for you will be one's hero and another's enemy. :]",

            "content": "STORY: Code Geass is a story about just/unjust war, the aftermath, peace, and pride. There is great content here with multiple levels of conflict, making the process of deciding right and wrong very difficult. The plot lines are complex, easily drawing the viewer into this fictional world. While the story is not tangibly realistic, the show is quite convincing and alluring. With Code Geass the plot material is serious and demanding. Silliness, fun times, and character development are required and acceptable as long as they remain within the established context. At times the story-telling of Code Geass steps out of its theme, and the flowof the solid story loses impetus and direction in uncharacteristic light-heartedness. The show is then thrust back to its original course which can be jarring. The negative effects of this shift result in a loss of the strong conviction by which the show is driven. Also, this series is not finished, and the end is a huge slam on the brakes. I do not consider the abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion to the 25 episode season to be detrimental, but the end will leave you craving more. Besides the occasional sharp, awkward shift in the plot dialect, the story of Code Geass is fantastic and one of the best of the 2006-2007 season.\\n\\n\r\nART: Sunrise is one the oldest and most reputable animation production companies in Japan, and they have no problems upholding their reputation with Code Geass. Although it's not the best I've ever seen, the animation is very good. At no point is the art direction bad or frown worthy. Mecha fights are convincing enough, dramatic scenes are illustrated well with emotion in mind, and filler scenes don't fall below the established visual standard. The animation is very good, but, more importantly, the animation is consistently good.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The voice acting is okay. Some of the voice actors blew me away, especially Suzaku's. Some of the actors left me feeling a little soapy with opera, especially Leuloch's. At times important lines, ones meant to finish a powerful scene with conviction, fall short of their mark. However, the voice acting is situational. Sometimes Leuloch's voice actor convinced me to the fullest. At other times the voice actor made me roll my eyes and laugh.  The sound effects are decent, and the music is good at getting the audience interested. However, the soundtrack here does not take command of the epic saga, and there are no moments where the music capitalizes on a scene. The audio aspect of Code Geass is sometimes hit or miss, and the audio is always runner-up to the other facets of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: There are tons of characters in Code Geass, and the show does an exceptional job of trying to involve each and every one of them. Even among the farfetched fantasy of the show, the characters felt unnervingly human and real. Amongst the diverse multitude of characters, there are complex characters being developed through genuine, deep emotions. And then there are the characters who are well developed but not deep. These characters seem out of place like infants among giants. Whenever these normal characters are on screen, the show drops the ball and begins to feel out of place. The screen time was a little too divided between the true characters and the cookie cutter characters. The true characters of the show sold the story and are arguably the strongest element of the show. I just wish they received more time and focus.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Code Geass is compelling, complex, and convicting, and the final product leaves your heart pounding with tension and suspense. While the experience is very entertaining and enjoyable, Code Geass is dark. As the characters make decisions with massive consequences, the vast amount of emotional weight of the show can easily affect the viewer. The show is fun to watch and equally difficult to watch. As previously stated in the story section, the show does not do a good job of providing light-heartedness and release from the stress. Thus, the peaceful and happy scenes feel forced and out of place at times. Still, Code Geass is entertaining and involving.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Code Geass is an intelligent and provocative, war-time, think piece. The production has flaws but is still great, and the final product is much greater than the show's parts.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review has been beneficial. All feedback, critiques, and comments are appreciated and well accepted through messages. Happy anime watching!",

            "content": "Title: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion\r\nManga, Light Novel, Anime: Code Geass has, at this point in time, three manga spin-offs to its name, all being serialized in Kadokawa Shoten magazines.  The first, with the same title as the anime (Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion) focuses on Lelouch and more or less follows the series, with art by Majiko!, and began being serialized in Montly Asuka magazine in the Octpober 2006 issue.  The second, known as Code Geass: Suzaku of the Counterattack, focuses on Suzaku's part of the story, with art done by Atsuro Yomino, and is being serialized in Beans Amagazine.  The third, Code Geass: Knightmare of Nanally, focuses on Nanally's part of the story, with art done by Tomomasa Takuma.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a series of light novels that follows the series' plot that began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Sneaker magazine on April 28th, 2007.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is a twenty-five episode series that was produced by Sunrise (famous for their work on the Gundam series and Cowboy Bebop) and directed by Goro Taniguchi (famous for his work on Planetes and s-CRY-ed).  It ran on Japanese TV from October 5th, 2006 to July 28th, 2007, and has been licensed Stateside by Bandai.  Bandai has yet to release a date for its DVD release, but the dub will be airing on Adult Swim starting on April 26th (next Saturday!).\\n\\n\r\nStory: On August 10th, 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia invaded Japan and conquered the country in less than a month with their mechs, known as Knightmare Frames.  Japan, renamed &quot;Area 11&quot;, was colonized, and the Japanese, now known as &quot;Elevens&quot;, were made to live in ghettos while the Britannians live in upper-class walled-off settlements.  Lelouch, then ten years old, swears to his friend Suzaku that some day, he will destroy the Britannian empire.  \\n\\n\r\nSeven years later, Lelouch is going to school at a private Britannian academy, known as Ashford Acadmey, and Suzaku's joined the Britannian army as an honorary Britannian.  One day, Lelouch gets caught up with terrorists escaping with a military secret, and Suzaku is part of the squad sent to capture the terrorists.  When Suzaku insists that Lelouch isn't one of the terrorists, he is shot for disobedience, and in the chaos that follows, the military secret is revealed to be a young girl named CC (or C Two), who contracts with Lelouch and gives him a power known as Geass, more specifically, the power to make anyone do anything he says just by looking them in the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch decides to bring Britannia down using his Geass, while Suzaku decides to attempt to change Britannia from the inside.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good, solid series.  The set up's a bit like Death Note, in which we've got a guy in high school using the powers he's received to change the world (Lelouch), and there's someone opposing him and his ideals (in this case, Suzaku).  It's also like V for Vendetta, in that we've got Lelouch leading a rebellion against Britannia as the masked Zero.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series ends up being a neat juxtaposition of politics, mech action, plotting, rebellion, and school life.  And it's like Toward the Terra, in that a lot of the side characters are developed more than they would be in most series, are pretty intriguing, and end up playing major roles in the plot.  The plot progresses pretty nicely, with Lelouch figuring out how his powers work and building up his power and followers and attacks on Britannia, with a few calm-before-the-storm episodes that end up bringing some of the more awesome revelations, plenty of plot twists tossed in, all bought to a boil in the last few episodes, leaving off with that cliff hanger of cliff hangers.\\n\\n\r\nTaniguchi weaves in little homages from the other series he's directed, so if you've seen his other series, watch and see what you can find.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not without it's problems, though.\\n\\n\r\nFirst thing you'll probably notice is the rampant jingoism.  It's probably a bit more apparent to me, because I'm in an class about the ethnography of Japan, and we just finished a section on WWII, but, still, you'll notice a lot of BANZAI NIPPON! in the first few episodes.  For example, the date that Britannia (which, if you look at the bit before the OP, is, in fact, America) invades Japan is the day that Japan surrendered at the end of WWII.  It does get less noticeable as the series goes along, but you can still tell it's there.\\n\\n\r\nThe second fact is that the series brings up a lot of mysteries and doesn't really answer them, a la Rozen Maiden and Romeo and Juliet.  But at least they don't try and clumsily resolve things like in Nishi no Yoki Majo or Darker than BLACK.  Admittedly, there is a second season that just started airing in Japan about two weeks ago, so hopefully they can address those issues.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation for this is really smooth, not to mention vibrantly colored.  The action scenes are fully animated, as are the explosions and such, which is nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell straight off the bat that Clamp does the character designs because the men are a bit pointy and lanky.  But once they're introduced, they get a bit less pointy, which makes the lankiness work out better.  And, of course, the females are absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSunrise's mech designs do admittedly look a bit like Gundams, and a bit on the bulky side rather than streamlined but, for the mecha I've seen in anime (which, admittedly, isn't that much), they're pretty neat.\\n\\n\r\nThere's some stock footage for when Lelouch uses the Geass, and a bit of recap at the beginning before the OP, but, luckily, it's well-done and doesn't get too old.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: I like the music for this a lot.  There are some pretty basic themes and styles for specific people and things that happen, but there end up being a lot of well-done variations.  The insert songs that they do don't take away from the scene, but fit in perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I liked the OPs and EDs for this.  The first (and, incidentally, the third ED) and third OP are your standard pop numbers, but they're really catchy.  The first ED is an ALI Project song, which, in my opinion, guarantees awesomeness.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the vocalists for the second OP and ED (whether or not they're the same, I'm not sure) need to be strangled.  They're worse than the harpy woman who did the Honey and Clover OPs, and that's saying something.  They gave me headaches.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: The seiyuu for this project are made of awesome on several levels.  Jun Fukuyama, who played the naive innocent Albert in Gankutsuou, gets to play the scheming jaded Lelouch, and it's particularly nice to see the role reversal there.  Kikuko Inoue, who played Mercedes in Gankutsuou, appears in a small, but important, supporting role, as do Jouji Nakata and Fumiko Orikasa.  Also, Suzaku's seiyuu may sound familiar, mainly because he's been voicing Cloud in the recent FFVII spinoffs.\\n\\n\r\nThe only seiyuu who really annoyed me was Lloyd's seiyuu, but then again, he's meant to come off as annoying.  They did their job there.  xD\\n\\n\r\nLength: Had they done some slight reworking of the plot, they probably could have made this a twenty-five episode series.  However, the story would've taken a hit if they had.  The second season, which, as I mentioned before, just recently started airing, should hopefully bring a sense of completeness to the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A beautifully designed and animated show, with excellent music and seiyuu, and a very solid plot, save for the jingoism and unsolved mysteries, which will hopefully be solved by the next season.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9/10\\n\r\nLength: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 43/50; 86% (B )",

            "content": "I'm here to talk about the both seasons of Code Geass. I don\u00b4t want to make 2 reviews about it so i will do as i did with Clannad. \r\nCode Geass .. one of the best rated animes here on MAL .. for sure it deserves it ! \r\nStory: (9/10). It is a complex story, usually or this go terribly wrong, or goes extremely well. It depend if it gets confuse or not. This story starts to be a normal one, but then with some twists we get lost for some time until we figure everything out at the end. The plot is original andcreative. It is about world domination and one of the new colonies named 11 starting a huge rebellion for freedom(and ofc this one it had to be Japan). The leader of the Rebellion is Lelouch, our main character. \\n\\n\r\nI found the plot nice, but this is a progressive anime, gets better with the time. So at the beginning, it may seem boring, and it is but don\u00b4t give up, it is worth to watch. Then after the 8th episode, things starts to get hot :D. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime talks about a lot of shit.. really it talks about a lot of themes from love to immortality. From world domination and how is it like to lose our rights as a nation, to what happens when some one gets sick of revenge and power. I can\u00b4t tell you more otherwise i would be spoiling but you get the point. It is really interesting to watch this show.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is fluent at some point (when it doesn't get confuse). It is solid and I found no plot holes here. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10). The character design is pretty normal. The characters are solid and have a peculiar shape (all look pretty skinny and tall) and we have really different looks between the characters. The anime is really coloured and the machines (this anime is a mecha anime) are really well designed. The detail is outrageous. The action here gets super nice due to the detail ! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10). This is the thing here ! For me the best aspect to see in this anime. We have C2, Lelouch and Suzaku taking the first place as the main characters. While C2 is a mistery until the end, Suzaku and Lelouch have their development since the first episode. While Lelouch suffers a transformation due to his power (geass), Suzaku suffers as well a transformation. He is a japanse who joined the Britannia army(Britannia were the ones who conquered Japan and named it \"11\". So he basically is fighting with his enemy). The anime gets good because of this. The interaction between them 2 and their development is really interesting. They were friends since childhood and now they are like enemys (because Lelouch  is the one who is fighting against Britannia while Suzaku is the one who tries to stop the rebellion). So having these 2 main characters makes the plot much more fun rather then just huge machines destroying each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are pretty as usual as in the other animes. In general, i found them to be really realistic which is rare. But some of them make quetionable choices... he/she would really do that?  ~\\n\\n\r\nHere we have everything. Normal characters, super strong ones, super weak ones, and those characters that we just can\u00b4t know what they are. If they are bad or good, if they are strong or weak. This gives some kind of mistery around them and it is something that at least for me it was nice. \\n\\n\r\nSo basically, there is a huge variety of characters here, that's why i belive it is the best point here to be considered. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10). We have 2 good openings, while the other 2 suck. But when we have such nice OST no one cares about the openings. Lelouch as a leader of the rebellion, he often makes inspiring speeches and the OST that they use for it it is just epic :D. Not just here, throughout the entire show we see nice OST in pretty much everything. In the romance, in the drama, in the action.. and then we have that finnal OST that almost made me cry :D. So the sound in general has a nice effect on the show, makes it look better. So does what it is suposed to do ( making the scenes better) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10) I did not give 10 because for me, the 10 would be an anime which all episodes were fun or cool to watch. Such thing does not happens here. As i said, sometimes the plot gets nasty and we can get confused, and the first part of the show is just too boring compared to the rest. But besides that, it make me hooked. The consistent plot twist and the development of the plot was so nice. It also has a nice drama and a litle bit of romance. It is a litle, but it is good !. Plus seeing the huge machines (by they way the are called \"knightmare\") fighting is really epic. Some fights are even better than the fights in some shonens.  \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is one of those anime that i will never forget... With this end and this characters, it makes it really unique. Unlike some other animes that can be good but are normal. This one is good and not normal so it becames memorable! \\n\\n\r\nAbout the end? One of the best i've ever seen. It has everything to be a good end. They give an end but at the same time, we can chose our own end and get happy with it. So i think it would be hard for anyone to dislike this anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has everything to be a good anime and that's why it is so known and so well rated. This anime also has a lot of psychological fights so if you liked Death Note you will problably like this one to. If you never saw something like this, well give it a try. It happens that having a super inteligent guy taking controll of an entire army at the age of 17 is really epic xD.",

            "content": "Code Geass- Hangyaku no Lelouch is definitely one of my favorites yet I found the most difficult to review because of its complexity. \r\nStory (9/10)\r\nFans' first impression: Gundam + Deathnote= Code Geass. That opinion was normal and may somehow be correct but it is definitely not an acceptable conclusion: the story is a beautiful mix of mecha, school life and epic soap opera. Code Geass may have some familiar elements and some may think \"ah, i know this type\" but when one gets absorbed in the plot; he/she will find a very unique anime with surprising twists:\r\nThe unique thing I find in this series itsvery hard to categorize: on the outer surface it is called mecha but the robots and their pilots' endeavors are not mainly the ones that make the story progress, they are just players of the game not the rules. CG is has exciting action scenes but the ones that really thrilled me are the: psychological and tactic's clashes, character development and choices and their interaction with other characters, who the good or bad guy really is and many mysteries being revealed one by one or further mystified.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has lots of irony yet like a fruit salad; different ingredients and tastes good altogether and still distinguishable, the story is very well focused on one point though it has a lot of attributes. An idealistic and righteous but selfish and hypocritical view battles with a realistic, practical but dark and personal goal. In these brain popping thoughts, humor, sarcasm and teenage drama is added together with politics and racial conflict. Here humanism is a tasty ingredient present in every side growing within every tragedy and angst.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, the animation is super consistent, high definition and vivid. The machines are so cool and effects like explosion, sparks and water movements are satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nClamp has made a wonderful job designing the animation. But if one's not fond of thin characters and pretty boys, animation may be not too satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nArt, not only animation, in this series in my opinion is innovative; classic and modern concepts are also used. The one thing noticeable in this series is the outfits; they are post-modern European inspired yet manipulated into pilot suits, uniform(both in military and school) and casual wear into \"anime\" fashion (with Japanese preferences). At first I thought that the \"vampire cape\" and \"mask\" is kinda dorky showing a classic evil and mysterious appearance but I eventually loved it, not to mention the minions' \"evil\" but cool appearance too (which are actually good guys) \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThough I like some tracks, I was not impressed by the opening and ending themes except \"Colors\". Sometimes they destroyed the mood or annoy me. Nevertheless the background music still give the right mood: Insert songs are well placed and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters strongly inspire both love and haterd; some are very unique while some are ordinary. That composition is helpful because too many complex characters will make the plot confusing and unfocused. Though one can say that not all characters are exceptional; their interactions are full of twists and developments! CG featured well some much more complex new tastes in anime characters:\\n\\n\r\n               a dark, byronic main character that is insanely smart and good-looking that needs gym classes\\n\r\n               a good, kind guy who is the greatest mockery of the concept of heroism\\n\r\n               a mysterious, sexy green haired lead heroine that probably knows and understands more things than any of the characters\\n\\n\r\nTheir characters deepens as the series progresses and they are meticulously designed in way that they are both the protagonists and the antagonists of the series, both hero and anti-hero or both villain and anti-villain.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the themes, I personally think that they are action and thrill on the surface,yet deep down, it is back boned in simple human desires, ambitions, frustrations and opinions. Nevertheless, this series is definitely not depressing, not deep as deep as the ocean that ordinary viewers will not even understand the story and I found that it contains weirdness both in humor, drama and tragedy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Personal Response and Overall:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this one, very addictive and offers a lot of mystery. I found the main characters very likable especially Lelouch the main character. I found it really cool.\\n\r\nAlso, this story as a whole is not yet finished, it has a direct sequel: Code Geass r2.\\n\\n\r\nI don't recommend this anime to grade-schoolers because it the story and visual interpretation shows a lot of controversial and violent things and may not answer the question \"What's the moral lesson?\"\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n",

            "content": "The following is a review for Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion as well as it's second season R2.  Enjoy!\r\nImportant Notes:\r\n\tBefore we get into the actual review, I believe a quick bit of back story is important.  Code Geass was first conceptualized at Sunrise Animation in hopes to create a show that would appeal to a wide range of audiences.  The idea originally only entailed a underground resistance leader leading a double life.  The idea was then given to the manga author team of Clamp for character designs, (both physical and portions of other aspects as well) a partnership which continuedthrough the writing process meaning many of the stories intricacies were also written with assistance from Clamp.  The idea was to cover the two largest demographics: Shonen (action and generally story based targeted at young males) and Shojo (relationship based normally set in more everyday scenarios).  The question is, were they successful?  Well, yes and no.  The problem is that if you swap between the main character's everyday life and his secret life at the drop of a hat with little in between, one party is usually unhappy.  There are entire episodes based on dating games and creating the world's largest pizza that barely contribute anything to the story.  They are immediately followed by two episode long battles in mech suits that get rather monotonous pretty fast.  Compare that to a show that, in my experiences, does appeal to almost every audience like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.  Brotherhood keeps the battles much shorter while keeping a ton of relationship and character development, and all of it is integrated together rather seamlessly to have everyone on their toes.  Compare that to the separated method which has a tendency to give the viewer minor whip lash.  What does save Code Geass is occasional episodes where everything collapses and the two worlds collide pretty beautifully.  Now that we have that out of the way, to the story!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n\tCode Geass has an enjoyably complicated story so if you're looking for something to watch while doing other things it might not be the best choice, but hey, a better choice than Baccano!  It features very few all out filler episodes, every episode has something that furthers the plot or some amount of character development no matter how small, (except maybe the dating game episode, I can see what was supposed to be character development but... yeah not really).  The only real story problem is that at times it seems like it could have ended right there but trust me everything happens for a reason and those who stick with it shall be rewarded eventually.  Well that was short, but I don't want to give anything away so let's just move on to characters.  \t\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n\tThe fascinating thing about Code Geass's characters is that none of the \"good guys\" are particularly likeable, yet you grow to care for everyone anyway.  Our protagonist, Lalouch Vi Britannia, is a manipulative liar who tells us that the ends always justify the means.  Most of his school friends are, in my opinion, annoying, his little sister has a terrible voice and makes me cringe rather than daw, and the only character who acts entirely \"good\" is Suzaku, and he is the one character I didn't really grow to care for!  The Britannians on the other hand had several great characters who I loved despite their \"evil\" actions.  One thing Code Geass does amazingly well is kill people.  Sorry I had to be the one to tell you but you were going to find out eventually and, this is war, come on.  By the end you realize that your favorite characters are dead and aren't coming back and you honestly feel the same despair that the surviving characters do.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound:\\n\r\n\tLet's talk music.  At the beginning the background music is an awesome flavor of weird.  Odd moments in the eyes of the protagonists are highlighted by that sad trumpet.  I love that sad trumpet.  As the story progresses though sad trumpet leaves us and other than a few quick return visits to say hello and goodbye, doesn't really come back.  Other than that the background music is pretty average quality and is made mostly to emphasize the intensity of situations and regality of it all.  The opening and closing music varies VASTLY.  I loved some of the songs particularly those by FLOW and Ali Project then they are immediately followed by the second opening which I watched several times to be sure I wasn't making a snap decision but no, it's just bad.  I'm just going to combine the voice acting section in right here.  Decent.  Some characters were good.  Some were close to great!  But some were just bad.  Nunnaly is the number one culprit in my opinion.  I will never forget her unique and ear-bleeding inducing way of saying \"le-loooosh\" no matter how much I try.  On the brighter end though, without too much bias, Luciano Bradley in R2 is one of my favorite Vic Mignogna roles, Johnny Young Bosch does his usual thing for Lelouch which I guess is cool, Euphemia and Cornelia were very fitting, and last actor of mention is Troy Baker as Schnizel which is as amazing and regal as every Troy Baker role. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n\tOkay now just art and a quick conclusion, almost there.  The art style is quite unique and was made to mimic the original character designs by Clamp although it takes their drawing style to a new level.  Drawing quirks well known from works like Cardcaptor Sakura such as high shoulders, thin bodies, and incredible height, are extended to an odd level that every once in awhile makes you notice: \"Oh yeah, that's super not accurate to life... that's weird.  How does that work?\"  but it is quite well done and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n\tWell over all Code Geass is very good, it isn't perfect but nothing really is.  No matter if you prefer Shonen or Shojo or even if you're more like me and prefer something more moderate and balanced, if you can sit through the parts you don't like, you'll be pleased with the end result.  Tears will be shed, trust me on that.  I sadly had several deaths accidentally spoiled for me and told myself that I would not cry because I didn't even like that character anyway and then slowly lost my resolve.  Well thank you for reading and I hope my opinions were helpful to you.  If you can see anything I missed or misreported please let me know.  Bye for now!  \\n",

            "content": "I had high hopes for this show, and it certainly delivered.\r\nFirst off, the story; In 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia -which rules about a third of the world- decided to invade Japan, the Japanese resistance didn't last long against Britannia's new fighting robots, the Knight-mares. After adding the country to its territories, it was renamed Area 11, with its citizens dubbed 'Elevens'. Now after all of this, the protagonist, Lelouch, vows to destroy Britannia. 7 years later, he gets caught up in a terrorist attack and the mysterious girl C.C. grants him the power of 'Geass', the ability to make anyone obey your order.Using that power, Lelouch adopts the identity of Zero -a masked rebel- and sets off to destroy Britannia and free Japan from its clutches, with his primary goal -other than defeating Britannia- being the protection of his little sister, Nunally.\\n\r\nSome people may be skeptical about the art style, but I find it beautiful. The credit for the character design goes to the manga group 'Clamp', I personally never watched or read anything from them, but CG looks marvelous and I have to give them credit for the amazing work that they've done on the characters' designs.\\n\r\nFrom there we get to the sound and music, and I don't really have much to say on this except for, go listen to the first opening. The music of the show does a good job immersing you in the show, through all moments, from an action scene to a flashback to a character death to... pizza?\\n\r\nThe characters vary from 'I'll kill myself if you die' to 'Hurry up and die'. Reasonable Lelouch and retarded (for lack of a better word) Suzaku, Poor table-kun and *cough* PERVERTED, CRAZY, PSYCHO AND OVERLY ATTACHED NINA.\\n\r\nOverall, the enjoyment I got from this show was great, and it's definitely worth your time. So if you haven't watched it, then you should",

            "content": "Code Geass. That's surely an anime most anime watchers have at least heard about. Some consider it amazing and some consider it overrated. But maybe it's a little bit of both?\r\nStory: 9. The story revolves around Lelouch Vi Britannia, an intelligent exiled prince with a sister complex and some daddy issues. In the Code Geass world, Britannia (we all know it's Britain) has taken over 1/3 the world, including Japan, and renaming it Area 11. Lelouch is an exiled prince of Britannia with a dead mother and a crippled sister. He swears vengeance on his father after he banished Lelouch and his little sister, Nunnallyto Japan. One day, when caught up in a terrorist attack by some Japanese (Elevens) rebels he meets a mysterious young woman named C.C who grants him a power. Geass, the power of absolute control over anyone (except her lol). With this power and his intellect, he vows to take down Britannia, and create a gentle world where his little sister can be happy. He dons the persona of a masked figure called Zero and manipulates some Japanese into thinking he's doing it to save Japan, while using his Geass and intelligence to win battles against Britannia (though he doesn't win all of them).\\n\r\nNow the universe of Code Geass is quite original, but it doesn't sound that special. Well, the story is not exactly Code Geass's strong point. And for the love of God, it's NOT a Death Note copy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. The art is solid, with CLAMP's lanky characters and pointy chins. Even though I'm not a mecha fan (CG has mecha but it's not a mecha anime like let's say Gundam), I can appreciate the good animation and designs of the robots. Also, animation when the characters are like walking and small stuff like that is pretty great too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:9. Code Geass has a good OST. While most of the OP and ED aren't that memorable the background music that play during the show are usually quite good, from music for sad scenes to battle music. I find myself even personally downloading some of them, such as Deeply Fast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10. Ah, the characters.... Where do I begin? We have Lelouch Lamperouge (A.K.A Lelouch Vi Britannia) the hero of the show. Er...well, sort of. He's more like the byronic hero actually or the anti-hero. These are typically the reasons people compare him to Light Yagami of Death Note and they're both also highly intelligent, but unlike Light, Lelouch has morals, and a sense of compassion. And even when he does some pretty immoral stuff (like blowing up some soldiers and making it look like suicide) you can't help but cheer for him. It's odd, but there's something so charismatic and charming about him that you just want him to win!\\n\\n\r\nBut surprisingly, Lelouch doesn't overshadow the rest of the cast. You have C.C the mysterious, immortal and sarcastic girl (actually over 500 years old) who gave Lelouch his Geass. Everything she spoke I hung onto her every word. We have Kallen, the kick-ass, fanservice girl in the show, and Nunnally, the crippled little sister you have to feel bad for.\\n\\n\r\nOh wait, I'm forgetting Suzaku, Lelouch's former best friend. Suzaku has very similar goals as Lelouch's, (to stop the oppression of the Elevens and create a better world) but a very different way of going about them. Suzaku and Lelouch are best friends in school, but enemies on the battlefield. Neither of them knows each other's secret identity. While Lelouch leads a group of terrorists named the Black Knights to destroy Britannia, Suzaku (even though he's an Eleven) joins the Britannian Military, and want to change Britannia from within. Oh....idealistic Suzaku. Code Geass has a wide range of characters, most of them interesting and some of them bash-your-brains-out-annoying *cough*Nina*cough*.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10, definitely. Code Geass is a wild ride, no doubt about it. Lelouch doing his tricks to score the Japanese several victories, with more plot twists than Evangelion. (But in a good way) It's also quite psychological, and EVERY FREAKING EPISODE ends on a cliffhanger: always leaves you wanting more. But Code Geass isn't without it's flaws...a few questions remain unanswered, and though most of them are answered in the second season, it's still kind of confusing. It's also very faced paced with about 3 storylines going on at the same time, at all times. Personally, I liked this and never found it overwhelming. But it might be different for some.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Code Geass is a psychological, action, with a bit of romance (and even a bit of politics), thriller. It always leaves you wanting more, and by the conclusion you won't hesitate to start the next season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Such a sad and violent story. Filled with death and decay, yet I enjoy it so much.\r\nThis anime fits perfectly into my descpription of a good anime. It forces you to think hard after every episode, make theories what the Zero's next step will be and completely devote youreself to it while watching. The political critisicm(atleast I think it is) in this show is huge. I draw parallels to the colonisation of the world, lead by Brittain and other European countries, that lead to the first world war. This is almost exactly what happened in Code Geass. \r\nThe story in this show is so twistingand turning that I never once knew what was going to happen. The thing is, it's so well thought through that the most obscure things can happen and still it fits in to the story. Truly a masterpiece. \\n\r\nThe art is typical CLAMP, very tall and majestic. I find nothing wrong in this, but it's not my favourite kind of animation. Therefore the 8\\n\r\nThe fate of the characters are intertwined in such a way that you wonder how the hell they managed to make this. There is a thin line between masterpiece and crazy and how CLAMP did the characters is so close to cross it. So much emotion is shown in the action of the characters that it will probably make you cry. Hate and insanity is very common among the many outstanding characters in Code Geass so if you don't like that you can skip it. Yet somehow, in the middle of all the bloodshed, they manage to squeeze in some love. They did it in such a way that proves that this anime isn't all darkness and hate.\\n\r\nOverall this series is horrible and dark with a glimt of light at the end of the tunnel. Fighting to protect what you love with all means possible.\\n\\n",

I watched, regardless, as there had been a lot of hype surrounding it, and I was quite interested in it based on what I had seen.\r\nCode Geass is a series which left me confused about ow I should feel towards it. On one hand I had just viewed a wonderfully animated, well developed story with nice character designs and some plot twists which drew me in intensely. On the other, I had just viewed ananime with grossly styled art, fairly typical character personalities, and an abundance of scenes that tried to hard to shock, and succeeded - for all the wrong reasons. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure what else to say. But I feel Code Geass is an anime you'll either love or hate, it's probably best to give it a go and make your mind up yourself, but I seriously warn anyone who has heard all the hype - it's not THAT good.",

            "content": "It is the year 2011 of the normal century. I decided to return to the anime medium after a 2-year break from anime due to me being more interested in video games. I went on the Internet, went on google and typed in best anime of all time on the Google search bar. Then I click on a couple of websites, and I saw the anime series called Code Geass as it was placed 1st in many best anime lists. Then decided to check to see if it does deserve that spot of best anime of all time.\r\nSo I watched the series of Code Geasson some random streaming website for that weekend, and I absolutely loved. I loved it so much its literately became my favourite anime series of all time for a good 5 years.\\n\r\nFast forward to the year 2016 of the normal century where I became a more experienced anime fan who has seen over 800 anime as well buying anime on DVD/Blu-Ray because I wanted to support the anime industry.\\n\r\nIt was during that same time where Code Geass would be receiving a follow-up squeal to Code Geass R2 called Code Geass Lelouch of the resurrection.\\n\r\nNow quickly fast forward to early 2017 where I decided to re-watch both seasons of Code Geass for that weekend and well.\\n\r\nDoes Code Geass still hold up well after these years? Let's find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nSo the story of Code Geass is set in an alternate history country area 11 formal known as Japan before getting beaten in a war on the hands of the Holy Britannia Empire.\\n\r\nOur main character Lelouch was once a prince before the assassination of his mother as well being disowned by his father left him and sister going into hiding as a Britannia school somewhere in area 11 with his blinded sister Nunally. \\n\r\nLelouch pilots his revenge towards the Britannia Empire, but everything changes during a chance encounter with terrorists where is given the power of Geass by meeting a strange girl named C.C. The power of the Geass enables Lelouch to give a single command to anyone and they must obey him. It's during its time Lelouch reunites with his childhood friend Suzaku Kururugi the son of the former Prime Minister of Japan. Now Lelouch must learn his Geass power to carry out his plan of destroying Britannia as he becomes a notorious terrorist known as Zero as well making a terrorist group called the Black Knight who is a group of terrorists who are fighting for the independence of the country so they fight against Britannia forces.\\n\r\nThe story for Code Geass is pretty good for the most part.\\n\r\nFor starters, I really like how Code Geass R1 is paced. It's fast and very engaging.\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding in Code Geass R1 is very good as it manages to showcase how people are living in war Circumstances in both sides as well as establishing nations as well as distant names to relevant locations etc.\\n\r\nAlso, I liked the overall story direction for the most part as its very entertaining to watch as well has had great moments.\\n\r\nCode Geass does a great job at cliff-hangers, has it, keeps the audience interested in the show.\\n\r\nHowever, Code Geass is not the best-written show in the world. In fact, Code Geass R1 has some notable flaws in the story department. \\n\\n\r\nOne: Tone consistently.\\n\r\nThe tone of Code Geass can be quite an inconstancy at times especially the middle portion of the show. \\n\r\nTwo: The school episodes.\\n\r\nThey could have been better written because those episodes feel very cheesy and out of tone not to mention the pacing for those episodes was not that great.\\n\r\nThree: Plotholes.\\n\r\nCode Geass is notorious for its amount plotholes and while the plotholes in R1 is not as bad as R2 there were some plotholes in R1 that kinda annoyed me.\\n\r\nWhy did Lelouch let Villetta live past the second episode?\\n\r\nHow did Lelouch\u2019s phone have Euphemia number even though Lelouch was Euphy enemy? \\n\r\nHow did Lelouch manage to plot the other mech perfectly? We never saw him read the menu at all.\\n\r\nBelieve me however the plotholes in R1 are tamed compared to the plot holes in R2 but that's for an another time.\\n\r\nThe last issue that I had with is episode 22 especially the second half of it.\\n\r\nI won't mention it here due to spoiler reasons but my god was the moment terribly directed.\\n\r\nBesides these flaws, the story for Code Geass is pretty good for what it is.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in Code Geass are hit or miss depending on your tastes.\\n\r\nFor me, I personally enjoyed most of the characters for what they were.\\n\r\nLelouch, in my opinion, is one of the best main protagonists I have seen in any anime. He the type of character that you can relate to in a very good way. Not to mention Lelouch has great character development and we do get to see that character development as the series progresses as learns more about that Geass as well as doing cruel but justifiable things towards other people.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm, not a fan of Suzaku I still found him to an interesting character to watch and he was still a pretty enjoyable character at times despite him being hypocritical at times.\\n\\n\r\nC.C is another interesting character that is enjoyable to watch. She starts off emotionless but as the show progresses she begins to have show more emotions as well as caring more for Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nI really like Kallen as a character. She's a beautiful badass fighter for the black knights.\\n\r\nShe also develops quite a bit as a character as the show progresses during a certain character arc in R1. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters of Code Geass are also a hit or miss.\\n\r\nThis can be very polarizing cast for some.\\n\r\nFor me, I liked most of the characters because they're fun and very interesting.\\n\r\nFor example, I liked characters like Cornelia, Lloyd, Jeremiah, Euphemia, and Milly because I found them to be interesting and very enjoyable.\\n\r\nOh, the other hand I found characters such as Shirley, Nina, and Mao to be annoying.\\n\r\nOverall the characters, for the most part, were great and enjoyable.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nCode Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion was done by Studio Sunrise who also produced other great titles such as Outlaw Star, Gundam series, Cowboy Bebop and Tiger and Bunny and to be honest Code Geass has really aged well visually.\\n\r\nFor starters Clamp really did an amazing job with the characters designs. They just very well designed and for the most part fit very well with the setting.\\n\r\nThe animation for Code Geass R1 is great and smooth and has no stock-footage.\\n\r\nSadly I cannot say the same thing for mecha designs as most of the mecha designs are very generic and boring to look at especially the grunt suits aka the Sutherland.\\n\r\nHowever, these are three mecha designs that I really like.\\n\r\nThese were the Guren Mk-II, Gawain, and the Lancelot.\\n\r\nI liked the design for them as they look really cool and they are very good at combat.\\n\r\nOverall the visuals of Code Geass are very good.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Code Geass is just great, and it really fits with the setting and the theme of Code Geass rather nicely.\\n\r\nOne of my favourite tracks in Code Geass is a track called Stories which is one of my favourite track pieces that I heard in any anime.\\n\r\nThe first opening of Code Geass is easily one of the best things about R1 because it's so iconic, memorable and not to mention the song itself is great.\\n\r\nThe other two openings themes on the other are not so great. I personally found those next two opening to rather bland and they don't fit well to Code Geass at all.\\n\r\nThe ending themes of Code Geass are great as they are very memorable and they fit with the tone of Code Geass very well.\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, both the sub and dub are great in they own right as well as being well acted but I prefer the dub due to Johnny Yong Bosh amazing performance as Lelouch.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters sounded great in the dub in my opinion.\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is great, the first opening was amazing, both endings are great and both sub and dub are great and well acted.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nAfter 6 years since I watched Code Geass for the first time, how does the first season 1 hold up?\\n\r\nFor me, Code Geass R1 holds up quite well for the most part.\\n\r\nIt has a great engaging story that will keep your edge on your seats, good world-building, good and enjoyable characters especially the main character Lelouch, Great visuals and animation besides the generic mecha design for the Sutherland. Great soundtrack along with a great English dub.\\n\r\nSure it had some issues along the way such as some annoying supporting characters as well as a few tone consistently issues and plotholes but they didn't ruin the show for me as Code Geass R1 is a great and enjoyable classic in its own right. Not a masterpiece by any means but still a great show in its own right that I can recommend. \\n\r\nFinal Score 8.5/10",

            "content": "The anime doesn't waste any time and jumps straight into action and to the point. The anime contains lots of various elements as in technology, super powers, intellect etc. which COULD HAVE ruined it due to over crowding of too many features BUT as they are well planned and placed, it complements to the story and keeps the views entertained and occupied thoroughly. The interesting combination and relations of the character is what I liked the best which keeps the momentum of the anime going and makes the anime more interesting. However the battle of the wits and intellect is my favorite part of theanime. The constant urge to be best and outsmart the other make me rewind and view certain parts again to fully understand the process. Character of Lelouch intrigues to the fullest. His progression from chaotic good  to chaotic neutral is worth mentioning and understanding. He in lots of ways makes this anime more interesting, all being about good v/s bad morally and proving a point is attracting. \\n\r\nIf you like this Anime you should also try:\\n\\n\r\nNo Game No Life\\n\r\nDeath Note",

            "content": "Okay first off i want to say that first the only reason I watched this series is because it was recommended to me because I had seen Guilty Crown, and honestly i feel like i have a much higher appreciation for this series because I had watched it.\r\nAlso this review is for both R1 and R2.\r\nAfter watching this series it immediately made it to my number 1 favorite series.\r\nFirst the story, and yes I'm going to try to not hint at any spoilers. This story in a single word would be wow. From the first episode the series never drops the ball. Like i saidbefore i had watched Guilty Crown before this so i wasn't really sure what to expect, and when C.C. originally gave him the power of the Geass, I had thought to myself \"that's it?\" but I've never been so wrong. Yes it may not be as cool as Guilty Crown's \"Power of the King\", but the ability to give any order with total obedience couldn't be better fitted then to Lelouch. The series is filled with twists and turns always wanting to watch the next episode. Its a great mix of story and action with the Knightmares. At the end of season 1 you will immediately want to start the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nNext the music, this is really the only thing ill gripe about, I feel like there wasn't enough. Really all i can say about this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. This series does an amazing job both with the writing for each character and the voice acting (I've only watched the subbed version). Lelouch is an awesome character. He has so many sides, just when you think you know or understand him, he throws a curve ball and shows you a new side. He can go from cold and calculating, to caring, to off the deep end upset and that's just a normal day for Lelouch. I feel like so many series fall short with screen time between main and supporting characters but this one does it right. Never do you see a relationship spark up and die in the same episode, or random people show up and then are gone the next episode. They start and finish with roughly the same group of characters. Each of the supporting characters get a decent amount of screen time and story around them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I've already started to rewatch the series, do i need to say more?\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is now my favorite series. Perfect mix of characters and story. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll be on the edge of your seat begging for more.",

            "content": "Story: 3/10\r\nCode Geass tries to be a mature political drama  like Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Gundam, it bears a lot of similarities, as stated by the creators Lelouch is based off of Char Aznable. He also bares many similarities with Reinhard also, empires fighting federations, peoples demanding independence etc. However Code Geass has a lot of dissonance dissonance from the extreme amounts of comedy they insert randomly and the political drama is much more toned down than other series.\r\nAnd to those comparing it to Death Note. Death Note de-constructs the themes in shows of its demographic (shounen) of teenage males possessing unimaginablepower and mixes it with crime thriller and supernatural horror to success. I would not call Code Geass a deconstruction or a parody, it just simply poorly done the politcal themes of the military sci-fi genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\r\nThank god this was one anime that had 2D mecha (the same sadly cannot be said for it's side stories), while none of them are among my top 10 mecha designs, they are above average. Unlike most people, I am comfortable with the character designs and how they were animated. This was one of CLAMP's best art, I much prefer it over their later works like Chobits.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/ 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nMean: 5.4 rounds down to 5\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, don't see Code Geass as mainstream shounen anime but don't see it as something amazing either, it's an attempt at a mature political drama that has been dragged down by it's out of place over the top comedy and it's public image.",

            "content": "The crowd sits in suspense. The vehicles have stopped. The music cues and the news puts the spotlight on the stage as the man of the hour waltzes onwards to reveal his persona to the world. The curtain rises in flames to reveal the one who wishes to have the entire world as his audience. The icon of justice, Zero appears, the spark of rebellion sets fire to the nation, and a performance to end them all begins.\r\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is the perfect popcorn spectacle; it is the summer blockbuster of a lifetime! It is as bombastic as anime can get, fromits sexy and over-expressive character designs to its majestic soundtrack to how it revels in its genius and stupidity (more on that in R2). It is pure, unadulterated fun and glory, stemming from such an interesting and brutal concept. Blending impressive mecha action and revolutionary schemes against a powerful dictatorship, with uproarious school comedy, and a supernatural superpower, Code Geass is certainly an ambitious project and an exhibition of theatrics. \\n\\n\r\nIn the criminally oft-reviled school portions of the show, we are treated to one of the best running gags ever conceived, a kitten that manages to be a better tsundere than a majority of the archetype\u2019s additions a decade later (more on that in R2), and the best and most whimsical school theme ever conceived. Laughably, our deliciously cunning spaghetti boy finds the presence of a cat wearing his mask more of a threat than most of his \u201cintellectual opposition\u201d, as his worthless physical skills are put to the ultimate test. Such comedic gold is handled with the same musical prowess as scenes of mass murder, ultimate downfall, and glorious accomplishments of plans that can only be described as bullshit batman gambits. Said music also accompanied bullshit like episode 9 and the catastrophic way one of the aforementioned mass murder scenes began.\\n\\n\r\nA main character as bombastic and flamboyant as Lelouch needs a true rival to be hated by everyone, and Suzaku Kururugi steps up with the brazen moral obligation to be the king of stupidity and hypocrisy, and the biggest punching bag a show has ever partaken in. A gloriously detestable takedown against the overpowered mary sue mecha protagonist who reeks of hypocrisy, idiocy, and bullshit --see Kira Yamato from Gundam SEED--, Suzaku is the heel everyone grows to hate (more on that in R2). The quality memory does not stop here with the likes of JEREMIAH GOTTWALD THE ORANGE BOY present in this glorious mess, or Emperor Charles, who looks like a buff Russian Czar partaking in 17th century French Royalty Fashion. God forbid any mention of Nina the table rapist, and her rule of 3 Euphemia obsession driving her over the edge harder than a landslide slamming into a city --thanks Ledouche--!\\n\\n\r\nThese characters would only be roughly 9/11th as memorable as they are if not for their god-tier facial expressions driving the point of their lunacy to levels rivaling Suzaku\u2019s stupidity. The same fact applies when taking in some of these sick costume and outfit designs that just scream \u201cwe were born with fashion sense\u201d. One need no further evidence than a glance at Zero\u2019s outfit or the Lancelot Knightmare Frame to truly understand what a thing of beauty this series is. Seeing these axle-skating mechs fight like break-dancing kung-fu fighters is a sight to behold, just as much as seeing them fight like actual military units or use their grappling devices to not get swept up by a landslide.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the hamminess of the characters is matched only by the godly music composed by our lord and savior, Kotaro Nakagawa! From the whimsical to the beautiful, to the bombastic and grandiose, this series excels with nearly every song! \u201cSchool Days\u201d, \u201cAvalon\u201d, \u201cStories\u201d, \u201cAlone\u201d, \u201cFinal Catastrophe\u201d, \u201cCallin\u2019\u201d, \u201cLast Adolescence\u201d, \u201cPicaresque\u201d, \u201cCold Nobility\u201d, and so many more have made sweet home in my consciousness, and have been applied into my everyday life when imagining made-up scenes or writing out something such as this! It is almost as perfect as a catalog of songs for a show can be, both in terms of the background music, and the tracks that open each episode and close the second half of them. Just imagine playing these in videos where you slam on a gigantic trainwreck or marvel over the beauty of a show. Imagine using these tracks when you study for an exam or write about what a mostly well-constructed bout of absurdity and talent this show is! Just imagine hearing this while you watch the marvelous English dub with the delicious performances of talents such as Johnny Yong Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Steve Blum, and Crispin fucking Freeman! Would it not be glorious?! \\n\\n\r\nSo, what I\u2019m saying is, this show is the biggest shitpost in anime history, and you should give it some of your money. After all, it is certainly a unique performance that stunned the globe.",

            "content": "Let me preface this by saying this is the fourth time I've watched Code Geass, and it never fails to impress.  I'm also well aware of the many reviews attacking the show for its alleged defects, often going out of their way to tear it apart based upon questionable criticisms instead of offering a sincere assessment on the merits.  I can only surmise that the bulk of these are the product of the counterculture phenomenon: the series is so popular and mainstream that it must suck.  Obviously I disagree, and I'll do my best to explain why.\r\nCode Geass starts with a great,deceptively original premise.  The world is at war.  Its sole superpower, the Holy Britannian Empire, has recently conquered Japan using advanced weaponry known as the Knightmare Frame.  Lelouch, a well to do, perpetually aloof boy living in the Tokyo Settlement, escapes his otherwise dull life by beating nobles in high-stake chess games, until the day that he is caught up in a fight between the colonial government and pro-Japanese terrorists, meets a mysterious green-haired girl named C2, and is given the power of Geass (in his case, the power to order anyone to obey his command).  War, mechas, and special powers are nothing to sneer at, even if stories incorporating these elements are a dime a dozen.  Yet Code Geass stands out in its ability to infuse richness and depth into virtually every element and central character of the story.  The war isn't just about land - it's about political philosophy.  Britannia, by far the most powerful, nationalist, and aggressive of the world's political powers, is also the most morally deplorable, founded upon racial superiority, economic inequality, and the principle that the strong should devour the weak.  The European Union and Chinese Federation, by contrast, choose to grant equal rights or equal wealth to their citizens, but are consequently weak. \\n\\n\r\nNor is Lelouch some random guy who gets special powers and decides to become a terrorist.  Besides being one of the best and most complex male protagonists in the last decade, he is an outcast prince of Britannia who despises its philosophy and the Emperor because both deny the worth of his crippled sister Nunnally.  Through his alter ego, Zero, he seeks to destroy the world through virtually any means so that he may rebuild it anew.  Suzaku, Lelouch's best and yet worst friend and pilot of the invincible Lancelot, isn't just some trite rule follower, either.  He is driven by his own dark past to believe that no good can come to oneself or others from an end attained by wicked means.  C2 has her own complex history and a soul tempered by an existence outside of time.  In her most candid and beautiful moment, she explains that her real name is all she remembers, and so she goes by C2 to ensure that it may only be spoken with tenderness, honesty, and affection.  A number of characters beyond the main cast are also remarkably well-developed: Kallen, who leads a double-life as a Britannian student and terrorist and fights to give meaning to her brother's death and mother's life; the deliciously ruthless Cornelia, who presents a formidable challenge to Zero's plans; the maniacal Jeremiah Gottwald, aka Orange Boy, whose devotion to the Crown causes him to lose his very humanity; and Euphemia, the sweetest, kindest, and most tragic character a mecha anime has ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond incredible, dynamic characters, Code Geass offers a superb story with perfect pacing and an endless supply of suspense and emotion.  From the first episode, when Lelouch narrowly escapes death using his newfound Geass powers by ordering the Britannian soldiers to kill themselves, I was completely hooked, and things never let up.  While the plot is initially and ultimately about the conflict between the Black Knights and the Britannian government, there are some nice subplots that enrich the main story: Suzaku's rise within the Britannian military and incessant ability to thwart Lelouch's efforts; Shirley's internal struggles; C2's past; the origins of Geass; and the Emperor's obscure plans for the world.  Underlying the story are two philosophical questions, one common albeit well executed, the other quite novel - Can revolution be justified if it requires sacrificing the lives and happiness of others (i.e., can the ends justify the means), and if so, who should bear the blame for the consequences?  The conclusion is also one of the best of any anime.  True, it's the biggest cliffhanger ever and had I been watching during the initial broadcast I would have gone into a fit of rage, but it manages to create one of the most emotional moments I've ever seen, and it ensured viewers would be back for the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately the studio realized it had a great story and went all out on the animation, soundtrack, and voice casting to make this a top-notch production.  The character designs in particular are stunning, with facial expressions that often bring them to life (see especially Cornelia when she goes mad).  The soundtrack is essentially as good as it gets without hiring Yoko Kanno, featuring a mesh of classical tracks with an imperial flavor (e.g., Noblesse Oblige), beautiful symphonies (e.g., Boyhood), jazzy trumpet pieces (e.g., Pessimistic Time), and a couple of amazing Hitomi tracks (e.g., Stories).  The voice cast is essentially as good as it gets (no qualifier), featuring Johnny Yong Bosch (Lelouch) in probably his best performance, Kate Higgins (C2), and an exceptional fit and performance by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (Cornelia). \\n\\n\r\nAlright, so at this point I sound like a fanboy foaming at the mouth, which is partly accurate.  But I like to be fair, so I'll close with the few things I did not like about Code Geass.  First, and most critically, there are a few times when things line up too perfectly.  Eye contact, for instance, is occasionally an area where Lelouch takes a huge gamble and gets lucky.  Episode 22 also borders on unbelievable, but is ultimately acceptable because a foundation is established earlier on.  Second, events accelerate a bit too much in the final 3 episodes and one more episode would have been nice to spread things out.  Finally, I don't like Nina (mainly because of her voice) and I can't stand Tamaki.  \\n\\n\r\nObviously those are minor criticisms that had little effect on my opinion of the show, and try as I might, I can't think of any others.  Really I'm sure I could add more reasons that I love it, but this review has gone on too long already.  Put simply, Code Geass is a masterpiece, and at least for now, it's the gold standard by which I review new anime.",

            "content": "First, for the sake of those who don't like reading much, I'll try to summarize what I can say about the anime in general.\r\nWhile may sound exaggerating, I would say this anime excels in almost everything. Even though the idea on which the anime based is pretty average and feels like a replica of other series, I assure you that everything about Code Geass is actually more unique and special than you think. \r\nThe simple idea of \"a boy receiving powers and executing revenge\" was taken to new heights in this epic anime. The plot of this series is most likely the most intelligent, unpredictableand fast-paced you'll ever see in your life. Predicting the plot of this anime isn't hard \u2013 it's impossible!\\n\r\nIt moves so fast and has so many twists, that at some point you'll surely give up about predicting it and will simply enjoy it. \\n\r\nThe characters in the anime, differently from most famous shonen series like Naruto, feel realistic. Most anime try to offer unique characters with many strange and interesting features. But when you look closely, you should notice that those characters feel unrealistic because they have awfully extreme characteristics, which you won't find in real people. In Code Geass, the characters are much more balanced and feel much more real, while still being very unique and different from each other. Another strong point about characters is their development. You will usually see how different characters deal with though decisions, and may eventually even change the side they are fighting for.\\n\r\nThe animation of the series isn't something I can say much about. Personally, I like it. With that said, it's not my \"perfect\" style of art, and yet I have to admit it's a unique one. Rather than simply being \"good\" or \"bad', I think it's more about your taste. If it fits your taste \u2013 you like it, and if it doesn't \u2013 you don't. \\n\r\nThe voice acting is really strong, especially for the main character \u2013 Lelouch. Since the anime focuses a lot about Lelouch's thoughts and decisions, the voice acting plays an important role in delivering the watcher his feelings and emotions. I think it was done beautifully in this anime. I could really feel how heavy each and every one of his decisions was, as well as how he felt before and after making the decision.\\n\r\nThe music played a very important role as well, and like the voice acting \u2013 it fulfilled well its duty. Putting aside the action and tense moments, in which the music was great, I would rather focus on the tragic and dramatic moments. In these very plot-wise important moments, the music was simply perfect. Seeing the same moments without the music will make these moments simply \"another forgetful part of the plot\". But with the music, these very moments will most likely be the ones you'll remember the best after finishing watching the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, for those who wish to read a more deep analysis about the series...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot: The basic idea, which you most likely already read about somewhere, is \"Lelouch receives special power from a mysterious girl, and decides to use it in order destroy the Britannian Empire, both for revenge for his mother's death and to make a peaceful world for his sister\". You will most likely also see similar words over and over when watching the beginning of each episode. It's hard to believe there are many people who read such description and say \"this anime gonna be epic!\". I doubt if there are any at all. And I can't blame them, because it really sounds like a pretty average and simple idea. But the strength of Code Geass isn't hidden in this basic idea, but rather in the way its plot was executed. A basic plot pattern for the idea will be something like this: \"Lelouch and his organization fight against the evil commanders of the Britannian Empire and defeat them. At some point, the evil \"final boss\" arrives and Lelouch defeats him as well. Happy ending. Credits. Bye bye\"\\n\r\nThat's what I believe most people would expect from this anime, and I was no exception. At the beginning, it really feels like it's going to follow this plain pattern. But very soon, after watching a few episodes, you'll realize that Code Geass's plot is nothing as simple as that. To start with, there is no even      \"Good vs. Evil\" in this series. You can't simply classify the characters and the different organizations in the series as either \"good\" or \"evil\". If I had to pick, I would rather say that the main character himself is actually \"evil\". But the most important thing about the plot, is that there are many things which make the plot very complicated. The main character, Lelouch, has more to do than just \"fight against the empire\". He also has to make sure he hides his identity, act normally in front of his sister and friends, and most of all \u2013 to be a strong and reliable leader in order to make people believe in him and follow his orders. If you think these are trivial matters which has nothing to do with the plot \u2013 you are gravely mistaken. Each and every one of them affects the plot strongly at some point, and shows you that the plot won't go the way you thought it will. \\n\r\nThe plot itself is very fast paced. You may not notice this at first, as it feels like things moving a bit slow at the beginning. But once you get to the main parts, you'll be flying trough the episodes, and be warned \u2013 you may not be able to stop. For me, the plot was the biggest source of entertainment in this anime. It just keeps on going and never stops to take a break. With each passing episode, my curiosity about \"what will happen next\" only grew bigger and bigger. I'll admit it \u2013 I got addicted to the plot of this series, and to the series as a whole.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Alongside with the great plot of this series, stands the amazing cast of characters. While the anime focuses a lot on the plot and on moving the story fast, it never forgets about character development. This anime has many characters, like most anime. What makes it different, and better in my opinion, is the balance of the characters. You won't see \"an idiot who shouts the whole day\" or \"a girl which hits everybody when she's angry\" type of characters. Every character has its own unique features, but in the same time they are all \"humans\". Which means that no matter what personality a character has, it'll never act in extreme or unrealistic way. Such balanced characters are easier to understand and to become attached to. \\n\r\nAnother strong aspect of the characters is their \"state of mind\". You often see how different characters must make hard and heavy decisions, which will affect them or their surroundings in different ways. The main focus is on the main character, Lelouch, but many other characters also make important decisions in their life, like Lelouch's childhood friend \u2013 Suzaku. Every character has its own past, beliefs, wishes and values. Together, they affect the decisions of the characters, and usually even put them one against another. If you look at the battles in this anime, then you'll see they are mostly based on each person's beliefs. These aren't battles between \"good\" and \"evil\", but rather between what each character \"believes is right\". This adds a lot to the series, and doesn't allow you easily judge a character as \"good\" or \"evil\". Some people may say Lelouch is \"good\", while some may say he's \"evil\". Personally, I belong to the latter type. \\n\r\nBut just like I said \u2013 they are humans. Every human sometime loses his way and falls into confusion and despair. You can see it perfectly in this anime. Many characters tend to become confused of what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong\" at some point. One event can totally change the character's personality, and to shake its beliefs and values. Some characters eventually even change the side they support and fight for. Your enemy in the beginning, may end up as your ally in the end and vice versa. If you ask what are the things that make this anime unpredictable, then this, without a doubt, is one of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Since the character design is done by Clamp, it's not strange to see how similar the art style between Code Geass and Clamp's manga, like X. The characters usually look tall and slim. That's how I always described Clamp's art style, and I think this description pretty much fit Code Geass. I'm a big Clamp fan. Not because of the art style, but because of their great ideas. This art style is pretty much unique to Clamp and you can either like it or not, depends on your own taste. Thus, it's hard for me to say that the art style is either \"good\" or bad\". Even though it's not my \"perfect\" type of art style, I still liked it a lot. I think that in term of quality, this anime was done well \u2013 no matter whatever you like the art style or not.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Since the characters are put trough different situation, the voice acting plays a very important role in this anime. If it's done well, then the watcher can understand well how complicated or tense the situations are. If done badly, then everything about the anime will feel shallow and boring.  \\n\r\nI say it was done well. Very well.\\n\r\nNotably is Lelouch's voice acting. No matter what the situation was, it was easy to understand it well thanks to the voice acting. Especially when Lelouch was lost or was making hard decisions, I could really understand how difficult and heavy these decisions were. Also, since Lelouch has more than one \"identity\", it was important that he'll feel different in every environment. He really felt like a fearless leader when he was on the battle field, but also as a carefree student when he was at school.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic: It's always important to have a great music. Thanks to music, many events become better and more memorable. While the anime had great music during action scenes, I would rather focus on the music during sad and dramatic moments. In these very important moments, the music was perfect, beautiful and irreplaceable. It made those few moments the most memorable ones about the series. Even seeing them again, with this perfect music, will make you enjoy them almost as much as the first time. Without this perfect music, the same scenes just won't feel as great as they did.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: No matter how many things I say I liked about this anime, what really made it my favorite one is: that I really enjoyed it; and to enjoy is the most important, right?\\n\r\nIt almost didn't have any boring parts. It was always active, and was moving forward without taking a break. It was unpredictable to a degree I have never seen before in a series, and I LOVE unpredictable things. Basically, the anime was very thrilling for me. It's like riding a roller coaster \u2013 once you start, you can't quit until it ends; but you don't regret it, because every moment was epic and thrilling.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I recommend this anime to everyone. No matter what you think about it, and no matter whatever you think you won't like it \u2013 just try it. I was quite sure myself I won't like it. For me it was \"Robots? Who the hell is going to like an anime with big robots?\"\\n\r\nThat was the reason it took me so much time to actually try this anime. But when I tried, I realized how stupid I was. It doesn't matter whatever there are robots or clich\u00e9 base idea. What really matters is how well it was done, and how much you enjoyed it. \\n",

On the other side, nearly every character is a stereotype and not memorable at all. My biggest problem with Code Geass though, is the way it feels like 3 genres of anim\u00e9 thrown into a blender. Sometimes it's Action/Adventure and stuck to the plot, at other times It goes school comedy and harem. I would not really mind it, though it feels that only 40% of the episodes stick to the plot, and that's sure to annoy you. In fact, when I finished it,first thing that came to mind was how mediocre it was. I don't know why people keep comparing this mecha-wreck it to Death Note. I clearly recommend you pass on this",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BOTH SEASONS OF THE SHOW**\r\nThere is nothing that I enjoy more than a well-written, intellectually stimulating anime; they are by far my favorite kind of show to watch. Evangelion, for example, is one of my favorite anime of all time. Before watching Code Geass, I was told that it would fall into that same sort of boat and that it would entertain me while making me think simultaneously. While it certainly entertained me and I enjoyed it quite a bit, I would like to make it clear that this is not what I would call an intellectual anime, not even tothe same extent as its oft-compared counterpart \"Death Note\". Let's be honest here; at its core, Code Geass is still a show about giant robots fighting each other in a battle where the biggest and best one wins (*cough, White Knight, *cough). It's overly theatrical, can be pretentious at times, and has a few inconsistencies with its plot\u2026 But I still love it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nSynopsis: A boy named Lelouch is secretly the long lost heir to the Holy Brittanian Empire; a planetary superpower who rules over inferior countries with tyranny and an iron fist using advanced robotic technology called \"Knightmares\". Lelouch was exiled from his homeland and sent to live in Japan, which has basically been turned into a Giant ghetto under the rule of the Empire who look down on the Japanese and treat them as sub-human. Lelouch holds a harsh grudge against his father, the King, who exiled him, and so he vows to destroy his father's mighty empire.\\n\\n\r\nHow much you enjoy the story-line of Code Geass really relies on how seriously you take it. To elaborate on that, here is an example of what I mean: In the very first episode, Lelouch receives the power of \"Geass\", a power that allows him to bind anyone to his will and gives him the power to order anyone to do anything he wants. With a power such as that, it is inevitable that a few plot-holes arise. There are a few shortcuts that Lelouch could have taken using his power which he should have been able to figure out since he is portrayed as such a genius, but Geass luckily is able to avoid any show-wrecking plotholes and keeps them all relatively minor.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the main strength of Geass' plot is that it simply knows how to get an audience invested in a story; it is written very, very well considering what they were going for. The writers were able to grip the audience from the very first episode and keep them on the edge of their seat for nearly the entire remainder of the show. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass deserves a lot of credit for focusing far more on the strategy and tactics of mecha battles rather then the fighting itself, which is one of the show's most redeeming qualities. At least, that is the case for the first season. The second season gets away from its roots bit and starts to divulge to the \"Build a better robot! Beat the bad guys using brute force!\" kind of story which is far less interesting. For that reason, I would definitely say that the middle part of season 2 is the worst stretch of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is certainly worth mentioning that Code Geass has an absolutely fantastic ending. Probably my favorite anime ending of all time. It can only be described using the far overused term, \"epic\". I wouldn't dare spoil it, but I truly wish that other anime would have the balls that Geass has in regards to not being afraid to risks in their storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, despite it's minor flaws, the big picture is that Code Geass' plot is impressively written and centered around a fantastic protagonist with supremely entertaining plot twists and an indescribably good ending. If you can look past the minor inconsistencies and the tendency for the show to over-exaggerate (which you should), you will have a blast watching Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters look great, the settings look great, and the action scenes are very well animated. For an anime released in 2006, these are some very quality visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OST is definitely the best part about the sound, as it never fails to set the mood. It is used to over exaggerate not-so-exciting scenes a bit too often though. The openings and endings are alright, but none of them really stand out. The voice acting is above average in both the sub and the dub, so you can watch whichever you prefer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Code Geass are great overall, in my opinion. To the show's credit, they all have very specific traits that make them recognizable and distinct, but Geass can struggle with inconsistent character behavior at times as well as one or two characters that are just very poorly written. But for such a large cast, these things are bound to happen.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch vi Brittania, the protagonist, deserves mention for being a masterfully written, extremely complex character and one of the most notable anti-heroes in all of media; not just anime. You love him at times, you hate him at times, you are constantly intrigued with his motives, and you are always in awe of his actions. Lelouch is compared to Yagami Light from Death Note often because they are both geniuses who are constantly involved in a cat-and-mouse game and because it is unclear whether they are heroes or villains. However, I think the real reason Lelouch is such a fantastic character is the ending to the anime. Everything you didn't understand about him is elucidated, particularly his motivations. It is incredibly hard to decide throughout Code Geass whether Lelouch is a hero or a villain; has he gone mad with power or is he still a force for justice? Well, lets just say the last episode gives you your answer in an EPIC fashion . Lelouch is in the running for my favorite anime character of all time, and I am not alone in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for every couple of great Code Geass characters, there is one who is not-so-great. CC , for example, is a character who is shrouded in mystery for a long time. She seems to add a lot to the anime at first with her level of intrigue, her unknown motivations, and her charm, but she receives little to no development  at any point in either season, and the little that she does receive is very shoddy. CC is giant wasted opportunity. Don't get me started on Nina either. *shudder\\n\\n\r\nThere are many more great characters to talk about, but I can't possibly go over all of them. In short, there are a few bad characters in Geass and there a few things about the good ones that don't make sense, but the majority of the cast is very, very well done and most importantly; memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIs Code Geass perfect? No, not by any means, but watching it is incredibly fun and you owe it to yourself as an anime fan to watch it all the way through, even if it's just to say that you have and don't like it. I was on the edge of my seat essentially the whole time, the characters were likable, and the story-line is well written for the most part. I highly recommend Code Geass to all ages.",

            "content": "This is a long, detailed review so congrats if you can make it to the end.\r\nStory 8:The series takes place in an alternate universe where Japan has been conquered by the \u201cHoly Britannian Empire\u201d, the world\u2019s only superpower. Under Britannian rule, the native Japanese have been subjected to a cruel and oppressive foreign rule. At the heart of the conflict is the protagonist, Lelouch, who is a Britannian prince who hates the Empire. The story begins when he receives a special power from a mysterious girl. \r\nWhat I appreciated most about the story was the moral complexity and ambiguity. Nothing is clear cut and everyone(who survives) undergoes a significant character change. It\u2019s one of those morally grey narratives where it\u2019s hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Britannia is an evil empire, yes. I mean they ruthlessly execute Japanese civilians and their soldiers follow orders like Nazis, yet many of the series\u2019 most likeable characters are Britannian students/citizens. The Japanese resistance on the other hand may stand for a noble, underdog cause, but they conduct terroristic bombings and execute Britannian hostages too. Ok, so who\u2019s the \u201cgood guy\u201d? If that\u2019s an answer you need to have then this is not the anime for you.\\n\r\nThe story is exciting and engaging and it definitely does a good job combining action with strategy and intrigue. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9: It\u2019s rare and great when you have an anime that has exciting and well-developed characters along with a very cool plot. Often you have to choose between one or the other\u2026or neither. Code Geass has both. The characters are complicated and don\u2019t follow typical anime clich\u00e9s.\\n\r\nOne of the predominant themes that keeps surfacing is the challenge of fighting evil without becoming evil. \\n\r\nI\u2019m reminded of a famous quote from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s Gulag Archipelago (which I was coincidentally reading at the time I watched this anime): \\n\r\n\u201cIf only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?\u201d\\n\r\n The protagonist, Lelouch, embodies this good/evil dichotomy. He is intelligent, self-righteous, ambitious, vicious and powerful. The viewer can\u2019t help but respect him and his obsessive, driven personality. However, this admiration becomes progressively more uncomfortable for the viewer as Lelouch\u2019s hands become bloodier and bloodier in his quest to eradicate the evil empire of Britannia. Can one fight evil without becoming corrupted? Is it wrong to kill in the name of a righteous cause? Are people guilty by association? What are the dangers of seeing the world in black and white? These are some of the questions that are explored in Lelouch\u2019s journey and (in my humble opinion) allow the anime to transcend just being a cool story and, instead, give it some philosophical depth. \\n\r\nWhile Lelouch is the centerpiece, he is surrounded by very interesting characters too. And while these co-mains and supporting characters serve to give Lelouch more complexity, they are also very interesting and unique in their own right.\\n\r\nFor example, when CC is rude or unreasonable it\u2019s not part of some cutesy tsundere flirtation scheme\u2026no, no, sometimes she can just be a major bitch\u2026which is delightful to watch. Then there\u2019s Suzaku, who I disliked at first for being a one of those over-powered, one-dimensional, annoying, simple-minded, pure-hearted idealists that pop up in anime so frequently, but even he turned out to be more complicated and flawed than I gave him credit for. And of course there\u2019s Shirley, Episode 1: just the cheerful, preppy bimbo; Episode ???\u2014 Think again, she\u2019s complicated too. Haha, I guess a good way to sum it up is that everyone in this anime has issues, which makes them interesting. And it\u2019s through these unique characters that we get to see the different facets of Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: the art is beautiful, from the action sequences to the futuristic/Victorian scenery to the characters themselves. The animation takes a very strange approach to depicting the human body. I noticed that most of the characters have very androgynous body frames and are usually tall and oddly slender. In faraway shots people look almost like well-drawn scarecrows. This isn\u2019t good or bad but it\u2019s unique. What\u2019s not unique though is the absolutely shameless product placement. In an alternate universe where Britain rules the world, battles are fought using mechs and where magical powers shape the course of global events, only one thing remains constant\u2026Pizza Hut. That\u2019s right, kids eat Pizza Hut. CC eats it in 90% of the scenes she in and still manages to maintain that slender figure I was talking about earlier. And despite Pizza not even being Japanese or British, Pizza Hut still shows up on buildings, in parties, on desks and even as a password during a crucial moment. I was seriously waiting for the Mechs to start entering battles with NASCAR-style Pizza Hut logos slapped on their guns.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 8: Catchy intro but not my favorite. None of the other music stood out in a big way for me.\\n\r\nCritiques: \\n\r\nAt some point, every 17+ anime has to answer the simple question of how wrong is it to kill someone. Compare Elfen Lied and Psycho-Pass. Both are dark shows but Elfen Lied put very little moral weight on the masses of people Lucy slaughtered, and even portrayed her as a misunderstood and sympathetic character. Whereas, in Psycho-Pass, despite a great deal of violence and moral ambiguity, the death of a single anonymous person is still treated as something horrific, evil and thought-provoking. Code Geass is inconsistent and they kind of swing back and forth. Sometimes they\u2019ll explore the psychological effects of a single death on different characters, but other times these same characters kill without so much as an afterthought and go on with their merry lives. I would have preferred more moral consistency. \\n\\n\r\nSatisfaction/Overall 9: I was very satisfied with the first season. I'm looking forward to season 2.\\n\\n\r\nBlood/gore: There is some. It\u2019s not stylized or overdone but they are also not afraid to show death and violence. \\n\\n\r\nLove/Romance: Lelouch develops special connections with a couple of girls throughout the series but the focus isn\u2019t on developing a particular romance. As I said earlier, different characters = different sides of Lelouch and he\u2019s able to interact with each of these girls in a different way. Likewise, these girls each see something different in him. I know it sounds weird but we bypass, a lot (but not all) of the jealousy/love-triangle/harem stuff despite everyone going to the same school. In my opinion, this is largely because these girls see Lelouch\u2019s obsession with achieving his goal (rather than each other) as their greatest rival.\\n\\n\r\nSex/nudity: While there\u2019s a fair amount of fan service in the form of \u201cwhoops, I didn\u2019t realize I was naked\u201d, there were a few (usually non-graphic) \u2018mature situations\u2019 where I had to ask myself what the fuck did I just hear/see? Seriously Nina, wtf\u2026\\n",

            "content": "With striking character designs, adrenaline inducing pacing and epic battles, Code Geass is basically a versing in making exciting, highly watchable shounen anime.\r\nPlot-10/10\r\nMy highest score would undoubtedly have to be for the plot of Code Geass. It immediately gives an interesting premise: Japan has became a social darwinist state, ran by the xenophobic britannians who dub it \"Area 11\". The Britannians are shown to be cruel and racist: their actions in the first episode of the anime is enough to get us on the side of Lelouch. The anime, thankfully, does not divert too much from the original plot. There are only really two orthree episodes that are not totally pivotal to the outcome of the anime, and these are important as they divulge some of the secrets of Lelouch's new found powers. The pacing is fantastic: for someone like me, who has a hatred of filler episodes, the plot was concise and steady, it did not diverge in to useless flashbacks or mini-arcs. Code Gass works just as well as a drama as it does as an action movie: the interactions between characters are just as interesting as the mecha scenes. In fact, Code Geass does not behave like a stereotypical gundam series at all: at times, I forgot that this was a giant robot anime-it is far more Death Note than Gundam Suite.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8/10\\n\r\nMost of these points are solely for Lelouch-one of the most three dimensional anime characters I have seen for a long shot. Sure, he is supposed to be a genius, but he is a relatable one at that: he makes enough mistakes for the viewer to see him as a human being, rather than something invincible. Despite comparisons to Light Yagami, for me Lelouch does not tread in to \"despicable anti-hero\" territory: he is driven by his love of his family, and in fact, his empathy with others often prevents him from fulfilling his plans to their full extent. Lelouch is a true deconstruction of the \"infallible badass\" character: his flaws make him likeable and it is not hard to root for him as he dotes on Nunally.\\n\r\nCode Geass has a massive cast, and due to this, many are pretty 1D. But the characters that are fleshed out properly make an interesting bunch: Karen is a total action girl from the start, Euphie makes for a realistic beautiful princess, with enough flaws to not fall into Mary sue category. Suzaku is believable as Lelouch's counterpart: He has a massive guilt complex, and turns out to be not all that he seems: he is basically a breakdown of the classic mecha pilot.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nClamp's character designs are gorgeous. I was initially a little bit thrown by the noodle like proportions of the cast, but give it time! Eventually your eyes will adjust to the anatomical weirdness. The characters were certainly all very different: the beautiful attention to detail in clothes, hair and eyes make this series a cosplayer or fanartist's dream. The striking differences in each member of the cast made it easy to tell who was who, essential in an anime that features so many people. \\n\r\nThe backgrounds were pretty standard fare, as were the giant robots. But the obvious nod to Victorian style and architecture gave the series a feel unique to typical mecha and also fitted the essence of the ostentatious Britannian rulers.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8/10\\n\r\nI watched the subbed version, so all this will refer to the original Japanese.\\n\r\nNo real complaints here. Lelouch's voice actor was awesome, and his changes in tone were excellent in showing the differences between Lulu and Zero. I thought Nanally's voice was adorable. The differences in chosen pronouns were pretty interesting: Lelouch uses \"ore\", Suzaku uses \"boku\", Euphie talks using the extremely formal \"Watakushi\". It's practically worth learning a bit about Japanese pronouns before watching as these nunances make such a nice touch. The creepy gospel music that plays during fight scenes wasn't dissonant to the general atmosphere of the fights, and suited it quite nicely actually. The rest of the background music went unnoticed. \\n\r\nThere are two different ops: the first one was a standard shounen op, the second seemed to be from the Blink 182 of Japan. I thought the ending songs were actually better: the first one is a real challenge for any karaoke fans, the second stays in the head all day.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9/10\\n\r\nCode Geass is enjoyable as it doesn't pretend to be something that it's not: sure, it has a crazy plot, everyone has neon hair and school boys piloting giant robots doesn't even turn heads. But that's the fun in it! Anime is supposed to be pure escapism, something often forgotten by those craving more and more realistic plots. As soon as you let go of any pretensions, Code Geass becomes a very fun ride indeed: it is bright, with many twists and turns and leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction when it's finished.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I believe I first heard of Code Geass during a Lucky Star reference. During that time, I had no idea what it was or that it was even an anime. I soon started hearing more and more people talking about it and then read about it in my December 2007 edition of Newtype USA. I decided to check it out, since I had only heard good things about it. I went into watching the show having high expectations, and Code Geass did not let me down&hellip;\r\nStory- Code Geass&rsquo; story is incredibly complex- not so much in a psychological or abstract way, but because there isalways about fifty things going on at once, with over twenty characters to keep track of. This makes the show incredibly engaging and exciting to watch as you become entranced in its multifaceted storyline. The story line moves at an incredibly fast pace as well. There are no long gaps of staring people down *cough*Naruto*cough* and there are minimal scenes containing subject matter that is irrelevant to the plot. Even though this is a good thing for the most part (no boring scenes=win), the plot sometimes moves too fast for one to fully comprehend, giving it a somewhat rushed feeling. Nonetheless, Code Geass manages to turn a seemingly simplistic mehca plot revolving around a rebellion into a jam-packed roller coaster ride filled with a little bit of everything- political intrigue, comedy, adventure, suspense, action, drama, and even some ecchi- making for an eclectic plethora of different anime genres in one show. \\n\\n\r\nArt- Some excellent work by CLAMP here, although their artwork is usually quite high-quality. While toned-down colours may have been more suitable for Code Geass&rsquo; intricate and somewhat dark plot, I felt that the vivid colours that were used throughout the anime added life and energy to the story. Animation was fairly decent as well. The fight scenes between the mechas could have been more detailed at times, but I&rsquo;m not complaining. Everything was pretty slick and tight- it made for an entrancing display of exciting fight scenes, gorgeous settings, and unique character designs (I&rsquo;m partial to C.C. &lt;3)\\n\\n\r\nSound- Top-notch. Code Geass incorporates some wonderfully unique background music during a number of episodes that fits very nicely with the plot. These songs sometimes included some interesting female vocals as well which I enjoyed hearing during some of Geass&rsquo; most intense action scenes. It made for some excellent juxtaposition between fast-paced action and relaxing/calm vocals. Sound effects were very appropriate to the story and none seemed to interrupt the flow of each episode. Opening and ending songs were outstanding as well. There were a variety of different genres of music involved in the show&rsquo;s opening and ending themes from the dissonant &ldquo;Kaidoku Fun\u014d&rdquo; (2nd opening) to the more poppy &ldquo;Colors&rdquo; (1st opening) to the trance-influenced &ldquo;Hitomi No Tsubasa&rdquo; (opening for episode 24). Great range of musical genres and all are a pleasure to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- There were a variety of well-developed characters in Code Geass. A few of them include Lelouch, a strategic mastermind who has sworn to enact revenge upon his irrational/totalitarianistic father; Suzaku, a kind-hearted boy who joined the army in order to promote peace in area 11 (Japan); and C.C., a very mysterious girl whose origins and motives are unknown. These are only 3 characters who grow and develop during the show. Countless other characters (including relateively minor characters) also encounter hardships, interact with others, and form unique bonds during the course of the anime. The fact that Code Geass manages to give adequate attention to such a wide array of characters in the course of a mere 25 episodes is quite impressive. One can relate to a good number of the characters in one form or another as well- whether it be Leouch&rsquo;s protective nature toward his sister or C.C.&rsquo;s will to remain aloof and isolated from others out of fear of idscrimination or rejection- making them more relevant and realistic in the eyes of the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I quite enjoyed watching Code Geass. The storyline was detailed, well thought-out and incorporated some truly remarkable plots into the plot as well. Each episode left me wanting more; it was a rollar-coaster ride I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to ride again and again, and the line-up to wait for another seat on the ride was my computer that loaded each episode too slowly for the fast pace I wished to keep. Where does Code Geass fall short of a 10 then? For the most part, it&rsquo;s originality. In all honesty, we have seen this plotline many other times in other mecha series- one that kept coming to mind was Gundam Seed in particular- and the fact that a supernatural ability was thrown into the plot was strongly redolent of Death Note. Code Geass&rsquo;s plot line also left little room for the viewer to form his or her own theories or ideas of what actually or may have happened throughout the storyline. There was little room for viewer interpretation/extrapolation- something that actively engages me while I watch anime and also something that makes it all the more exciting to discuss with others. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- Code Geass was quite entertaining to watch and was definitely worth my time in the end. If you are looking for a thrilling anime that gets your adreneline pumping andleaves you with little room to catch your breath, look no further than Code Geass.  I look forward to seeing how R2 advances with the plot when I watch it in the future.\\n",

            "content": "There are several popular anime whose success is difficult to understand, but perhaps none more so than Code Geass. This anime has been called a masterpiece by various sources, often using such adjectives as \"deep\". This strikes me as a bit odd, because if there's one thing that I think the show lacks, it's intelligence. \r\nThe premise seems reminiscent of Death Note, setting up an allegedly intelligent male high school student against incredible odds while armed with nothing but his wit and an incredibly potent superpower. In the case of Code Geass, however, the power the protagonist is given is too useful and lacking inany particular weaknesses to allow the kind of entertaining intellectual competition that was present in Death Note. Perhaps to try and compensate for this, the series contains several battles between armies of mecha, but the action in these is actually somewhat dull, and they quickly become repetitive and predictable. \\n\\n\r\nThese problems are fairly minor compared to some of Code Geass' other issues though. For one, the characters are archetypical and uninteresting, although that problem becomes more apparent in the next season than in this one. Some of them are quite grating as well, a trait for which Suzaku, one of the most important characters in the series, deserves special mention. The plot is a bigger problem than the characters are. It starts off tolerable enough, with the premise looking like it might deliver an enjoyable conflict between Lelouch and his opposition, but it kind of collapses toward the end of the season. About twenty episodes in, an event occurs that makes it look like there will be an end to all hostilities and Lelouch is unwilling to stop it. This could actually have served as a possible ending to the series, but instead it is resolved with one of the most contrived and nonsensical occurrences I've ever witnessed in anime. The next few episodes seem to waste a bit of time almost, and then it ends with a cliffhanger ending that could also have possibly served as an ending to the series but is also resolved by an utterly nonsensical chain of events that makes several supposedly intelligent characters embarrass themselves so that there can be a second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are less worrying. The art style is kind of strange and not visually appealing, but it also isn't terrible. The music is actually somewhat enjoyable and the voice acting is competent. There are a few other things that work somewhat as well. It's kind of enjoyable to watch the fight scenes early on and there are some conflicts that Lelouch gets out of using reasonable tactics rather than something impossible or a deus ex machina. There's a few episodes early on that are fairly solid, and Lelouch is tolerable as a protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's Code Geass. A poorly written anime with a messy plot and bad characters. Its creators clearly thought that they were more clever than I think they are, and evidently a lot of people agree with them. The bright side is that this season has a few strengths and is certainly not as terrible as the second season is.",

            "content": "To start off this review I should probably say right from the start that I'm not a huge mecha-fan, so don't come hunting me down with pitchforks and torches if I somehow offend some of you hardcore fans.\r\nRight then, Code Geass, a mecha-series taking place in Japan(Area 11), where else? Let's start this going over everything that I didn't like about the series, so we can save the good stuff for the end. First of all, this isn't a spoiler and you'll see this in the first episode, but mecha-machines with jetpowered inline-skates somehow doesn't really cut it for me... Secondly, some of the charactersin the series are really annoying, and I mean truly, honest-to-whatever-deity-you-praise annoying. We got the idealistic goody-two-shoes who wants to save everyone, the weak, confused and uncertain nuisance and some others who are just, or go, blatantly and frustratingly insane in an unamusing way. Also, some of the weapons are quite &quot;over the top&quot;, but I suppose that's common for this type of genre.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the stuff that wasn't bad! First of all, you got to love the main character no matter what, truly the main reason to watch the series is simply to see him act and think. There's also the fact that the story plotwise is engaging and interesting, aswell as dealing with many fun things, such as racism and patriotism (don't get me wrong, I don't support any of those things). The humor in the show is also quite enjoyable at times, especially the shamless, comedic gaggery that has absolutely no plot-significance, like the cat-biting jokes. The artwork is stylish and well done and the sound is of good quality. I can't say too much about the music, there wasn't anything that caught my intention like in some other shows, but then again none of the music bothered me, so it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's the summary of all this then? Well, if you like robots that war with eachother, people making up schemes and some humor mixed up somewhat then you'll probably want to watch this show. However, it wouldn't surprise me if you end up hating half of the characters and would be very happy to see them launched out of a cannon into the sun. And if the creators of the show intended to get me sucked in and force me to sit around on my butt waiting for the next season then mission bloody accomplished I suppose. Overall, it's not a bad series and there are moments of true brilliance, but some things could have been left out, or removed entirely, to make it alot better.",

            "content": "Everyone loves a good story that makes them think. \"Death Note\" is a good example of an anime that is loved mainly for that aspect. Most people will disagree with me on this subject, but I think Code Geass is in fact more thought provoking than Death Note. Don't get me wrong, I loved Death Note and I always will. However, Code Geass gave me something that Death note just couldn't...\r\nI had actually watched Code Geass about 2 years ago, and I was really glad that I did. Recently I decided to re-watch Code Geass, and in doing so I gained a new appreciation forit. I saw this quote floating around the internet, \"If Death Note is chess, then Code Geass is Checkers,\" and to some degree, I agree. As far as outwitting and being outwitted goes, I think we can all agree that Death Note is superior. What Code Geass does do, I feel, better than Death Note, is explaining the mentality of the show. \"Why did the main character do this?\" \"What is his drive for killing all these people?\" \"Is this just? In fact, what is just anyways?\" In Death Note I feel the main protagonists reasoning for killing all the people he did is... far fetched, and poorly explained. Code Geass didn't do that much better a job, but I feel getting revenge on the people who killed your mother, while at the same time creating a safe environment for your crippled sister is a bit more believable. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as character goes, I wish I could score it at an eleven (no pun intended). Maybe it's just me, but a character that is strong willed and actually able to do something for him/herself is way more attractive then the usual \"worthless sacks of shit\" that seem to dominate anime and manga today. The characters in this story would be totally perfect, but for some reason the creators felt the urge to put the most annoying, worthless, and downright pitiful character I have ever had the displeasure of watching. If you find yourself wanting to break \"Nina\"'s neck, don't worry buddy, I'm here with you.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the only (and biggest) complaints I had regarding code geass was, yes, the art. I'm not saying the art is horrible or anything- in fact- it's far from it. That is, if this were a shoujo manga or something. The heads are big, the colors are way too bright, and everyone looks way too... nice? As far as story goes, this should be one ho dank, depressing anime. The main character kills his blood brother before the first few episodes are done, for gods sake! I might just be ranting over here by myself, but in my opinion they could have chose a much better art style.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't let that discourage you from watching a great anime. After the first episode, you'll stop noticing and start code geass'n. Oh, also I noticed that a lot of people put this off because they hate the Mecha aspect of it, which I can understand. Honestly I don't get the whole Mecha fad, but it works out well for this anime. If you had any doubts about whether this is worth your time, trust me, it is.",

            "content": "Code Geass is easily my favorite anime (that goes for Code Geass R2). It combines the brilliance of Death Note with the mecha action in Gundum. Its basically about a boy, Lelouch, who obtains a sacred power to manipulate people, the Geass. He plans to take over the Britannian Empire.\r\nThe characters are very interesting. For example, CC. The pizza loving green haired heroine of Code Geass. Her past is shrouded in darkness. Her love for pizza adds a lot of humor. CC is easily a fan favorite along w/ Kallen Stadtfeld, the 2nd heroine. Shes tough and is Lelouch's main love interest. Another character ofinterest is Suzaku. Suzaku is deeply hated by many for getting in Lelouch's way. He's a japanese boy but joined Britannia to change it from the inside. My fav characters are CC and Kallen.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is best watched when all the episodes are released (and they are) due to cliffhangers. Make sure you have nothing to do because from episode 1-25 you'll be hooked.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, there is mecha combat. Combat takes place in Knightmare frames. Many people believe the mecha genre is over used. Luckily, Code Geass manages to easily balance out mech fights and the stories that happen before each fight.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass nvr lets me down. The balance of story, combat, and character development.\\n\\n\r\nPeople say Death Note and Code Geass are similar, and they're right. I personally believe Code Geass is dominent. If you liked Death Note, you should like Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass FTW!!!",

So if you think that, i would say \"watch another mech anime damnit!\" but i dunt have the time here. This is the top anime of 2007 after all. And nothingsays product placement like a pizza hut sign every episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn the terms of characters:\\n\r\nYou want someone that's bad ass? CG's got it\\n\r\nYou want someone that can survive a bullet to the head? CG's got it\\n\r\nYou want someone with a insane sense of justice? CG's got it\\n\\n\r\nEach character holds the story up in some way, even the supporting ones. You end up hating some along the way ( i can guarantee you will hate at least 2 of them) and quite a few of the support character plays some huge role either as a stepping stone or a wall in Lelouch's quest for udder world domination. As for the character art...well its nice to see Clamp is still doing the stretched limbs, but at least their faces look cool...so clamp fans should watch it for the character art i guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this anime just blows me away. Each time there seems to be some solid ground to stand on, something happens that makes that ground appear over your head. It just makes the story do a complete 180 degree turn. The more you watch the more you are impressed by it. Do not expect to be able to predict the ending of this anime, you'll be greatly surprised. Please do not watch if you are younger than 14...there is one scene that is bad for younger viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest turnoff for me on this anime would be the freakin 4 month wait between episodes 23 and 24/25 which were aired in a 1 hr special. Of course if you havent watched it yet...i say DAMN YOU!! as you did not feel the pain season running watchers like me felt. When you see the end of episode 23, think of your reaction to it, then think how you would react if ep 24 would not air until a date later this year. We had no idea when the next ep was gonna air except that it was gonna be in the summer.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you are bored and dont have any anime to watch right now, give Code Geass a shot, the first episode will get you hooked right off the bat.",

            "content": "(BACKLOG)\r\nYou know, I really was about to give up on the mech genre for awhile. I would be lying if I said giant robots beating the crap out of each-other till one of them falls over to a singing orchestra doesn't appeal to me, but what I've seen hasn't impressed me too much. Gurren Laggan had the excuse of not being supposed to be good, but I.S Infinite Stratos and Evangelion had pretty much sucked the tolerance of out of me with the pace of a tortoise running a marathon, so thanks a lot Code Geass for being actual being good! I won't lie, ithas flaws big enough to fly an apache helicopter through, but its story and characters are solid to keep me limping around the junkyard of mech anime in hope of finding something half as good until I fall over and suffocate on the discarded OP's... \\n\\n\r\n     Code Geass has a cast large to populate some European countries, but for now let's talk about Lelouch Lamperouge, a main character smarter than any teenager has any right to be. So when a mysterious woman grants him the power to give a command that his subject must obey, he does the typical thing anyone would do in that situation, and starts to take over the world under the alias \"Zero\", but not before telling an entire army squad to off themselves. He may seem like an cocky, emotionless git at the beginning but once you learn his motivation you really begin to understand him, and as the pressure of leadership piles on him, you see his confident demeanor start to crack. He really was an entertaining character, partly because he could produce some epic inspirational speeches when he wanted to, and partly because his character is complicated enough to drive the story forward, even if he could be a little annoying to watch occasionally. Suzaku Kururugi is Lelouch's childhood friend, but now is a soldier for Brittania. What makes it interesting it that even though he and Lelouch have essentially the same goals, they go about in completely different ways, which not only creates good tension, it also makes you question Lelouch and whether he's doing the right thing. Another purpose for his character I think was to let the viewer into the Brittanian Empire, so that the \"generic evil empire\" stamp avoids them. It lets you see that even some royalty aren't sure if they're doing the right thing, and this gives  good contrast for the show. \\n\\n\r\n     My biggest problem with the show is that its tone is more shaky than laundry dryer on a treadmill. Imagine someone sneaks into your house in the middle of the night and takes all the labels of your soup jars; you would be confused if you aren't one of those people that didn't fall off their bicycle as a child, and that's how I felt about the show's tone. Code Geass has a completely unnecessary high-school setting(which seems to be a requirement for anime these days) so after a heart-pounding mech fight, the show's a freakin' slice-of-life; love triangles intact. The show also has an extremely dark moment near the end, and while it pleasantly shocked me, it just seemed out of place. \\n\\n\r\n   Animation is decent enough, and even shines during some of the mech fights, but when nothing interesting is happening, it's painfully average. I understand that choice, but I don't want to be bored while the characters talk about postal stamps either! The sound fits the show, but fits like I fit into my skinny jeans, with rips and pain on both sides. I hardly ever acknowledged the background music, and even the OP's weren't that amazing, so all in all, a \"meh\" sound wise.\\n\\n\r\n     Code Geass is an intelligent anime, with good action, colorful characters, and nice pace, but it can't seem decide what it wants to be in the end. It flicks through ideas but never settles on one, and never impressed me animation wise. However, I still have the watch the second series, and this is all building to towards soe kin dof grand conclusion. Code Geass is worth your time, no doubt about it, but I'm not going out of my way to get others to see it. But wait I'm writing a positive review on it. So does that means I'm contradicting myself? You know, it's time to stop padding this review out. \\n\\n\r\n     Final Verdict: 8/10 \\n",

            "content": "How many Code Geass reviews are there? I know, way too many. I think I have something a little different to say abut the show though, so bear with me. This functions as a spoiler-free review of both seasons of Code Geass.\r\nI'm a huge Code Geass fan. I've described it before as the crack cocaine of anime because there reached a point where if the series had been the same length as One Piece it would have ruined my life. My first run-through I was truly addicted. Now I'm well aware that the show is wildly popular already. I'm pretty sure I've seen Lelouch Lamprougeon more \"favorite character\" lists than anyone else. Any top list without Code Geass will undoubtedly be assaulted by enraged fans demanding why this worldwide phenomenon isn't #1 on everything. It almost seems as though Lelouch has used the power of the king on millions of people worldwide to make them swear undying loyalty to his show. Despite this, the show does take a lot of flack from more scrutinizing critics for its plot contrivances, unexplained magic powers, absurdly over-dramatic characters, ridiculous robot sequences, and the escalation of all of these things in the show's second season. If you're the kind of person that values thematic soundness or plot cohesiveness over all else, that places an emphasis on realism over cartoon mania, feel free to sink your teeth into Code Geass. It's not Utena and it's not Eva: as I see it, Geass has two major goals:\\n\\n\r\n1. To provide insight into the true nature of revolutionary leaders and what it entails to change the world, and to challenge its viewers to pursue an equally grand change.\\n\\n\r\n2. To entertain the fuck out of its viewers.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to address the first one first. One of the things that makes Code Geass so compelling is Lelouch. Not in the sense that he's fun, though he is that, but in the sense that he is one of the most accurate reflections of the leader of a revolution or similar organization existing in fiction. People like Napoleon or Martin Luther King Jr. or even Ghandi are often drastically simplified by historical texts. People often take one of two sides: they side with the ideals of the person, or the criticize them for not being a perfect reflection of them or having alternative motives. In truth, these people are far more complex than that. Yes, they have ideals, and yes, they pursue them, but they are also human beings: they falter, doubt themselves, lose their way, have personal reasons for wanting to change a larger system. They do not behave in fully one-sided or rational ways, they are inconsistent, flawed, and confused. This is Lelouch. Lelouch breaks down the non-existent boundary between \"everyday people\" and people like Martin Luther King Jr, demonstrating that Lelouch is just as human as they are. Yes, he is an exceptionally intelligent person, but it doesn't take some genetic fluke or divine incarnation to change the world: it takes passion, determination, allies, timing: things that supposedly everyday people can have if they choose to embrace them. Lelouch initially strives to create the ideal world for Nunally, but realizes that he also legitimately wants to change the world because it's what he personally believes in as well. He claims to use people as pawns (such as Rolo) but he constantly demonstrates that he is not emotionally disconnected from them and can even alter his actions to selfishly protect those he cares about. He's neither a saint nor a martyr, and he's not asexual either (Lelouch semi-frequently demonstrates his hormonal urges, and whilst usually able to control them is not always the embodiment of chaste.) Lelouch shows that it takes more than just one brilliant mind to make a difference: all of Lelouch's allies are essential to his cause, furthering the point that just because you aren't Lelouch himself doesn't mean that you can't be an equally important part of the cause. Kallen is a far more talented nightmare pilot than Lelouch, and without her his tactics would be moot in the face of far-too superior forces. Diethard ensures that Lelouch's achievements do not go unnoticed: without publicity, his victories would be of minimal importance. Zero is an idea: he's not a person. The idea is pure, driven, resolute, refined. The people behind the idea are not. As individuals, they are messy, convoluted beings. But together they balance and complement each other and they come together to create the idea.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass doesn't come up with any solutions to war or oppression or imperialism. From a political science aspect it's a trainwreck and its resolutions are completely unbelievable. But from a people aspect, it's informed and understanding. It's inspiring. It demands more from its audience, asking them how they want to change the world and what they can do to make that happen.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's move on to part two.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is entertaining. What exactly do I mean by that? As far as I see it, there are three main elements that make Code Geass such a huge heap of fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\n#1. THE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nCode Geass has an absolutely enormous cast. In the fifth opening they actually showcase all the ones that aren't dead yet and it takes up an entire chorus. Each and every one of these characters are about as colorful and over-the-top as possible. They're loud, expressive people. They love to give speeches, profess their emotions, espouse their ideals, engage in battles of philosophy, and move/pose in dramatic fashions. From Lelouch to Suzaku to Shirley to Kallen to Lloyd, everyone is memorable. Thanks to this it's an extremely engaging cast since you can remember everyone and a lot about them. These characters are extreme, and it makes them pop like a 3-D picture book. It's more than this, though: despite being absurd, the characters are also actually really good! They all get a lot of screentime, and this is extremely beneficial because we get to see how much most of them make sense: their motivations, their growth, changes, decisions and words all fall into place in a way that is extremely satisfying.\\n\\n\r\n#2. EMOTIONAL RESONANCE\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I hate, it's stories trying to garner emotional investment through tragedy. You shouldn't have to make something horrible happen to your characters in order for me to care about them. Code Geass has plenty of tragedy but never ONCE does it rely on it. It packs an emotional punch because its characters actually grow and change drastically yet subtly, making the viewer feel as though they actually know them. This is because that's what it's like to be around actual people. They grow and change, and you don't always notice it at first but when you look back you realize it. It's because it's so effective at creating this bond between you and the characters that it doesn't need to rely on tragedy. Merely seeing the characters you care about in perilous situations creates intense investment, because the show also proves that it is not unwilling to kill them if that's what makes sense. This is the type of story where you don't care about characters because the die, you fear that they will die in the first place. One of the reasons that this is so effective is because Code Geass has a tangible sense of grounded conflict: there are tangible stakes in each battle, it is understood why the various sides are fighting, and the possibility of a variety of different outcomes feels very real. One thing that will forever stick with me is when a single poorly-timed joke from Lelouch results in Euphemia's horrific demise. It makes the show feel as though it's not glossing over the details: any small moment or decision could legitimately result in drastic repercussions.\\n\\n\r\n#3. THE ABSURDITY\\n\r\nThis is the real kicker. This is where Code Geass truly shines. The show manages to smoothly transition between being completely serious and not seeming to give a f*ck. It's like what Akame Ga Kill was going for, but actually done right. It's not even two sides of the same coin: they're completely entwined. What I mean by absurdity should be pretty obvious: Pizza Hut product placement. Lucrative bombastic speeches by Lelouch. Nonsensical conversations about mech abilities that are never explained (super energy beam cannons! Increase to 200%! Activate the rearview legacy thrusters of doom!). Unexplained magic powers. The fact that no matter what, everything always comes back to the goddamn high school. Entire episodes dedicated to chasing a cat. This works so well because never ONCE does the show have the characters draw attention to it. There's no stupid anime humor. All the characters are always completely serious, and this contrasts against the nonsense of the world they live in PERFECTLY. A lot of people complain about the amount of mech mumbo-jumbo in the second season, but I thought that it fit perfectly. The second season had some of the show's most intense and serious moments, it seems only natural to juxtapose those against a backdrop of INSANITY. What the hell is the 'Mordred' and why does it shoot death lasers from its chest?? Why can all these robots suddenly fly?? Now there's nukes, energy shields, people that can stop time, see the future, and even a collective unconscious. This is like Gurren Lagann, people, except instead of having women as housewives and teachers it has them as nuclear physicists and front-line tanks. This is the kind of over-the-top nonsense I expected from a genre with as much potential as anime, but instead we get dumb slice-of-life shows that think they're funny. Code Geass absolutely nails down fun, often at its own expense, and that's something I completely respect it for.\\n\\n\r\nNow take that surreal absurdity, add emotional attachment and add amazing characters. Hilarious, shocking, creative, fast-paced, tear-inducing, epic, and just the right amount of over the top. That's Code Geass. That's what makes it so much goddamn fun. It's not some pseudo-intellectual nihilistic bullshit like Death Note, it's not idiotic slapstick comedy, it's dumb fun that also knows how to be good. It's both intelligent and stupid, and it absolutely works.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go back for a moment though, to purpose #1.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the part where I have no idea what the creators were intending. This is pure speculation. However, regardless of intentions, Code Geass does something that more shows could definitely aspire to emulate.\\n\\n\r\nIt has an impact.\\n\\n\r\nThrough its addicting nature and emotional staying power, Code Geass might be one of the easiest shows to get obsessed with. It's massively appealing, affecting millions of fans worldwide and permeating their hearts and souls. So naturally, they're going to listen to what it has to say. It's not the most complex message, but it's an important one nonetheless. The main point is, as I discussed earlier, that it has one. Because whatever the message of a show like Code Geass is going to be, people are going to hear it LOUD AND CLEAR. Take Revolutionary Girl Utena, for example. Brilliant commentary on the nature of sexism and social expectations in society, phenomenal use of symbolism, excellent insight into adolescence and the obsession with permanence and eternity created by a fear of death. Virtually non-existent fan base. Due to its repetitive and grinding nature, slow progression, abstract presentation and confusing execution, Utena is only going to reach a very small and dedicated audience. It's not going to make an impact on a wide population, it's not going to turn into any sort of gospel of the masses, it's not going to get its point across to anyone other than a select few. Which is a real shame, because it has a lot of important things to say. But, if Utena had adopted the same tactics as Code Geass: seeking to ENTERTAIN as well as make a point, striving to engage its viewers on a fun, intelligent AND thematic level, I GUARANTEE that we would be looking at a very different reception. That version of Revolutionary Girl Utena COULD bring about the world revolution, because people would listen. Code Geass makes people listen, and then it has something to say. That is the value of entertainment: what can be done with it. That's why I think Code Geass is so great. Because it is entertaining. Because it did manage to entertain me more than any other show to date. And because it was able to do something with that. Sure, the themes are incomplete and basic, but they're also important. Code Geass isn't as refined a revolution as Utena, but it's the one that's more likely to actually happen.",

            "content": "Code Geass:Lelouch of the Rebellion portrays an intelligent young man's stuggle against the ruthless and discriminating government in an alternate history. Coupled with supernatural aspects and usage of advanced technology, it looks like this anime will take you in for a good ride. \r\nUnfortunately, from my point of view, it ended up to be a complete drag filled with fanservice, ridiculous plot lines and shallow, underdeveloped characters. And don't forget the completely irrelevant mecha which was added just for the sake of adding it.\r\nStory: A boy receives supernatural powers which have the potential of making him omnipotent. He also has a defined goal: creating apeaceful world for his sister. He is also supposed to be the master strategist...however, instead of using his Geass he goes on and starts the mecha war for no particular reason. With the power given to him he could've just waltzed into the government building and crowned himself as the new leader. End of story. No, the master strategist insisted on cool mecha wars. That is the main problem in the story: the mysterious power completely loses its meaning in the context of events portrayed. The whole thing could've rotated around the rebellion without any kind of magic powers and you wouldn't even notice. It's like they casted it out of the series and only used it in order to create ridiculous plot twists (Euphie's story) which ended up to be laughable. Filled with useless tidbits, plot holes,cliches, ridiculous plot twists the story gets a 4/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: While smooth, it had a fair share of still shot-camera pans, closeups and sometimes the anatomy of characters would get so ridiculous it puts slenderman to shame. I don't think any of this is justifiable with \"style\". 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Average as it gets. The bg music was unremarkable but it did serve its purpose. 5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Flat and unlively, poorly written and completely one-dimensional.I don't even feel like going into details there.

I failed to find it entertaining. 4/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Average. If you're able to get past the flaws and just enjoy it for the animation, character design and action, then you might enjoy this show. If you're looking for a rich and interesting plot with lively, loveable characters, steer clear. 5/10",

            "content": "Well, here I am, writing my first-ever anime review. I'm certainly no anime expert, as I tend to be very picky about what I watch and won't invest my time into a show unless I feel fairly confident that I'm going to really get something out of it. So, after reading countless rave reviews of Code Geass, I finally decided that I had to see what all the hoopla was about. It's worth noting that Death Note is my favorite anime--hell, possibly my favorite show period--of all time. It's a show that I hold dear. Naturally, I had to check out the show that constantlygets compared to my beloved Death Note, and while I doubted from the start that I would enjoy it on the same level, I had very high hopes that CG would at least take me on a riveting and stimulating ride.\\n\\n\r\nBoy, was I wrong. Look--I tend to go along with the notion that things don't get extremely popular unless there's a good reason, whether that thing suits my personal tastes or not. But now, after struggling through sixteen episodes of this show, I can honestly say that I have no idea how this show became at all popular in the first place, much less considered a rival to Death Note. That is, in my personal opinion, a complete insult to DN. I could go on for hours about the reasons why that is, but I'll sum it all up with this: the beauty of DN is in its subtlety, and how rooted in reality the concepts and events are despite the supernatural themes of it all. CG, on the other hand, wouldn't know subtlety if it ran up and spat in its face. From the first episode, the series comes off as spastic, frantic, and downright desperate to convince you that you're being entertained. While DN has a clear point and sticks to it; CG has no point. There; I've addressed the whole DN/CG comparison. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first show that I have ever made it past the second episode of and then didn't complete. How did that happen? By me clinging to the hope that the series would make a turn-around at some point and start impressing me, proving me that my first impressions had been wrong. What I got instead was a slow, steady spiral into absurdity that eventually became so unbearable that I had to abandon a series for the first time. Since spoilers are discouraged, I'll instead have a list at the bottom detailing the worst examples from my list of ridiculous, inexplicable, plot-holey moments that I managed to get through. I'll say this though, since it shouldn't count as a spoiler: the thing that finally broke me was the clapping guy. I almost turned off my Xbox after his first episode, but I was willing to press onward since it looked like his role had been concluded. When he turned up again, I just couldn't handle any more. Ironically, this guy had one of the more interesting backstories, and his was a premise that I think, in different hands, could've become something pretty compelling. It's a bad sign when the most obnoxious character in the whole show is also the only one that manages to pique my interest even 1%. The completionist in me wanted to know how the story ended (or didn't, as the case turned out to be) so I read the summaries of the remaining episodes, half hoping that I would read something mind-blowing that would make me kick myself for not sticking with it. I didn't. It should go without saying that I will not be watching the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I won't get too deep into a discussion of the art, soundtrack, etc. since it's been echoed a million times on this site already. All I'll say is that the female characters looked totally generic, and the two leading males, Lelouch and Suzaku, were shameless Gary Stus. It's no coincidence that the last episode I watched included Suzaku turning into a Spiderman-Flash chimera and outrunning/round-housing a machine gun. Aye-yay-yay. To the art's credit, Lelouch was very, very cute, and being able to stare at him may have subconsciously been what carried me (partially) through the series.\\n\\n\r\nI'll conclude with my list of ridiculousness, but I want to point something out, too. My extremely harsh review of CG may make me seem like the type that simply doesn't think any anime is good enough, but that's not true. I'm usually not that tough of a critic, and I tend to give cut shows a lot of slack. All of my favorite series have their flaws, even the ones I give 10s. I suppose the difference is that those other series managed to entertain me and get into my heart and/or soul and/or mind despite their shortcomings. CG, on the other hand, tried my patience and fortitude like no other series I've ever seen. To the millions who loved it and got a lot out of it, I'm glad for you, but I really can't understand it. To each their own, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\n****SPOILER ALERT****\\n\\n\r\nWhere did Lelouch get that helmet? Did he buy it? Are the high-tech customized villain gear stores in this alternate reality, ones that can link with your brain and reveal only your left eye whenever you will it so? Some may consider this nit-picking, but these sort of things bother me, especially in series that try to be somewhat realisitic.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole resolution to Lelouch and Shirley's...whatever it was. So I'm supposed to buy that all of their friends, not to mention the entire school, are cool with playing along with Shirley not recognizing him and knowing nothing about him? For like, ever? I would love for someone to look me dead in the eye and tell me with a straight face that that whole plotline wasn't completely idiotic.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same vein, the fact that no one ever tried to pin Lelouch down about his suspicious behavior, as well as how conveniently MIA he was each and every time something big with the Black Knights happened, really bothered me. Coupled with the fact that Zero has his exact height, build, and practically the same voice, and you've got yourself a supporting cast that's dumb as rocks in order to protect the \"story\" from falling apart after episode 4.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other little things I could get into, but it would quickly become redundant, and this review has gotten too long already. Perhaps shockingly, however, I will answer \"yes\" to the \"would you recommend this\" question, with one stipulation. I would recommend this to someone who has never seen any other anime before, so that I could then show them some decent series and be able to use CG as a baseline. As in, \"see how great that was? SO much better and more sensible than how they did it in Code Geass.\"",

            "content": "Just a disclaimer here, this review will be for R1 and R2. There will also be spoilers mentioned in this review. So this will mainly be for people that have already watched this anime, or atleast have watched season 1.\r\nCode Geass is one of the worst anime ever made. I don't think there are any other anime or manga that I've seen that are worse than Code Geass in terms of quality. \r\nSTORY/PLOT: 1/10\r\nThe story is very simple. Lelouch gets his Geass power and wants to get revenge on the Britannian Empire. Eventually Lelouch does accomplish his goal due to asspulls, plot holes, deus exmachina, and retcons. It's actually hilarious to me how this anime tries to be intelligent, yet ends up being the complete opposite. \\n\\n\r\nOne problem I have with the story is the filler highschool episodes. None of these episodes have anything to do with the story. It's literally all just a bunch of garbage filler that doesn't progress the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of filler episodes that had nothing to do with the plot; the entire Mao arc! This is easily the worst episodes Code Geass has to offer. One part of this arc made absolutely no sense whatsoever that I just have to talk about it. In episode 14 Mao and Shirley both have  guns to Lelouch's back and says if he uses the Geass he will shoot. Mao then goes back into the train to pick up a shotgun. He then says \"I will just take care of them both\". And then C2 helps Lelouch escape. If you cant see the awful writing in that then I don't know what to tell you. He had a fucking GUN aleady, and then he goes back to get another gun for no reason at all. That's only one example of stupid shit from Code Geass, there are many more examples of stupid shit.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of stupid shit from Code Geass; Mao not dying even though he was shot like hundreds of times. Now you know how I said this anime tries to be smart but fails at it? This just the perfect example of that. Many Geass fans often say that he survived due to advanced medical technology. That still makes absolutely no sense! It doesn't matter how advanced technology is, if someone gets shot 100 times then they have no possible chance of surviving.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on that stupid plot twist involving Euphy. I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about. That was hands down one of the lamest asspull/plot twists I've ever seen in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the plot would be the mech fights. There's just too much mech fights in this anime that don't go anywhere. It's even worse in season 2 because the writers just throw strategy out the window. Season 2 is just about who has the stronger mech, not about who is more strategic. For example, there was a moment where Lelouch was cornered by the Chinese Federation. What did he do to escape you might ask? He fucking got a stronger mech, not by outwitting his enemies. And Kallen must've fought Suzaku like 100 times in these boring ass mechs. It just gets absolutely boring to watch. I didn't watch this anime to see these stupid Shounen mech battles, I came to see Lelouch outwitting his opponents. This anime is FILLED filled with lame mech battles that don't go anywhere. Funny thing is, even when Lelouch outsmarts his enemies Suzaku just comes out of nowhere and then saves the day. Everyone just goes home after that. This is how the show just gets extremely repetitive and boring for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother plot hole is when Lelouch somehow commanded the entire country to follow him. I'm pretty sure it was stated that the Geass requires eye contact to actually work. I don't think it's possible ofr Lelouch to make eye contact to every single individual, therefore this makes absolutely no sense. \\n\\n\r\nEven more plot holes, why didn't the Emperor just kill Lelouch? He had no use for Lelouch so I don't understand why he didn't kill him? It was never explained why he decided to wipe his memories and have him live a normal life.\\n\\n\r\nAnother plot hole that I have that made no sense; how did the Black Knights produce over a million zero outfits without being noticed? This was one of the worst asspulls I've seen in any anime! It makes no sense for them to not be noticed due to the amount of resources and people that were used to produce these costumes. \\n\\n\r\nThere's one thing that I always didn't make sense to me. Ever since Lelouch's first broadcast, how the fuck did people not know that it was him? It's quite weird how the people that have known Lelouch for all his life didn't instantly recognize his voice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot of Code Geass is awful. There are many plot holes or just things that make absolutely no sense. People say Code Geass has a good ending, but I honestly don't care about it. I also didn't care about Lelouch finally achieving his goal because it was only possible due to asspulls and plot holes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION 0/10\\n\\n\r\nLets be honest here, the art in Code Geass is absolute trash. How can I take these characters seriously when they're all built like sticks with their noodle ass arms. I also was never impressed with the animation. It was just average animation, nothing impressive at all.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\\n\r\nThere's only one decent character in Code Geass. That's it, only one decent character.People always talk about how Lelouch is such a well written character, but I completely disagree with that. \\n\\n\r\nSo lets talk about why Lelouch is overrated. There are a lot of character inconsistencies in Code Geass. One example of a character inconsistency is when Lelouch was crying when Rollo died. This made absolutely no sense. This is the same character that said he will just use Rollo until he becomes useless and then he'll throw them away. That made no sense because he pities Rollo when Rollo dies...? \\n\\n\r\nSuzaku is definitely the worst character in the series. Suzaku always believed that the results don't matter if you used the wrong method to gain those results. One episode he completely changes his beliefs. He says that the results are the only thing that matters, not the means. This is just bad writing at it's finest. This isn't even called characterdevelopment, this is just a character inconsistency. He just randomly changes his beliefs and it was poorly executed. The second I watched this part I just cringed way too hard.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single time Lelouch outsmarts his enemies, Suzaku comes and sends the Black Knights home with his broken Lancelot. This same thing happens over and over and over again for the majority of the first season that it just becomes ridiculous and frustating. Suzaku is such an unlikeable character it's just insane! He first says that results don't matter if the methods to achieve that result is morally wrong. Suzaku says that Lelouch's ways of doing things are wrong, yet he never did anything to accomplish his goal himself! They both have the same goal but at least Lelouch was doing SOMETHING. Suzaku did absolutely nothing to accomplish his goal, therefore he's a badly written character. It seems to me that he was a scumbag that only cared about gaining more power.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about Kallen for a bit. i love me some fanservice once in a while. That's pretty much all there is to this character. I couldn't care less about her motives and her backstory at all. Here's why I didn't care; her brother wasn't even introduced to us, so why should I care about her wanting to get revenge? We don't even get to see an in depth backstory at all so why should I care about this character?\\n\\n\r\nC2 has got to be the most boring character I've seen in an anime. She doesn't do much at all. She's just a boring one dimensional character that I never really cared about. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a LOT of characters that are pretty much living plot devices. Rollo is the perfect example of a living plot device. He has poor characterization, he's one dimensional, and the only thing he did was help Lelouch. Jeremiah is another example of a living plot device, mainly in season 2. He just comes out of nowhere and says that he wants to team up with Lelouch..? I understand that he was loyal to Lelouch's mother, but that just came out of nowhere. That's just a stupid asspull that was used just to get Lelouch out of the bad situation he was in. \\n\\n\r\nTbh, Lelouch really carried this trash ass show. Even though I consider him to be just a decent character, he's far superior to every other character in the series. Every other character is just awful, and that's all there is to it. I don't want to drag this review out more, so that's it.\\n\\n\r\nART: 0/10\\n\r\nANIMATION: 1/10\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 0/10\\n\r\nPLOT: 0/10\\n\\n\r\nThis awful anime does not deserve the score it has. Absolute dog shit.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Many people tend to compare Code Geass to Death Note, while they do have things in common, Code Geass is no match for Death Note. This review only contains first season, because after finishing the first season I have no desire whatsoever to continue second season. I will explain why Code Geass is no masterpiece and at most a decent anime so bear with me before clicking that not helpful botton. \r\nStory: 6\r\nCode Geass is essentially about a high school student Lelouch who was given a power named Geass to control other people by looking through their eyes. Lelouch is heir to Britanian Empire, butafter his mother was killed and his father show no emotion for his mother's death, he relinquished his rights and was expelled to Japan, a nation colonised by the Empire. Lelouch, with his Geass power, now tries to overthrow the Empire and revenge his mother's death. The reason why Story of Code Geass is only worth a 6 is because also many said it has a lot of plot twists and colliding ideology, etc, etc. By further looking into the story, the plot is actually very simple and cliche. The main storyline is about Lelouch and his childhood friend susake's colliding ideology. So to put it in a simple way, Lelouch seeks peace through violence and power, by destroying his opponents at all costs and Suzaku seeks peace by \"trying to gain a position within the empire and avoid violence\". How is that even \"complex\"? You could easily see that sort of ideology collision in Deathnote, light Vs L, Akame ga kill, night raid vs Ran, naruto, pain vs naruto, attack on titan, Eren vs armin. Though they differ a little in different animes, it is basically the same approach where one supports violence and the other takes a softer approach. It is amusing how anyone could say that it is \"unique\" and \"complex\". Code Geass also has a lot of plotholes, one thing I dislike the most is that the mecha element in this show is completely a mess. There is no explanation given to the standards involved in these fights, we don't know how these mechas function, their weaknesses or their relative strength. There is a mech called lancelot, appeared to be one of the toughest mech out there, but even then we don't know how strong it is quantitatively, what I mean is that in these battles, what we can see is lancelot destroying one mech after another in early episode and then another mech is introduced driven by kellan and after that another bad-ass mech driven by C.C and lelouch. What I see is that the show throws powerful mechs at you without explaining anything about them. This makes fights in Code Geass lackluster because all fights at the end resorts to the fact that which side has the most bad-ass mech, this fact completely defeats the \"tactic\" element in Code Geass. Apart from that, the Geass ability is very inconsistent through the show, there are no rules for this ability like there are ten rules for death note. Another problem with Code Geass is a common problem in most shows: it trivalise the idea of \"rebellion\" or \"revolution\". Same in Akame ga kill, rebellion is depicted as something only about power fights, little was mentioned about politics, economics and other key elements. I know you can't demand an anime to consider all that, but i am not contented with the way Code Geass deals with the idea of \"rebellion\". There are many other problems  that I will not mention here due to word counts, but all other problems are not minor.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nArt is consistent through out, although i am no fan of this type of animation, It is generally good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nNow this is the worst part of Code Geass, many other people say that characters in this show are complex and different. Yes they are different and varies a lot, but they are no way near complex, some of the characters are completely ridiculous and irrational. \\n\r\nLet's begin with suzaku. Image your country is colonised by another country, and there is a guy from your country who joined the invading country and fights your own people. This guy is what suzaku is. He tried to change the status quo by securing a position in Empire at the same time fighting lelouch multiple times where he literally destroyed many chances of Japan being independent. But for now let's assume he is really that stupid and believe in whatever he believes. now look that what he is doing, did he try to secure a position in politics and try to persuade royal members? did he make propaganda about equality and peace? NO and NO, he sits in his lancelot and fights his own people, this is how this guy wants to change the empire from within. Now at this point I can still bear with this incredibly irrational character, but not until the point he faced zero and when empire fired missles at them he refused to escape even though it means dying with zero. Now What the heck is with this scene? Let us be clear that suzaku tries to change the empire from within, now how are you going to do that if you are dead? I am curious. After watching that episode, suzaku in my opinion changes from an irrational character to a complete joke. \\n\r\nNow let's talk about lelouch, he is not bad character but is very inconsistent, as smart as he is, he doesn't know if someone's following him, becomes easily emotional in battles, accidentally caused a massacre( yes you heard me right, the biggest plot twist is accidentally caused, this literally means the following plots and what lelouch does after that is not what he planned for ). As a main character with so many sentiments, his background is as plain as it could be: \"my mother is killed so sad I need to revenge for her\". \\n\r\nOther side characters are either occupy little screen or are irrational in different degrees. \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: 4\\n\r\nI did enjoy the show, that is what make me finish the first season, otherwise I would have dropped it mid way. However, once I finished it and think about the show backwards, it is a joke to me, what Code Geass is is an anime that takes many popular elements of the decades and mix them together in a very bad way and produced a half-decent hybrid that has so many plot holes and irrational characters. Yet many people think this is a masterpiece. But no , trust me, if you really think deep about suzaku and lelouch's motivation and their doings, you would realize just how ridiculous they are. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNo masterpiece, only a decent overrated anime.",

            "content": "Credit where credit is due, this show has one really great OP. And that's it, that's literally all the credit I'm willing to give, I hate literally everything else.\r\nLet's go ahead and start with my biggest complaint that makes itself evident in the first 5 minutes of the show; this show has the single most insulting writing for a \"smart\" main character I have ever seen. The main character of Lelouch is introduced to us by telling, not showing, us he wins a supposedly unwinnable game of chess, intercut with a completely useless and unnecessary scene of a girl changing into a swimsuit doting overhow smart he is when he isn't even there. Despite being at maximum hype levels after the OP, I was ready to drop this show 5 minutes in, but I kept watching because of how popular and beloved this show is. Needless to say, I regret that decision, the entire show works on the same weak logic, lazy story telling, and horrid character writing.\\n\\n\r\nMy hatred of Lelouch only grew though, peaking after what happens with Shirley. I can't say what it was he did without a pretty major spoiler, but he had so many options available to him, and he chooses possibly the most stupid option possible. Then the show insults me by trying to treat it as a sad moment despite it being entirely his own fault.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I dislike Lelouch though, he might genuinely be the best character in the show. If I broke down every single character and why I hated them, I'd be here forever, but they're all completely one dimensional and fall into 3 basic categories; useless, senseless, and manipulative. Most of the useless characters are girls that could easily be written out of the story, but they wanted to keep in sexual themes and dumb highschool drama, the worst example being the girl who had sex with a table (yes you read that right and it's actually dumber than it sounds). Every character in the show lacks logical consistency, but several are completely defined by their senselessness such as Suzaku who tries to explain his thought process multiple times and somehow it becomes more self contradictory every single time to the point where he becomes nothing more than a nonsensical plot point to create drama. The worst of the worst however are characters like Shirley and Nunnally who just scream \"PITY ME!!!\" by having as tragic stories as possible and literally nothing else to their characters.\\n\\n\r\nI can't believe I made it this far without even mentioning the many many plot conveniences. I can't get into specifics without spoiling everything, but this show requires absolutely massive amounts of suspension of disbelief, I've heard the things that make the climax happen described as \"the worst writing of all time,\" and while that's obviously hyperbole, the sentiment is right. This is the part of the show most people who dislike it point to as to why they dislike it, but honestly, by the time I got to that point, I didn't even care and it almost got into \"so bad it's good\" territory. It didn't though, it's still pathetic and an insult to my intelligence because they once again try to make me feel remorse for circumstances that were entirely avoidable if not for how stupid every single character was.\\n\\n\r\nActually, let me harp on those unearned emotional moments for a bit. One of them I can harp about isn't even a spoiler, during the first episode, two characters heavily featured in promotional material and the OP get shot and appear to be dead, Lelouch even says so himself. They're both just fine, it was a complete misdirect for the purpose of drama. Every single time the show tries to have a moment, there is something that makes it stupid instead of sad, and by the halfway point, I was just pissed off. No other show I've seen has ever managed to screw up basic writing like this one has.\\n\\n\r\nI can't end the review without at least addressing the presentation, which was easily the best part of the show. The character designs were pretty solid actually, and the music definitely had its moments, but overall I found the show just boring to watch with extremely limited animation at times where the only movement was moving lips or panning over still shots of mechs with bullet effects, with the budget obviously going to animating the actions of unique mechs, but even those weren't anything great, rarely having more than a couple frames for an individual action, so it left me underwhelmed. At first I felt bad judging a show because it was made over a decade ago, but after doing a little bit of research, I learned this show came out around the same time as Gurren Lagann and actually came out after Eureka Seven. Those shows might have been done by better studios, but that doesn't change the fact that they are so much more interesting to look, you can feel the creativity in all of the key shots while Code Geass feels minimalistic at all times.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I'm only scratching the surface of all the things I dislike, but I want to put this show behind me. It's garbage, the worst thing I've ever even tried to watch and I can't believe I made myself sit through it.",

Make no mistake, there are still all the typical mecha elements present, but Code Geass is by no means to be lumped with them - the thrill is in watching the bold planning and execution of Lelouch, the Emperor of Brittania, and others as they play out a high-stakes game of strategy and tactics with war machines.Furthermore, those who enjoy trying to figure out the plans and tactics used before they are revealed will have an absolute field-day with this one - trying to predict just how each battle (and the war as a whole) will play out is no easy task - the thrill of the ever-changing plot is real.",

            "content": "It's been a while since I watched this, but I felt like I should weigh in against the mountain of praise.  \r\nCode Geass is an exercise in wasted potential.  The basic idea of the show could have been interesting with the right handling, but not like this.  \r\nI never sat through more than a couple of episodes at a time.  I was constantly annoyed by the fact that the show expects viewers to accept whatever Lelouch does as brilliant, instead of thinking for themselves.  In particular, there is one part that had me thinking \"Why is he doing this?He has access to military hardware and personel.  He has a thousand easy ways to solve this problem without being anywhere near it.  This is positively moronic.\"  If he was a chess player, he'd be the kind that plays only with his queen, and that can only go so far.  If he was really that brilliant he'd make masterful use of all his pieces instead.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat's more, the overall feel of the show is really not that different from every other show made for teenage audience.  Maybe I've tried a few thousand more titles than the people who like this thing, but seriously, it's the usual circus.  \"Look how (insert hyperbole here) this is!\" all day long.  It takes more than that to hold my interest.  \\n",

            "content": "Take the Death Note concept and execute it a bit less well, take the high school comedy genre and execute it as well as the genre really allows (that is to say, clich\u00e9d beyond saving), make the critical addition of hot mecha action, and you have Code Geass. Except that doesn\u2019t do it justice, because what makes Code Geass enjoyable and unique is exactly this awkward smorgasbord. Geass is a shounen that mostly doesn\u2019t take itself seriously, accomplishing a satisfying balance between the darker political mindgames and the light-hearted school life. That is all the producers set out to accomplish in season 1 (of 2)and to this regard they have succeeded heroically.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Code Geass is only the starting block for the larger scale events of Code Geass R2, it certainly does not hold back, delivering from the get go the twists and turns that a political drama demands. It appears at first to be nothing more than a classic mecha/highschool anime with a few ideas of its own thrown in, but I found myself engrossed when, at times, it twisted the light-hearted and over the top theme of the show completely on its head. When it needs to, Geass delivers a genuinely intriguing and shocking battle of wits between our anti-hero Zero, the secret identity of Lelouch, and the might of the British Empire. Yes you read that right by the way, the British Empire has taken over Japan in Code Geass, which is impossible and awesome in equal measures.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a very important feature to Code Geass that stands out: That of Lelouch\u2019s power, Geass, which guarantees him absolute obedience of anyone he should wish to use it on. The exact nature of this power though is kept purposefully vague in the first season, playing a more significant part in R2. This has its benefit and disadvantages in my mind, but suffice to say that the context surrounding this Geass power is certainly not forgotten in season 1, and is addressed sufficiently well enough for the audience to appreciate its strengths and weaknesses. \\n\\n\r\nThe first and last few minutes of each episode are where Geass stumbles the most. Colors is one of the best ops ever, plain fact. It is truly unfortunate then that one of anime\u2019s best ops stands next to the gold award winner for one the worst op I have subjected my ears to. Further to this, the second op makes the unfortunate compromise of reusing a significant portion of clips from the first op video. I recommend just playing the first op over the video of the second op \u2013 you won\u2019t be able to tell the difference, and your ears will thank you for it. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a general both-good-and-bad theme going on in this review, and this extends right down to the animation quality. Character models are blown vastly out of proportion, and although I got used to it, it still stuck out as a sore thumb. Otherwise though, the animation is pleasant and colourful for a 2006 anime, a stark contrast to the black and white palette of Death Note (which curiously aired the same year as Geass. That would have been a fun year to watch anime). Mecha fights are enjoyable if uninspired, but then I would never expect a mecha fight to be anything more than clich\u00e9d. The ultra-powerful Lancelot mech is the saving light to Geass\u2019 fights, with the help of Suzaku in the Lancelot\u2019s cockpit, who is both Lelouch\u2019s best friend and most hated enemy, this one man army card is played as well as it could be. The contrast between Suzaku\u2019s innate mecha ability and Lelouch\u2019s careful planning is the heart and soul of any scene with a mech in it. \\n\\n\r\nI think I sound as though I\u2019m damning the show, but that is certainly not the message I want to be getting across. Code Geass is a fun and inventive take on the psychological mecha genre best exemplified by shows like Evangelion, although in contrast to Eva, Code Geass took the initiative to place a much larger focus on the high-school side of things, too large a focus for me. Lelouch though is a genuinely fantastic protagonist throughout, on par or superior to the likes of Yagami Light, and Code Geass does not hide the fact that its protagonist is not really the hero we expect him to be. By the end of season 1, what started as the story of a simple high school student given a strange power has become a battle for the future of a nation, with the same school boy at the centre of it all. It saddens me a bit to admit it, but it would be impossible to picture Code Geass without the light-hearted moments to counter the moments of exciting high-stakes drama.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations: Death Note. Both shows thrive of the confrontation between friends who are unknowingly each other\u2019s enemies. Geass has Lelouch and Suzaku, and Death Note was at its best during the direct confrontations between Kira/Light and L.\\n",

            "content": "An anime that has a good concept, but unfortunately turned out to be horrible. This is by far the most rage inducing and stupid anime I've watched to date. Also, please don't read this review if you're someone that gets offended easily. \r\nI'll just give a quick synopsis of the story first. Code Geass is a story about Lelouch and his quest for vengance against the Brittanian Empire. The Britannian Empire is the strongest nation in the world and they eventually conquer Japan, renaming it to Area 11. Lelouch seeks vengance for Britannia because of his mothers death, and he just wants to make theworld a better place for his sister. At the beginning of the series, another character named C2 gives him a power named \"Geass\". This is a power that allows him to give commands to anyone just by giving eye contact, and they'll obey anything. The story starts from there.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the anime actually has a strong start to it. I liked the main character and liked the fact that he had such a cool power. It did a great job of hooking me in ever since the first 2 episodes. I've only had a couple of minor problems with the anime at this point. The only thing I wanted to know about is how Lelouch is so \"smart\" to begin with? What makes a high school kid so smart to the point where he's trying to start an entire rebellion? Well, that's isn't that big of a deal. My problem with this anime isn't even the story at all. My problem with it is the bad writing and the poor execution. I feel as if this anime could've been a masterpiece if it wasn't written so badly. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'll be talking about the good parts of Code Geass. As I said before, the story is actually pretty interesting. Code Geass has decent animation to it. It's not that special, but not bad at all. The openings/endings/background tracks are pretty awesome. The voice acting is also pretty well done. Lelouch is actually a damn good character, and very enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, that's all the good things I have to say about this anime. Now I'll be talking about whats bad about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this anime is how pretentious and edgy it is. The writers tried to make it seem smart, but it really wasn't. The only reason Lelouch was able to last as long as he did was because of plot armor and asspulls. For example, somehow him and his \"Black Knights\" produced 1 million copies of the same Zero outfit. That makes absolutely no sense at all. And everytime Lelouch is cornered he always ends up surviving because of asspulls. \\n\\n\r\nThe perfect example of this is when he was cornered by the Chinese Federation in season two. He didn't think of a plan or anything. He ended up surviving because of plot armor and asspulls. I'm not going to go too much into detail, but anyone that actually watches the anime knows what I'm talking about. A smart character wouldn't need asspulls to help him escape from a dangerous situation. A smart character would think and come up with a plan. A smart person wouldn't be consumed by power and ambition. A smart person would engage in some sort of moral reflection, and Lelouch has never done that. That's exactly why he lost control of his power and ended up getting thousands of people killed. A smart character would've never let that shit happen. That's exactly why I consider this anime to be fake smart. Infact, this anime has some of the most stupid characters you'll ever find in anime in general.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about stupid characters, this anime is filled with them. Infact, Lelouch is the only likeable character in this anime. Every other character is one dimensional, and they get absolutely no character development at all. \\n\\n\r\nWell, maybe Suzaku did get some character development, but it definitely wasn't good. The only time I remember him getting development was when he just randomly said \"RESULTS MATTER MORE THAN THE MEANS\". Suzaku is supposed to be the complete opposite of Lelouch, yet the writers just ruined the character that they built up. Now that he just randomly changed his beliefs, it makes the rivalry between him and Lelouch non existant. That just made him a boring character to me. This is pretty much poor execution at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the other characters, none of them are interesting in the slightest. As I said before, only like two characters get developed. Everyone is boring and don't have any sort of depth to them whatsoever. C2 has got to be one of the worst female characters I've ever seen. Her entire character is pretty much just a plot device. Anytime something bad happens to Lelouch, she'll be there to save him. That is the definition of a living/breathing plot device. As for Kallen, I don't really think she's a bad character at all. I feel as if she would've been a good character if she was fleshed out more. Unfortunately her only role in this anime was to fight with her lame ass mech. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about fights, Code Geass has a lot of them. Let me tell you this, Code Geass has really boring fights. It's not even because they're fighting in mechs, it's just because it's somehow so boring. I've watched a lot of mech shows, but somehow Code Geass makes mech fights seem so boring. Some people say that it isn't mech focused, but I have to completely disagre with that. Maybe in season one it wasn't mech based, but in season two all they fucking do is fight in their lame ass mechs. I'll be explaining what I mean by that later on. \\n\\n\r\nSeason two specifically has a lot of boring mech fights and none of them end up being good. They just keep fighting the same battles over and over again ad nauseam. I think the boring mech fights are just there just to take up screen time. These boring ass mech fights really made season two so boring to watch. As technology goes up, the use of strategy goes down. Instead of using strategy to win, season two is all about who has the stronger mech. That's pretty lame.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass has a lot of boring filler that doesn't really do anything for the story. The entire Mao arc was just completely stupid overall. It didn't contribute anything to the main storyline, so I have no idea why it's as long as it was. That was easily the worst part of the entire anime IMO. That's where most of the illogical/nonsensical things took place.\\n\\n\r\n There's also a bunch of school filler involved in this anime and it's just silly. One second Lelouch is making plans of how he will destroy Brittania, and the next the anime turns into slice of life bullshit. The entire school setting in this anime was completely unnecessary. It didn't contirbute anything to the plot whatsoever. None of those characters from the school should've gotten more than a minute of screen time. I don't remember their names, but they sure as hell got a lot of screen time when they shouldn't have. That's just pure stupidity from the writers, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Code Geass is very bad. I honestly felt sick when I first saw how the characters looked. They're literally built like sticks and have huge heads. It's not that big of a deal, but yeah it was pretty bad. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this is an extremely overrated anime. It definitely doesn't deserve the rating it has. Don't watch it :)\\n",

            "content": "Story: I really enjoyed how this storyline rolls out, it's just like deathnote, the first episode pulls you right into what's going on and the second one fuels your interest. The rest of the episodes expand on the simple plot and twist and turns it, but all along the way you have a good idea of what's going on. \r\nThough as much as the storyline can resemble Deathnote, I managed to dig out a bunch more themes. This is very much like a mix of Deathnote's \"I want to change the world to my liking\" plus Full Metal Alchemist's \"What is a human capable ofdoing?&quot; It's extremely psychological and introduces people to a different way of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Overall the art is fine, though I'm not really picky with art. Sometimes Leloouch's blocky hair made me a bit unsure, but those are just sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I don't recal much music in the episodes, just the little mood adders, those were really good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Yes, there is a bunch of character developement. Lelouch slowly becomes more evil (like Light from Deathnote) yet he still manages to cling to his human emotions to his sister and friends. And C.C. also has some changes, though the seris she becomes more open to Lelouch (though it does seem like he's manipulating her). My favourite character developement is on Suzaku, when he changes from a loving, nice boy to a killer because of what Zero does to him (not spoiling hopefully). The rest of the characters also undergo some little changes, but I'm not going to get into them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I just finished this anime yesterday and now I can't wait until the Second season comes out next year (Spring 2008). For anyone who loves a good mix of different genres, Code Geass has everything. Also for those who finished Deathnote and is undergoing obessions and such, WATCH CODE GEASS!",

            "content": "I had originally watched part of the first episode of this series with little expectations, as other mecha series such as Gundam Seed had left an impression on me. One might call this a mecha anime, but the reason you'll love it is so much more than that.\r\nStory: This story is without a doubt the greatest thing I've ever experienced. The concept of all the secrecy and involvement of Lelouch's friends is very interesting, and it's not very often you find a very popular anime about rebellion against a kingdom in a modern world that is taking over everywhere. My realization of how wonderful thestory is handled came along towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm not much one to take into account an anime series' animation style, but it is indeed very good looking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Again, I don't really compare musical scores to different anime series, but some of this series' ending and opening themes were particularly good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now this is another reason that makes it so amazing, the character development. It's rather amazing to look back at the first episode and see how much it's all changed. The interaction between the characters because of the story elements is truly different, and I have yet to see anything that is better at this. There is one part of the series involving Lelouch using the Geass on someone, and it was just so non-stereotypical in the way the events turn out it amazed me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This series is very enjoyable, mostly because of the story. The endings of individual episodes were also more enjoyable than most other series, as there were a lot of cliff hanger endings that left me awake until two in the morning just because I NEEDED to know what happened. This series really just had a lasting effect of amazing. Every time I've tried to describe the ending to my friends, honestly, the only words that come to me are &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;wow&quot;. This series definitely must be watched by anyone.",

            "content": "I'm stepping out of my dark corner in order to write a review for the only anime I feel I can. This is also my first review so I'll try my best not to be too sloppy.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nNow before I have people who praise this anime hate on me for not giving it a 10/10 for the story listen to this, this anime has a second season. This second season is the only reason I give the story a 9 as I feel that for those who don't know about the second season would be quite disappointed. (I know I was it took mea week to find R2). The basics of the plot is the year is 2010 and the Holy Britannia have control over 2/3 of the world and has just taken over Japan, dubbing it Area 11 and the Japanese, 'Eleveners'. Enter Lelouch the once 11th Prince of Britannia who was cast to Japan with his sister Nunnally by their father King of Britannia 'Charles Vi Britannia'. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason  gave the art style an 8 is because it really matters on the person watching its preference. Personally I am more-so inclined to watch an anime with a moe-esque characters and scenery, i.e Non Non Biyori. But for an anime that started almost 10 years ago and ran for slightly under a year it has high quality designs and has little things that make it what it is. Such as Lelouchs' eye when he uses Geass and Zeros' mask having an eye slot.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I can really get into Code Geass, the voices, the music, the OP's and ED's are all so magnificent that I can listen to them now and still enjoy them the same as the first time I heard them, (Notably Stories and Madder Sky, from R2). I chose to watch the dub when I first watched Code Geass and I have since rewatched the dub and watched the sub once and am genuinely pleased to say they are both extraordinary, Johnny Yong Bosch did an incredible job portraying Lelouch and I recommend both sub and dub to people thinking about watching the show, as they both hold up to standard. Back to the soundtrack, without the soundtrack Code Geass wouldn't be half the show it is, it has 45 tracks (from what I gather) and each one of them are used so well that it adds a form of involvement into the show that some anime do not have. It has to have one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard even if you don't want to watch the show I recommend looking into it's soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with the characters is some of them feel a bit forced not so much in a bad way but there's still that presence. Not to mention Nina Einstein the craziest motherf**cker I have ever seen in anime, and I've seen Mirai Nikki. I can't say to much about the characters with out feeling like I'm spoiling stuff, but the characters you need to focus on, i.e Lelouch are done almost to perfection and push the show that little bit further forwards.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow even tho I have bickered on bits and pieces Code Geass and it's sequel have to be one of my all time favourite anime and I am quite pleased I didn't spoil any of it, it has been likened to Death Note quite alot and seeming that I have accidentally one way or another spoiled the hell out of that, I would have to agree. Given I feel like Code Geass just has that special something that makes it unique. I would buy this anime without hesitation, and have recommended it to my friends more times than I can account for, the way the music resonates and the characters and story develops are beyond my words and it does something that many anime try for and alot fall short on. It makes you think, about morals, about humanity, about social problems that plague us today such as racism. \\n\\n\r\nOverall -\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said and done I give Code Geass R1 a overall of 8.94 out of 10 as without it's second season it would not be near the anime it is today. The fact that even today 9 years after it's making you can go to videos to do with it one YouTube and just see 'ALL HAIL LELOUCH' shows how much of a cultural milestone it is and how much of an affect it has had on the community, I recommend this anime only if your willing to think about what is going on in front of your eyes and are willing to put full attention into it whist you watch each episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope that I did well enough to garner some people into watching this show and I also hope that this review was up to scratch.",

            "content": "I have to say, that Code Geass is one of  the few animes that I can watch over and over again, in jap or dub, and not get bored of it. It still gives me goosbumps everytime I watch it. Even though I know what's going to happen. When I first came across this anime, I wasn't at all interested because it was a mecha show. But, I decided to give it a shot.  While watching Code Geass, I started to fall in love with the story line and the characters.  Also, while watching this anime, I may have become bipolor, dueto the fact that for one minute I was yelling at my computer, then was laughing and crying the next. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I love about this anime, is the character development. As the story progress you become really attach to the characters, as there are many friendships, relationships and betrayal that happens to them. And you see how they change from beginning to end.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Art in this anime is futuristic and high detail, and doesn't at all looks dull. The opening and closing theme songs are very catchy to sing or hum along to and they place the perfect background audio for specific parts in the anime that makes you want to pay attention. Like in a horror movie.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen Death Note, then the idea between the main characters are the same. Wanting the rid the world of evil. But, the way that Lelouch (*main character*) proceed with the idea is what makes this anime better than D.N. Lelouch exudes a sense of authority while holding a hidden contempt for authority and has a brilliant mind. The guy is smarter than you, knows it and will wait patiently until the exact moment to pummel you down to the ground. What sets Lelouch apart from the dozen other geniuses is his down to earth nature. He may be willing to toy with human lives, but when it comes to his friends and family, he unwittingly shows a more vulnerable side that is distinctly human.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to wrap up this review, obviously I give this anime a 10 out of 10. Even if you're not the type of person who like mecha shows, I recommend you give this anime a try. I promise you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "This review covers both the first and the second season of Code Geass. Code Geass is one of the most enjoyable anime I've ever seen. It's addictive, has awesome mecha fights, great music and an interesting main character. But it's also one of the most overrated anime ever created. \r\n\"What! Code Geass, overrated? Blasphemy! How dare you to insult one of the most popular and amazing anime this way, you just didn't understand this masterpiece!\"\r\nWell, Code Geass is not a masterpiece, the first season was pretty good, but the second season was just retarded. Why? \r\n~Story~ 4/10\r\nOur main character Lelouch is an exiled Britannian prince,who wants to avenge his dead mother and disabled sister. And (of course) the evil Britannian empire occupied Japan (again) and (of course) our hero joins with the brave rebels who want to free poor Japan (again). In exactly how many anime is Japan occupied by a foreign nation? It's not even funny anymore, do Japanese people have some kind of victim-syndrome? \\n\r\nBut okay, our hero accidentally meets C.C. a pretty, mysterious girl who gives him superpowers, Geass. Now, Lelouch has to ability to control the will of everyone he sees, of course there are some limitations but Geass is extremely strong. This raises the question: Why did it take Lelouch so many episodes to achieve his goals? He did some things in the least effective way possible so the viewer could see more mecha fights and bombastic speeches, this is fun but it just doesn't make sense. Another problem with the story is that it doesn't really knows if it wants to be a high-school comedy or a serious and dramatic mecha anime with politics. You can't mix these two ideas and expect them to work, it is really weird that the viewers are supposed to care about stupid high-school drama after they have seen wars in which a lot of people died. Well, we see our protagonist in high-school and he teams up with the rebels and he tries to free Japan while having fun with the school council. The story progresses, apparently everyone in his school is either a rebel or part of the military and Lelouche wins every fight because of his \"brilliant\" strategies or Geass. There is a lot of melodrama, Lelouche has a harem, there is fanservice and he wins more battles, that's pretty much the first season. Then comes the second season, which is rated higher then the first, WHY? There were a few plot holes during the first season but during the second season there were plot holes everywhere. There were even more stupid comedic filler episodes and \"awesome\" new characters no one cared about (Rollo). Oh and almost every character aside from Lelouch and Suzaku became useless and added nothing to the plot, because of this there was almost no character development. And a lot of people have Geass-power because... Actually, I don't really know why. And Geass is now an explanation for everything. How did Lelouch win this fight against a stronger army? Geass. Why was his mother alive out of nowhere in a random supernatural Geass-world? Geass. A serious problem? Lelouch will Geass ex machina himself out of it. Also the fact that C.C. turned into a fanservice object because of amnesia is not okay. And then the ending, the greatest anime ending ever made! Haha no, the ending didn't make sense, Lelouch is not a hero, his behavior was out of character and this is not how world peace or politics works. But it's sad and there are feels, so everyone loved it *sigh*.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe first season was decent, but the second season was a train wreck. At first Lelouch used Geass, but the power of Geass was limited and he tried to use cool strategies (though a bit stupid at times), but after a while every battle is won because of Geass and plot convience. And I'm not going to talk about the ridiculous amount of plot holes or the dead mother of Lelouch who appears in some kind of supernatural Geass-world for no good reason. Also the combination of high-school comedy and dramatic war scenes did not work, the same goes for Lelouche's bombastic speeches and hand gestures. And there are more explosions then in a Michael Bay movie, why? Because it looks cool and it's fun. That's exactly the problem with this anime, they try desperately to make everything look cool and fun while the plot is a mess.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 6/10\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of this art style, CLAMP's character designs look ridiculous. Every girl has big boobs and every guy looks like a bishie. Also it was too colorful during the more dramatic and the darker parts of the story. And the facial expressions are a bit over-the-top at times, I don't think that the makers were trying to make me laugh when the characters were sad or angry, but their facial expressions were so stupid now and then. Though I have to admit, the animation was original and the battles looked very nice.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nI hated the character designs, but that is something personal. It was a little bit too colorful and Lelouch looked like a clown when he was sad or angry. Still, I think that the animation was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\n~Music~ 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening were all in between average and good, they were not extremely special, but they were fitting. I really liked 'COLORS' by FLOW, but it wasn't very original. The same thing goes for the ending songs. The background music was very good but a little bit too bombastic at times. There was nothing wrong with the (Japanese) voice acting, actually it was very good.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe music was great, the opening and ending song were fitting and there wasn't one bad opening or ending song. Also, the background music and the voice acting were very good.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 3/10\\n\r\nLelouch is an interesting character, everyone else isn't. Literally no one aside from Lelouch is interesting, let alone well-written. Suzaku is just an annoying, hypocritical whiner, Nunnaly is the useless, cute little sister in a wheelchair, C.C went from a powerful mysterious women to a fanservice object with amnesia, Shirley was just fanservice combined with forced drama and she kept screaming 'Lulu' at Lelouch in the most annoying way possible, Charles Vi Britannia is a stereotypical cartoon villain, Kallen was just part of Lelouche's stupid harem, what was actually the purpose of Rollo aside from annoying the viewers? Euphemia was a bland cute and nice girl and some girls were just in there for fanservice. I almost believed that Nina was the most interesting character of the whole supporting cast.... ok never mind, I take that back, poor table *shiver*. \\n\r\nBut even the best character of this show, Lelouch, is not that good. His motivations and behavior keeps changing when the plot needs them to change. And everyone thinks that Lelouch is a genius, why actually? Because he plays chess or comes up with farfetched strategies that magically work? Lelouch is a perfect, pretty boy who is supposed to be smart and has a harem, when I think about it, he reminds me of Kirito from Sword Art Online.... ok, I also take that back, he's a better character than Kirito (not like that's saying much), but still he is not a brilliantly written character like his enormous fan base claims. His character development is inconsistent and the fact that during the final episode he stops behaving like an enormous jerk, doesn't turn him into a hero, this jerk started a war that killed millions of humans for the sake of his stupid revenge and his stupid sister. He's either an anti-hero or just a villain, so please stop with the \"All hail Lelouch, he's the savior of mankind\"-crap. \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe characters were so damn bland. Most of them were annoying or useless, some of them were quite decent during the first season, but during the second season everyone aside from Lelouch and Suzaku turned into furniture, they just were there without contributing anything to the plot. We also got a bunch of new characters during the second season where no one asked for (yes Rollo, I'm talking about you). But the worst thing was what they did with C.C. She lost her memories and went from a supernatural and powerful women to dumb little girl who was constantly half-naked for the sake of fanservice, this annoyed the heck out of me. Good job writers, good job!\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 9/10\\n\r\nBombastic speeches with over-the-top arm gestures and dramatic background music, epic mecha battles, a lot of explosions and an awesome though ridiculous ending: this show is extremely enjoyable. I was entertained from the first till the last episode, yes this show had a lot of problems but it was never boring. I can understand why people like this show so much, it's plain fun!\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nAn enjoyable show with a lot of problems, if you love Michael Bay movies, you'll also love Code Geass. If you just want to have fun and turn your brain off, then go watch this show. But if you prefer well-written characters, consistent story lines and if you hate plot holes and characters that are nothing more than plot devices or fanservice, go watch something else, you'll wast your time on Code Geass.

            "content": "Code Geass is a series that many people love. While it is an older anime compared to today's standards, there are many things to like about it.  It is a mix of many genres: mecha, psychological thriller, a little bit of romance, and action just to name a few. It is an anime with an engaging story, and characters that hopefully will stand the test of time. \r\nStory (10/10): The story of Code Geass will capture your attention right from the get-go.The action of mech combat, the warfare strategies of the protagonist, and the complex narrative will sure to satisfy many anime fans. \r\nArt(8/10): While this anime was made almost 10 years ago, it still holds up art-wise. The mech combat still looks great, and the animation is very fluid. However, there may be a few who can be turned-off by the art style of the characters. Their elongated bodies and arms take a little to get used to. But, some find the character designs positively unique. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): The music in Code Geass can be seen as one of the best points of the anime. There is a great blend of genres of music, and it keeps the tension high when need be and also lowers tension at the opportune moments. The first opening, Colors by FLOW, is especially memorable. The voice actors also do a terrific job portraying the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): There are many characters in the series. The main protagonist, Lelouch vi Britannia, is compared to Light from Death Note by some people. While they both have similarities, they are also very different. Lelouch is a little more positive in terms of personality. He is a strategical genius and watching his plans take action are fun to watch. The secondary protagonist, Suzaku, is also a very interesting character. He can be seen as the opposite of Lelouch. Watching his plan to change the world in a more diplomatic way is commendable. Other notable characters include Kallen (a leader of  Lelouch's rebellion), Nunally (Lelouch's sister), Eupemia (a princess of Britannia), and Lloyd (the creator of Suzaku's mech, the Lancealot). As you can see, there are many unique characters in this series. It can be easy to find one to relate with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): This anime is probably my favorite anime of all time. With its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and great music, it left me begging for more. I am sure that many anime fans will love this series. However, some might find the character designs a little odd at first. Others will find the character designs unique. If you haven't given it a try yet (why haven't you?), check out Code Geass!",

            "content": "THERE WILL BE MAJOR SPOILERS\r\nUh Code Geass one of the most overrated anime ever in MY OPINION so let's start then:\r\n-Code Geass was nice as I could tell I watch the both seasons and planned to watch season 3 too but man It sure is overrated. Lets start with some major issues Code Geass could have end in just 1 episode that is true Lelouch could just say (you are my slave forever) then could coquer the world very easily or the animation. That animation was the worst animation I have ever saw the humans looks like tree in the show so that art workand animaton was bad as a person who don't care about the animation I had to say it was bad but sounds aren't like animation. I think sound was Code Geass's best thing Code Geass has got one of the best mecha sounds I have ever heard and characters has got good voice actors and sound effects were great as I could say. I haven't enjoyed Code Geass that much there were tactics that have used before from season 1 to season 2 there were some plot holes and things that didn't change the show that much just like Mao I mean it changed just nothing or what is the gods and there is still much more mistakes. As a person I have enjoyed the finale but season 3 is coming so that finale was actually the Code Geass's best part but now it isn't that much great knowing that Lelouch is still alive. It is just feels weird because season 2 finale was great why the heck are they trying to make another season but there is something in my mind why just why so many characters on this show are bad. NO I am not only talking about Suzaku I am talking about a lot of characters just like Nunally I mean look at it in one point she returned to the kingdom family and didn't care about how Lelouch will feel about it and she didn't even cared about him at one point. At season 2 when Rolo came he was a big mindfuck but then all it revealed and at one point he try to kill Nunally for Lelouch I mean why the heck would you try to kill a person who loves the same person it was easy to understand Lelouch roleplaying all along. Code Geass has got other bad characters too but I want this review to be short so I could give Code Geass only 1/10",

            "content": "NOTE: This review applies to the first 2 seasons of Code Geass.  I do not plan to watch and review Season 3.\r\nThe Positive Side: Code Geass takes place in an alternate future, wherein Britannia (Great Britain with mechs and Nazis, basically) has conquered Japan.  Lelouch, an exiled Britannian Prince, seeks to topple the Britannian tyranny to avenge his mother and create a kinder world for his blind younger sister, Nunelly.  He is aided by a mysterious power called Geass, which allows him to give irresistible orders and bend other people to his will.\r\nCode Geass has an intriguing premise and some very strongportrayals of war, racism, colonialism and cultural disenfranchisement.  One of my favorite details of the setting is that under Britannian rule, Japan and the Japanese people have been stripped of their name, and live under the designation, \u201cArea 11.\u201d  It\u2019s a brilliant detail that shows the lengths to which Britannia goes to destroy Japan\u2019s sense of identity.\\n\r\nThrough the first season, Code Geass exhibits strong characterization on all sides of its conflict.   Lelouch\u2019s friend and archrival, Suzaku, opposes him throughout the first season, and while we are inclined to root for Lelouch, given the horrific atrocities of the Britanian\u2019s, it easy to understand why Suzaku is on the other side, and hard to blame him or dislike him.  Another excellent addition to the supporting cast is Kallen Kozuki, a daring young freedom fighter and half-Japanese Britannian student who joins up with Lelouch\u2019s rebellion on behalf of her abused and down-trodden Japanese mother.  The brilliance of Kallen is that she is able to maintain a kind of purity of character when Lelouch begins to slip morally ambiguous behavior.  While Lelouch embodies the duality of war\u2014noble intentions with seemingly unavoidable, evil methods\u2014Kallen embodies the courageous patriot, and as long she remains in the focus of the narrative, she ensures we have someone to root for.\\n\r\nWar is an immense and difficult topic to handle in anime, and it\u2019s rare to find a Shonen series that doesn\u2019t reduce it to a conflict between obvious heroes and uniformly sadistic and irredeemable villains.  Code Geass refuses this simplification, and for that at least, it deserves a little respect.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative Side: Like its protagonist, Code Geass starts off full of promise and blazing ambition, but loses its path, and ultimately, seems to forget what it was trying to achieve in the first place.  Code Geass should have been one of the greatest anime ever made, but its faults are so numerous and distracting that it\u2019s often irritating to watch, and ultimately, very hard to take seriously.\\n\r\nLet\u2019s begin with the artwork.  While the mecha are well-drawn and have intriguing designs, and most of the action is very fluid, the artists flounder any time they\u2019re required to draw a person.  Nearly every member of the cast is suffering from Terminal Anorexia, Chihuahua Head Syndrome and Early Onset Yaoi Hands.  Even the girls have yaoi hands.  There\u2019s a few martial artists and soldiers in the cast, but the quality of the mecha fights makes every fight not involving a mecha look even more ridiculous.  Everyone moves like they\u2019re filled with helium instead of blood.  Supposedly human characters leap five times their height, defy gravity and inertia and spontaneously spin with nothing to draw traction from but thin air.  If this was explicitly a supernatural martial arts anime like Ranma \u00bd or Fist of the North Star, I\u2019d have no problem with this kind of silliness, but Geass\u2019s efforts to feel grounded and real are shattered in nearly every hand-to-hand fight.\\n\r\nEven more irritating is Geass\u2019s insistence on cramming fan-service into scenes where it has no business being.  There\u2019s a moment late n the first season where Kallen and Suzaku become mysteriously stranded on a tropical Island.  Kallen, in a complete defiance of the concept of logical priorities, decides this is the perfect time to take a shower.  Suzaku stumbles on Kallen while she\u2019s naked and bathing in a waterfall.  Kallen immediately recognizes Suzaku as an enemy, draws her knife and charges him.\\n\r\nThis should have been one of the tensest and most dramatic scenes in the series.  Kallen and Suzaku have both been built as sympathetic and complex characters, and without a moment\u2019s warning, both are thrust into mortal danger.  In that moment, I was afraid that one of them was surely going to die, and I was unsure of who I was rooting for.  Sadly, the animator\u2019s insistence of baring Kallen\u2019s breasts, coupled with Suzaku\u2019s subsequent take-down (which puts Kallen in a position far too reminiscent of being raped) ruins the tone of the scene.  Instead of witnessing two noble characters in a struggle for their beliefs and their survival, we witness a display of the creator\u2019s own bad taste.  The fanservice is almost invariably of the creepy variety, either nonconsensual \u2018accidents\u2019 or used as a point of shaming the girls.  Roughly half the battle-scenes are ruined by pointless close-ups of the girls\u2019 breasts and rear-ends.  There are moments when Code Geass feels like it was created as a guide on how not to use fan-service.\\n\r\nDespite the writers\u2019 knack for characterization, Code Geass degrades its strongest women to a disgusting degree.  Kallen, a fearless revolutionary who has been fighting against Britannia even longer than Lelouch, is forced to wear playboy bunny suit, to her own shame and humiliation.  She is later captured and strapped to a table with what is quite obviously bondage gear, forced to wear a dress that exposes a solid fifty percent of her breasts, and is nearly raped by one of her captors.  C.C. spends most of the series as a stoic, mysterious ally with her own agenda and desires, and is one of the only characters in the series who calls out Lelouch on his stupidity and immoral hypocrisy.  Following a convenient memory lapse in Season 2, C.C. is reduced to a cringing slave-girl, perpetually terrified of being beaten and eagerly subordinating herself to Lelouch, even when asked to remove her clothes.\\n\r\nCode Geass often uses chess motifs to support its themes of clever planning and manipulation.  This would probably be a lot more effective if anyone who worked on the show had ever learned the rules of chess.  Every time a characters busts out a chess board, you can count on hilariously stupid and illegal moves.  At one point, a character moves his king into check.  Amusingly, his opponent is horrified.\\n\r\nSpeaking of clever planning\u2026 despite the fact that Code Geass puts focus on tactical intelligence, many of Lelouch\u2019s decisions are mind-blowingly stupid.  He walks into obvious traps even he knows they are traps, and is unnecessarily hostile and paranoid towards people who ought to be his allies.  Britannia is not exempt from this, as we see in Season 2, when they dismiss the idea of multiple countries working together in a military campaign laughable, and claim that the result would be \u2018an unruly mob\u2019.\\n\r\n\u2026Hey, Britannians?  Remember that whole \u201cWorld War 2\u201d thing?  You know, the one that both Britain and Japan fought in?  Turns out countries can actually work together pretty well when they have a common enemy.\\n\r\nDespite the strength of the characters, the dialogue is frequently hammy and ridiculous.  Sometimes this is justified by Lelouch\u2019s fondness for theatrics, but sometimes, it\u2019s just plain stupid.  There is no context in which the words, \u201cAttention, people of Japan.  Could you all just die, please?\u201d will not be ridiculous.  \\n\r\nI really wish I could separate seasons 1 and 2, because season 1 is vastly better, but unfortunately, season 1 ends on a total cliff-hanger that demands I take both seasons as halves of the same story.\\n\r\nCode Geass\u2019s death blow comes near the end of Season 2.  I will refrain from giving spoilers here, but  will say that the strong characterization given to the main characters is wasted, as they seem to forget their own defining motivations.  When characters stop behaving in a way that makes sense for who and what they are, it\u2019s simply not possible to believe in them the way we believe in all the characters we love most dearly.  Where there were once compelling and complex characters, there are now puppets, spouting nonsensical monologues about vague ideals and coldly marching through whatever actions the writers thrust upon them.  No matter how many convoluted schemes or dramatic twists Code Geass hurls at you, the entire effort ends up feeling hollow and pointless. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:  Code Geass is riddled with obnoxious faults in taste and style, but beneath these faults, there\u2019s artistic ambition, moral insight and a cast of memorable and exciting characters.   It\u2019s truly a pity this show was less than it could have been.  If you\u2019re curious as to why this anime is so highly rated, feel free to check it out.  Otherwise\u2026 I, INKSPIDER VI BRITANNIA, COMMAND YOU\u2026 to go watch something better.\\n",

But those do not make it downright heavy because it's all balanced out by touches of student life here and there, little stories of friendship and trust not to mention romance. Everything is all good and amazing especially that one big twisted ending.\r\nThe bad stuff: Very twisted ending. Every episode takes your breath away that you cannot wait for the next episode.",

            "content": "From my Instagram (covering both seasons):\r\nCode Geass Analysis:\r\nPart 1:\r\nThe first season of Code Geass is perhaps my favourite anime of all time. Aside from one episode, it is 25 episodes of pure perfection.\r\nCode Geass S1 ensures to have at least one 10/10 moment every episode. It is a series that very much lives for its big moments, there are a countless number of scenes that I could point to as being absolutely perfect. Even though it puts a lot of emphasis on its big scenes, what fills the gaps in between those scenes is just as substantial. The student council scenes may be made funoff but they serve a crucial narrative purpose, it is these scenes that serve to humanise Lelouch, which is very much needed when every other scene involving him portrays him as a ruthless terrorist. However, the scenes in which Lelouch takes on the role of Zero are what really shine in Code Geass. Watching Lelouch give up his quiet life for the sake of his younger sister and in turn the whole of Japan show not only his strong will and compassion, but more importantly his absolute selflessness. I will save any further analysis of Lelouch for a seperate post but needless to say, I can\u2019t fault a single aspect of his character. \\n\r\nTo briefly touch on the mecha element of Code Geass. While there may be mecha, they merely serve as a plot device and more or less add nothing to the story. This allows for some genuinely great mecha fights to be present but ensures that they don\u2019t outshine the brilliant narrative and characters, but rather support them. Watching Lelouch employ his brilliant tactics is always a pleasure. Lelouch is able to use underhanded tactics without feeling any guilt over it, since his opponent is an entire empire. This means that the strategies he has to come up with have to be increasingly sly as the series goes on. In season one, the writers were able to keep coming up with new and inventive strategies consistently throughout, which is a very impressive feat. (Season one part two analysis coming soon)\\n\r\nPart 2:\\n\r\nTo think that I wrote an entire post on everything great about the first season of Code Geass without even mentioning the power of geass itself. Lelouch is the perfect character to be given the power of geass, by its very nature, even the physically weak can use geass. Lelouch is shown to be physically weak, however, where his strength lies is in his intelligence. This means that, unlike in a lot of other anime, Lelouch\u2019s most powerful weapon is his mind, and the addition of geass makes him all the more powerful. Geass is very interesting as it is used to raise a very profound question, what is the morality of controlling others? Lelouch does use his geass to control his comrades, which could be viewed as morally corrupt, however, the fact that Lelouch is controlling his comrades for the sake of their dream brings about a great ambiguity on the matter. This question is never truly answered in season one but does lead to a great conflict between Lelouch and Suzaku, although I will save that for my post on the character dynamic between Lelouch and Suzaku. To summarise, while the first season does not answer the question on the morality of controlling others, it does not need to. Perhaps the fact that it does not answer is an answer in itself, perhaps no one has the right to judge the morality of such a thing. It is clear to me that all of this was intentional. \\n\r\nThe moral ambiguity of geass as a power also works wonders when it comes to Lelouch\u2019s character arc. Lelouch sets out to be a hero, to save Japan from Britannia. While this may be the case, he also desires to see the Britannian Empire completely obliterated. On one hand, he selflessly wishes to destroy Britannia, but on the other hand, he wishes to see it destroyed for the sake of his own revenge. Lelouch is torn. This is where geass comes in, obtaining this power enables him to fulfil any selfish desire that he happens to have, at first, he refrains from using his power so irresponsibly. However, as the series goes on, and as the tremendous pressure that he has on his shoulders increases, he uses his geass to satisfy himself. (Running out of room, swipe across to see an example of this)\\n\r\nPart 3:\\n\r\nTo me, the appeal of Code Geass\u2019 first season was never the mecha battles, the mecha designs, or even anything to do with the mecha element whatsoever. It was the brilliantly complex strategies, the ideological battles, the immense sense of never knowing what would happen next, and finally, the characters. The second season of Code Geass seemed to misunderstand what the appeal of Code Geass was to non mecha fans in the first place. My absolute biggest problem with the second season of Code Geass is anything to do with the nightmares. As I mentioned in a previous post, the mecha aspect of Code Geass was fun, but never a part of the story that was emphasised in any meaningful way. However, the second season of Code Geass goes out of its way to constantly introduce new nightmare designs and such. The believability of it all lessens as the season goes on. The need to come up with intelligent strategies are more or less completely gone, when the enemy could introduce a new nightmare model at any moment, completely changing the course of battle. Yes, this happened in the first season, however, that was always with Suzaku piloting the Lancelot. Understanding the difference between these is crucial. Suzaku being the one to interfere with Lelouch\u2019s plans served a narrative purpose other than just to make things harder for Lelouch. The fact that it was Lelouch\u2019s childhood friend stopping him without either of them realising worked wonders in building tension between them, but then simultaneously showing them being friendly at school. This was an excellent part of season one and was a crucial element to the story. Season two misunderstands this. Plus, in my opinion the nightmare designs aren\u2019t even that appealing in Code Geass, so to put more emphasis on them was always going to be to the show\u2019s detriment. \\n\r\nDespite having said so much negative about season two, it\u2019s still far better than most anime I\u2019ve seen and a strong 9/10. It\u2019s just a shame that I didn\u2019t find it as good as the first season. I should also clarify that I am aware that the last ~five episodes of season two are some of the best episodes in the history of anime, I\u2019ll be covering them in a separate post.\\n",

At first I said that this military-robot thing would never suit my taste, but unlike my expectations it was totally awesome. What I really loved were the characters, especially Lelouch. Now when it comes to Lelouch, either you love him or you hate him. I particularly love him. He's one hell of a badass who's always one step ahead the others. Although he played the role of the villain in the most part of the series, in the end he turned out to be truly good and this is the reason why Code Geass isawesome.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking a little about the graphics, they are really good. You can actually see a lot of details, there's also a large variety of both lively and dark colours, so I really don't have anything to complain about.

It's hard to stop watching the show, it does a good job of compelling you to watch the next episode.  That's not enough to make the show good, but it's something.\r\nSTORY - 3 The similarity with death note is the characters have different philosophies, but what they want is ultimately a good world, a good thing (they just have different ideas of how to get there).  Unfortunately, I think the twists in this story goway to far, and the main character does atrocious things for selfish reasons.  We see characters twisted by their trauma, sometimes in an almost elfen leid kind of way.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS -3.  There are some pretty fleshed out characters,  but this is a show that takes things too far and gives us characters to hate.  At first, you can kind of understand him and where he's coming from, but he takes things too far and doesn't consider alternatives.  If you like to have a character you can hate, then Lelouch you.  The rest of us will be repulsed.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 10.  The way they used music is one of the best things about the show.  Excellent job.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10.  I'm not overly critical of art - it was good and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment - 0.  You end up hating or feeling detached from almost every major character.  There's nothing enjoyable about that.  There are no morals to be learned, and ultimately nothing to redeem the downhill this show takes.",

            "content": "\"Geass, the Power of Kings will bring you solitude\"\r\nThose are the mysterious words that are the basis for which the series is based on. Through these words, Lelouch Lamperouge is able to seize the opportunities sets in motion his plan to bring down the world's largest Empire, The \"Holy Empire of Britannia.\" The story itself is a very open and easy to follow one, straight forward enough for anyone but with enough twists to keep it interesting. The arts and sound degree of the anime are next to brilliant, with a good incorporation of \"Insert Songs\" and great animations.\r\nSTORY: The way in which Britannia isportrayed, is nothing short of an Empire of the roman times, effortlessly landing, attacking and claiming land. Set in the Year 2010 a.t.b, or \"Ascension Throne Britannia,\" when the Holy Britannian Empire waged war and conquered Japan. With this, Japan is now a formal colony of the settlement now known as \"Area Eleven\" and it's people referred to as \"Elevens.\" Starting 7 years after this invasion with Lelouch Lamperouge, is Ex-Prince of Britannia, but he relinquished his name, title and right to succeed the throne after he saw the true face of the Empire and it's biter indiference. The story moves at a steady pace at most times, constantly showing a \"war,\" whether it be with Britannia, with himself or his friends and family. At the best of times, you are gaining answers to questions that arise in the mere first seconds of the series, at the worst, you find yourself asking new questions but that is all part of the draw for Code Geass. It is that, \"Now why is that\" & \"Who did this,\" that really makes for a thinking anime. Mind you, there are no times when your are bombarded by answers, nor are you given a huge heap of questions to think about. They are all delivered in due time. \\n\\n\r\nARTWORK/ANIMATION: Sunshine has always made for great animation, showing what the cutting-edge of Anime Animations are capable of. Code Geass is no exception to this rule, with many great designs and background artwork. I would like to pay special attention to the \"Knightmare\" frames however, as they earn extra-special credit from me because of all of the eye-candy that follows them wherever they go. Their animation seems so fluent, that it almost looks like they could exist. Another extra-special credit is in the special CG effects. I will use the Hadron-Cannon as an example because even though it is not a drawing as such, it's light and shimmer effects make for a dangerous-looking beam.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/MUSIC: The sound effects of this series, are so-so. At times, they are realistic and lively but at other times, they are really repetitive. The quality of these sounds, regardless of the repetitiveness, is perfect. When someone is walking, it sounds like they are walking right-beside you. When a Knightmare frame is attacking, it sounds lively, and large. The Insert-Songs work well. They do fit really nicely with the entire theme of the Anime. For example, when Lelouch is thinking really solemnly, this sort of solo Trumpeter accompanied by Cellos is heard, making for the music to not be overwhelming. My favorite insert-song is the one heard at almost all Britannia-related parties and speeches. It is a majestic-sounding song sung by a choir of men. With this, you get the sense of \"Britannia, it's a large, big, majestic, overwhelming Empire.\" The Voice-Acting and casting was also perfect. Jun Fukuyama played an excellent part as Lelouch and in using one, quieter voice for his school friends and then this big, deep voice for when he is \"Zero\" is simply inspired. And then there's C.C who was played by Yukana Nogami, even her voice suits C.C's solemn character. Overall, great sound selection.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: I really did enjoy this anime. It had just the right mix of serious, meaningful elements with a comedy backdrop (At times.) With this combination, it surely wasn't going to go wrong and I'm glad it didn't, because it was just soooo enjoyable. People will watch this anime for times to come and still think \"Wow, I wonder if that would occur if such an event had taken place.\" Although mind-you, I'm sure that there wouldn't be any Geass...",

            "content": "Im just putting up a warning here before you continue on. This review will contain vulgar language and in normal cases i don't think it is necessary. But this piss poor anime infuriates me on every level, something no anime, manga or game have been able to do before, so cudos to that.\r\nThis is by far the worst anime i have ever seen. \r\nFirst up is the dialogue and story;\r\nThe only comparison i can make here is being forced to watch a highschoolers poorest atempt to write drama. Its clunky, over dramatic, edgy and make no sense in most sceens. Things seams to happen withno after fought and seams more to happen because it looks \"cool\" rather then to make sense. \\n\\n\r\nExample for this:\\n\r\nThe very first episode. The stolen truck. There is no way in hell that ANY rebel that went this far into stealing a goddamn weapon with said aledged power, would swirve of the highway because a dumb shit on a moped went up on it. And why they are there in the first place is beyond me aswel. Not the truck, the protagonist.\\n\r\nThis could have been averted so easily. A un forsceen police blockade, the military blowing up the bridge. But HELL NO! instead a goddamn tool on a moped are the thing that stops the 10 ton truck filled with what is assumed to be a nuke.\\n\r\nThat whole sceen is just down right lazy writing that looks \"cool\" on the surface but executes like shit.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there are so many sceens in each episode that are equally stupid that im not going to go over because then this review would be 100 pages long.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the art;\\n\r\nAnd jesus on a cross is the art piss poor. Im not giving this whole show a 1 out of 10 for some elaborate meme or shitty reason, it is a damn terrible show and im here to state why it is so.\\n\r\nDesign, this is something the author and makers of this show are so unfamiliar with that it's goddamn terrifying. The only thing that comes close to the poor choises made in this series would be if you googled the term \"Sparkle dog\" if you can't find it add \"furry\" to it and you will see what i mean.\\n\r\nThis show have not understood the term \"less is more\" by a long shot. its all over the place, the outfits looks dumb as shit and the castle thing in the first few episodes, the one that is compltly white. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT THING? it surves no arcitectual purpose what so ever.\\n\r\nAll the towers with bridges that leads nowhere, its pale with coating, oh and how about the none existing windows? That whole shit is a safty hazzard like no other.\\n\\n\r\nSo what about the sound?;\\n\r\nHonestly i can't tell. It was not terrible but at the same time it was not memorable. Being extremly forgettable but not bad id say i put it at decent at best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters;\\n\r\nJesus fucking christ. There should be a negative number for this category. The whole time im watching this im just sitting there and hoping \"Please make laluche die\". And why? because he is the edgy fuck boi of the block that will emotinaly exploit anyone got get anything he wants.\\n\r\nHe is not a well written villan type, but rather a shitty and lazy written protagonist type.\\n\r\nAnd the names in this show is the worst i have ever heard. They make me infact feel like the show wants to be pretentious and takes itself so seriously that it  just feels disgusting. \\n\\n\r\nLets name a few: \\n\r\n\"Lelouch Lamperouge\" it sounds so slimy and rich boi esque. I don't know how to describe it, maybe pretentious fits in here aswell.\\n\\n\r\n\"Euphemia li Britannia\" From my understanding, the family is royal? So it would make a small bit of sense why the last name is what it is. To bad its garbage since \"Britannia\" is the dumbest sounding  take on \"britan\" i have ever heard.\\n\\n\r\n\"Nina Einstein\"\\n\r\nYeah, no. Not taking yourself just a TAD to serious now are you?\\n\r\nFun fact, when looking up her name i got in the top results \"top 10 most annoying anime characters! [HD]\" with her face as the thumbnail. Nice one.\\n\\n\r\nWhy not add our number 1 nation? GrEaTu BrItAnIaUeUeUeU. In all seriousness, i have never heard of a dumber name in a anime when it comes to nations.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that leads us to enjoyment and overall;\\n\\n\r\nWell, what do you think yourself? I just spent the whole review shitting on the show, so its a clear 1 right? Wrong. I have not been this much entertained in years. Me and my brother went to see this show and it took us over 1 hour per episode due to the sheer amount of times we had to pause, point out something hilariously stupid and laugh about it.\\n\r\nIm not kidding when i say this, but code geass might be the holy grail of shitty anime. But in the sense of its so horribly bad its actually enjoyable.\\n\r\nThink arnold swartcneger movies that is packed to the brim with cheesy one liners. The movie itself is shit, but goddamn, those one liners gets me every time.\\n\r\nAnd that is the case with this anime. Every elephant misstake gets me every time. Its like \"haha, ok, they can't fuck it up even more\" and then they did.\\n",

            "content": "*Mostly Spoiler Free Review*\r\nWell, here I am, writing my first ever MAL review, and this review will go into both seasons of Code Geass.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe story is set in 2010 Japan, or Area 11 and follows the exiled prince Lelouch Vi Britannia. A country called Britannia has taken over a large amount of the world, and recently Japan too. Lelouch, after getting involved in an accident, obtains a power called Geass, and uses it to try to overthrow Britannia.\r\nArt - 8/10\r\nThis is probably a bit biased on my opinion, but I personally didn't like those super tall, super skinny characters. I mean, they lookedsick, but I thought it could have been better. I did however like the designs of the mechas. I haven't watched any gundam or stuff like that, but the designs of each Mecha were pretty good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors of Code Geass were very pleasant to listen too, (Altough I haven't watched the dub myself, the sub was quite well done) and so were the OPs and EDs. (especially JIBUN WO!) The soundtrack itself is better than most if not all the anime I have watched. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters in Code Geass, (Especially Lelouch) had unique personalities and uh.. interesting, I guess *Cough**Cough*Nina-*Cough* Many of the characters you think would be generic develop and become enjoyable to watch and some not so enjoyable. But hey, at least they aren't generic, amirite? NinaxTablekun tho...( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is one of my favorite anime of all time, and that's why I decided to dedicate my first review on it. My rating here is most likely biased, but the reason why I enjoyed the hell outta Code Geass had to be the unique 'everything' about this show. Now, if I said more I would be spoiling, but Code Geass really portrays modern problems in society very well, and the way Code Geass made these problems in real life seem so entertaining and captivating leaves me bewildered. The ending of Code Geass really got me thinking too, unlike most anime. Is Lelouch alive or dead? Lets find out in R3.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be exact, I would give it a 9.78 out of 10.0. Code Geass was an unbelievably well done anime in its time, and one of the few anime that will be sitting on my favorites page. Code Geass blends in many genres such as Mecha, Drama, School Life, and Superpowers, and does amazingly well at it. If you're looking for a good show involving Mecha, or Superpowers, Code Geass would be an excellent choice. ALL HAIL LELOUCH!",

            "content": "I was going to bring one season of anime to watch on my iPod on my vacation, and I chose Code Geass. Boy, did I make the right choice.\r\nFor those of you who know Death Note, you can consider Code Geass the same except less based around tactics and more based around character development. Also, Code Geass has a much brighter, lighter feel to it, wheras Death Note feels very dark most of the time. That said, I'll break this down for ya:\r\nSTORY: 8/10\r\nBasically, Lelouch the main character is a 17 year old boy who has always disliked the Brittanian empire that conquered Japan longago, naming it &quot;Area 11&quot;. As such, native Japanese people were nicknamed &quot;Elevens&quot; by the Brittanians, who discriminated and continue to oppress the Japanese. Lelouch finally gets what he needs to get started, and begins to rebel against Brittania. \\n\\n\r\nNot horribly inventive, but still engaging. What I love about the story personally is  that it seems like no character was forced to do something to steer the plot in the desired directions. Every character does what he/she feels, and the plot develops itself. Very natural feeling. Also no fillers (w00t!)\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great; love the eye styles (I'm big on eyestyles, in case you didn't know) and the character designs are unique and refresing. There is a bit of recycled panoramas, but I usually dont have a problem with that; it doesnt really negatively affect the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs/EDs are fantastic, with songs by Access and FLOW (my favs) and they REALLY made me love the music. As for the in-anime sound effects, nothing really struck me as astounding, but the sound in general is very good (Very good is an 8/10... oh well, the OPs and EDs are too good)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I have a 10 in this section is because there is a character (or more) for everyone to love. Like Death Note, Code Geass becomes a battle of morals, and every character has a different opinion on what should happen. Unique designs, great voice acting, very memorable characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot always keeps you engaged. I love the fact that you dont always know what is going to happen next, so it keeps you on the edge of your seat. No huge flashback episodes either (which I personally hate; wasting a whole episode for a flashback is like a filler to me...). You'll root for certain characters, laugh, maybe cry? Who knows, its a whole different experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of these elements slapped together make a very memorable anime that I will remember for a while. The sequel to this season is great as well, be sure to check that out. Hard for me to say anymore; go give this one a watch!",

            "content": "I'm not going to go to much in depth but I'm just going to give you my overall thoughts on the series.\r\nWhen I saw this when I was younger, I thought this was the greatest and most flawless Anime ever. Fast forward a few years, and honestly? It's still in my top 10. This Anime is flawed heavily in so many aspects, there is pretty much ass pulls and plot holes every episode or two. Lelouch is pretty much given an power that allows poor writing since it's beyond broken, he pulls deus ex machina constantly. There is shameless fan service, it tries to havetoo much of a wide audience appeal through too many genres. Characters have such over exaggerated personality's it felt like a self parody at times. It adds in Mechas for the sake of adding Mechas, and it's over the top in every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what? At the end of the day none of those flaws mattered in my enjoyment in the series. The series was such a blast to watch that it reminds me that Anime should be about one thing, and that is having fun. Would Code Geass by better if it had better writing, and cut down on a lot of those aspects that majority of people think ruins the show? Probably, but then again it won't be Code Geass. I know that seems like a stupid answer but those flaws are what makes Code Geass, well Code Geass. I could rant on for hours about the shows flaws but in all honesty I was having way too much fun. I love the overblown character personality, I love how Lelouch somehow outsmarts everybody even in ways that don't make sense. I love the ass shots of Kallen every time she appears on screen. And above all else, I love how insane and over the top series is.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't for everybody though, if you get annoyed by amount of plot holes it has at times and the poor writing. I don't suggest it, but if you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the show for what it is, you will have a hell of a time.",

            "content": "*MINOR SPOILERS WITHIN*\r\nI'm not really sure why Code Geass is so positively rated. There are definitely some good parts, however the show has so many pitfalls that they completely cancel out any good qualities. The first thing that I really didn't like about it was the plot structure. Many people compare this show to Death Note, and side by side, Code Geass absolutely pales in comparison. On average each individual episode did very little to forward Lelouch's goal of taking down the Brittanian Empire. The majority of the episodes felt either like filler, or they would follow a predictable formula like this: Lelouch plans somethingsneaky, he totally destroys the empire's forces, then right as they are about to win Suzeku rolls in and undoes absolutely everything. Seriously, this happens over and over for the entire first season. Then in the middle of the season Mao shows up, with absolutely no explanation and starts causing Lelouch to do an even more pitiful job then he is already doing of forwarding the rebellion. The season finale was absolute rubbish as well. It did nothing at all to conclude the plot of the first season and left such an inordinate number of cliffhangers that it just felt like a cheap gimmick to trick you into watching the second season. After the first four or five episodes out of twenty five in R1, it felt like nothing significant to the plot really happened at all besides minor character development.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the plot, I really hated the fan-service in this anime as well. Any show that has to rely on huge boobs or pantie shots to garner the attention of the audience is not one worth watching. There were two nude scenes with Kallen, one where Euphemia takes off her clothes for literally no reason, and a scene where Nina is straight up masturbating to pictures of Euphemia. All these scenes did very little if anything to add to the plot, and in some cases detracted from it. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass does have very good action and does a great job of creating suspense. I admit that when I watched this show it had me hooked for the first season. In retrospect however, there are just so many problems with what could have been an absolutely amazing anime that it completely counters everything that this show does well.",

            "content": "Imagine a small restaurant that sells one specialty food. This restaurant gets a following and it has something good going. Then with the pressure of having to serve more dishes, it turns to something it shouldn't have. It decided to offer foods not remotely related to their specialty food. It began to sell burgers, pasta, sushi, and curry. It became such a jumbled mess that the original specialty food was lost. Though it retained its popularity, it was no longer for the original reason. This, is how I see Code Geass.\r\nCode Geass started with a plot that centered around the character Lelouch and his desirefor revenge against his corrupt father. With his mastery in strategy, he leads the rebels against government forces with the use of large machines. This, is a promising start.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the plot progresses, you can see that the story was not carefully crafted beforehand. It seems as though as time passes, new ideas are thrown into the mix and we are taken further and further away from the core of the story. And as the story becomes unnecessarily complex (Using simple ideas and forcibly mutating them to seem complex), they struggle to explain or conclude each part.\\n\\n\r\nTo not spoil the show, the end is basically \"things look like they went wrong, but it was my plan all along!\" This is so cliche and the easy way out in trying to make an ending for the out-of-control story that they no longer had any idea what they were doing with. (see spoiler review below)\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is good for some amusement, but don't expect a master piece.\\n\\n\r\n<<SPOILER REVIEW>> (a more in-depth review, but with slight spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to go back to discuss the ending. Throughout the show, we slowly start to see Lelouch's descent into power madness and corruption. These are the same traits we know his father to have. We see him struggle with the idea that he is becoming like his father...and then we're told at the end that it was all a plot and he did it on purpose... It just cheapens the whole inner struggle. I just find this to be silly.",

This show is ingeniously written and a sheer pleasure to watch as the story unfolds and we learn more about the world we are put into. The story only becomes better as it unfolds.\r\n[ART: 9/10]\r\nThe character design and art itself are great and only goes up in quality during the transition from R1 to R2. The main characters have much thought and care put intotheir designs and they stand out compared to other characters, whether it's in this series or any other. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe sound was done masterfully, both the voice acting and background music. Everything fits and the voice actors do a great job portraying their characters for the animation they're in.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe main characters are extremely well-written and unforgettable. Lelouch is seen as one of the best characters in anime history and it isn't hard to see why. Whether you see him as a harsh dictator or enthralling hero, you'll have a difficult time hating him by the end.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10]\\n\r\nI loved this show all the way through watching it and I never felt as if it wasn't anything but great during. As a groundbreaking masterpiece of the medium, Code Geass will stand the test of time as one of the previous decade's greatest animated works.",

A battle of ideals. The most powerful wins. The weak dies and they suffer. Basically this anime is about ideals. Ideals of a person\r\nand what he or she thinks what is right. A battle of what is right basically. And we have here our two main characters protagonist being Lelouch himself code name Zero and also the antagonist Suzaku Kuraragi . The story revolves around them and their Ideals basically. Now lets talkmore about ideals. This anime has shown me that ideals can be a very scary thing and also a weakness. This has shown in the anime that a person's ideals can deny the action of a certain person even if it is what is right. It suppresses them, their own ideals. And just like that our main character is suppressed by his own ideals and so eventually leads to his misery. It's a battle of power and one mistake can ruin everything. And so Code Geass leads to a interesting topic of ideals and if ur an idealistic person then you should definitely watch this show heck doesn't matter just watch this show maybe it'll give you a different perspective of life. Or you know a different set of ideals, Just like what it did to me. This story is a 10/10 for me. \\n\\n\r\ncontinuation : After rewatching the anime I have realized something. It's surely a battle of ideals. But the only thing that will truly triumph is power. Power is Everything. It doesn't matter what is your ideal. As long as you win, In the end you will triumph. And so that is what I learned in this anime",

            "content": "I believe that by looking at this anime's genre at a first glance, you may think that this is a mecha battle anime like Gundam or a military sci-fi anime like Akira or a superpower anime like many of the other anime that you have seen before. And you are not wrong. It does contain all of them, in perfect proportions. However, Code Geass has something more, that overshadows every genre mentioned, that makes it beautiful. It is not its well written original storyline, nor its cool art, nor its memorable soundtrack. It is something more, something elemental, which sets it apart from other anime.And you may not believe me when I say it, but it is the truth.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is REALISTIC. You may ponder upon how something set in a mecha world, with superpowers is realistic, when an anime is typically nothing but. The reason is that Code Geass does not just give a mecha battle, it shows the deep conflict between both the sides and the reason for the battle. It does not just give a military sci-fi, it also gives depth to the consequences and the meaning behind everything and how it came to be. And most importantly, the superpowers are not just powers, they define each and every character and how it changes them. Every character is a victim of his/her own choices and that just makes this more natural to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is awesome and well paced. At the end of each episode, you are in full anticipation of the next and you get to live the story. The anime may be difficult to understand from the first episode due to its varied style of storytelling, however, as you go past the first 3 episodes, it becomes easier to understand the entire perspective of the story. Summarizing the story here is nearly impossible, however, the story alternates between light paced humor and hugely dark scenarios unpredictably. It is emotional and appealing. You also understand the reasons as to how everything came into place and that was one of  the things that appealed to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art  is quite beautiful, though I would have been happier if they tried even more. But still, the art design of each character is quite good indeed and Zero is the most coolest of them. The mecha design is also sleek and efficient. I am happy that they improved more in the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing and I would suggest that you listen to some of them sometime later on. And don't miss the intro soundtrack and the ed, most of them are quite good. I can say nothing more than the fact that it blends into the story in its own way. Sometimes the melody underscores the emotions felt in a scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is one of the focal points in Code Geass and you can't argue with the decisions made by the main characters, no matter how extreme they may be. Lelouch and Suzaku are the most contrasting characters and their conflict is central. Also, the partnership of Kallen and Lelouch is one of the best, as they reflect off each other. One of my favorite scenes in the anime comes in at episode 13, where you see how well their character had developed compared to the beginning of the series. Their conversation during this episode is one of the best and shows immense reasoning with their views and how they have changed into more complex and stronger characters. Of course, this is one among many of the places where I see how Code Geass improved upon the multiple character dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a 10, because this is a masterpiece worth watching, where you don't just view the next episode just because you have to, but because you want to. And it never disappoints anywhere and is something I would definitely be proud to call one of the most enjoyable anime. And after watching it, I am sure that you would too.\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY 10/10:\r\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch is the 1st of two seasons of the series more commonly known as Code Geass. This series is about Lelouch vi Britannia who lives under his alias Lelouch Lamperouge, the name taken from his mother. When he was 10 years old his mother died while his sister Nunnally became paralyzed from being shot in both legs and also became blinded. Lelouch was angry at his father and King of Britannia, Charles, over this incident and threatened to renounce his entitlement to the throne. Unexpectedly his father already had plans to send him and his sister to Japan so theycould be used as political hostages. While there they stayed with the Prime Minister's family, the Kururugi's, where he met Suzaku who became his best friend, even though they never got along at first. After the Britannian Empire created Knightmare Frames (fighting robots/ mechs), they quickly took over Japan, leaving Lelouch and his sister without a place to go until they were taken in by the Ashford family and given a room at their academy. \\n\r\nCharles view of the world is stern; there are winners and losers, the rich and poor, and those at the bottom will never succeed. Lelouch swore after everything that happened, he would make a fair world so his sister could have a chance as well as find out about his mother's death. But to do this he would need power, authority, money, a team, and a way for no one to recognize him. He thought he would need to wait a long time for all of this to come together, but then he meets a mysterious girl named C.C. who makes a contract with him in order for her to get one wish and Lelouch to get a geass. The geass is an eye power that is different for every user. Lelouch can use his geass to control anybody with a gaze in their eyes, but can only use it once per person. After receiving the Geass he leads a group of rebels through radio into defeating Clovis. After this he dons his new outfit and mask to become Zero, the knight of justice.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nYou would think an action series would use a shonen style, but on the contrary, it uses CLAMPS's, a shoujo style wich surprisingly goes well with the series. Its refreshing to see this rather than the same old shonen style.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nIn my opinion the OST's were average, not great but not bad wither. As for the openings and endings, well, they just weren't my type of music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10:\\n\r\nCode Geass has a wide variety of characters ato like, and well, dislike. But in this review I will focus on the 4 main characters:\\n\\n\r\nLelouch vi Britannia is an extremely intellegent high school student who doesn't take his studies or his postion of Vice-President on the Student Council too seriously. He is calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his upbrining. Even so he is righteous and noble by nature he has a belief that he must commit evil to destroy an even greater evil. At first his goals are a bit selfish but, he comes to realize that his goal can become good for the entire world. He also has a habit of blaming everything on himself, whether or not he is at fault. And though he can be merciless on the battlefield, he truly cares for his friends at school and his comrades on the battlefield. \\n\\n\r\nSuzaku Kururugi wants to change Britannia just like Lelouch, but believes violence will not solve anything. He is naieve belief that Britannia can be changed for the better. This huge difference of beliefs between him and Lelouch eventually leads them to become rivals. Then mortal enemies after Zero kills Suzaku's love in which he loses some of his naivety and no longer believe that killing will no longer solve anything. Since he wants nothing more than Zero dead.\\n\\n\r\nC.C. is a mysterious girl who can grant the powers of the Geass among anyone who she deems fit. She is quite cold and emotionless, but over time begins to care about Lelouch more than just someone she wants to use to get her wish.\\n\\n\r\nKallen Stadtfeld/Kozuki is a half Britannian on her father's side and a Japanese on her mother's. She also has a low temper, is very stong willed and sometimes impulsive. Despite all of this she is sensitive and gentle. She can come off to people at first as cold and ruthless, but cares deeply for her teammates and especially for Zero which grows as the series goes on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nAt first I thought I wouldn't like this series because I hate mech series, but soon came to realize that this story has a deep plot with many twists that you can just not stop watching. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10:\\n\r\nI would reccommend this series to anyone 14+ because it does have violence and blood as well as dark themes. As for genre, don't worry what type of series you are into because I promise you that this is a series  anybody would enjoy.",

            "content": "Story-9/10\r\nLelouch- \u2018\u2019To defeat evil, I shall become an even greater evil!\u2019\u2019\r\nI will say at this point. Code Geass does what it says on the tin. It is over the top, plot twists are incomprehensible and clich\u00e9 themes are used throughout. Watching Code Geass and complaining about the lack of beauty or realism makes as much sense as buying a solar powered flashlight. Code Geass is there for the entertainment, so bear that in mind\u2026 Now to the review. \r\nCode Geass certainly knows how to carry out such a grand and theatrical story. The overall conflict takes place on planet earth as we know it, withslight changes in world history. World politics and moral stances, although extreme, are thus all too familiar, and the viewer is therefore easily able to grasp the sheer scale and severity of the actions and moral dilemmas in the anime. The story itself is straight forward. Code Geass knows where it wants to go, and how to get there. As a result, every episode (even with the supposed filler episodes) will conclude and offer relevant advancements in the story. The sheer pace and scale of the show makes watching Code Geass an exciting and dramatic experience. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass does well to set the stage for its succeeding TV series. The grey themes in Code Geass are taken very seriously, and for the viewer to fully appreciate the different views, care must be taken when presenting them. Code Geass does take it\u2019s time to make sure you understand the different characters\u2019 perspectives and political situation the world finds itself in. Once the stage is set, the show really does take off and the scale and general epicenes of everything gradually and successfully builds, leading the way to the second series. \\n\\n\r\nThe moral dilemmas are well argued in the anime. The universe of Code Geass creates the ideal setting for the controversial and applicable issues to be presented. Each viewpoint surfaces through sound reasoning, is enhanced through personal experience and is pushed to the limits through vigorous testing of one\u2019s will. The level battlefield between the arguments results in the viewer being constantly thrown around by powerful/ logical viewpoints and flawed outcomes. While characters themselves may not be overly consistent or powerful in presenting their own personal ideas, they all contribute to make sure the two, main overarching ideas are at the forefront and are in constant conflict. \\n\\n\r\nArt-8/10\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest, a Code Geass wallpaper does look like the local circus is hosting a Yu-Gi-Oh themed wrestling match. Do not be put off by this. Code Geass has the potential to be a very dark anime but its clear aim of simply providing entertainment lends itself to this style of animation. The colours used are striking and add to the theatrical feel of the anime and the almost crude representation of the human body makes Code Geass feel like more of a play (rather than a realistic portrayal that we could relate to, which of course, Code Geass could never be). The battle scenes and environments are full of detail and action. Character design and the design of the universe in general maintains the theatrical and striking style of Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack further emphasises this feeling of experiencing a show. When you are watching a play in a theatre, you are aware of the stage and the audience; the soundtrack thus aims to make you aware that you are watching an epic piece of drama. It never tries to help you affiliate with characters through using unique character OSTs or encourage you to become emotionally entwined with relationships by using overly beautiful soundtracks. It simply wants you to sit back and enjoy all of these individual aspects as part of the overall performance and it does this by using the same, theatrical language throughout most of the OSTs. Otherwise, voice acting in subbed is fantastic, certain characters in dubbed lack gravitas, but on the whole is successful. Here are some soundtracks that best represent the universe of Code Geass; \u2018\u2019Britannian National Anthem\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019Stories\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u20190\u2019\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLelouch- \u2018\u2019The trick of real combat is that everyone is human.\u2019\u2019\\n\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass has a legendary array of characters. The anime finds itself having to balance moral arguments, military bodies, different main characters and the weaker, entertainment driven supporting cast. Code Geass makes sure that each group/ individual can be respected and understood and does this by providing constant and gradual development. How the groups interact within themselves and how each organisation views other organisations are also well explored. The result of this even and constant development between all persons results in one of the largest cast of characters from anime that can all be understood and respected. \\n\\n\r\nNo matter their fa\u00e7ade in battle, every character is undoubtedly a human. What was so great to see was that every character sets of with a steadfast commitment to their personal beliefs, but are constantly and vigorously tested to the point where they can no longer walk with such pride. Lelouch, the main, and supposedly most resolute character ends up having his will tested the most and seeing a self-proclaimed king succumb to these tests delivers the arguments presented in Code Geass with absolute force. Having such authentic characters in an otherwise completely over the top anime enables the viewer to take the very controversial themes present in Code Geass that much more seriously.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is one hell of a thrill ride. Absolutely everything about Code Geass is done with the aim of the viewer\u2019s entertainment. The battle scenes offer intense stand offs between military geniuses, epic single conflicts and stunning visuals. Characters offer comedy, romance and drama into the mix. The story itself has an epic sense of scale to it. The only factor holding this section back is that Code Geass purposefully uses this first season to build up to the second season, and thus has placed some deliberate  shackles on the extent it is willing to go. But putting shackles on a dragon ain\u2019t gonna stop it flying or breathing fire! \\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/10\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is built for entertainment. It knows this, it uses everything in its power to emphasise this. Please look at Code Geass as a piece of entertainment, rather than some artistic masterpiece.  I thoroughly recommend for you to watch Code Geass, and sincerely hope you will have as great a time as I did. \\n",

            "content": "Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, or, more known as Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch is my first normal anime I saw since I watched Lucky Star. \"Normal\" meaning I was too busy watching 18+ hentai and I couldn't stop for some reason. I felt perverted. After seeing this, I decided to go back to my normal habits, in watching anime that isn't... well... porn.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nLelouch Lamperouge or... if I said anymore it'd be a spoiler. Lelouch Lamperouge  is a high school kid, that gets into the wrong situation and ends up being tangled up with terrorists. Police and shit get the wrong ideaand think that Lelouch is the terrorist, and are about to kill him. Just before dying, Lelouch makes a contract with a mysterious girl named \"C.C\" which gives him the power to make anyone obey absolutely any order. The power is called... you guessed it. Geass. You didn't guess it? Well... not my problem, then... So, Lelouch decides to make the world a better place for his younger sister Nunnally, and kill all the mother-fucking Brittanians. Doing so with his so-called Geass power.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style, animation style, whatever you want to call it, is awesome, but for some reason I don't give it a 10. Eh, I don't understand my own logic, but there's just something missing, maybe because it was made in 2006? I don't know, I might just be being racist, but, eh, just a couple of things missing I just can't quite lay my finger on it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing and I would advise anyone to listen to it... or not, just listen to it while watching the anime, because, you know, the music plays in the background in the scenes. I was going to be high, and give the sound a 9/10, but I thought \"Wait a minute! I didn't smoke pot today! I'm not going to be high!\" so I gave it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSome characters I don't like, so I gave it a 9/10, but the characters that I don't like I seem to like at times, because they're being normal. I don't know. C.C, Lelouch and Kallen are top tier, I don't know about Suzaku, he kinda gets on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me stop being a pervert and start watching normal anime again. I am now watching the second season, and after that I'm going to go look for some more normal anime.\\n\\n\r\nThings to not take seriously: The quote about smoking pot. I don't smoke pot, or smoke at all. And, you do take the hentai part seriously, that shit seriously happened.",

After watching the first episode I was really amazed that what happened.  It's very much like death note + gundam seed because It fallows a same goal as death note.  Why gundam seed some people ask?.  As I said before this anime is like death note + gundam seed.  There are robots/mechs like in seed but they don'treally look too detailed until suzuka got his new knightmare (gundam/robot/mech thingy).  I found it cool that they called it &quot;knightmare&quot;.  The story itself is amazing and there Is an second season coming.\\n\\n\r\nSound: All I can say is excellent and pretty detailed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Most of the characters look pretty good and very well made/drawn (not sure if thats a word o.o).  Well it's not really a downside but most the characters In code geass never really changes cloths much and always wear the same thing.  \\n\\n\r\nI am looking forward for season 2 and I bet you are if you start watching CODE GEASS.  Code geass FTW!! (for the win).",

            "content": "I had put off Code Geass for such a long time despite hearing many good things about it. To me, that whole mecha thing always feels like a ripoff of Gundam. In addition, i had heard from a few friends that \"it's like death note\" or \"it's death note with robots\" & while this comparison is an easy conclusion, when you get down to it, they're pretty different but that's obvious considering their different stores. \r\nAnyway, the STORY; \r\nGreat story. One of the best i have ever come across. It's not especially unique but entirely entertaining and well thought out, never rushed & always keepingyou on the edge. It's fairly unpredictable or at least, not a cliche story. The story progresses well with each episode, and has a perfect blend of comedy, action, psychology, idealism & so on & so on. Only problem I had was that after each episode,(or many) instead of leaving off directly with what had just happened at the end of the previous episode, it takes you to some unknown point in the future and so sometimes, it can be confusing as i was. There were a few times i asked myself what the fuck was going on but it was brief so maybe it is worth mentioning. There are lots of tiny sub plots and interesting developments that all relate to the overall story scheme and so in short, there is no objective fault with the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nI hate clamps art style. So if you don't like it then you can't really do anything about it. I never liked it but the anime is so good it doesn't matter at all. Their skinny lanky bodies put me off but it's not animated badly, it's just a style so i rated it a 7/10 just because i dislike the style, but overall, great animation, especially with the mecha robot suit things(they have names but there's too many to count to list) & they give special attention to the main character and so his artwork from facial features, movements, etc is especially great. \\n\\n\r\nsound: \\n\\n\r\nAgain, if you don't like the opening/ending or music than what can you do? \\n\r\nI liked the first opening by FLOW, as I like the band FLOW & it seemed appropriate. The other two, i didn't like at all, nor did i like any of the ending & the sound for this show isn't particularly great anyway. It's definitely not memorable except for maybe the first opening and none of the background music was especially memorable or outstanding, probably average to ok at best.  But none of it hinders the anime nor does it ever feel out of place. If you pay attention to the sound the entire time, you'll probably come to the conclusion that \"It's okay\" & that \"They could have done better\". \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThere a shitload of characters, and though so many are one dimensional & unchanging, they are there for a decent amount of episodes, and serve some function. The main character, Lelouch, is so fantastically presented and dealt with that despite his choices, which let's be honest, in the very general term of the word, \"Bad\". But existentially, no right or wrong blah blah blah . The mindset he has, the choices he makes, his ideals, his life, his family, his opinions, they are all very real and unlike death note's Light(as the two animes are compared) he is much more likable. The other characters such as Suzuku and Euphemia and C.C all have great development as well, though suzuku's ideals are cliche as fuck which made me dislike him most of the time but eventually, through developments in the story, he becomes much more understandable at the least. Euphemia is cliche in many regards but really, that whole cliche thing isn't too bad because regardless, there are people who think like that(you'll know exactly what when you watch the anime) & code geass gives every character a fresh look & so their ideals are the only things truly cliche, not so much the characters themselves. Each have a decent unique story & past. C.C is very unique but mostly because her story & past are only ever briefly touched upon & never really explained which i imagine will be in the next season. Some characters appear out of nowhere which is confusing & are seemingly very important but again, i probably have to wait until next season. Overall, great characters, and even the minor ones are fresh, as is their story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nAs with anything it comes down to your own satisfaction. I loved this anime and have found no objective faults, and only subjective faults i have are with the artwork. It is a great anime with a fresh new plot, great unique characters and an amazing story that always makes you want to watch the next episode. There is no real right & wrong and the show presents it as such with characters on all sides with pasts, opinions, family, loved ones, etc. \\n\\n\r\nI high recommend this anime & to any of the people who click, \"i did not find this helpful\" I can't possibly understand why so fuck you in advance.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS***\r\nBefore I start, I implore you to read the review first before trying to chop my head off. If there is ANYTHING I say in this review that isn't 100% accurate, feel free to let me know. Also, I have not watched the second season nor plan to for a long while because of how appalling season one was.\r\nNow, since this is a very negative review, there will be spoilers as I said before because it would be impossible to address the major flaws in this series without revealing large parts of the plot, so let's get into this.\r\nThe largest and most impossible to ignoreflaw with this show is filler. I am truly baffled as to how a show can have this much critical success when well over 50% of the show is filler. How the fuck can you even pack THIS much filler into a 25 episode anime? And don't come at me with this \"it's not filler, it's slow paced\" bullshit; it's filler.\\n\\n\r\nSince I'm going to assume you've already watched this anime before reading this review because of the spoilers warning I gave earlier, I'm going to skip giving a backstory since you all should already know the plot. The story is about our protagonist Lelouch trying to reclaim Japan from the Holy Empire of Brittania as Zero, assisted by the \"Geass\" given to him by C.C., a power that allows Lelouch to bend anyone to his will once he has made eye-contact with him/her. Unfortunately, the plot elements that contribute to this main plotline are less than 50% of the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAlready at episode 6 we have a filler episode that contributes absolutely nothing to the main story, \"The Stolen Mask\". It is an episode about Lelouch trying to recover his Zero mask from a cat who stole it, yes, that takes up an entire episode.\\n\r\nThe entire Mao arc also contributed absolutely nothing to the main plot. It is a completely pointless side-story that takes up about 4 episodes, the most impactful thing to come out of that pointless side-story is Lelouch using his Geass on Shirley to get her to forget ever knowing about Zero. The worst part is that this happens during our protagonists first encounter with Mao, then this meaningless side story of Mao continues on for another three episodes. Can someone explain to me how the kidnapping and recovery of Nunnally contributed ANYTHING to the main story? What was accomplished by the end of the Mao arc? A character (Shirley) with awful characterization that didn't give me a reason to care about her as a character lost her memory of Lelouch. Oh my, soak up four episodes with this shit, fuck freeing Japan from the grips of the Holy Empire.\\n\\n\r\nThe parts of the show where this bullshit (aka blatant filler) isn't going on, are (for the most part) just side-stories of x group has captured x area, Zero and friends will free the people of x area. I can't call these parts of the show filler though, because they do have some correlation with the main plot, however these are simply just side-stories. \\n\\n\r\nThe show starts showing some semblance of coherence around episode 18 after Suzaku is knighted by Euphemia. Unfortunately, three episodes later we have another POINTLESS filler episode \"The School Festival Declaration\" where everyone builds a giant pizza. Are you fucking kidding me? Four episodes away from the end of the series and it's fucking \"let's build a pizza\" day.\\n\r\nI'm getting a headache writing this..on the topic of pizza though, there was something particularly cringe-worthy about the shameless Pizza Hut product placement.\\n\\n\r\nSigh, regardless, continuing on from let's build a pizza day, the show again shows a bit of coherence for three episodes, then ends on a cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - This anime was recommended to me because all I had been watching up until this was psychological, dark, dementia type anime like Lain, NHK, Koi Kaze etc, and this was my break from those types of shows, so I had absolutely no bias while coming into the show, all i was expecting was something decent so my review is purely objective.\\n\\n\r\nThis was truly one of the most fatiguing and frustrating anime experiences I've ever had. The only reason I didn't give this a 1 is because the art and sound were fairly good. This show is compared to Death Note a lot but I don't see the comparison whatsoever. Death Note, while not flawless, has a coherent plot. Geass is a clusterfuck of filler and side-stories with poor characterization. I couldn't find myself able to give a shit about any of the characters, the characterization was that bad. HOW THE FUCK IS THIS SO POPULAR? You know what I shouldn't be surprised because garbage like Ghoul are among the most popular, and that pile of shit was actually better than Geass, even though it's like comparing dog shit to cow shit. \\n\r\nAnyway, I'm going off on a tangent now because writing this really annoyed me.\\n\\n\r\n3/10, do yourself a favor and don't watch it.\\n",

            "content": "I'm not a fan of mechas. I despise mechas with all my heart. This is why I avoided Code Geass for a long time even though it became mainstream. This is also why I hate Gundam shows with a passion. I decided to give this show a try and next thing I know, I was hooked. \r\n[Story]: (9.2/10)\r\nCode Geass takes place in an alternate modern day timeline where the world is split between three superpowers: The Holy Britannian Empire, The Chinese Federation, and the European Union. On August 10, 2010, the Holy Britannian Empire set its sight to Japan and invaded Japan within one monthwith their use of new mobile humanoid armor vehicles dubbed Knightmare Frames. Japan has been stripped of its right and identity, now re-named by the Britannians \"Area 11\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story, in my opinion, is magnificent. Well, it could have been a perfect masterpiece if it wasn't for the last few episodes where they decided to cram in more plot twists and left the viewers with more plot holes that will most likely be answered in the second season and of course, the season finale cliffhanger. I didn't see it as a bad thing but I also didn't see it as a good thing either. I'm the kind of guy who watches a show and expects everything to be answered in the season alone. This is why I don't like plot holes and season finale cliffhangers. Anyways, This are literally the only flaws I found within Code Geass. Everything else is perfect.\\n\r\nBack to the story, I love it. I love how the conflicts unravel between the superpower countries, I just love the strategies that are being planned by the characters and see them play out, and etc. \\n\r\nThe politics in the show are almost realistic and they've done a great job of displaying the character's tactics. This clearly shows that the staff of Code Geass knew their politics very well and they also knew how leadership situation plays out. The show also has a lot of plot twists and most of them are executed perfectly. Some of them are minor plot twists and most of them are shocking plot twists that will leave you at awe and will affect the overall plot. Man, the plot twists are ready to bite's Lelouch's ass when it's needed to. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is perfect. It doesn't move too fast and it doesn't move too slow either. It explains the situation that's going on around and if it leaves a few plot holes, the show will answer it in the later episodes. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe Animation for it's time is great. When was this show made? 2006? 2007? Whatever, the animation looks beautiful, the environment looks great for its time and the mecha's design are gorgeous. Especially the Lancelot and the Guren Mark II. You know, for a 2006 anime, the mecha fighting scenes are very fluid. There's no still frames and everything is flowing smoothly. However, the biggest issue I have in terms of CG's animation is the character design. The characters tend to be inhumanly tall, inhumanly slender, and inhumanly pretty, like they took an instant-growth pill because they were a bunch of elves in their previous lives or something. I got used to the character designs after 5 episodes but I still get bothered by it from time to time. For the love of god, I hope that CLAMP doesn't do the character design for the next season. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, in my opinion, is great. The background theme that plays during the battle scenes are awesome and it fits so well. There is one issue though. The music used in dramatic scenes. I'm probably the only one thinking that here but it doesn't fit. Just play some goddamn theme instead of some guy singing in the background which felt out of place. There are 3 OP theme songs and 2 ED theme songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe 1st OP is \"COLORS\" by FLOW, the 2nd OP is \"Kaidoku Funou\" by Jinn and the 3rd OP is \"Hitomi no Tsubasa\" by Access. My opinions on the OP theme songs? The 1st OP is one of the best opening soundtrack I've ever heard. The 2nd OP is the worst opening soundtrack I've ever heard. I just skipped the 2nd opening before they switched to the 3rd opening which is a lot better than the 2nd opening. Why couldn't the 3rd opening be the 2nd opening? The singer in the 2nd opening is annoying as hell. Even Justin Bieber is better than Jinn. Now my opinions on the ED theme songs. The 1st ED theme song is great and the 2nd ED theme song is, once again, sung by an annoying singer who can't even sing. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'm going to review the English VA. In my opinion, the English Voices fits the show very well. I mean, why would a Britannian speak perfect Japanese? Why is one of the Chinese Federation members speaking perfect Japanese? Anyways, most of them did a great job except Suzaku's VA. He sounds somewhat monotonic in some scenes. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (10/10)\\n\r\nEasily a perfect score from me. Why? Because most of the characters are well written, fully developed, and most of them are Three.Fucking.Dimensional. Take notes, future potential writers. CG shows that it's not hard to give your character some life, give him/her some goddamn personality (looking at you Touma), make him/her not a useless character, and etc. Now, the actual character's review.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch Lamperouge or you can call him Lelouch vi Britannia which I highly prefer calling, is the main protagonist of the show and a student of the Ashford Academy High School. One day, he got a mysterious ability called \"Geass\" from a girl named C2 which allows him to command other people whatever he wants. However, there are restrictions and side effects. Lelouch just became one my new favorite characters and currently one of the best protagonist I have ever seen. Why? Because he's strategically smart, his plans are not dumb and is well thought out, he has flaws just like the rest of the human beings, he doesn't whine when his plans don't go to plan, he's a well developed and a three dimensional main protagonist, and I can literally list more but this is getting way too long. \\n\r\nC.C or what the Eng. Dub calls her, C2 which I also highly prefer calling her, is a mysterious girl who gave Lelouch the \"Geass\" and allied up with him to protect his life. C2 is now also one of my new favorite characters because she's a developed character, she has a personality, she's not annoying and she likes eating huge amounts of pizza. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (10/10)\\n\r\nEven though I hate mechas, I easily enjoyed Code Geass as a whole because of the engaging and well thought out story, likable characters, and it balances dialogues and action which prevented me from getting bored.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nCode Geass is one of the best shows I've seen yet. Besides the plot holes and the season finale cliffhanger, I seriously love the story, the politics behind the show, Lelouch, and the action scenes doesn't drag out too long instead of some random explosions with no meaning behind it. This is now going to my Top 10 Favorite Animes of all time. If you're not a fan of mechas, like me, then I still recommend that you watch this show. You seriously will not regret it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Story\\n\r\n+Great and Beautiful Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Fully developed and well written characters\\n\r\n+Balances out dialogue and action scenes\\n\r\n+Cliffhangers did their job (Except the season finale cliffhanger)\\n\r\n+Perfect plot twists\\n\r\n+Lelouch is one of the best protagonists I have seen yet.\\n\r\n+Pizza Hut logos around the show. A nice little touch up\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Character designs looks atrocious\\n\r\n-Out-of-place dramatic theme and songs\\n\r\n-Season finale cliffhanger\\n\r\n-Few fanservice",

            "content": "*This will be a review for the entire series, both Season 1 and Season 2*\r\nINTRODUCTION:\r\nCode Geass is set in an alternate Earth, in which there are three major political entities - the Holy Britannian Empire, the Chinese Federation and Europia United. The former one, led by Charles Zi Britannia, is the world's current superpower. They invaded and took control of Japan, renaming it as \"Area 11\" and its inhabitants as \"The Elevens\". Britannians living in Area 11 act in superiority towards the elevens, which face prejudice and mistreatment by their conquerors.\r\nAbout ten years after the conquest, resistance can still be found in the area fromgroups that still call themselves \"japanese\" and want to free their country from Britannia's tyranny. Using mechas to fight one another, the conflict is far from being over, and that is when the story starts. The show features mind games and strategic planning throughout the entire series, while stakes keep getting higher and higher. Politics and its implications are a major part of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPLOT:\\n\\n\r\nLelouch Lamperouge is a brilliant, just and genius britannian student that finds himself in the middle of an act of resistance, where he meets C.C., a misterious girl that was imprisoned. For some reason, C.C. proceeds to give Lelouch a \"geass\", a power which lets the main character literally command people to do whatever he wants. With it, he manages to contact the resistance under the name of Zero. Suffering imminent defeat, the resistance listens to Zero's orders and manages to turn the tides of the battle due to his privilleged strategic planning and information. With that, the common student naturally becomes the misterious leader of the resistance under this exotic, unknown persona.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot follows the struggle of the resistance, now under new leadership, as well as Lelouch's student life. It is a fine balance between his own personal objectives and the world's political struggles. Characters are introduced throughout the story and, in general, they are all well-written, interesting and unique in their own ways. With a huge roster, some of them are bound to not be as interesting as others - in that regard, there is only a single character whose existence I completely despise. There's fine character progression for most of them, which helps to define the tone of the story. Some characters face moral dilemnas throughout the story as well, which makes us wonder who the \"good guy\" is, if there's even one. Do the means justify the end or not? Is it right to sacrifice one for thousands of others?\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the art style, it is nothing to marvel at, it just fits the environment and the tone. In general, I'm not a fan of the mecha genre, so I couldn't care about the action scenes nor about the mechas' powers. In some episodes, fan service is present, both in the form of tight clothes and partial, explicit nudity, which is also something that does not interest me at all. When it comes to the original soundtrack, the anime features amazing sound design in some critical plot points, though it lacks in other parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season does a good job in setting the world, its rules and the events that happen. Its pacing is great, slowly building hype towards each new major plot point. It makes us care for different characters. It makes us crave for the next episode. It makes us want to know more about Zero's plans. The end of the season is incredible, ending on a high tone. There was one specifically scene that made me literally shiver in anxiety and worry, which is something that rarely happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season starts slowly. It takes some time for the plot to advance and, when it does, it is not as significant as it could have been. Some subplots just take way more time than it should and, up until the second half of the season, I was not thrilled by the show. I can safely say it was the least interesting part of it - it wasn't bad, but it simply wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. Some of it feel like \"more of the same\", though without being as important. However, the second half of this season is on par with the first - that is when questions are answered and things move in a great pace. The last few episodes are simply brilliant, featuring one of the best endings I've ever experienced.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is a brilliant anime. It suffers from power creep and has, eventually, pacing flaws, though nothing is critical to the enjoyment of the show. The story is amazing, featuring charismatic characters and moral dilemnas that makes it worth it to watch the anime, even if you are not a fan of the mecha genre.",

            "content": "Yesterday, I finished watching the English dubbed version of \u2018Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2\u2019 and now, I feel compelled to write this review. It only took me a few marathon days of watching hours and hours on end to smash through the fifty episodes of the two seasons, which for me is a feat in itself considering my hectic school schedule. Even so, every minute I was away from my computer screen, my life was on hold as this extremely addictive, thought provoking and visually awesome anime played on my mind. All I could wonder about was Lelouch and his impossible conquest againstBritannia. To put it simply, \u2018Code Geass\u2019 is the greatest anime I\u2019ve watched to date.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly have to ask myself, where do I start? I have to say that the greatest strength of \u2018Code Geass\u2019 is its remarkable political complexity. While the subject of revolution may seem clich\u00e9 and has been used in many forms of literature, film and even anime over and over again, never before have I encountered such an in-depth expos\u00e9 of the subject. \u2018Code Geass\u2019 pulls no punches and fully immerses you within the world of both the fascist regime of Britannia and Zero\u2019s \u2018just\u2019 revolutionary army known as The Black Knights. Both armies are brutal, unforgiving and ruthless, always sacrificing whatever it takes to reach their own objective. As the bloody conflict rages on you\u2019ll constantly be asking yourself, do the ends justify the means? Is the lesser evil worth the cost? Your own morality plays an integral part in the viewing experience and if you take an interested in politics \u2018Code Geass\u2019 is a must watch, especially if you\u2019re heavily invested in either the right or left wing.\\n\\n\r\nEven if politics isn\u2019t your thing, \u2018Code Geass\u2019 will almost certainly have something for you. There\u2019s an insane amount of different themes blended into the story with everything from interesting characters, comedic school life and cute romances to clever military tactics, blood and violence and even sci-fi conspiracies, super human powers and strange alternate worlds. What\u2019s great is that none of these themes turn any of the episodes into pointless fillers, but rather take the viewer deeper into the relationship between these different themes throughout the story. For action fans itching for a fight, this might be a boring diversion but the light-hearted breaks from the bloodshed shine a light upon the injustice of both Britannia and The Black Knights as their conflict affects the entire structure of the society, involving those who never intended to be and changing their lives for better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads into the characters of \u2018Code Geass\u2019, and with a large cast of both supporting and main characters, pretty much every outlook and walk of life you could imagine is taken care of. Diversity is key here and the writers and character designers have done an amazing job of creating individuals from every facet of society. Each character is an exhibition of the type of people who\u2019re getting caught up in the conflict. It makes you wonder how others like them around the world are coping, adding a real human element into every character even if they don\u2019t make a major impact to the overall narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Lelouch, is nothing short of a strategic genius and could only be described as the perfect general. On the battlefield, where failure is never an option, he dons a mask and takes upon the persona of Zero, and his cold, calculating and brutally efficient style of warfare is often carried out with a disturbing level of emotional detachment. The only objective is the one that\u2019s set prior to the mission and Zero will do anything in his power to see that objective completed, even if it means sacrificing his own troops, manipulating those in his way with geass or slaying countless innocent civilians. All this is for the simple goal of preserving his little sister Nunnally and creating his ideal world where she can live in peace. Even so, as we\u2019re exposed to Lelouch and his persona, there\u2019s a certain level of sympathy that we can lend to him as his traumatic past has lead him down a path of death and destruction, all for the sake of avenging his mother\u2019s death and ensuring that Britannia\u2019s warmongering ways will never be repeated again in the future. Is this noble goal worth the sacrifice of millions, if not billions, of people to ensure that countless more won\u2019t be slain? This is where your morality as a viewer comes into play, and I must say, it\u2019s a disturbing thought.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is another strong point of the series and really goes the extra mile to amplify the intensity of the battle scenes and showcase the fantastic array of possible futuristic technology. The sheer scope and scale of the battles, especially large combat zones crawling with thousands of Knightmare Frames, tanks, aircraft, battleships and other forms of military arsenal, send a shiver up the spine as the vast conflict rages. I highly suggest watching in HD, whether it be streamed or downloaded, as a low definition picture really wouldn\u2019t be able to do justice to the chaotic beauty of these particular scenes and the rest of the visuals in the series. Colours are vivid and lines are clear, however if there was one complaint it would certainly be the proportions of some of the characters as they stand when we\u2019re looking at them from afar. Their physiques are way too thin, but this is only a minor complaint as the art really struts its stuff in fast paced action sequences. When characters aren\u2019t in their Knightmare Frames, it\u2019s the banter that\u2019s the more important.\\n\\n\r\nThis is more opinion than anything else but for those who\u2019ve not yet watched the series I would recommend watching \u2018Code Geass\u2019 in English dub rather than Japanese for continuity reasons. The English voice acting is of high quality and fits every character to a tee, but the main reason is that Britannia is an empire based in North America with its capital city in what we would call the United States. There\u2019s no reason why any of the Britannian citizens or nobles would speak Japanese, except for a select few who live in Japan, and even then, considering the distaste towards \u2018Elevens\u2019 as they\u2019re now known, it\u2019s unlikely that they would even make an effort to speak Japanese at all. Even the students at Ashford Academy don\u2019t have much of a reason considering it\u2019s a school exclusively for Britannians and Honorary Britannians and not Japanese. It would make sense for English to have become a standardised language throughout the world during this time period as Britannia is the world\u2019s major power in terms of military, politics and trade, with Japan only being a small conquered region. Just my two cents on why the English dub is preferable over the Japanese audio.\\n\\n\r\nA further major point, as the explanation of the rules of the geass power become more and more abstract as time goes on, I would encourage some viewers to take the time to rewatch some scenes to understand just how it works because by the second season comes around, geass users, those affected by geass and the rules of geass become increasingly difficult to keep track of, which could cause a great deal of confusion for some viewers especially when it comes down to decisive moments within the story. This is also true for the philosophy of both sides and their reasoning for why they fight, as these issues become more complex as the war rages on and those fighting begin to question their reasoning behind their participation in the bloodbath.\\n\\n\r\nWith its complex take on world issues and the human condition, \u2018Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion\u2019 and it\u2019s follow up season \u2018Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion: R2\u2019 proves to be one of the greatest anime to ever hit the small screen. While questioning your own moral compass at every turn, you\u2019ll be biting your nails on the edge of your seat, wondering how Lelouch will command his army of Black Knights to victory and just what drives him to commit the atrocities that he orders. Is it out of hatred and vengeance for Britannia and its tyrannical regime? Or perhaps a sense of justice for the people of Japan and the rest of the world? Maybe it really is just for the sake of his little sister\u2019s safety, or is that simply a guise to justify a lust for power? With a scale and scope I\u2019ve personally never seen in an anime series before, you and your own morality will be the judge.\\n",

            "content": "This series is my current fav by far.\r\nStory: Too many people compare this series to Death Note.  The only similarities is that the main character is a teenage prodigy who's willing to use any means, including supernatural, necessary to achieve their goals.  The similarities end about there.\r\nAs a slight explanation, Geass is the ability that Lelouch has to force anyone to obey his commands by looking them in the eye.  The moral questions of this ability are never really explored but let your mind wander for 5 minutes on what you would do with it and I bet at the end ofthat 5 minutes you will have thought of at least of 3 crimes with 20 year minimum sentences.\\n\r\nThis series, and the sequel series, seems to mock the standard mecha anime formulas and metaphors.  The mecha only serve as a vehicle to allow the characters to fight without destroying each other.\\n\r\nThis is made clearer by the fact that despite a massive war and frighteningly powerful weaponry, only one major character is killed in the entire first series.\\n\r\nAnyone who's ever played a &quot;god-sim&quot; (ie Civilization) will recognize Lelouch's chidish attitude towards his war with Britannia at the beginning.  As time goes on, he matures but also continues to lose his innocence as he uses increasingly immoral means to meet his goals.  Suzaku, the almost stereotypical white knight, acts as his foil exemplifying traditional attributes of heroes; physical ability, honest nature, comradery.  I don't have much to talk about with the story since this series is almost completely character-driven.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Nothing special, though all the characters are memorable and interesting.  Lelouch is a very flexible character who they can make look heroic, apathetic, and downright sinister. The mecha are nothing fantastic though the choreography of the battles is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I enjoyed the opening and closing credits of most of the episodes.  Nothing I want to add to my mp3 playlist, but they work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Lelouch's character is amazingly complex as he goes from a child wishing to avenge his mother to a man who begins to realize the importance of his actions.  In the end, he returns to his childish ways at the end of this series and he and his comrades pay the price of his actions.  Things turn around in R2, but that's a different review.  Suzaku's development is very little in this series.  Of course that makes his changes in R2 that much more fascinating, but in this one he's a very static character.  In the end he suffers for Lelouch's actions and puts into motion Lelouch's own suffering.\\n\r\nThe side characters are largely boring.  I hated Mina, the bookworm closet lesbian racist, but then I expect that was the intent.  His school friends become an unnecessary bore and are anime school chum stereotypes.  Karen, pronounced and mispelled at times as Kallen, was a good character with clear motivation and background.  I feel as though her plotline(s) are neglected in both series.  C.C. (pronounced C2) is very boring.  Her droll manner is punctuated by brief moments of emotion toward Lelouch which are meant to be meaningful but largely fall flat.   By far C.C. is the most interesting character, but is never very engaging and is largely used to promote the show's primary sponsor, Pizza Hut. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: The mind-twist of this series is that you find yourself rooting for a person who is willing to destroy the world in a quest for revenge and the dim hope of making the world better for his sister.  When one sits down and really wonders what they would do with a power like Geass, one realizes what a true hero Lelouch is for not becoming completely corrupt and evil.",

This show looks, sounds, and very simply is, amazing. \r\nNote, some small spoilers may be in here.\r\nStory: 10\r\nCode Geass has an incredible plot. The idea was genius, and the way the played out the story worked perfectly. They brought the right things into view at the right time, and they did it throughout the whole series. When I saw the first episode, I didn't leave my computers chair for anything besides eating, and no other anime has been able to do that for me since. It was that good. \r\nArt: 10\r\nCode Geass looked amazing,simple as that. The world looked realistic and beautiful, and the knightmares, they were on a whole new level. Never in an anime have I seen cooler Mecha than I did in Code Geass. All of them just looked simply amazing.\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nWhile the sound effects and voices in Code Geass were amazing, I find that the music was to be a little lacking. It may have just been the opening songs, but personally I found the music to be a less well done than the anime itself.\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5\\n\r\nCode Geass had some amazing characters. Lelouche was simply incredible, and all of his friends allies and enemies were great too. So I take it your now wondering why I gave it 9.5 rather than 10. 1 reason. Nina. I don't know what it was about her, but something about her just REALLY aggravates me. However, thankfully she only played a very minor role in the series. Also, as I side note, this series has who I consider one of the most entertaining anime characters of ALL time: Earl Lloyd.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nNow, This show, was one of the most enjoyable shows I have and will EVER see. It had really epic action scenes, the characters were great, and the mechs, oh the mechs were great. This show was simply amazing to me.'\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\r\nIf I could give this show a 12, I would. I believe it to be one of the greatest animes ever made. I recommend ANYONE watch it. Its that good",

Sure, people go insane over Lelouch, but he's an over rated character, and simply isn't as awesome as Light.  \r\nIn fact, he's a pathetic wimp, and is not very intelligent at all.  He's the only real character that the anime goes into depth about, but then again that isn't saying much, because the story simply lackscharacter analysis.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was intriguing.  The use of ridiculous plot twists gets over done pretty quickly.  Plot twists are good, as long as they're believable and not dim-witted to an extreme.  There's no aspect of \"mystery\" and \"I want to watch more of this\" anywhere in the show, unlike Evangelion or Death Note.  \\n\\n\r\nEven though Evangelion was a character-based show, at least the concept of Angels and Nerv kept the watcher interested enough to keep viewing.  However, in Code Geass, there wasn't anything that made me want to keep on watching it, besides Lelouch's shitty past.  \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are all stereotypes, and never is the told anything interesting about them before they all die.  There were way too many characters in this story, first of all.  Also, unlike Light, Lelouch is a pathetic attempt at an anti-hero. \\n\\n\r\nI know I compare a lot of this to Death Note, because the anime takes much of the aspects of Death Note and makes them a lot worse.",

I must say that I'm absolutely blown away by this anime in almost every way!\r\nStory - 9/10: \r\nI liked how the story continued to suprise me, even though the whole \"I need to take revenge and destroy my evil father\" thing seemed a bit cliche at first. There were many plot twist that sometimes confused me a little and left me wondering what exactly was going on but I do like that in an anime! I had to think and guess  a lot which madeit even more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10: \\n\r\nThe art in this anime was really really great! It was very beautiful to look at and the character design was quite tasty (to me anyway). There might have been a little too much fanservice for my liking (nudity, breasts and such) but I guess that boys wouldn't have a problem with this at all! :)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5/10:\\n\r\nI didn't really care that much for the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10:\\n\r\nI liked how the different characters complemented each other. The main characters had a lot of dept and they continued to surprise me. I liked Lelouch as a main character even though he could seem very arrogant and bitchy at some times - he had his reasons. If I had to say something bad about the characters it would be that there were a few to many of them. I had a hard time remembering who was who because new characters continued to be introduced all the time. Whenever I would see a minor character I would be like \"who is he again?\". \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10:\\n\r\nI was very well entertained with this anime! I was caught by it from the begining and I just had to keep watching and watching to know what would happen next. It had a lot of action but there were also funny moments that would make me laugh and smile. Oh and I didn't really mind that it was mecha because the giant robots were kinda awesome! \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10:\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed watching Code Geass and I would definitely see it again! It's one of the best anime I've seen in a long time!",

            "content": "I watched this because of all the rave reviews.  My expectations were high, and I was unfortunately disappointed.  I stopped after 20 episodes, because I just couldn't get myself to waste any more time on something I didn't love, not even to see the epic cliff hanger ending that had been enough to keep me going this far.\r\nMy favorite animes include Gintama and the Full Metal Panic series (all 3 seasons), so you have an idea of the type of things I like-- action, comedy, etc.  In fact, because I loved the FMPs so much, I thought for sure I'd like CodeGeass since they both are a mix of big genres like mecha, school, drama, war, etc.  Due to their similarity, I'm going to do my review on CG in comparison to FMP.\\n\\n\r\nStory-- I do like that CG involved strategery and mind games, but the whole Britannia world domination thing seemed quite propaganda-ish.  Also, while there were good plot twists here and there, the over arching conflict seemed really lame and mostly just a manifestation of teenage angst.  I also felt like it took itself too seriously at times and was overly dramatic... and did not do a good job of comic relief.  FMP also dealt with war and was dark at points, but the comic relief was executed perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nArt-- The mecha designs were pretty flashy and the animation quality was great.  I'm not a fan of the anorexic CLAMP character design, but that's a personal preference rather than a flaw of production.\\n\\n\r\nSound-- The theme songs were average anime music. The sound effects were pretty good.  Even though the tone and attitude of his voice was appropriate, I didn't think the maturity of the (Japanese) voice actor matched Lelouch's young 17 year old character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-- This was my biggest problem with this show... the characters whom I could care less about. FMP drastically outshined CG in character quality and development.  Lelouch just needs to take some anger management classes; I have to say, though, that his egotism is so extreme that it is almost funny.  Suzaku just needs to see a shrink about his father issues.  Angst, angst, angst.  No real depth, no real relationships.  None of the romantic connections are believable nor do I sense any ounce of true chemistry. Most of the girls just seem to be there for fan service or to fill a token plot role.  While characters like Chidori and Sousuke from FMP feel so alive, three dimensional and multi-faceted, all of the characters in CG feel flat and dull like props.  It's hard to like a show when I don't feel moved by the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-- Obviously I didn't enjoy Code Geass from the characters, relationships or story point-of-view, but I did enjoy the flashy mecha fights and strategery.  \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:  Given that so many people love this show, I would still recommend that you watch it and try it out for yourself.  But know that you aren't alone if you don't think this is as much of a masterpiece as everyone declares ;).",

'Twist-happy' is a phrase that springs to mind, unfortunately almost every single one of those twists fails at what they're meant to do. They don't excite, intrigue or surprise the watcher, they don't often add new and interesting elements to the story and they are completely predictable.\r\nYet Lelouch's adventure is still an enjoyable ride, the art is fantastic and the use of action and mind games is spot on.\r\nThough none of the characters really hit home on the emotional front, theycombine to make a strong, though once again stereotypical, cast. The most interesting part of Code Geass for me is the very personal chess game going on between Lelouch and his enemies. Unfortunately, this element is lost amidst the large scale of the conflicts, instead of being a personal battle of wills it descends into a much more diluted affair.\\n\r\nThis 'intellectual' character has certainly become popular since Death Note, yet many creators are forgetting what made the battle between Light and L so brilliant.\\n\r\nGood but not great, take it as its own entity and that is exactly what you will get.",

            "content": "I don't really understand why this anime seems to be so popular. It recieves so much praise, even unofficial 11/10 ratings. I see it on so many people's favourite lists, that you'd think it really was a masterpiece. Seriously, what the hell? How can opinions be so radically different? I'd give it at best 6/10 and that's generous. Granted I'm probably in the minority saying this, but it's just not that special. Don't get me wrong - it's still a perfectly watchable anime, however I just don't see why it draws such a disproportionate level of appeal and support.\r\nI guess my main issue is thatit's supposed to have a so-called 'amazing storyline' with unexpected plot twists and surprises that just blow your mind. I found it to be anything but - to me the direction of the story and characters was leading and easily predictable, and to be honest downright boring at times. I was frequently disinterested, to the point of barely being able to resist watching something else.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really struck me was how 'western' this show felt compared to any other anime I have watched, possibly why i found the story and outcomes so predictable and mind-numbing. It was somewhat reminiscent of watching Dexter (HBO), but full of seemingly pointless mecha battles, and severely lacking in hot female characters and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nI was really irritated by it towards the last few episodes *SPOILER ALERT* where Lelouch's crew, who had trusted him and were willing to die for an unknown masked man for basically the entire series, were swayed into betraying him, by the enemy who boarded their ship, within a single episode - and at a time when the rebellion clearly had the upper hand. Even the few crew that were aware of his true identity and had been keeping quiet the whole time also suddenly decided to become turncoats and side with their enemies whom they were bitterly fighting to the death up until a few minutes prior. What the hell is that? To me, that's another hint at western influence behind this anime, since Japanese tend to be honorable to a fault, rather than treacherous at the drop of a hat. \\n\\n\r\nI consider Code Geass highly overrated, and unjustly sensationalized into popularity for reasons I still cannot explain. Perhaps the blatant Pizza Hut advertising throughout the two series had something to do with it, which further bolsters my feeling this show was meant for a foreign audience that is easily pleased.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019ve seen some beautiful art, some breathtaking innovation and some brilliant narratives in anime, but I can\u2019t lie: this is the most profoundly interesting series I\u2019ve seen to date. The best cut of this rare beast? It does it with grace and aplomb.\r\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion tells the story of a disaffected Prince and Princess to the Holy Brittanian Empire, which by way of its Knightmare Frame robots has conquered some third of the modern world. When the young Lelouch voices his anger over the apparent murder of his mother, he and his sister are discarded and their deaths imagined in soon-invaded Japan.A teenage Prince  under pseudonym is left brooding  and without purpose\u2026until he stumbles upon a power at once revolutionary and ruinous.\\n\\n\r\nDecent setting: check. Interesting story: check. But there\u2019s no great lack of any of this in modern anime; we\u2019re talking about the Japanese here. Crazy shit to anime is as windows are to houses. Now the fancy stuff, a bit of air conditioning\u2026that\u2019s pace. With budget limits and gargantuan manga to adapt, it\u2019s only too common that the anime should deviate or have to be scaled back, cut off, edited. This too often ruins what would otherwise have been a great series, often in the form of filler, and most usually in the form of the trademarked terrible ending. This is by no means clear cut, but I think Sunrise nailed both here. There are a couple of episodes in the middle of each series where the story ambles along with character development, but it soon picks up, and I never felt like they were buying time \u2013 however slow the progression of the plot was, everything seemed relevant and contributory. There are quite a lot of detail to pick up, and I found myself skipping back to a fair few subs, but it\u2019s no onslaught.  Much of the brilliance of the story is in the casual details; it\u2019s no murder mystery, but it is very well written, and everything comes together in a really good way.\\n\\n\r\nIn trying to be innovative beyond simple creativity, a lot of studios have also taken extreme drama and shock tactics into habit, with deaths not exactly fatuous, but secondary to the progression of the story, a steam-rolling catalyst for the anger of the protagonist. Code Geass is better than that. There\u2019s plenty of tragedy and there are plenty of shocks, but they really are integral to the story, and their effects are eroded and balanced in the character psyches as other events and revelations take hold. This is a great thing about the story: the attitude and aims of the main character never really change, but just about everyone else\u2019s do, and the development of contact and contrasts between the two \u2018groups\u2019 are wonderful to behold. If I had a problem with the story, it would be that the world affairs, Empire aspect is largely sidelined in the second series, and in the bouts of action and plot twists descends largely into farce behind the hero\u2019s apparent ego\u2026but it is a minor quibble. The change of focus to the character ultimately gives the ending the clout it needs; I\u2019d just have liked, for the sake of a rounded drama, more of the worldly perspectives of the first season in \u2018R2\u2032.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Code Geass are arguably its pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. \u2018Deep and complex\u2019 is a horrible, throwaway phrase which this series doesn\u2019t deserve, and which doesn\u2019t adequately describe any one person. Sure, there are clich\u00e9d archetypes in the school President, the goofy friend, even the unnaturally clever and forward-thinking Lelouch. Sure, there are a lot of series\u2019 with slightly broken, conflicted protagonists whose aims and intentions are ultimately good, and sure, it\u2019s nothing new to throw some dramatic irony in there for drama. But it\u2019s just done so well. Loyalties change constantly, people and feelings are sacrificed, and perhaps most importantly, I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019s really cemented as a douche-bag. The story and character relationships develop in such a way that you can see everyone\u2019s reasons for the way that they think, and the things that they do (sometimes catastrophically), even if you and our hero disagree with or rue them. Like I say, there is very little in this series that seems fatuous, or meaningless. It isn\u2019t super detailed and true-to-life, capturing personalities and moments in film the way that Miyazaki does, for instance. What it is is brilliantly structured, good looking, action-packed and emotional, like a good TV drama should be. And they are rare enough gems in the big-money world of TV, even in the bigger-money (if more compressed) world of cinema. Code Geass is a feast for brain and eyes \u2013 odd at times, fast at times, slow at times, clich\u00e9d at times\u2026but entirely enthralling.\\n\\n\r\nI wrote a while back about Elfen Lied, and how I thought \u2013 minus the \u2018Japanese-ness\u2019 \u2013 it could (and deserved to) garner some proper, cult appeal. This runs through much the same vein, with a mainstream edge; Code Geass is proper telly in every sense bar the most important one: it\u2019s Japanese. For the unenlightened masses, an opportunity lost. For you, wholesome and brilliantly executed entertainment. Revel in it.",

            "content": "[ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]\r\nCode Geass is one of those rare adrenaline pumping anime that you just can\u2019t get enough of. It is by no means overrated or overhyped. It has an excellent plot that has shocking twists, great mecha battles and intricately designed main and side characters. The story is the high point of the series and the brilliant protagonist really gets you fired up with his devastating ruthlessness and strategic abilities. Watching him mastermind seemingly impossible operations is a real blast. This series is just so enjoyable, that it leaves you begging for more. And thankfully, there is an equally stellar season two.The animation is fantastic and the dramatic soundtrack fits the bill. Tight screenplay ensures that the show drifts effortlessly from Shonen to Mystery to Drama effortlessly. Extremely fast pacing and over the top battles make for a fun 25 episodes. Code Geass : Watch it.\\n\\n\r\n[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first heard about Code Geass\u2019s storyline, I was not very impressed. I mean come on, a guy can tell anyone what to do and they\u2019ll just do it without any hesitation? Sounded like an overpowered protagonist to me at first. And his aim? To defeat an empire which covers 1/3rd of the world. Right about now, I lost interest. But then one day I was really, REALLY bored and picked this series up. I expected a typical shonen with a guy who doesn\u2019t talk much, a girl with a crush on him for no reason, extraordinary hidden talents, blah blah blah\u2026 And that\u2019s basically what I got for the first few episodes. But after around the 6th episode, my oh my\u2026 the series just kick starts its engine and goes into high gear. The story from then on has a breakneck pace which will keep you at the edge of your seat for the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Code Geass is that the protagonist (I didn\u2019t use the word hero for the same reason that Yagami Light of Death Note isn\u2019t considered a hero.) Lelouch Lamperouge, is a former prince of Britannia, the empire that controls a third of the world, renounces his title after the Britannian army massacred his family and disabled his sister. Lelouch lives on, praying each day to get revenge on the Emperor of the Britannian Empire. And one fine day, he runs into an alien girl called CC by \u201ccoincidence\u201d. And she can grant him the power that could help overthrow the Empire \u2013 She will give him the power of Geass as long as he fulfils her one and only wish. Lelouch, of course, agrees and obtains the power of Geass. With a Geass, you can turn one of your eyes into a Geass eye and use the Geass power on any human being. And what is the Geass power? Well, if you use Geass on a person, they simply do whatever you ask them to. Yes, he can ask them to die, rollover, do pushups, make pancakes or whatever the hell he wants. And Lelouch is a master strategist, who has exceptional chess skills which builds his battle tactics. Now that he has a Geass, the power to grant ultimate obedience, taking over an empire should be simple\u2026Right? Well, not exactly. The story is set in 2017 a.t.b where soldiers use battle bots/mechas (like the ones in Mobile Suit Gundam) called Knightmare Frames to fight. And all Knightmare Frames are insanely powerful. Thus begins the story of how Lelouch, a high school student, tries to take down the world\u2019s largest empire using his brilliant mind and the power of Geass. To keep his identity a secret he becomes Zero, the oddly dressed savior of Japan and begins his double life.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is produced by SUNRISE, the same guys who made Gundam, so you can expect the bots, the Knightmare Frames, to look good. Transition is smooth and there is almost no recycling of frames. Almost all the bots, especially the ones that come in the later episodes, look slick. However, the character design did not appeal all that much to me. Almost every character in the anime had the same build- lanky. They look like white matchsticks. But still, all the characters look different and you rarely ever get confused. I really thought that Zero, a character you see nearly episode, could\u2019ve had a better attire- the mask looked like an egg on a stick and his grand suit is just ridiculous and at first glance, he looks like an overdressed bartender. As far as the animation department, I am impressed and don\u2019t have too many complaints. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, as for content warning, there are a few tit flashes, a lot of scenes where the female characters are shown being in tantalizing poses and viewed from hentai-like angles and it has tons of open gory violence so it\u2019s definitely not recommended for kids below 14. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Code Geass, is overall, good. The first season opening and ending theme were pretty good. Although the OP was praised by critics and fans alike, I really didn\u2019t think it was as good they claimed it to be. As far as the background score goes, it is done well, but there is nothing standout. There were some really dramatic tracks that got your blood pumping. Not much to criticize, but not much to appreciate either.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually much deeper than it appears at first glance. The story also plays the Best Friend vs. Best Friend card. And I just love anime which play that card. While Lelouch tries to take down the Britannian empire, his best friend from childhood, Suzaku, tries to stop Zero. And the best part? They don\u2019t know each other\u2019s secret identity. In the initial episodes, Lelouch simply does not care how many people he kills and abuses his Geass to the core. Just as it is about to get stale, the story switches paths, minimizing the role of the Geass and giving greater importance to his tactical and strategic abilities. Elements of Drama and Slice of Life come into play very soon. There are constant twists in the plot, which ensures that the viewer never gets bored. Whether it may be a new Knightmare or a new character, the tight script keeps you going. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough you may initially think Code Geass is just a Death Note + Mobile Suit Gundam, you soon change your mind. Agreed, they have a lot of similarities, but it is handled and presented in a different manner. For those who are familiar with Death Note, Lelouch might seem similar to Yagami at first, but around mid-way in the series, you stop comparing the two and realize both of them are completely different characters. Code Geass is far more dramatic and emotional than Death Note. It answers several critical questions Death Note did not. And for one thing, Lelouch actually has emotions and feels the pain of having so much blood on his hands. It\u2019s not as intelligent, sophisticated or subtle, but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad thing. Geass has grandeur, which surprisingly appealed to me. The balance of Code Geass continuously shifts between the power of the Geass and the power of the Knightmare Frames. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are really good, each of them showing great depth in their personalities. The initially shallow and shonen characters soon grow and mature into subtly interesting characters. The notable side characters are Shirley, Kallen, Cornelia, Nunally, Ougi and Euphemia. The main characters ( Lelouch, CC, Suzaku ) are all excellently made and make this show a cut above the rest. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending, is well, hardly an ending. It\u2019s like the prequel of season 2, Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion R2. Yet, you will savor every moment of it. You shouldn\u2019t have much problem choosing between the sub and the dub as both are, surprisingly, done extremely well. You should be comfortable with either.\\n\\n\r\nSo, just to answer the question in the intro, this show is not overrated, overvalued or overhyped by any means. It did not gain popularity through huge promotions or a few fanboys running forums down with their rave reviews (*winks at Naruto*). Code Geass has earned every accolade it has received. Filled with exciting, thrilling, powerful, dramatic, heartbreaking, raunchy, gripping and awe-inspiring moments, Code Geass R1 is something you don\u2019t wanna miss.",

The story starts out as an almost day-to-day life of a school student until he gets caught up in a rebellion against Britannia. I loved the story line, and how there were plenty of twists in it to make the series more addicting. The way that everything was played out was outstanding. The story was just amazing. As was the art. Everything looked so realistic. The robots were amazing. To me, it seems like the art was perfected to every last bolt. The sound was good, but there were re-occurring sounds insome of the episodes that got a little annoying. Besides that, I loved all the background music, all the opening themes, and all the ending themes. The characters all had very different personalities. Most of the characters also seemed to have the thing with 'acting like someone else' when they're around their friends. I enjoyed this show so much. I wish that the ending wasn't so.. Sudden. Everything has it's own way of doing things, and personally, I liked this anime a lot. Overall, it deserves 10/10.",

            "content": "~~~~ENGLISH & ESPA\u00d1OL REVIEW~~~~ [5,5/10]\r\nCode Geass is a curious, controversial and interesting anime, it is not difficult to understand why, since the series has charismatic characters and an attractive premise, the problem of Code Geass is not the premise, but the development, but I will go for part to the subject.\r\nIn short, Code Geass tells the story of Lelouch Lamperouge a young man who for reasons that are told in the series has a disproportionate hatred of Britannia, a superpower that controls 1/3 and takes possession of Japan. Starting with the good, Code Geass, in addition to having a good premise, has many interesting things,such as the good use of strategy and prioritizing it before things like power over power and falling for convenience, the military aspect is very good. But the science fiction is not well worked since they do not show us the origin, development or an elaborated introduction to the fuses and in relation to this, the construction of the world is superficially good but in depth it is mediocre, in spite of being an alternate reality to which we live never show us well how the entire world organization that composes Code Geass was formed, nor do they clarify us so much the motives of those who move the strings of Britannia, nor do they clarify the functioning of the world that composes it outside from Japan.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the holes in the plot, there are radical changes from one fight site to another that sometimes seem convenient and are never explained in depth, being a problem when tying threads.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was on a good rythm until close to the final moments, where with a plot-twist in relation to Euphemia all they do is force to lengthen everything instead of being faithful to the established and have induced a debate among the nobles that they were for or against the emperor.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, Lelouch is a very good protagonist, is consistent with their actions, their actions have reasons to spare, is three-dimensional and fully human constantly debating their mistakes and regretting them, but even so it is prevented from reaching the end that He tries, although, Lelouch makes mistakes, he knows how to correct them and to give in the best possible solution to everything. As a co-star, Suzaku starts his pacifist role well, but at the passing of the plot even before the Euphemia event in final moments, Suzaku becomes a hypocrite who constantly lectures the same, to make me understand, I will relate him to Yang Wenli, Yang is an excellent pacifist co-protagonist, and precisely because he is consistent with each of his acts and leaves the mold of the sermon in which he is able to convince most of his actions, but Suzaku totally changes his actions and it makes you think in a superficial way that it follows its ideals when it is not so, having evidence in view of the fact that its pacifism is a sham in the end. The rest of the characters are not flat but do not end up convincing, with the exception of Lelouch and C.C. if they cause a contribution to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation or art, is quite good according to the time, is not amazing or outstanding but meets the minimum for what you want to teach, the same with the sound, is a decent section.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary Code Geass is an interesting series but it is only there, it has a good protagonist and a good premise, but the development is not the best and tends to be unfortunately anticlimactic and to take bad decisions forced when the problems (Like the plot-twist of Euphemia) could have been easily solved and create a story arc against the emperor before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5,5/10 = 5/10\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass es un anim\u00e9 curioso, controversial e interesante, no es dif\u00edcil entender el porqu\u00e9, ya que la serie tiene personajes carism\u00e1ticos y una premisa atractiva, el problema de Code Geass no es la premisa, si no el desarrollo, pero ir\u00e9 por parte respecto al tema.\\n\\n\r\nEn resumen, Code Geass narra la historia de Lelouch Lamperouge un joven que por motivos que se cuentan en la serie le posee un odio desmesurado a Britannia, una superpotencia que controla 1/3 y toma posesi\u00f3n de Jap\u00f3n. Empezando por lo bueno, Code Geass adem\u00e1s de tener una buena premisa, posee muchas cosas interesantes, como el buen uso de la estrategia y priorizarla antes que cosas como poder sobre poder y caer en conveniencias, el aspecto militar est\u00e1 muy bien. Pero la ciencia ficci\u00f3n no est\u00e1 bien trabajada ya que no nos muestran el origen, desarrollo o una introducci\u00f3n elaborada a los mechas y en relaci\u00f3n con esto, la construcci\u00f3n de mundo es superficialmente buena pero en profunidad es mediocre, a pesar de ser una realidad alterna a la que vivimos nunca nos muestran bien como se form\u00f3 toda la organizaci\u00f3n mundial que compone a Code Geass, ni nos aclaran tanto los motivos de los que mueven los hilos de Britannia ni tampoco, ni nos aclaran el funcionamiento del mundo de que lo compone fuera de Jap\u00f3n. \\n\\n\r\nOtro problema son los agujeros de la trama, hay cambios radicales de sitio de una pelea por ejemplo a otro que a veces parecen conveniencias y nunca se explican a profundidad, siendo un problema al atar hilos.\\n\\n\r\nLa trama iba en buen camino hasta cerca de los momentos finales, donde con un giro de tuercas en relaci\u00f3n a Euphemia lo \u00fanico que hacen es forzar a alargar todo en vez de ser fiel a lo establecido y haber inducido en un debate entre los nobles que estaban a favor o en contra al emperador. \\n\\n\r\nEn cuanto a los personajes, Lelouch es un muy buen protagonista, es consecuente a sus acciones, sus acciones tienen motivos de sobras, es tridimensional y totalmente humano debati\u00e9ndose constantmente sus errores y arrepinti\u00e9ndose de ellos, pero ni as\u00ed se impide a llegar al fin que pretende, si bien, Lelouch comete errores, sabe corregirlos y dar en la mejor soluci\u00f3n posible a todo. Como co-protagonista, Suzaku empieza bien su papel de pacifista, pero al paso de la trama incluso antes del suceso de Euphemia en momentos finales, Suzaku se convierte en un hip\u00f3crita el cual sermonea constantemente lo mismo, para hacerme entender, lo relacionar\u00e9 con Yang Wenli, Yang es un co-protagonista pacifista excelente, y precisamente porque es consecuente con cada uno de sus actos y se sale del molde del serm\u00f3n en el cual es capaz de convencer a la mayor\u00eda de sus actos, pero Suzaku cambia totalmente su actuar y te hace pensar de forma superficial que sigue sus ideales cuando no es as\u00ed teniendo evidencia a la vista de que su pacifismo es una farsa a final de cuentas. El resto de los personajes no son planos pero no terminan de convencer, a excepci\u00f3n de Lelouch y C.C. que si causan un aporte a la serie.\\n\\n\r\nLa animaci\u00f3n o bien arte, est\u00e1 bastante bien de acuerdo a la \u00e9poca, no es incre\u00edble ni sobresaliente pero cumple con lo m\u00ednimo para lo que quiere ense\u00f1ar, lo mismo con el sonido, es un apartado decente. \\n\\n\r\nEn resumen Code Geass es una serie interesante pero se queda solamente ah\u00ed, posee un buen protagonista y buena premisa, pero el desarrollo no es el mejor y tiende a ser lamentablemente anticlim\u00e1tica y a tomar malas decisiones forzadas cuando los problemas (Como el plot-twist de Euphemia) podr\u00edan haberse solucionado f\u00e1cilmente y crear un arco contra el emperador antes.\\n\\n\r\nGracias por leer / Thanks for read\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 5,5/10 = 5/10",

            "content": "As someone who tends to be shallow when it comes to impressions, my first glance at Code Geass so many years ago, was, as I'm ashamed to admit, unfounded. An artstyle that didn't attract me, Mechas heavily being involved and an incredibly large cast of characters all led me to postpone watching this masterpiece. The magnum opus of studio Sunrise, and in my humble opinion one of the defining anime that revolves around a story that is so well-paced, intertwined with the character cast and captivating, that it deserves to be praised as much as it is.\r\nThe first season of this incredible story starts outfairly fast, and action and the core concepts of this show are introduced to us viewers within the first episode. Once the stakes are set and the driving force behind the MC is discovered, the plot slowly starts to take form. Careful not to introduce us viewers to too many concepts and characters at once, the pacing picks up ever so slowly, but once you're in the thick of things, there is almost no putting down the experience. There are very few shows that manage to lay out such a grand stage of events, and still never feeling rushed or inadequate, as it never lacks the bravado to back up the events that get more intense as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nCraving for more, the viewer is instigated to start thinking about the events of the show, about morality and how much sacrifice is compared to the greater good. Is evil necessary to defeat evil, and how much of a right is necessary for a wrong to be perceived as the correct path? \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the show in general almost involves us viewers personally, considering the 'power' that is wielded by our MC is more than imaginable within our own lives. It's use, and the consequences thereof all seem possible, and the show is not afraid to pull punches when it needs to. It knows when to move from heartfelt and gut-wrenching plotlines to a more light-hearted relaxed scene without any of them feeling forced or unnecessary. Even episodes that are commonly reduced to simple filler for most shows have care and attention intertwined within them. Character progression and the careful cat-and-mouse games that revolve around our MC are apparent, and are especially noticeable in the less intense scenes.\\n\\n\r\nBacked up by those final few episodes, where the story reaches a point of such tension, such emotion, all to end the season in such a crescendo, a point of no return, shows how all of the events can come together and deliver, truly deliver. A moment of perfect tension, with only one way forward, the next season. To this day, I have not experienced a stronger cliffhanger that urges the viewer to watch the next installment of a show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all backed up by such an excellent soundtrack that is both captivating and emotional when it needs to be. It all comes together in a way that's indescribable without spoiling the plotline that must be experienced firsthand.\\n\\n\r\nAre there problems with the show? Sure, the artstyle might seem dated, the story suffers from a very apparent power-loop and sometimes you wonder why character X did not simply do Y instead of Z, but does that detract in any way from the excellence that this show portrays? In my opinion, the flaws are barely worth mentioning compared to the enjoyment one can derive from watching this show. It might put you off, as it did me, at first glance. But it's but a shadow, an illusion. If you cared enough to read about the show in the first place, you are most likely going to enjoy it once you do decide to give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nA tale worth watching, worth experiencing, and definitely worth your time. I bid you all farewell, and I hope you consider my words carefully. Chances are, if you came this far into the review, you have already decided, and I hope your decision is well-founded.\\n\\n\r\nStay tuned for my next review, I'll be sure to cover the second season as well, as it's no less deserving of my thoughts, and I can't wait to put them into words.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time, dear valued reader, and hopefully you enjoyed my written experiences concerning \"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch\".",

            "content": "Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch is possibly the most fascinating anime of the mecha genre and the best aspect is not the mechas themselves but the majestic characters and intellectual plot that combines all the aspects together. It usually refreshes the characters with a calmer setting before proceeding to the escelated mysteries that are occuring throughout the events and it is so impressive how all these different varieties of beautiful characters and mechas come into action in the story, everything about Code Geass is very immersive and interesting. Lelouch is the ideal main character and really lives up to his concept, everything about him isso brilliant from his outfits to his personality and intelligence. He always handles situations in a very effective and cunning method and tends to be perfect in everything which justifies being the number #1 rated character on MyAnimeList which is the biggest manga & anime network and database on the internet. His academy and zero outfit is majestic, it maintains a simplistic yet elegant style, it can be used without the helm and cloak as well and it fits Lelouch along with any slim silhouette in general in a perfect way, I personally like the academy outfits more but that is a preference for many series. C.C. and Suzaku are also from the best secondary protagonists and a really great addition in combination with their mechas and along with the other delightful characters and mechs it makes Code Geass one of the best franchises of all time. Code Geass is just brilliant in all aspects, the characters, the mechs and the story are so wonderful and well established and with Lelouch as the main character it makes it one of the best anime in all of dimensions.\\n\\n",

I'm completely stunned at the moment, It's incredible how powerful the series and the ending came about. \r\nI was skeptical at first. Being a mecha anime, I thought it would be bland and sugarcoated with lot of special effects to replace its lack of depth and plot, how wrong was I. \r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story is VERY well executed, and the twists are completely stunning. You will be at the edge of your seat every second, It was like a roller coaster ride watching Code Geass. As every episode rolled, you saw the picture form slowly and vividly.\r\nArt 10/10\r\nJust flawlessin the art department. The animation and character design was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound track was very fitting, and the director knew when to use certain themes to get the most out of a scene. Things like is CRUCIAL. Imagine watching an anime without sound or with the wrong sound, would it be the same?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nI feel like I've known most of the characters for years, that's how incredible the character development is. Lot of series emphasize too much on the main character and only those who are important to him, but in Code Geass, I feel like I know every supporting character as well. The author gives us insight on how each character thinks and moves throughout. I feel like I know those people as my friends even though this is just a fictional piece, it's amazing to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyed it to the utmost.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nThis was a masterpiece, there is no other way of putting it. EVERYTHING came together perfectly. The elements that make a piece of writing shine was flawlessly seen in code geass. From the plot, to the art, to the sound and character developtment combined with nerve wracking suspense, drama and action made this series beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nDefinitely give it a try. Don't be discouraged if it contains elements you are not in favor of, mechas being in my case. This series contains far more depth than you could imagine, don't judge it by the outside. However, I will say that it might not be suitable for young kids as it contains much graphic violence and blood.",

I was neutral about mecha anime and decided to take a shot at it. I was surprised and absolutely LOVED it.\r\nStory: *put synopsis here*\r\nToo many loose and cliffhanging ends. That makes it up by plot, character developments, and drama. It's leaving you eager to watch some more episodes. For some, the fast pace of the story might drive you away.\r\nSeems like Code Geass focuses on drama, heart-breaking moments, and emotion, VERY unlike Death Note. Code Geass has many,many memorable scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Very colorful. Great and well-drawn. The fights aren't really smooth or fluid, but the animation is perfect for this type of series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The openings and endings aren't really memorable, but rather extremely fitting for this type of anime. The voices are really good and fitting. Great choice for each character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are characters you're going to hate to death and there are characters you're going to love to death, that's for sure. Some of the characters are a little cliched, but some others are just amazing. Something unexpected might happen to all of them, though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've chuckled at times, my heart was touched at times. I was amazed. One moment, crying, another moment, smiling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: An awesome anime with tons of drama, emotion, and interesting characters, you wondering what will happen to them.",

            "content": "Code Geass is one of the most well-known and loved anime of all time. Why? Because of it's grand, theatrical story that has tons of plot twists and turns. When I had first watched this, I was turned off by the mecha aspect of the anime, but went on to watch it because I was intrigued by it's \"change the world for the better\" psychological aspect (+ obviously it's crazy popularity). I am happy to tell you that Code Geass exceeded my expectations in both aspects, the anime was fantastic and definitely worth the watch, for everybody. \r\n\u201cIf strength is justice, then is powerlessness acrime?\u201d - Lelouch Lamperouge Vi Britannia\\n\r\nThis one quote pretty much sums up the anime. Social hierarchy in society. Equity among the people. Fairness. What the right form of government is, what the right way to rule the people are. Secrets, Deceits, Revenge, Power-Corruption, Friendship/Hatred, Love, Temptation, Evil/Good. This is a story of a classic hero's psychological and political struggle in his reality (similar to our reality)\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass put simply revolves around an abandoned prince of the Holy Brittanian Empire (think of it like a royal country like Great Britain, but has the world power of the US), Lelouch Vi Britannia and his journey into rebelling against his father, King Charles Vi Britannia and creating a new world/society. Of course, the story would have been nice (possibly boring though) if it was more realistic; Code Geass is NOT realistic what-so-ever despite these true disgusting aspects of our reality being portrayed ingeniously. Lelouch obtains the \"Power of the Kings\" (Geass Power) that makes anyone who looks him in the eye directly obey his command. Using this power, the grand tale of Lelouch Lamperouge Vi Britannia unfolds. This is a psychological and political anime. The ideologies in the anime were beautifully portrayed and clashed with one another. Is murder wrong? Even if it means saving more people? What about \"justice\", how do we fairly carry out justice? Evil? Good? How do we distinguish between them? Human Nature, can we ever change it? Fate and Destiny, does it exist? Hope. What is hope? Is there hope for our world? The story has a buttload of questions with twists and turns that'll blow some people's minds and enlighten others. Overall the anime is quite fast-paced and doesn't linger around useless dialogue too often, which makes the anime all the more entertaining and captivating. Though, because of this there are a number of plot-holes here and there, leaving questions unanswered and thus confusing the viewers as to what happened to the ____, or ____. Furthermore a big problem with Code Geass' plot is because it seemed like the writers couldn't decide whether they wanted to add in school-life into the anime, but why add that into an anime that's something like a second coming of Hitler-World Domination story... The school scenes were touching~ly pathetic and a waste of Code Geass' time. But... that's okay, Code Geass' main plot was still superb. Like honestly, on paper, there are so many things about Code Geass that shouldn\u2019t work. It's overall elements don\u2019t really blend together; the mix of high school drama with the liberation of Japan via use of mechas' is quite the strange combination. Things that shouldn't be connected are, and outside the classroom the same characters are fighting each other in a war for freedom, like uh... what the hell. But somehow Code Geass makes it work. No, they make it into one hell of a masterpiece. Plus a side-bonus about the overall plot I really liked was that although there's one obvious \"main\" plot, there are also lots of sub-set plots as well that end up intertwining with the main plot to eventually create a satisfying (*cough* cliff-hanger *cough*) end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters is one of all the points that Code Geass really excelled at, despite having a second main character that absolutely sucks balls: Suzaku Kurushit... But whatever who cares about him when there's the soul and heart of Code Geass, the most popular anime character ever, Emperor Lelouch Lamperpouge Vi Britannia. Lelouch is quite the unrealistic and childish character who somehow makes a great tragic hero that the audience can watch with respect and compassion as he strives to become an evil greater than evil itself in order to overcome evil and change the world for the better, yet maintain his humanity and pure dreams. Lelouch is quite the courageous, manipulative/smart and morally ambiguous (good or evil) character; my favorite type of main character. His character is pretty deep if I do say so myself. Lelouch was betrayed by his family, his loved ones, and eventually his friends. Lelouch was betrayed by the rotten world. With his burning hatred for the rotten world, he becomes a masked legend-knight serving for \"Justice and Truth\"; he's known as Zero. Lelouch never revealing his identity by wearing a mask symbolizes his lack of a true identity. Throughout the anime, Lelouch is struggling to truly find his identity. Lelouch is always at a constant battle with not only the world, but with himself. As Lelouch goes further and further in achieving his dreams, he is forced to make harsher and harsher choices and keep himself from crossing the line into the point of corruption and insanity (Lelouch is literally like a non-psychopathic and \"Good and Genius\" version of Hitler). Lelouch is truly a tragic hero: The wise Aristotle and Shakespeare stated that a Tragic Hero had to be \\n\r\n1. Of Noble Status (Lelouch is the Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and later literally becomes King of the entire world) \\n\r\n2. Hamartia - Have a tragic flaw that eventually leads to his downfall, which you'll see in Lelouch constantly throughout the series.\\n\r\n3. Peripeteia - a reversal of fortune brought about by the hero's tragic flaw. Lelouch's downfall towards the end of the first season (this season)\\n\r\n4. And finally in his downfall, his actions result in an increase of self- awareness and self-knowledge. He reaches a sense of \"Enlightenment\" and sends a message to the viewers. # The audience must feel pity and fear for this character. -- This is Lelouch. His end acceptance of his consequences.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have unique ideals and motives, which causes conflict throughout the entire series. The characters are portrayed in a way that makes it difficult to determine who exactly is in the right. Even if your ideals are just, do the ends justify the means? Can you truly change anything with out taking huge, and sometimes costly, risks? These are some of the questions the characters are constantly struggling with. Code Geass also does a great job showing the humanity of the characters. There is genuine joy, and happiness, and there are moments of intense rage, and bitter sadness. The main characters in this series are well rounded and developed. C.C (whose identity is never revealed but in Greek Mythology C.C = Circe, whom is a sorcerer, a source of temptation for heroes which reflects C.C's role in Code Geass). Even though we don\u2019t get as much information on the supporting characters, they all play their parts well too. They are unique, and they all add something different to the overall story. All characters are 3 dimensional and their own specific personalities shape what they do. Everyone has a fatal flaw take adds a lot towards the story. Characters: 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was stunningly beautiful, it looks as high quality as anime made in 2014, such as the Fate series. The characters were all distinctively different, which is quite tragically not the case for most anime. Lelouch = Royal, C.C = Beautiful~ Suzaku can go die~ The mecha were nicely designed, but I won't say that I enjoyed watching the mecha because I despise mecha. The sound of Code Geass is another aspect where the show really excelled. The openings very nice--they give a great impression of what's to come in the anime. But.. the endings were mehhh... The soundtrack was great, especially \"The Master\", \"Madder Sky\" \"Stories\" and \"Continued Stories\"; beautiful~ The music certainly added to the suspense of the fight/dramatic scenes, and the feels of the sad/touching scenes. The voice cast was great, both sub and dub (yes, even dub, in fact in my opinion Code Geass' dub was even better than the sub). Lelouch's voice was way too deep to fit Lelouch in the sub, but Johnny Yong Bosch fit/executed Lelouch' voice perfectly in the dub. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass was a thrilling ride from beginning to end (Season 2 isn't as good as Season 1 but the ending... The end of the entire show [season 2] is probably the greatest ending I've ever seen to a show). Code Geass is a classic, and it\u2019s one you probably won\u2019t want to miss out on. Overall, I'd go to the point of calling Code Geass an iconic anime; a model for future psychological \"tragic hero\" masterpieces to come. Sure you may not like the anime, but Code Geass is definitely a show you should give a try and decide for yourself whether you like it or not.",

            "content": "*** I tried to be vague, but when talking about characters below I gave a small spoiler from the first couple episodes relating to one of the characters. Skip Suzaku's paragraph if you don't want a slight spoiler ***\r\nThis is an anti-hero tale. It's based in a world where a militaristic society has taken over most of the world, and it oppresses those that it conquers. The emperor has a strong conquers the weak mentality, and his beliefs are pretty extreme. A hidden and disgraced prince is the main character of this story. He starts out as a good guy, and though his ultimate goalis for the greater good (long term) he does a lot of morally questionable things to reach his goals. The power he obtains in the beginning (his geass) is said to isolate him from everyone in the end, and it's easy to see how that will happen as the story unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the two main characters, since they are the key characters in this story. They were friends as children. One is a prince in hiding, and the other is the former leader of Japan's son. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch and Suzaku are supposed to be two sides of the same coin. However, they're not so dissimilar that I agree with that. They both are incredibly selfishly driven, but they simply end up on opposing sides even though their ultimate goal is the same. One is the brains, and the other is the brawn. Truthfully it is silly how Suzaku keeps getting in the way, and it's almost an unbelievable fact but not in a good way since the mech fighting scenes are not practical.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch is very intelligent and the storytelling never contradicts his intellect. He only loses when the completely unexpected happens which is basically when others act completely out of character. The irony is that happens more often than it should. He definitely does some morally questionable things throughout the story, but when you get to see the opposition it becomes difficult to disagree with his ideals. One element never changes, and that is Lelouch has a master plan and a goal that he will do anything to attain. Nobody else even has an idea of what that is, or that they are merely pieces on a chessboard.\\n\\n\r\nSuzaku's ideals are supposed to be for the greater good in that he doesn't want innocent people to be harmed by a rebellion. He thinks that following the rules is the just and righteous path. The sad truth is that he's a soldier for an army that constantly murders innocent civilians and persecutes them. In the very beginning he is almost murdered by a superior and then framed and nearly executed. We're talking first couple episodes folks. Even knowing this he thinks it's wrong to go against the system. His selfish need for atonement drives his ideals, and though he's supposed to be the one attempting to follow a more righteous path, he is on just as destructive a path as Lelouch. The difference between the two is that Lelouch knows his path is one of destruction, and he knows the pains he will have to suffer to accomplish his goals. Suzaku represents hypocrisy at it's finest. I really started to dislike his character as time went on.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the story. If you summarize it, then it sounds like an incredible series. Unfortunately, the delivery is completely flawed in so many ways. There are scenes that are crammed with dialogue and void of all dramatic emotion, and then you have long and uneventful scenes void of all emotion as well. The action scenes that are in the series are mediocre at best, and really not believable in how they transpire. The animation was ok, the supporting characters were just ok, but the overall story was very good. It was fast when it should have been slow and slow when it should have been fast, so the pacing really killed it. Frankly, I was incredibly disappointed. Oh, and if you are wondering about the music, then don't wonder. It's not a big help to the story at all. Thankfully there is a second season to follow, but do not expect a well presented first season, and don't expect to be wowed in any kind of way.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of twists and turns. There are lots of betrayals, but the delivery itself is sort of a betrayal when you look at the potential of this series. I wanted to love it, but I just sort of liked it.",

This anime is truly amazing. It is what every anime should strive to be like. The story was interesting in how a genius teenage boy tries to over throw an entire nation. The art was not amazing due to it's time but it was good none the less. The sound track gets you pumped and suits the scene perfectly. Yuo could just feel a scene due to the sound track.The characters are super enticing making fall in love with them. Except Nina. She is a little poop head and needs to die.  I really enjoyed the anime to times where I felt like crying in sad moments and I got shivers almost throughout my entire body in how amazing some scenes were. In an overall sense this anime is amazing.  It is my favourite anime. It truly is a well thought out and interesting anime.

After watching Death Note I was un-satisfied with the ending ( it is still one of my favorite anime series of all time) but I wanted a show that had a brilliant ending and that's where Code Geass comes in which has what I consider to be one of the greatest anime endings off all time and anime series of all time. There is nothing to fault in this show, its image is squeaky clean. Everything from the characters, story, art, enjoyment and overall experience was perfect. I have just one tiny problemwith it and that is it's fan service, I don't think that was needed in this anime and since I'm a girl that was a bit uncomfortable to watch at times other than that this show is a MASTERPIECE. But nonetheless anyone who has finished an anime that are un-satisfied with the show should defiantly watch Code Geass R1 and R2. The main character LELOUCH VI BRITANNIA (*all hail Lelouch Vi Britannia*) is my second favorite character in all of anime first being L from Death Note  ;) but anyone who hasn't already watched Code Geass well shame on you and you have watching to do.",

            "content": "Code Geass is a bad show, why?. \r\nWell, for start the character they are flags, Its unique attribute is to be \"smart\" and even is. Light, for example, at least knew how to bring a situation or make plans instead Lelouch is disgusting character that manages all by chance and end of the day, does not even have a real evolution.\r\nAnother problem I have with the program is its design. Seriously, it's horrible, you know I hate with all my heart to elderly degenerate CLAMP. But, beyond that is my main problem with the show and its artists that displeases me ... The design isdefinitely bad, the heads are small, the characters are 3 meters, arms and legs are long, and Pokeballs eyes seem, are disproportionate, and at the end of the day, the mechas ... are pretty good, I remember shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion and although I do not like them, admit they are pretty bad ass.\\n\r\nBut after all, my main problem with this show is its script. The strategies are full of deus ex machinas that has not been presented. Without going any further, in the second episode, Lelouch gets a fucking army of robots to their friends when they never said they were there. Also as I said, situations happen because the script requires it, in the second episode seems that Lelouch will die, oh no wait, a lady falls from the sky and will save, in the first look set to kill Lelouch ah not expected. If the girl with no personality magically doing it with his magic .... Are you serious ?. So the situation is not resolved, and if you're going to do, has the power of a bitch girl at least.\\n\r\nHopefully, the technical work and mobility of the characters is very well done and robots unlike humans in the series. They have a very masculine design\\n\\n\r\n4/10 Very Bad\\n\r\nIn conclusion, is it Code Geass recommend? ... There really is very poorly written and does not serve to casualfag material.",

            "content": "no spoilers!\r\nCode Geass starts with off with such a bang and a memorable protagonist right from the beginning.  It&rsquo;s such a shame how close this series was to being great because I really do like it.  It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s not anywhere near to being perfect.  There were so many flaws in its storytelling and characters with the plot driven many times by coincidence, I can&rsquo;t help but think that the story was improvised half way through.\r\nThe anime starts off with revealing the setting in an alternate time course.  The American&rsquo;s lose in the revolution against the British, and now theBritish continues their reign of imperialism.  The empire, Britannia (why the name change? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;), practically takes over the world and renames each country into an area.  It brings up an interesting aspect of this show because of how the Britannian&rsquo;s are portayed; they&rsquo;re so unbelievably evil and proud in displaying their bigotry, I question why the main characters are the only ones in expressing the slightest bit of humanity to the Japanese, now renamed elevens.  Like I hinted in the previous sentence, Code Geass takes place in Japan.  Britannia continues their colonization and has taken over Japan after 200 years after the American&rsquo;s defeat.  Now the Elevens live in the ruins of their country, while the Britannians live wealthy lives in the colony.  I&rsquo;m just surprised on how quick it developed through immigration in just around 10 years.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Lelouch Lamperouge, lives so lazily as if he has no purpose in life.  The world is under so much inequality, Lelouch carelessly accepts it.  We see that he is the typical lazy smart cool good-looking kid at school, all of it being revealed in just one episode: he ditches class to play chess where he easily wins against other renowned players, then leaves with his sidekick on a bike where he lays back reading Hamlet, later to receive a call from Shirley, the cute girl from his school&rsquo;s student body who easily hints her crush on Lelouch (zomg popular guy!!!!).  As he rides with his sidekick on that cool bike of theirs, Lelouch gets caught up in the middle of terrorist activity, meets his closest childhood friend, Suzaku, on the badguy&rsquo;s side-a scene that closely resembles Gundam SEED-, and inherits powers that I will not reveal (though you&rsquo;ll probably hear it from someone else); all of this being the first elaborate coincidence of the anime-we can let that slide.  After Lelouch gets his new powers, the plot quickly shifts to tactical warfare and leads a rebellion against Britannia.  With this promising premise (you have to watch it to overlook its ridiculousness.  That&rsquo;s how it is with animes), Lelouch&rsquo;s rebellion is one hell of a show.  This show features so much intense battles and tactical comebacks that it&rsquo;s such a thrill to watch.  Watching this is easily entertaining with its clean bright animation and likable character designs from CLAMP.  Sunrise never disappoints with their budget in terms of animation and voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot reveals soon that Lelouch was actually a Britannian prince, but denounced his father for ignoring his mother&rsquo;s death and so is thrown away along with his crippled sister, Nunnally.  Under the care of the Prime Minister of Japan, Lelouch and Nunnally befriend the son of the Prime Minister, Suzaku.  Britannia soon colonizes Japan (talk about evil), and war breaks away Lelouch from Suzaku.  I&rsquo;m glad that they don&rsquo;t spend massive amount of episodes in revealing all of this like what many other animes tend to do, because that would definitely slow the pacing of the current plot, which is incredibly entertaining.  Lelouch makes himself a memorable character with his villainous-like qualities and also benefits from his voice actor who gives a great enthusiastic performance.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the story suddenly lags at the half point and relies on coincidences that are no longer elaborate.  I can&rsquo;t reveal the story but I&rsquo;ll give an example: Lelouch and Kallen have no way to escape from the enemy and easily steal a powerful knightmare that benefits them greatly.  There are other moments that are just so stupid that it almost ruins the entire anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also lags from smaller arcs that don&rsquo;t add much to the plot except one small aspect, like the Shirley and Mao portion.  Though mediocre at worst, it&rsquo;s very disappointing because it cannot compare to the pacing from the beginning of the series.  It feels as though this series is stalling a bit before it gets to the main point.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also features a huge cast that the subplots may get in the way.  These subplots don&rsquo;t add much to the main plot and don&rsquo;t fulfill the task of character development.  Because of the weak character development, the minor characters feel more like a cheap plot device rather than an important part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s an overall good series but its negatives bring down the series a lot that I don&rsquo;t rank it up there along with other greats.  Still, I recommend it as this is one of those series that you can&rsquo;t really go against.\\n",

If you watch it expecting for it to be like DN, you may end suffering a lot. \r\nThen why so many people recommend it? Are they all nuts? \r\nWell, it&rsquo;s because the main character looks and acts like kira. \r\nBut believe me , he&rsquo;s no kira. \r\nDon&rsquo;t get me wrong, this show not bad at all, and its has a little voice of his own. But if you keep comparing itto Death note, you will realize some its obvious mistakes, like when a &quot;plan&quot; its half assed, or when it was impossible altogether, or  the constant feeling that you might be smarter than the main character ( something that in DN will be a heresy) because you could had it done better. \\n\r\nWorse of all, DN needed no mechas, no wars, no fan service nor bishoujo characters (well, just one) to be entertaining. It was the pure intellectual combat that made it so thrilling and that kept you asking for more, just that. \\n\\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s nothing of sort here. Lelouch intelligence is constantly unmatched, and only his own screw ups keep the plot flowing. His enemy is not another genius but a guy who could have been the main character in evangelion.  Destiny replaces long term strategies and Mecha fights replace deep thinking. \\n\\n\r\nBasically I am saying that you can put lipstick in to a Gundam, but its still a Gundam. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s this series is , just another Gundam arc( Gundam Geass, if you like)  and the only difference with it predecessors is that a guy like Light is the good guy in stead of the bad one. Thats not change we can believe in.  \\n\\n\r\nYet, even if its not as good as Death note, its still better than most of the things out there. There&rsquo;s a whole in the market for something like DN , and this is as good as its gets right now. And it might be worth giving it a try if only for the fact that everyone else has seen it and you will look like an ignorant if they start making geass jokes or adding Li Brittania to their names and they find you staring blank. \\n\r\nAnd it might mark the beginning of something, an era where intelligence and not emoish behaviour while piloting a giant robot is admired, and where thought replaces sticking fingers into some ass as the weapon of choice. CG isn&rsquo;t there yet, but it might be the first step.\\n",

Though who could blame you?It certainly is delicious after all. Some people compare this show to Death Note, and for good reason, they both have Japanese people in them. The music, is it music? No its not, it is a rampant analogy of the contextual accuracy in foreign cultures. Geass blends elements from all genres perfecting them and enhancing their flavor, you can taste the hard work that was put into this show. Go watch it right now, have a viewing party, serve some sushi and iced tea, maybe some chex mix.",

            "content": "[SPOILER WARNING]\r\nFirst off, this anime ends horribly. People talk about anime suddenly ending with no resolution. Sometimes they overreact \u2013 Deadman Wonderland and Attack on Titan end an arc but keep the big story unfinished. It\u2019s frustrating, since the arcs are integral to a bigger story and don\u2019t stand on their own. Code Geass, however, simply ends. Worse, it ends on a cliffhanger. I know there\u2019s a second season, but you don\u2019t separate seasons (Or episodes, or books) for the sake of it. You separate them because they\u2019re different stories. This one\u2019s unfinished and this is a huge blow.\r\nMore news at 11.\r\nAt first, it\u2019s temptingto view the anime as exploration of Japan under Western influence. World War II wasn\u2019t so long ago, and we all heard about how the Japanese are poor victims. This story is false, and bones have a way of digging themselves out. Japan was an aggressor in WWII and responsible for some true horrors. So seeing a story in which they are oppressed can be bizarre \u2013 you have to wonder whether in the world of Code Geass they found the bones in Shinjiku. The big Western oppressor this time is the UK, whose main contribution to the world after WWII was Big Beat and Dubstep.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not about politics. The Geass is a physical manifestation of power. The creators wisely chose to never talk about how it actually works. There\u2019s no D&D-esque magic system behind it, only a few limits to help us understand power better. A Geass is limited, because power comes in different forms. A Geass can also be used once, but can consume you.\\n\\n\r\nPower doesn\u2019t just come in isolation. Something drives power. The user wants to achieve something with that power. We hear about how some people just want to feel powerful, but why do they want to feel powerful? Powerful is ability and security. Power cannot be an end. If it is an end, it is only because power is the means to get many ends. Power never stands alone.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s your main problem with the anime. Power here stands alone. Excluding Euphie, the story is an ordinary one about oppressed people rising against their overseers, but so what? What does the British empire stand for? What do the Japanese stand for? You cannot just kill the tyrant but have to replace it with something. A person once said that anarchy is a \u2018tyranny of people with guns\u2019. Since humans are pack animals, leaders come by naturally and can be good for us. Leaders work differently, though even when they seem similar. Both the Nazis and the Japanese did unethical human experiments, but for different ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is soaked by the theme of power. The position of every character is established quickly, and is an important part of everyone\u2019s lives. Notice how Rivalz is obviously inferior to Lelouch, how no woman swoon over him and he\u2019s mostly just there. During high school scenes, we follow the most powerful people \u2013 the student council whose head is the daughter of the principle. Lelouch is a person who lost his position of power and that\u2019s the same story for Jeremiah. Cornelia\u2019s and Euphemia\u2019s relationship isn\u2019t just about protecting the little sister \u2013 one is clearly more powerful than the other.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fantastic stage to test what drives power and they squash it. The two sides fighting stand for nothing. Many stories use the typical Hitler-esque tyrant, which is cliched but at least something. Here, the British Empire only protect its own existence without ever answering why it exists in the first place. The Japanese want to free themselves, but they only free themselves into a vague \u2018equality\u2019 thing.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, it\u2019s not a story of simple evil vs. simple good. Many scenes show us the Britinnians, their lives and how they\u2019re actual human beings. The inclusion of school life comedy is brilliant. It shows us there are people behind the oppressors who might be used to their lives of privilege, but they\u2019re still people. When everything falls apart, there\u2019s no sadism but empathy towards the upper class.\\n\\n\r\nIf the creators can write vibrant scenes about everyday life, why can\u2019t they imbue their characters with motives and ideologies? Relationships with the same structure work differently. Both Lelouch and Cornelia protect their little sisters, but Lelouch is the soft warm protector whereas Cornelia is the condescending one. A small character arc involving Jeremiah \u2013 a clear villain and an asshole \u2013 shows us the pain of falling from a position of power. Even while the series sides with Lelouch, it doesn\u2019t shy away from how his power can hurt his enemies.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018Grand Purpose\u2019 is integral to any piece of art. Everything connects to it, and it makes the flaws more understandable. Without the grand purpose, there is nothing to review. Even shows whose only purpose is to show big boobs have this purpose. Often, average shows swing between two such purpose and commit. Code Geass doesn\u2019t even swing between purposes but simply doesn\u2019t have one. It goes through the motions, provides good storytelling that leads nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nCredit must go to the designers. The series sports one of the best character design I\u2019ve seen. As pure beauty few anime match it. In fact, the characters are so beautiful that it feels like a plot point. Everyone radiates sex appeal, but somehow no one has sex with anyone. The overly-slender bodies do contrast with this. They\u2019re not just thin but long, but every face is plastic-surgery perfect. Every stare is full of confidence with sensual lips. Even the voice-actors give a sexual smugness to it all. CC and Milly always sound teasing, like they\u2019re just about to invite you to their rooms. It\u2019s nice, but sometimes bizarre.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also fairly expressive. Notice the contrast in design between Lelouch and Suzaku. Suzaku has a softer, cuter look with the curly hair. Lelouch has sharp eyes, black hair that falls in spikes. These designs amplifies their personalities. Rivalz is being stuck with a goofy blue hairdo. The decision to give characters similar but different hair colors is meaningful. Euphy\u2019s pink is brighter than Cornelia\u2019s purple, just like their personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe gigantic robots don\u2019t fare so well. The action scenes are a constant thorn in the anime. Although there are emotional moments in those scenes, they take the chess game technique to the extreme. They become more about Lelouch\u2019s genius rather than the characters. Imagine JoJo but with giant robots. JoJo was nice, but its storytelling was built for shallow stories driven by excitement. Here, the storytelling always aims for something deeper. If the robots had a cool look to them, then fine. The designers went full lazy and just had gigantic hulks of metal with arms and legs. None of the imagination that fuels the character design (A character who appears for a barely a minute looks better than most anime characters) reaches them.\\n\\n\r\nContrast this anime with Future Diary. It\u2019s another overly ambitious anime with so much going on it couldn\u2019t flesh it all out. When Future Diary tackles an idea, it does so with full conviction. It may need more length, but when it\u2019s about comedy it\u2019s all about comedy. When it\u2019s horror, it\u2019s all horror. More importantly, Future Diary wasn\u2019t about build-up but about arcs. Each arc had its own style. All of the elements in Geass aren\u2019t spread evenly but crammed together into one gigantic arc that builds up to a huge climax. There is very little resolution in this anime. Some may enjoy the cliffhangers, the \u2018what\u2019ll happen next?\u2019 but that\u2019s boring. The most exciting anime are those that are exciting because what\u2019s happening, in the present tense. They\u2019ll keep you coming back.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass fails only because what it set out to do is be the best anime ever. It\u2019s overall a good show with a dynamic story and a wide cast, each with their own point of view. Although it slips often to cheap thriller mode, the characters\u2019 personality dominate it more than conventions. Even if it\u2019s not the best anime ever, most creators can\u2019t even attempt something this ambitious.\\n\\n\r\n3 sexy homosapiens out of 5",

            "content": "I usually break my reviews in points, but I think Code Geass will require something very different.\r\nI wasn't amazed by art or sound. Sound had nothing special IMO, neither opening nor ending marked me, voice acting was good but not stellar and music was generally forgettable. Art looked pretty good but some faults like those really wierd looking triangle eyes really didn't make it all look so good.\r\nNot that it matters much because almost everything about Code Geass is in its story.\r\nAnd it's good. Really good. Really really good. Then it kinda falls. Then it's good again. Then it falls. Then good, then falls. Thengood. Then the end.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I explain my exact issues with Code Geass, I need to say that true masterpieces are always head and shoulders above mediocrity. Always. If you take what I consider to be THE masterpieces of this decade and the last decade, namely the One Punch Man manga(forget the anime) and Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex(both seasons), even at their worst, when GitS goes into filler episodes for its underdevelopped side characters or when OPM delves into a little too much side characters' side stories, they are still very much above mediocrity and never brought boredom or disinterest.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass, by this standard, isn't a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nNow it is still an overall very good anime and it's absolutely worth watching. It goes into agressive politics and war policies very well. It starts off great with two \"opposite twins\" characters, Suzaku and Lelouch, one being the paragon of morality, the other being the paragon of success. And for a long time, you think that Code Geass will be an ideological battle between those two, mixed with intrigue, love and war, mystery, lots of attaching characters, and a ton of evil laughs at all of Lelouch's schemes and surprises.\\n\\n\r\nIt is that for a long time, but then things happen that turn it all in a wholly different direction. It's hard for me to keep this review spoiler-free, so from now on I'll mark at every paragraph if it has spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing is that the opposition between Suzaku and Lelouch eventually fades. Suzaku stops being a moral paragon over time and becomes a hateful killer by the end of the series, thus renouncing his archetype. It's a good thing for his character, it makes him grow from a naive boy into a violent boy, but even then this character isn't so interesting. Suzaku as the naive hero who wants to do good by trying to make peace with the enemy who despises him isn't a lot of fun. I doubt a lot of people like him. And he generally isn't worth writing home about. He's here as an opponent to Lelouch, and without Lelouch, forget him.\\n\\n\r\nBut since he stops being the naive boy, he just stops being all that important. He just becomes a plot tool, a dangerous foe Lelouch has to look out for.\\n\\n\r\n(spoilers)\\n\r\nAs for Lelouch, his growth is far more interesting, and if Suzaku abandons his archetype, Lelouch does so too, but in a very different way. Suzaku goes from naive hero to warring brute. Lelouch however shifts after some events from anti-hero, so a hero with villainous methods, to an outright villain. Now just to be clear, I'm fine with villains. A villain can be tremendously enjoyable to watch and I'm fine with a battle of villains as the main theme. The problem is, it sort of throws away everything we'd been taught with Lelouch. He was half scheming backstabber, half hero, someone hated by all who'd do anything for his goals, but who would also try and reach for something greater and better than his opponents. A conqueror more than a villain. But by the end of the series and the last big twist in season 1, Lelouch is literally nothing more than a villain. Which kind of begs the question, did they really want to build him as an anti-hero? What was the point if he was just going to turn into a villain from actions he isn't responsible for?\\n\\n\r\nWith that, I am compelled to point the biggest problem with Code Geass past its fairly shoddy art and sound: the lack of vision.\\n\r\nCode Geass several times shows that it doesn't have the vision, or more precisely the writing, to go the full length of its ideas. At several times, the story goes into the very tragic, into berserk-tier stuff even. If Berserk did one thing beautifully when it comes to its main villain, it's show his true intent with extreme precision. Griffith in Berserk is kind, gentle, intelligent, selfless, beautiful, daring, exciting, charismatic, a master in all things and in every way a Lord and a Hero. But his goal requires extreme, monstrous sacrifices, and he'll go about giving those sacrifices no matter what. Code Geass goes that route at some point as well, except while Berserk clearly put Griffith in villain's seat and made him an unapologetic, hated monster, Code Geass just doesn't have that vision.\\n\\n\r\n(spoilers)\\n\r\nThe complete spoilers here is the arc of Shirley. When Shirley's father dies at the battle of Narita, Shirley goes under shock and emotional breakdown, goes to Lelouch for emotional comfort, and steals a kiss from him while crying her eyes out. It's a perfect circle: Lelouch as Zero ordered the avalanche on Narita which crushed Shirley's father. The father was also a kind and fair man who always treated his family with love and care and never harmed anyone, he was simply a soldier and was at his post. And Lelouch is the subject of Shirley's affection since a long time and now she needs him. \\n\r\nThis perfect circle brings about a ton of subjects at the same time. It makes Lelouch question his actions and brings him in doubt. It makes him feel extremely guilty twofold because Shirley should hate him and because he has feelings for her too(something which is never properly shown in the anime but that we're told about eventually). Shirley starts looking for Zero's real identity to get her revenge, while he has to keep on pressing with the corpse-piling even harder. If he doesn't succeed in his conquest, all the dead will have been for nothing.\\n\r\nAnd how does that perfect circle end? In the course of only 3 episodes, Shirley finds out who he is, tries to kill him but fails, and he uses the Geass to make her forget everything about him, Zero and her father. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I had expected to be a long-running set of intrigue is solved in only 3 episodes with Lelouch essentially using a Deus Ex Machina to solve the emotional conundrum. He's literally throwing the ball out of the field and going \"meh, can't play, it's out\", can't feel guilty or fight Shirley.\\n\r\nThis is what I meant earlier when I talked about masterpieces and lack of vision. Code Geass had a perfect circle, the Gentle Dead, the Tragic Vengeful, and the Evil Hero. Then instead of going all the way to the end and putting Lelouch in front of the terrible choice of killing Shirley, dying, or managing to stay hidden forever, we just Deus Ex Machina out of it and we move on.\\n\\n\r\nIt's disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's even more disappointing for the last arc, too.\\n\r\nThe last arc features something that literally brought this anime from an overall 9 to a 8. Code Geass would've still been great if not for THAT awful part. What happens can only be described as the plot equivalent of someone stumbling into a rock on the mountains SO HARD that the rock starts an avalanche that kills 50000 people. Yes it looks stupid, and yes it took me out of the anime very very badly.\\n\\n\r\n(spoilers)\\n\r\nWhat really happens is that Zero/Lelouch is essentially beaten by Princess Euphemia. He admits defeat and accepts her conditions. Then SUDDENLY the Geass starts going haywire, EXACTLY when they're alone with no witnesses, EXACTLY when they're about to make a semblance of peace and give some independence to the Japanese, EXACTLY when Lelouch says \"I could have you kill all Japanese if I wanted to\".\\n\\n\r\nI liked Code Geass a lot despite its weaknesses up to now. Several times I felt like it wasn't making that much sense or wasn't that fun, but it always managed to eventually give me a satisfying enough explanation later on, and it always made me want to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nBut that part? That really hurt. It felt like shit scenario if I've ever seen one. I think Code Geass, being an anime-only product, with no manga, or novel of any kind behind it, may have lacked the important point of view of a writer who's only in it for the story and dialogue. That kind of focus often helps to build much more sensible and deep stories, and I'm not saying that Code Geass isn't deep, but it sometimes lacks sense or believability, and that part around the end really got to me in the worst way. I was disappointed, annoyed almost, and felt like it came out of nowhere. Never before was the Geass mentioned as \"faulty\".\\n\\n\r\nIt's also bad for reasons beyond plot: this is the second time where the responsability wasn't on Lelouch. With Shirley's arc they essentially threw the ball out of the park. The question to \"what do you do in that situation\" was never answered. Just Deus Ex'd out. With the ending arc however, the question was never even asked. Lelouch didn't do anything, the Geass did it himself. Where are my deep questions about power, responsability, and the great choices of meagre peace or great war? What of the huge symbolism of killing the people who are essentially the good and gentle ones? What is the meaning of Lelouch's actions when he was essentially put before the fact and didn't really choose anything?\\n\\n\r\nIn ideology-driven stories, the most fascinating is observing the distance between dream and reality, between the promise and the realisation. What Lelouch becomes, how he fails his original idea, is a slow growth for the most part, but the key, defining element that changes him entirely doesn't happen because he chose it, nor because of his ideology. It just happens because the scenario demanded it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that was a huge letdown.\\n\\n\r\nIt's still a very good anime, with deep intrigue and lots of flaws that are brushed over by the main themes and ideas thrown in there. It's enjoyable both at the beginning by appreciating the two main guys' points of view and thinking them over, and by the end for all the fighting between very opposite friends. It has a surprising, enjoyable and well-thought twist at almost every episode. Its characters are relatable and admirable in lots of ways, and almost everyone including the side folk pitch in with their own flavor of relatable, admirable or hateable personalities.\\n\r\nBut it's not great. It Deus Ex Machinas out of bad situations, it disappoints, it sometimes just isn't that interesting with all the unwarranted school stuff and teenager crap inbetween a generally very serious and thought-out political intrigue story.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely worth watching. Definitely not worth worshipping.",

            "content": "When I first watched this season of Code Geass, I said, \"There is no way that season 2 could be better.\" I was wrong, and that is the main reason that this anime did not get higher than a 9. I initially thought that this anime was flawless, but then I heard the second opening and watched the second season. The character development and cast is fantastic. Lelouch, the main character, is enjoyable and his friends and partners, The Black Knights, are memorable as well. The story is compelling and nerve wracking. While watching this anime, you will feel several emotions: joy, sadness, anger, andeven fear at times, all up until the major cliffhanger at the end that will have you begging for the next season (which I watched immediately after). However, all of these things are overshadowed by the second season. The near perfect story is actually perfected for R2 and new, even more memorable characters are introduced. It was just impossible for me to give them both the same rating. However this does not draw away from the enjoyment factor, as it is equally as gripping, and after all it is necessary if season 2 were to make any sense. To me, those are the most important details, but Code Geass has some missteps in art and sound. The character models took me a while to get used to, and the Knightmares looked like they came straight from Cowboy Bebop which came out in the 90s. However, the hadron cannon and the Geass power both looked good and I became accustomed to the weird character models after a while. The sound was great in the show, and the first opening is one of my favorites, but the second opening and the repetitive sounds really bothered me. The second opening is terrible and I found myself skipping it and then listening to the first one just to make up for how hurt my head was from the annoying voice. As for the repetitive sounds, every time Lelouch would use his Geass, the same track would play. EVERY time, and he uses it a lot. A similar thing happens when C.C is on the screen. Overall, this anime is very good and should definitely be watched. I would call this a must watch even for the sole purpose of watching season 2, but aside from that, it is still a great anime.",

            "content": "You know that meme \"Lie down, Try not to cry, Cry a lot\"? Ah, that's how I felt in the end of the second season of this anime. I mean while watching, I cried. I watched it tomorrow again and I cried again. I even watched it in German dub and cried. German dub, you know how ridiculous that sounds. I waited a long time for a \"Masterpiece \" anime like this, and finally I was able to rate a show as a 10/10 on MAL. May I present you the best anime I've seen so far. CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion.\r\n Plot andStory Line\\n\r\nGuys, I guarantee you this will be the best anime story you'll ever watch. It doesn't lack in any aspect of a good anime. The story is intriguing, the plot is smooth and the main story line is just perfect. Also it didn't lack in good background stories at all. Goro Taniguchi, the Original Creator of Code Geass, has an ingenuity I've never seen in my life before. And I wanna say thanks for giving us this anime. I have to admit that I was rather sceptical whether I'd like it or not, but thank God I did. Now let's see what the story actually looks like.\\n\r\nWell, in 2010 the Holy Empire of Britannia began a campaign of conquest, with Japan as its target. Because of the advanced armour technology of Britannia, Japan was soon taken over and its pride, rights and identity were gone. Now its called Area 11 and its citizens, the Elevens, are forced on a harsh life while the Britannian aristocracy lives and opulent and luxuriant life. One of the aristocrats is Lelouch Lamperouge that lives together with his little sister Nunnally. What nobody knows about them, they both are an exiled Prince and Princess of Britannia. His life as a normal High School student ends after he meets C.C. by accident. A rather strange girl that gives him the Power of the King. The Geass. With the power of dominance over any person Lelouch starts his fight against Britannia with the wish to bring down Britannia from the inside. I won't tell you the reason he did that, I want you to find it out on your own while watching. \\n\r\nThere are a few acpects of the show regarding the story that have to be mentioned.\\n\r\nFirst of all, THE ACTION. The whole Code Geass story is basicly a revolution so of curse there will be a lot of action. I was sceptical in the beginning whether I will like those robot like human-armor but after watching I few episodes I fell in love. True I saw those in Guilty Crown too but I didn't pay that much atention on them. The battles are epic, interesting and although Lelouch is such a master-mind he wasn't winning all the time. \\n\r\nSecond thing, THE PLOT TWISTS. This made me crazy. I mean, so many things happened in this anime that I thought were impossibe to happen. Aaaagh! One plot twist happened in the end, and that's the thing that made me cry. Me, cry. I've never cried before. Not even in Angle Beats. But I did cry here. Hat down for that.\\n\r\nThirdly, THE EMOTIONALITY. Whether it is a romance, or sibling/friend love, hatred, excitement, sadness, obedience, patriotism...Everything is there and it's manifested to the very maximum. You should see that emotion breakouts, it really gives you goose bumps. I am not kidding.\\n\r\nForth, and last thing. Tell me one thing that anime makers usually get wrong. Well, mostly it is theSECOND HALF, or even the whole SECOND SEASON. I was so scared that this would happen to Code Geass, but...It did not. The second season was even better than the first one and episode for episode the story got more and more interesting. \\n\r\nCode Geass is an example of how an anime should be. Interesting, catchy, with a smooth story yet having some surprises prepared. But please anime makers, don't do the Guilty Crown thing. Just don't. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThis anime's characters are maybe one of the best I have seen. They are so unique and there are not a lot cliche personalities that you see in other anime. What I mostly liked about the main characters are their flaws. The imperfection of their personality. It gave the show a little extra and a fresh scent. Here are the four of the main characters for you:\\n\r\nLELOUCH: His main problem was that he wanted to acheive his goal trough the goal of others. A mastermind I've never seen before. I envied him on his care for Nunnally and cleverness of curse. A very rational character with clear goals not affraid of taking risks. The only thing I don't get is how I can hate and love Lelouch at the same time. I really cant say. That's why, as a character, brilliant.\\n\r\nKALLEN kinda reminds me of Touka from Tokyo Ghoul. A strong, independent, badass woman that knows what she is fighting for. I, my self, am a great patriot, and that's the common characteristic we share. She became one of my \"idol-characters\" after watching this anime. And with great extent, one of my favorite characters ever.\\n\r\nSUZAKU: Although he looks like the cutest character of all, I hated him. How could you fight your own people? I don't get it. He was not scared of Britannia, he was just too naive. I know I can't blame you for that. But I certanly can for betraying your best friend. Not cool at all.\\n\r\nAnd in the end...I am sorry for saying this, but this woman is a bit*h. C.C. is so self-centerd and evil, I mean making a contract with someone without telling him the outcome. Come on! Too bad she fell in love and regretted what she has done. It's a bit too late in the end, but she managed it somehow with Lelouch's help. Still, I have to admit, I loved her. Her personality fitted just right in all those happenings.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nAaaam...again, there is not much to talk about animation. It is very good, no flaws. When it comes to the animation style I must say that it is a bit different. I mean you can see it on the character looks. Still it is not bad at all, and why not be a bit unique. One more thing I need to mention here are the sound and music. Both opening and ending songs are great an the music inside the anime is brilliant. I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nI can't believe this review beacame so long, but an anime like Code Geass maybe deserves even a longer one. The thing is that this show is perfect in every aspect possible. Story, plot, characters, emotions, action, animation, style, music...Every Single Thing is perfect! If you haven't watched Code Geass, go! Right Now! It's an order! I loved Code Geass, and I haven't met a single person yet that doesn't. I'd really like to know if there is a single person that doesn't like this anime. Let me know if you know someone. \\n\r\nIn short, Code Geass is truly a MASTERPIECE!\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log \u2013 August 10, 2015. Review #96: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion.\r\n7 years have passed since I first watched this particular anime, this was a fond memory of my high school days. Well, it is time that I review this series at last. This is CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion!\r\nThe Empire of Britannia has invaded Japan using giant robot weapons known as the Knightmare Frames. Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people are called \u201cElevens\u201d. A Britannian , Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he would one day destroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in highschool, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he gets himself caught in the mix with terrorists who've stolen a military secret who happens to be a young girl, and she gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass ran from October of 2006 until July of 2007 and this is a Sunrise production and the animation is not half bad in this anime. There are some little flubs such as miniscule use of recycled animation, some odd effects, but the animation still holds up. It may not be on par with the animation quality of Death Note, but the animation quality in Code Geass still holds up today. The openings look fine, the closings are nice to look at, and the Knightmares\u2019 design are unique. Speaking of unique, the character design is done by a well-known Manga group known as CLAMP (known for titles such as Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, xxxHolic, X, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Cardcaptor Sakura). Some may not like the character designs because the characters in Code Geass look like anorexic figures. I actually never had a problem since the character design was unique in the series. By the way, Code Geass is not the only series with this distinct style. Some of CLAMP\u2019s other works have that so-called \u201cAnorexic\u201d design. I should point out that CLAMP had no involvement in writing the plot, all they did was the character designs. Now if there is one issue with the animation, it would be the product placement of Pizza Hut. I am aware that Pizza Hut sponsored the show but it is a little distracting when product placement is used in the way Code Geass shows it. Now if you reside in America and have watched it on DVD or something, you might not get what I mean. For those that are not aware. The American release took out the Pizza Hut sign whenever it was shown in the series to likely prevent legal issues. Look on the bright side, at least Coca-Cola didn\u2019t add to this\u2026 You know\u2026 Coca-Cola Zero. Anyway, The animation\u2019s excellent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Hitomi Kuroishi and Kotaro Nakagawa is worth noting, No matter what they did before and since. Code Geass will be their high note. They may have been involved in titles like Gun x Sword and Planetes, but Code Geass\u2019 soundtrack is often energetic, light, and epic. The soundtrack is used well but it does have some moments where it is used on bad timing. What I mean is that there are some scenes that the viewer can tell that something is going to go down and a scene that sounds calm and carefree is not really the best time to use in a scene that is building up to a big sequence. The soundtrack is well-done, but it has some odd placements at times. As for openings, the first one which is \u201cCOLORS\u201d by FLOW is probably the most memorable in the series because of its catchy tune. \u201cKaidoku Funo\u201d by Jinn took me a while to adjust but it is also catchy but I liked the first opening more. Now this anime had a third opening but it was only used in the last two episodes. \u201cHitomi no Tsubasa\u201d by Access sounds cool but vocal-wise\u2026 it\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t have much to say on this opening. As for closings. \u201cYukyo Seishunwa\u201d by Ali Project is catchy, but I actually like the second closing \u201cMosaic Kakera\u201d by SunSet Swish. I should note that the last episode of this season originally had the first opening theme \u201cColors\u201d as its ending theme but if you reside in America, The closing theme in the last episode would be Mosaic Kakera. I don\u2019t know why this is the case but I would assume because the epilogue doesn\u2019t really add much. The epilogue was contained in the DVD release but as an extra and it was never dubbed. Oh well.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to voice acting. Starting with the original Japanese cast. Jun Fukuyama got a lot of praise for this role and I cannot deny that this was a big role for him. He did win best Male lead in the first Seiyu Awards in 2007. Even though his performance was award-winning, I still remember Jun Fukuyama best as Lelouch. Takahiro Sakurai may have hundreds of roles and I never found him to be a bad seiyu but I found his performance overacted at times. Yukana is great as C.C. (pronounced C2). Ami Koshimizu is fine as Kallen. As for the English Dub. Johnny Yong Bosch took me a while to get used to. This is due to how much I did enjoy Jun Fukuyama\u2019s performance but Johnny Yong Bosch might not sit well with everybody at first. He is a good voice actor, don\u2019t get me wrong. Johnny Yong Bosch sounded like he took a couple episodes to really get into the role, he does improve much greatly as the series progresses. As for Suzaku Kururugi, he is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal in the dub and he is terrific here. I enjoyed his part in the show. Karen Strassman does fine with Kallen, as for C.C., Kate Higgins may not be as pitch-perfect as Yukana but for the Dub alone, Kate Higgins is great. Amy Kincaid doesn\u2019t do much voice acting but she captured Shirley\u2019s character well, just as well as Fumiko Orikasa. Now the Dub of Code Geass has a lot of big names in Dubbed Anime. Code Geass\u2019 dub included names like Kirk Thornton, Laura Bailey, Liam O\u2019Brien, Michael Lindsay, Stephanie Sheh, Michelle Ruff, Peter Spellos, Sam Regal, Steve Staley, Travis Willingham, Troy Baker, Crispin Freeman, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. They even got Steve Blum in the dub. Truly, this cast did make it an awesome dub\u2026 However there are a few exceptions. Michael McConnohie is a good voice actor and his performance is good but it was not as epic as Norio Wakamoto. I got to be honest. I enjoyed Charles zi Britannia\u2019s Japanese Voice more than his English voice. There is one performance that I did not fully enjoy, and it was Rebecca Forstadt as Nunnally. Kaori Nazuka was great but Rebecca Forstadt sounded like she had a mocking-like tone of voice and I know that was not the intention but the voice never did sit well with me. The person responsible for Code Geass\u2019 dub was the late Kevin Seymour, the man responsible for dubs such as the Ghost in the Shell film, The Pioneer Dub of AKIRA, and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, which are terrific dubs in their own right. Both versions are good, but they both have 1 role I didn\u2019t like. The English voice of Nunnally and the Japanese voice of Jeremiah Gottwald, let\u2019s face it. Crispin Freeman fits the role much more than Ken Narita. That being said, both versions are watchable.\\n\\n\r\nWhen characters are concerned, it is interesting to see how Lelouch and Suzaku were playing out and they are fine here, Kallen is okay, C.C. is a good for the show\u2019s mystery. For the Japanese side, they are given a more sympathetic side because of the anime\u2019s premise. That is fine and all, as for the Britannian side, some are rewarding to watch, some are not. Shirley is fine, so is Euphy, Lloyd is silly, Cornelia is fascinating, Jeremiah Gottwald is cool, and I am about to flip the tables for some of you because I actually don\u2019t hate Nina\u2026 Well, during this season that is. If there is some characters I don\u2019t like. Viletta and Diethard are the two I did not like. Why Viletta? I can\u2019t say but I did not like how she played out in the midway point. As for Diethard, he was a stereotypical Media man. The characters are mostly played out fine, some nitpicking here and there but I didn\u2019t have much to complain about the cast of characters here.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, I would like to say that I enjoyed 85% of the plot, there are some areas I absolutely hated in this anime but first, I need to address Goro Taniguchi\u2019s directing. There is some flash-forwarding used in this anime and they are sometimes used after an episode cliffhanger. I really did not like it after the second time, it really cheapens the cliffhangers. The humor was fine, except for Stage 6. There is one character I did not mention that I did not like, but let\u2019s just say Stage 16 was unnecessary. Another unnecessary episode was Stage 21 because it focused on Students making a giant pizza. Now I don\u2019t want to ruin a big plot point but I would like to at least mention Stage 22. There is one thing that got overlooked considering how it was caused. I will leave it at that. I did enjoy most of the plot but there are some questionable directing moments. For example, How the hell did Kallen and Suzaku not recognize Lelouch\u2019s voice when Lelouch assumes his secret identity? What I enjoyed greatly was the tactics that were shown in this series. I don\u2019t want to give away much but I will say Code Geass was an engaging series, it was worth my time, and I do recommend checking this out if you have been living under a rock because this is one of the animes that still gets talked about today. However, I got more Code Geass to talk about but it will have to be said in my review of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass was available by Bandai Entertainment, it went out of print till it got rescued by Funimation. They have not re-released Code Geass at this time but I am hopeful for not only a re-release, but a Blu-ray release would be nice too. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 is also available in the same situation that the first season is under. The two OVA \u201cSpecial Editions\u201d were never licensed and trust me, they are condensed versions of the two seasons. The Code Geass light novels were available by Bandai Visual and my guess is that they are out of print. The Code Geass video game \u201cLost Colors\u201d for the PS2 and PSP never made it out of Japan. The light novel \u201cRed Tracks\u201d was never released outside Japan as well. The Code Geass R2 light novels never gotten an English release, The Code Geass Manga as well as other mangas called \u201cSuzaku of the Counterattack\u201d and \u201cNightmare of Nunnally\u201d were available by Bandai Entertainment but are now out of print. Two mangas called \u201cTales of an Alternate Shogunate\u201d, \u201cRenya of Darkness\u201d and \u201cOz The Reflection\u201d were never released outside Japan. An OVA called \u201cNunnally in Wonderland\u201d was also never licensed. The OVA series \u201cCode Geass: Akito the Exiled\u201d has been picked up by Funimation, and the manga \u201cOz the Reflection O2\u201d has not been licensed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is an anime with good animation, unique character designs, a nice soundtrack, some standout characters, and a plot that could have had some points directed better. In the long run, I really enjoyed this series (flaws and all) and I did view it as an excellent series and the end of this season did make me want to watch its second season immediately. It also has a good cast on both the Japanese version and the English Dub. You can\u2019t go wrong with either version. Give this series a try if you haven\u2019t seen it after all these years.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nI hereby command you\u2026to leave a comment if you wish.",

            "content": "I would actually go as far as to say that there is more depth and mind behind Code Geass than the grand Death Note. There's much more going on, lots of loose ends and many ideals and opinions displayed. There are a bunch of different messages for the viewer to comprehend, and the more I think about it the more complex it gets. Plus, there are some excellent twists and turns throughout the story and many of them lead somewhere, although at first the seemed like a bad idea. \r\nAnd for once in an anime, the female characters are more than (although still a bit)eye-candy with over dimensioned body parts. C.C's personality is more cynical and introvert than any other I've seen in animes. She's so far from the standard cuddly, high pitched and gullible girls we are used to. \\n\r\nShirley, which at first seems like your standard dumb schoolgirl evolves and shows more character than I could have ever hoped for. \\n\r\nMilly Ashford have such a warm and friendly attitude but with a certain amount of seriousness and thoughtfulness. I could go on about all of them, but I'll just wrap up the ladies by stating that Cornelia is one of the most bad-ass women you'll ever see in any series. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the men, well, where to begin? Without mentioning any names or such, the story of the main characters manages to portray a very moving journey, which begins reasonable and down to earth but eventually fades away into damnation and madness.\\n\r\nAt the end of the series I found myself in favour of no one, just baffled over the splendid story about power, corruption and love. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on forever about certain events or characters but the fact is that I would just be scratching the surface of what Code Geass has to offer.

            "content": "Code Geass is an anime I've come to like a lot, while before watching it (and even while watching it at times) I was skeptical of it. The majority of the anime is certainly a good show, with some great episodes/moments, but not really more than a good show. However, for the last ten or so episodes, the show really shines, moving at a breakneck pace with many plot twists (some aren't all that great, but just the scale of them makes them at least a little interesting), and an increase in action.\r\nThe story is pretty interesting, outcast prince turned genius high school student acquiresa supernatural power, completing the set of tools he needs to put his plan to take down the Britannian empire and allow his little sister to live a happier life, is opposed by childhood friend: a member of the Britannian military.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some less interesting parts, mostly towards the beginning of the show, focusing more on Lelouche's high school life and that of the school's student council, often dealing with romance and other more petty matters, although the main storyline usually either interrupts these scenes or has a small part in them. These scenes are pretty much required for Code Geass to progress, but that doesn't make them more appealing. It is interesting, however, to see Lelouche in this environment, where he is generally kindhearted, as opposed to his sometimes-evil, vengeful personality that he takes on as Zero.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nicely detailed and colorful, the backgrounds are great, as are the Nightmares and their accompanying action scenes. However, the character design just doesn't fly with me. Even after watching 25 episodes, I still cringe on the inside whenever a character is shown from a side view. Nearly everyone is very thin, many have ridiculous hairstyles and the eyes are huge with too much detail on the iris (which is the case with most anime, but that doesn't make it any better here. Especially with the hair, some of it is plain stupid).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the weaker points, but still well done. The first opening theme is very catchy, however the other two are decent at best. I hardly remember anything about the music in the show, other than those high-pitched cooings over orchestral pieces, usually a mellow one at the beginning of the show or a slow but fitting one for some of the dramatic ending scenes. \"High pitched cooing over orchestral pieces\" may be an entirely inaccurate description, I really don't remember much about this show's music. Which I have to take as a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...Well, there's a lot of them. You have the royal family, the high school students, the Britannian military force, the Black Knights, and a few more. The story is actually a little hard to follow at times due to all these characters. I'm sure there's been times where I didn't grasp the importance of a certain scene because I forgot about what was going on with a certain character, or set of characters. I also forget many of the characters' names, and a lot of the time I'm not sure who someone's talking about when they mention a name.\\n\\n\r\nBut focusing on quality opposed to quantity, the characters have a nice variety, and a few are especially well done. Lelouche in particular is a great character. He is well developed throughout the show, questioning his actions at times (since everyone loves to compare this to Death Note, I'll point out a difference here - I'm glad the show did this, in Death Note Light questioned his plans exactly once: when he first got them, while Code Geass puts a focus on Lelouche's morals regarding him murdering in a few episodes). Suzaku, while a good character, is not one I find especially interesting, he's rather straightforward. Oh, and I know he's in the military and all...But some of his little physical stunts are completely unbelievable. Among the others, we have some annoying ones (Nina [Oh God, Nina in particular], Mao, Lloyd [Use a different tone every once in awhile buddy], and a couple others). C.C is a very interesting character, obviously helped by our lack of knowledge about her past and her mysterious powers and such, but aside from all that she has an enjoyable personality and is fun to watch. Kallen is also a highlight, her inner strength and loyalty is always entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and on a less important note, I want to mention Diethard. He's not a bad character...But on the surface there's just tons of little bad choices made with this character. First of all, if you don't think of the word \"retard\" every time his name is said, I applaud you for being more mature than me. His hair wins the most ridiculous award for the show, and his very deep yet perfectly clear voice doesn't fit at all to me. Anyway...\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very enjoyable show, it's very action packed and filled with dramatic (sometimes overly so) moments. There are a lot of things about this show that mildly annoy me, however they are things that for the most part apply to anime in general, and since this is an anime site I doubt my sentiments are ones that many will have. Anyway, the sub-plots can be entertaining at times but don't take a backseat to the main story as much as I'd like. Overall though, it can be a little confusing at times but Code Geass is a show that's pretty much all about the enjoyment factor, and it succeeds for the most part, however it does a much better job on the last ten or so episodes than the first 15.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Code Geass is an all-around good show that doesn't really have any major flaws. Your interest in it may fluctuate a little, you'll be much more eager to watch the next episode after a Nightmare battle and a plot twist than seeing a little high school drama, but even in the less captivating episodes the show never dips below decent.",

            "content": "Put quite simply, this is the best anime I've ever watched to date. This is one of only two anime I've given a perfect 10/10 score, and there are multiple well-grounded reasons for that.\r\nThis anime revolves around a very intelligent 17 year old student named Lelouch who decides to rebel against the tyrannical empire of Britannia that is hell-bent on world domination and the subjugation of the people within its boundaries. From episode one you are deposited in a world full of political chaos and intriguing mysteries. This anime is very easy for most people to get into because it is so different from manyanime that exist. In Code Geass, we are presented with a protagonist that primarily uses his intelligence to outwit and win battles against his enemies, while in most anime people have grown used to dim-witted protagonists that win through sheer muscle and strength. Although Lelouch does gain a somewhat overpowered advantage over his opponents, it only works because he is able to use it so creatively and masterfully. Also, the sheer SCOPE of this anime glues the watcher to his/her seat, as this anime involves a GLOBAL struggle. This anime is a very nice mix of a drama, political thriller, school-life, mecha-action, with some romance, philosophy, and psychological elements here and there as well. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is so good  because it has strengths in a variety of different areas. Often times I will find myself enjoying an anime to a certain degree because I like one or two aspects of it while not enjoying other parts of the series as much. Code Geass is one of the exceptions in the anime I have watched in terms of it excelling in many different categories, thus leading to my enjoyment of the series. \\n\\n\r\nA huge reason why the series blew me away was the characters.  As mentioned before, Lelouch is a ridiculously smart young man who pulls crazy stunts off to obtain victory. Lelouch, as well as most of the other characters in the series, is a dynamic character that changes over the series according to the fluctuating circumstances caused by his rebellion. We as watchers get to experience the elation, the sadness, the hatred, and many other emotions that Lelouch experiences on his wild journey in the anime. As the series progresses and we find out more about Lelouch's connections with Britannia and about his connections to other characters, we find that Lelouch is an amazing anime character. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also provided a master stroke in terms of creating a perfect foil character for Lelouch in Suzaku Kururugi.  Lelouch can be characterized as the master manipulator who prefers to let his careful plans lead him to victory, and has a very flexible/intellectual view on morality while  Suzaku has a much more confrontational personality and has more of a black and white view on morality.  The relationship of these two characters is very complicated and changes constantly as the series goes on, and its very fun to watch these dynamic fluctuations. In a sense, their relationship with each-other serves as a microcosm of the entire series in the sense that they represent the two main opposing sides of the series, although their motivations and allegiances change as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\n  As for the other characters, many of them have widely varying personalities along with having believable reasons and back stories that contribute to their actions during the anime. It's very fun to see how Lelouch interacts with  various characters in different ways.  The depth of many of these characters is absolutely amazing. Allegiances change, friendships are broken, formed, broken again, a good friend can become the most vicious of enemies, your lover can turn his/her back on  you at any moment! The anime also does a very good job in showing how these characters react emotionally to traumatic or life-changing events, it makes it very easy for the watcher to care for the characters. The personalities of many of the characters in Code Geass are eventually so fleshed out that you are absolutely devastated if something happens to a character you loved, or you are absolutely elated when some scumbag actually gets what he/she deserves.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does have supernatural and science-fiction oriented elements, but these do not detract from the enjoyment of the story. The most notable element, besides the \"advantage\" I will not spoil in this review, would be the gigantic mechs called \"knightmare frames\" that are used in the anime by many characters. Honestly, I just viewed them as what they truly are in the series: tools that are used by groups of people to achieve their goals. In a general sense, you could look at it as people using the currently available technology of their times to achieve their means to an end.. I personally enjoyed the variety in different mechs with their different abilities/functions. If you don't like mecha-focused series like many Gundam  series, that's fine, but it shouldn't be a reason for skipping this series. As for the \"advantage\" that Lelouch has over his opponents, this by no means provides Lelouch an easy and quick path to victory. Lelouch encounters many other characters who's intellects, technology, and powers/abilities rival that of his own, and Lelouch is often times reduced to simply having to think his way out of situations in order to survive them.  Despite the elements mentioned above, this series is very realistic in terms of the consequences of Lelouch's and other people's actions. This is not your typical shonen anime where everyone survives in the end except the bad guys: People from various sides and perspectives die in this anime. People are psychologically traumatized in this anime. People's lives are dramatically changed in this anime. No one is invulnerable, no one is safe! Once you learn this early on in the series, you are always on edge when something big happens because you know the consequences could be extraordinarily dire.  \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the element of the series that kept my attention the most was the absolute unpredictability of how events would unfold in the anime, as Code Geass has many twists and turns that always keep you guessing.  Lelouch gets put into so many crazy situations, and many of the outcomes may not even be what you expect from an anime these days. Even when I re-watched the show two years later  I was STILL surprised at some of the things that happened, that's how crazy some of the turns of events are! And these events will be so significant that you will almost certainly have a strong reaction to them because they are done so well. I usually don't react very much while watching anime besides maybe laughing sometimes, but with Code Geass I clapped and yelled my approval at some events, loudly cursed and denounced other events, and actually cried (not kidding) in two very sad moments in the anime because I had become so attached to the characters that died.\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is also a great anime because it includes much questioning of philosophy and morality embedded into its story and characters. The actions of the characters make you really question what truly is right and wrong, what is good and evil, where the dividing lines between these categories should actually fall, and makes you question just how much bad should be done to achieve an ultimately good end. The series makes the watcher approach uncomfortable topics like racism and segregation , and forces you to reconcile with the issues as you watch people struggle as a result of these issues.  People that have finished the series constantly debate whether or not this or that should have been done, what was so in so's true motivation, were they right? etc.. etc.. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, animation and visuals. The animation as absolutely gorgeous if you watch this show in 720 or 1080p (recommended in 1080 with a good LED screen to get full enjoyment of the series's visuals). The art style is colorful but tastefully so and not \"cartoon-ish.\" The character designs are from the renown CLAMP studio, so they are absolutely top notch. The only qualm I really had with them is that the body proportions could seem a bit weird at times (some characters seem to have strangely long limbs, but this is not terribly noticeable). Everything from the environments, the mechs, the people, and the action scenes are animated superbly and with a painstaking attention to detail throughout most of the animation. The opening and ending songs are beautiful visually. The CLAMP studio even incorporates original colored drawings of Code Geass characters in the ending songs, which is nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio of this anime is probably the absolute best I've ever approached in any anime I've watched, no contest. There are so many different songs and themes to go with various scenes/circumstances, and they all fit very well. There is such a wide variety of songs that I never felt like any one got overused or got old. The opening and ending songs are amazing, and they sort of reflect the dynamics of the series  itself. Some openings and endings songs are very lighthearted and cheerful, while others are energetic and dramatic, while still others are dark and mysterious sounding. The first opening and ending really capture your attention, among others. I loved the fact that the first ending was dark and mysterious, and the second ending was so lighthearted and fun! I watched the series twice, the first time in the English Dub and the second time in the original Japanese. In my opinion, the English voices are good, especially with  the renown and experienced Johnny Young Bosch voicing Lelouch very well. HOWEVER, the Japanese original is better in my opinion. In particular the character of Zero and the Charles Zi Britannia are absolutely phenomenal in Japanese as they have very unique voices, but much of their auditory impact is lost upon the English version. \\n\\n\r\nI could keep ranting about how good Code Geass is, but I will end my review here. Ultimately, this show is an absolute must watch for any anime fan. You should watch it just for the crazy unpredictable ride that you will go on as you progress through the series and for the amazingly awesome story, if for thing else! \\n\\n\r\n*Note: If you watch the series, I'd advise you to not watch it on youtube, as that website is a breeding ground for spoilers!  \\n\\n",

Yes all anime rip off each other,  specially mecha/space operas,  but this was a little much.\r\nAlso the mech types are a hybrid of classic 80's mechas and Capped mechas with spears like from Escaflowne (also recomended over this), with a couple special units looking like Evangelion with swords.\r\nThe anime ends up being half decent, like a show to watch if you really cant find anything else.  But you prolly need to expand yourhorizons a little bit if you find this to be one of your favorite anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, nothing special here.",

Zero and quite consistently watching some military anime. But Code Geass was REALLY BAD. \r\nI peronally finished this series because some ppl insisted me on watching this series. I thought the story was going to get better at some point... but it never did.\r\nStory (1/10):\r\nCode Geass is setup in the universe where Japan is a colony and the ruling country is ... Britannia? Is this coincidence or possible hatred against western countries... that aside let's go to the next one.\r\nCountlessPizza Hut Ads. Is this anime about Pizza?\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are never injured and side characters always die. EVEN WHEN THEY ARE OUTNUMBERED 100 to 1. It's like saying couple of local men from the middle east defeated the entire US forces there.\\n\r\nLET'S GET THE LOGIC OFF THE FLOOR BOOIS!\\n\\n\r\nPrincess Euphemia incident (those who watched know)... JUST OOF\\n\r\nI mean the story-writer just tried to find a way to f*** up the story in such a SMOOTH way haha\\n\\n\r\nSo a couple of hs students can steal military equipment from the best country in the world? JUST WTF\\n\\n\r\nThe story could have ended if LeLouche killed Kururugi, who is obviously a traitor at one point... but heck no. Kururugi LITERALLY TRIED TO KILL YOU multiple times but.. eh if he dies the story ends so...\\n\\n\r\nSo somehow LeLouche and Kururugi are better pilots then experienced military men... ???? wait whaa\\n\\n\r\nBritannian army gets wrecked by Japanese forces!!! Let's tell Japan's dominance!... wait is this a propaganda? I mean... this could have been avoided if the writers decided to come up with a different world map and maybe AN ORIGINAL NAME FOR THE COUNTRIES?\\n\\n\r\nLeLouche always messes up his powers so the story doesn't end. \\n\\n\r\nPretty bad gundam fights. Fights aren't intense at all. \\n\\n\r\nAnd countless more to just get the conflict going in the most boring ways as possible. It's like Mirai Nikki on drugs except it's not interesting.\\n\r\nYes, this STORY IS FULL OF PLOT HOLES\\n\\n\r\nArt: (1/10)\\n\r\nPlease welcome\\n\r\nPeople with body out of proportion!\\n\r\nStick Figures!\\n\r\nReally Thin Arms and Legs!\\n\r\nREALLY BIG EYES!\\n\r\nwait... are these people really human?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\r\nhey, at least they have a catchy opening!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(1/10)\\n\r\nJust... Kururugi and LeLouche are just big d-bags and idiots\\n\\n\r\nOverall (1/10)\\n\r\nCode Geass, this rating is reserved for you.",

            "content": "How do you keep that figure if all you ever eat is pizza? Please enlighten me, Coco Chanel.\r\nStory:\r\nIt\u2019s Death Note with terrorists. Just kidding, it\u2019s nothing like Death Note at all. Former Britannian prince Lelouch tries to get revenge for his mother\u2019s death by destroying the empire with his terrorist organization. Of course it\u2019s not that simple, not at all. Code Geass is a story about idealism, politics, betrayal and mendacity. How far can you go to reach your goals before you sell out your principals? How far WILL you go? Does the end really justify the means? Is your own ideology worth more thanothers? Oops, that\u2019s a lot of questions. But Code Geass is not as heavy as other works (like the recently reviewed Ghost in the Shell) and manages to tell a compelling story that doesn\u2019t need you to think too deeply into it (if you don\u2019t want to). This is one of the few anime that manages to serve both sides. Are you interested in ideological conflicts or do you just want to see some cool mecha fights? Why not both? Buy now and get a pizza for free! But as good as Geass is with these things, it isn\u2019t without flaws. There are some interesting plot twists, but they often happen because of coincidences, that can test your suspension of disbelief. When a gust of wind can lead up to the deaths of hundreds, that\u2019s a lot to swallow. A problem of its initial run, that doesn\u2019t exist anymore, was the fact that the story was divided into two separate seasons, even though it was meant to be an ongoing one. At the end of season one, basically nothing is concluded and it ends on a huge cliffhanger. Today of course, you can just watch both back to back, but when it first aired, that must have driven people nuts.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed was the odd character design. Everybody seems to be incredibly thin, especially the males. Well, it\u2019s a CLAMP anime after all (at least the character design is), so if you\u2019ve seen some of their works before, you will not be too surprised. Besides this, which is more a question of taste than a quality attribute, Geass looks very good. The animation is smooth and the mecha fights are flashy. This show has aged a lot better than many others of its era.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the openings and endings. The first opening is very memorable, though it isn\u2019t my personal favourite. The second is pretty bad, but the third is very good again. It\u2019s the most fitting as well. The first ending is horrible, simply horrible. I didn\u2019t think Ali Project could \u201ctop\u201d their terrible Another opening, but this is even worse. I hate it (yes, I know that Geass is older, but I watched Another first). The second one was much better, though still not my cup of tea. The voice acting was solid, some of them pretty good. Jun Fukuyama does a nice job with Lelouchs maniacal monologues, but the crazy laugh does not really hit. Mamoru Miyano did that better in Death Note. Oops, now I did a comparison after all. My bad.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n Code Geass is full of characters. Okay, that\u2019s a weird sentence, but really, there are tons of em. Our protagonist is Lelouch, an incredibly cocky guy, who acquires a neat supernatural power that lets him command anybody to do whatever he tells them to do. With this he decides to start a revolution (hence the name of the series) to destroy Britannia. His high intelligence gets him far, but he still makes mistakes along the way due to him believing in his own invulnerability. Despite having somewhat good intentions, he clearly loses sight along the way, though it\u2019s up to the viewer to decide when exactly he crosses that line into villainy. Or is he still a hero to you? His counterpart is a a guy called Suzaku, who despite being the subject of racism and oppression fights for the regime that hates him so much. I don\u2019t get him, what exactly does he try to accomplish? He says he wants to change Britannia from within, but how on Earth is that going to play out? He is easily the biggest hypocrite in the entire show. For example, he keeps saying how he doesn\u2019t want to fight or hurt anybody, yet he is an elite soldier, constantly killing rebels. What a joke. He is supposed to be the other side of the coin of Lelouch, but there is nothing likeable or heroic or logical about Suzaku. They wasted a perfect opportunity to present an equally questionable character on the other side of the battlefield and have us choose who is in the right or not. With Suzaku, it\u2019s at least very obvious who\u2019s in the wrong.\\n\r\nThe rebels are divided into different factions, some more traditionalistic, some more terrorists than rebels. The main focus is on Lelouchs group called the Black Knights. These people aren\u2019t very heroic at first, being driven entirely by hatred towards the Britannians, making them no better than their oppressors. Lelouch turns them into a group of \u201cjustice warriors\u201d, which most of them seem to enjoy, either because of the fame or because they really wanted to be like that in the first place and just didn\u2019t know how to do it. Kallen is such a person. A determined and able fighter, who develops a devotion towards her leader like a father figure. She is your typical hot-blooded amazon, but unlike others of her kind, she is able to think before acting. The royal family was raised into power-hungry and narcissistic maniacs, who do anything to keep their power and have no qualms to terrorize civilians. As we get to know through the few scenes with the king, that is exactly how he wants them to be and only few managed to withstand this inhuman upbringing, namely Lelouch, his little sister and Euphemia. Euphy is kind of like a personification of blind idealism. Much like Suzaku, she wants to change the system without resorting to violence, but unlike him, she is in a position where this is at least somewhat possible. She reminds me a lot of Princess Diana and how the world saw her as the down-to-earth, humanitarian member of the snobbish, cold British royal family. While there are multiple characters that are clearly evil, she seems to be the only one who is purely good.\\n\r\nAlmost done. Finally, we have the student council. They are a heavy contrast to the dark and serious theme of Code Geass and could be ripped right out of any random slice of life anime. Despite them being somewhat of forced comic relief, I felt that they add well into the show. After all, Lelouch is trying to live a double life and one of that is that of a normal student. The fact that one of them has an obvious crush on him makes things a lot less easy for our genius, which I thought was a nice idea. Shirley is also one of the few anime girls who doesn\u2019t try to deny her feelings at all costs, which was very refreshing. Now, have I forgotten somebody? Oh, right, that immortal girl who eats pizza all day and doesn\u2019t really help Lelouch despite helping him a lot. CC is a big X factor and her true intentions as well as her background are always left vague. A very interesting character, who will probably become a lot more important in the second half of this anime.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nCode Geass does a very good job at staying away from clich\u00e9s and genre standards that so many other other anime fall victim to. The world building, the story progress and the forming of conflicts between multiple factions, characters and ideologies were done incredibly well. On top of that, the pacing is wonderful. There is always something going on, but you never feel knocked over by it. Sometimes it feels a little constructed, but if you can look past that, Code Geass is an incredibly entertaining anime that you can easily binge if you want to.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.0/10",

Granted, this was one of my first animes I ever watched so I may be a little biased towards it. I, like many others, have a special place for incredibly OP MCs. Which Lelouch is perfect since he can fight and is one of the smartest protagonists in my opinion. I would recommend anyone to watch this anime. I have re-watched it many times, including the second season as well. Not only that, but I have also watched Akito the Exiled movies and the recap moviesrecently aired. I am excited to see what Lelouch of the Resurrection will bring, but I digress. This anime has an older art style and the sound quality could be improved, but it is from 2007. Even though the style is older, I think it just makes the anime more unique and better over all. I enjoyed every minute of every episode of this show. It also got me thinking about the upcoming episodes and seasons. By the time I finished it all the seasons, it made me want to look up more about it and wish for a third season. I can guarantee most people will enjoy this anime if you haven't already watched it.  It is also a good way to start getting more into anime if you are a new watcher, like I was when I first got into anime.",

            "content": "I've never really pulled out the card to give an anime a 10, but since I completed this a year ago I've rewatched it at least five times, ultimately proving the rewatch value on this anime is immensely high. I've met a few people who will argue Code Geass is just a copy of Death Note, but while I am a fan of both i'd easily say Lelouch is definitely more appealing of a character then Light, because Light was given power, but easily corrupted by it.\r\nI'd also have to say the plot was absolutely amazing. I don't remember a single time in the fiftyepisodes I got bored of it. I'm not even a mecha fan and I actually try to stay away from all mecha series after Gundam, but the mechas in this anime are actually pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was also great. The character design combined with background visuals is  complete sex to the eye, and I remember watching these episodes and admiring the detailed art that was put in. Animation is also great, there is some limited animation when developing the story of the characters, as with all animes, but the mecha fights make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs in this anime were fantastic. I haven't watched Code Geass in two months and I can still remember at least five of the soundtracks played. All the soundtracks are memorable in some way and are played in times most fitting of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the hell out of this anime, it has the elements of slice of life, comedy, adventure, action, and drama, seriously, in this anime there is at least some parts that will appeal to your side of the audience. Personally I enjoy all of those elements which is why my ratings are so high for this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Code geass is an anime you should definitely give a try. The story is interesting, the art value is astronomically high, the soundtracks are memorable, and the characters are by latest anime standards, gods. Treasure the first time you watch this anime, because it is one of the very few gems in a swamp.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

The strength of this anime as I perceive it is related to the fact that it is able to represent a dystopian future with super powers and mechs in such a realistic way. As the story develops you find yourself truly invested both in the individual struggles of the different characters, and the struggle represented by the plot as a whole. The struggle isn't simple and straight forward, but rather complex. This isone of the few anime in which a viewer will truly struggle with the many characters' decisions morally because there is no clear correct decision. Definitely worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, almost flawless in fact...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are developed to extent that one can hardly believe, especially considering how long the series is.\\n\\n\r\nThe mood of the story is a serious and dark one, so prepare for an emotional roller coaster.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime for those looking for something dark and serious with a attention grabbing story and in depth character interaction. Just watch it at some point, you won't regret it!\\n",

            "content": "Length: 25 episodes (27 including recap specials)\r\nAirdate: 2006-2007\r\nDemographic: Shounen (should be Seinen)\r\nGenre: Mecha, Military, Sci-fi, Fantasy\r\nPlot Synopsis\r\nThe Empire of Britannia has invaded Japan using giant robot weapons called Knightmare Frames. Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people the 11's. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd destroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11's who've stolen a military secret and is caught by a member of theBritannian task force sent after them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for disobeying orders, while the military secret, a young girl, gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is secretly made the pilot of Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare, Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion to destroy Britannia once and for all.\\n\r\n(From Anime News Network)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nWhen watching this series I immediately noticed similarities to 3 other animes i've watched. However, Code Geass surpasses two of them and matches the third in quality. So here is the list of the three similar animes and my comparisons\\n\\n\r\n- Death Note\\n\r\nThis was the most apparent one early on. In Death Note, Light gains the power to kill anyone w/ no trace left behind... he uses this ability to make a utopia which he can be a god over. In Code Geass, Lelouch gains the ability of persuasion and uses this ability to attempt to overthrow the Brittanian government. Both Light and Lelouch are manipulative and show no remorse by the end of the series.\\n\r\nAs for differences. Almost nothing could surprise Light in Death Note... Lelouch was suprised frequently throughout Code Geass. Death Note dealt with 1 or 2 key character interactions... Code Geass deals w/ many more. Light appeared almost inhuman in Death Note at a few points... showing no emotions or regret... Lelouch actually shows some understanding of what he is doing and at times... appears weak.\\n\r\nIndeed Code Geass succeeds whens Death Note fails. CG expanded the battle of intellect while managing to appeal to action fans with intense non-disorienting fights. The character interactions in CG take it to another level... which leads to anime similarity #2\\n\\n\r\n- Gundam SEED\\n\r\nThe usage of Mecha, and two childhood friends reuniting on opposite sides of the battlefield. Those were the first major similarities to SEED. But other then that... towards the second half of the series, the themes of &quot;war is evil&quot; starts to emerge... and you start to sympathize and criticize both sides.\\n\r\nIn differences, SEED... although bleak at times... always showed hope for a bright outcome... Code Geass starts off dark... gets darker... teases us w/ happy ending... before crushing all chances and becoming pitch black. CG is incredibly tragic... with episode 22-23 almost bringing me to tears (if you know me... you know that this is rare).\\n\r\nAs for why Code Geass is better... well the simple answer is that it expanded when SEED didn't... the same reason i stated w/ Death Note.\\n\r\nNow for the show it matched...\\n\\n\r\n- Eureka Seven\\n\r\nThe similarities in this case aren't in the plot and characters... rather aesthetics. Instead of sky surfing mechs, we had roller-blading ones (no joke... but it's still quite cool). The military Knightmare Frames (the name of the mechs in Code Geass) had similar coloring and design to the KLFs of E7. The main mech in series, the Lancelot, had a similar design to the main mech of E7, the &quot;Nirvash&quot; typeZERO. This can be explained due to the fact that the writer of Code Geass was the writer of Eureka Seven. On an unrelated note... the first opening for CG was made by the same artist who made he first opening for E7. (=P)\\n\r\nAs for differences... way too many to list...\\n\r\nIn fact... that's why I can't name a better of the two. Both are excellent in their own right but are too different to be compared. Eureka Seven was beautiful... Code Geass was awesome. There's a difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Code Geass is such a cliffhanger that it's obvious that there'll be a sequel series... indeed it's confirmed. Code Geass; Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 is set for release in Spring 08 (coinciding w/ it's first season release on Adult Swim). I look forward to finding out what happened, and how the plot advances...\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\nStated above",

            "content": "TL;DR:\r\n+There's thrills on every episode and it doesn't know when to stop\r\n+Great characters\r\n+Great OST\r\n-Leaves a cliffhanger\r\n-Bad art style. Recycled opening animations. Bad mech fights\r\n-Second Opening theme is so bad.\r\n-Suzaku's character is bad.\r\nI am re-reviewing this anime because my review before is too bias.\r\nCode Geass is the very first short anime that I've ever finish and this was the anime that entered me to the world of anime. I was amazed at first of course but after watching many anime, this anime has major flaws ALTHOUGH, this anime is STILL amazing.\r\nThe story is about a boy named Lelouch \"Lamperogue\" (Not his real last name). After hisMother's death and the disability of his sister, he wants to take revenge on the Britannian Empire. He also wishes for peace like his sister wish for. However, he doesn't have the power to do that until one day, C.C. grants him the power of Geass. He also disguised himself as Zero and fight against the Britannian Empire. This is where the thrill of the anime kicks in.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about this anime is that it doesn't know when to stop. Every episode, there's always a thrill that kicks in which is a huge plus. Though, it does suffer from fillers (Just the half of the one episode). However, the last episode of Season 1 ended as a bad cliffhanger which was a big disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nI am not really a big fan of it's art style. I don't really like the style where almost all characters are very tall. Also, the battle between Mechs isn't even that entertaining. Not just that but, the animation between 2 openings are almost the same. They recycled it. The only difference is their theme song. Though, this anime doesn't really suffer from a lot of still frames so that's a plus there.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST on this anime is great. The orchestrated music used on the thrilling moments fits the show very well. The first opening theme was also great until the second opening theme came. The second opening theme is one of the most annoying opening themes in anime history. \"YOU MAAAAAD?!?!\" - no. Just shut the f*ck up. Though, the third opening theme is, alright.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, I'll go with Lelouch Lamperogue first. This guy is a natural genius similar to Light Yagami from Death Note. Actually both of them share very similar traits except Lelouch can be really soft at times. Lelouch likes to win against the Britannian Empire and he deduces his situations very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"best friend\" of Lelouch - Kururugi Suzaku. Nope, I am not convinced that they're best friends. Suzaku really has a bland character. His decisions can be too stupid at times. Too avoid spoilers, let's just say, there are some actions of his that he should have done in the first place if he knew in the first place. Yeah, just watch the anime if you want to know.\\n\\n\r\nC.C. is a girl who granted the power of Geass to Lelouch. She's somewhat a Kuudere. She can be loving at times but, she also has this cold and sarcastic personality towards Lelouch. Comparing her to Ryuk from Death Note, she does help Lelouch and supports him to win.\\n\\n\r\nKallen Stadtfeld is half Japanese, half Britannian. She is a terrorist and she eventually joined the Black Knights. She has a depressing back story which lead her joining the terrorist. She is somewhat the \"badass girl\" of the anime because of her rough behavior.\\n\\n\r\nEvery characters are entertaining on this anime though, I guess I am really bothered with Suzaku's character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime's thrill but when the thrill doesn't stop until the end of it's season, that's a bad thing. Is this anime worth watching? Even though it's not your genre, yes it is. This anime is not boring because it always has it's \"WTF!\" Moments and it doesn't know when to stop.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8/10",

            "content": "Watching a movie or TV show is sort of like reading a book: the plot must capture your attention, the dialogue must be captivating, the characters must develop, and an overall picture must at first be obscure, only to become more clear as the story progresses. Code Geass does this and so much more, taking science fiction, romance, action, mecha and character and plot development onto an interstellar level. This was one of the only anime I've watched where I had to sit back and reflect: what the HECK just happened? \r\nThe story was just excellent. The political infighting, friend bickering, resistance fighting, romantic spinand serious hardcore action melded perfectly from the start. The story delves headfirst, without a lengthy intro, and continues at a an increasingly faster pace. The \"geass\" is revealed early in the show, and it twists the plot this way and that. The last couple of episodes had me gripping my seat, biting my nails, twisting my hands - anything to get the nervousness out of my system. Suspenseful and fast-paced and sprinkled with betrayal and common themes of life, Code Geass starts off light but becomes very heavily serious with plot twist after plot twist. It quickly became very dark and foreboding. I found myself walking away, shaking my head; it was too hard not to simply watch in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are stunning, to say the least. The characters are drawn tall and lanky, with stereotypical straight hair. The backdrops are gorgeous, the environment drawn to the exact detail, the battles are, ahem, FREAKING AWESOME. There really is no other term; being a fan of action, this satiated my taste for some good ol' shoot em' up action flick. The anime did NOT skimp out on any scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was merely enjoyable; the OP and ED were nothing special until the second half of the season. There, it really picked up. I never did notice the background music; it never left a lasting impression. Then again, I was probably so absorbed into what was unfolding story-wise that I forgot to notice something as trivial as background music....however, the music did fit the mood when I happened to notice it, and there was always some sort fast-paced beat during the epic scenes, so it all works out.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the characters: a huge hit. There was the character for everyone, the tough guy, the strategist, the morally \"right\" guy. But the way these characters interacted within the bigger context of the Code Geass world: priceless. The way the government was portrayed sounded faintly similar to the British government during the American Revolution; I'll keep it at that. Each character changed and developed, and the main character probably experienced every emotion in the book at some point. Emotions flowed freely: romance, pain, grief, love, betrayal - they were all shown, in exquisite detail, from a variety of characters. It was refreshing to see human characteristics; many anime tend to sort of skip of the ramifications of certain actions, leading to a dull storyline. Code Geass, however, takes it a step further and actually shows what happens to the human condition when we experience major loss, grief, or anger.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was probably one of the best I've ever seen. At the end, it does leave you hanging; however, the way they set it up shows that the second season won't be disappointing either. The excellently portrayed characters mixed with a few ingredients of epic sound and stunning visuals all in a larger pot of a heart-stopping story leads to a dinner of the gods. Watch the anime; at least give the first couple of episodes a shot. I'll make a contract with C.C. because you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "\"Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch\", the highly received production by Sunrise, directed and created by Goro Taniguchi, is quite a unique venture into political anime.\r\nCode Geass tries its best to surprise you with its twists and turns, even to the point of it twisting so many times it practically breaks its back.\r\nLelouch is the anti-hero in Code Geass, doing all the wrong things with good intentions. Lelouch and his gained power \"Geass\", reminded me of Light in \"Death Note\", which was released the same year as Code Geass. But that comparison falls once the show starts rolling, and that didn't happen until around the 13thepisode. The rest of the story (including the second season) is a bunch of twists, turns, stabs, jabs, and u-turns.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems I have with this series is that there is so much information in each episode that it was hard to keep up at times.\\n\r\nAnd for some reason, I did not find most of the episodes to be very memorable. Whenever I watched an episode, I had a hard time remembering what happened without looking up the synopsis of the particular episode.\\n\r\nI found this out in the time that I've watched/read anime, movie's, books, ect. That there can be so much drama and so many twists in such a short time, that one becomes basically numb to it, and new twists are not as surprising as they could have been in a much more controlled series.\\n\r\nNot to say that this series is boring, it's actually an intelligent portrayal of two empires at war, and all the twists are quite imaginative. It's fun to see how this series goes down, and by the time I was finished watching the first season, I was excited to watch the second season.\\n\\n\r\nJust about every character plays an important role in the show, whether they are intelligently implemented or there to be the annoying twist creator can be hard to decipher, but just about every character is either of these two.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch Lamperouge is the brains of the series (Literally, he can barely do a 100 Meter dash without stopping in the middle, out of breath.), he obtains an ancient power called \"Geass\". With his new power, he is inspired to take revenge on his father, the emperor of Britania who abandoned Lelouch, and create a world where his sister Nunally can live in peace.\\n\\n\r\nSuzaku Kururugi is Lelouch's childhood friend. He's very important to this story, regarding Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nC.C. is a being who was discovered somewhere and locked in a capsule, has the power to grant Geass to whoever is worthy.\\n\\n\r\nKallen Stadtfeld, Milly Ashford, Rivalz Cardemonde, Nina Einstein, and Shirley Fenette are all Lelouch's close friends, and apart of the student council at Ashford Academy, Milly Ashford is the president.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other side characters that will come into the loop as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very well done. I must note that there's quite an abundance of ecchi in both of the series, one instance frontal nudity. \\n\r\nThe fights can be dramatic and epic, and the animation never seems to drop noticeably in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very well done, and gives off that Dictator and Monarchy vibe quite well.\\n\r\nThe Seiyuu are excellent, they're never out of character.\\n\r\nThe SFX also fit very well.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that deserves its recognition to an extent. It is imaginative when it comes to the politics of this series, creative in its delivery, and fun to watch. \\n\r\nYou may even want to watch it just because everyone is so in love with the series, it would be nice to know what people are talking about.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in a show with many twists and turns, and are not bothered by the comparisons to Death Note, Gundam, & Legend of the Galactic Heroes, go ahead and watch this fun series, you will love it.",

            "content": "To be completely honest, I was unsure of Code Geass.  The story seemed unoriginal and at first felt like something we've all seen before.  With that aside however, I decided to watch a cuple of episodes to get my own opinion on the series.   When it aired on adult swim I found the story too move too slow for my liking (1 episode a week with only a few developments in one episode) so I decided to watch all of the fansubs at once to get my code geass fix.  It wasn't long before I was completely hooked on it.\r\nToput it briefly, Code Geass is about the prince of Brittannia, Lelouche, who lost his mother and is unhappy with the rule that Brittania imposes upon the world.  Brittannia is a large empire spanning around 67 percent world, but when it catures a country it colonizes it and makes it part of its growing empire.  The story focuses on Area 11, otherwise known as Japan.  The date is 2017, seven years after Brittannia defeated Japan.\\n\\n\r\nLelouche meets strange girl, C.C., who gives him a strange a supernatural pwer:  The power of the geass.  The geass allows Lelouche to control the actions of people around him when he looks directly into their eyes.  Using this strange and cruel power, Lelouche declares war on Brittannia, promising the people of Japan freedom from the rule of Brittania.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does not disappoint.  The story, though sluggish at times, was great, especially during some of the mecha battles (there are lots of them) and where Lelouch plans his strategy.  There is a lot (and I repeat, A LOT) of action, and mecha battles too.  The story goes deep into the actions of Brittania and Zero's actions.  These is a hint of the supernatual and romance in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is top notch, though it cannot compare to some of the animes of late.  Despite the fact that the majority of episodes I watched were fansubs, the few episodes I watched on english TV had excellent animation.  The mecha battles are intense and Code Geass does a great job of animating them.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\\n\r\nI loved the japanese voice actors, and the SFX were also on par, but unfortunately the english dubs were slightly disappointing.  Hence the 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Code Geass shines the most.  You will be touched by the actions of some the characters, while others will ake you despise them.  The character development was excellent, probably the best I've seen in an action anime of this caliber.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\\n\r\nTHIS ANIME IS ADDICTING.  The story moves at a slow enough pace for you to savor it, constantly wanting more.  The characters will make you smile, laugh, cry, and loathe.  The action wll keep you at the edge of your seat.  This anime isn't very re-watchable, since most of the njoyment comes from the suspense, however.  Another good suggestion for this anime is to never skip ahead, or you will be lost and you will probably have the storyline ruined in the process of watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI give Code Geass (and Code Geass R2) a nine out of ten.  This show is great.  Keep up the good work, Sunrise!",

            "content": "Fortunately it is coming a new season soon, it is fortunate because this show has a lot of potential, unfortuneately they aren't close to that in the first season.\r\nI was really looking forward to watching this show, after what I could see of reccomendations, this should be close to two of my favourite animes Death Note and FMP. I was so-so pleased after the first episodes, but I expected it to grow on me when I got closer to the plot and a grand finaly. I expected right, to some degree. \r\nIt was entertaining and the art is great, and even if the story isnot spectacular and fantastic in any way, but it is good and takes up some ethical problems. The story is shifting swiftly between the battles, and the fast switching is one of its strenghts, but also one of it weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nThe swift switching in enviroment and action/school does not suit the characters very well. Because of the switching you don't get to know many of the characters very well .After the show you won't know that much about Karen, the chairman, Nina and Leval. Besides even though the scenes switch swiftly the main story moves pretty slow and can become irritating some times. \\n\\n\r\nThe first OP is not good at all, and the song there is just terrible, the second one fits the show much better, but the bad OP drags down the sound-score for me.\\n\\n\r\nFor a conclusion this show was between a 7 and a 8 for me, but I gave it an 8 as my score on my list, so I'll give it a 7 here. The show had the potential to evolve more, it has a lot of lay-ups to make a fun part with schoolife aswell, but insted focuses everything on the action part. I think this could have been done better if they had builded it up like FMP have. But people that liked FMP will definately like this one to,",

            "content": "Last week, while I was browsing the Internet for new anime to download, I just realise something was amiss... What's with Code Geass : R2? Then it hit me. This is the new installment (part 2) of Code Geass series. Funny, though. I have the first series at home; Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion but I haven't managed to finish watching the whole episodes. I guess because it bores me to death!\r\nThis is a sci-fi themed anime and it was produced by CLAMP. The plot is rather so-so. But the primary reason why I don't fancy this anime is because the theme. Gosh!For an anime, I believe the theme is rather serious, too serious in fact. It's too 'political' for me. And, even though most animes like to manipulate exaggeration but the idea that this anime is portraying is rather far-fetched (just because I don't fancy it)!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place somewhere in the future in the alternate universe. In that world, Japan is invaded by The Holy Empire of Britannia. Then, Japan is given a brand new name : Area 11. The country then is shared by the citizen of Britannia as well as the original Japanese who are referred as the elevens.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what on earth is GEASS? Well, according to the anime, geass is the power to manipulate people's minds. It is represented by a glowing, bird-shaped symbol in the iris. This power is bestowed upon Lelouch Lamperouge by a mysterious green-haired girl named C.C. Who is she? Well, you have to watch it, if you wanna know more. With the new-found power, he finally has the means to defeat Britannia and fulfill his two wishes: to seek revenge for his mother and to construct a new world in which his beloved sister, Nannaly can live happily.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also features the extensive use of mechas weaponry. The mechas are known as Knightmare Frame. Lelouch's childhood friend and son of Japan's last prime minister, Kururugi Suzaku is in the service of the Britannia Army as a soldier, and was chosen to test an experiment new model of Knightmare Frame, the Lancelot.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime exudes the theme of survival and sacrifice. It also tells us that revenge is sweet however too much revenge can be detrimental! Overall, this anime is OK. But I don't really fancy it, period!\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass I feel had the potential to be a truly great Anime, but sadly fell just short of that mark.   \r\nStory: 8.5 \r\n My best description of the show is that it is a mix of Death Note (smart main character, morally ambiguous path to achieve his goals and its emphasis on battles of wits situations) and Gurren Lagann (mostly for the mech suits and the ever increasing amount of side characters on both sides of the conflict). The story and it's flow are surprisingly methodical, with interesting twists and reveals as the show progresses. It really takes its time in agood way to flesh out all its characters and their motivations throughout, while also introducing new developments and characters seamlessly (for the most part). Surprisingly, my biggest complaint with the story is that it does get bogged down a bit with less interesting side plots involving certain side characters that feel a little tired by the end of the show. Also when the show delves more into the Geass side stories I feel they detract from the plot, and are rather uninteresting due to some reveals which really lessens the uniqueness of the power. The more comedic episodes I feel are not only out of place in this anime due to its tone and mood, but also serve to detract from the plot as well, even though the humor for the most part is pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really shines. For how big the cast becomes it does a very good job on developing them and providing their motivations. There isn't really any character I felt were poorly done (at worst some can be a bit bland), which is very surprising. Lelouch himself isn't your bland stereotypical main character, he feels like a real person and the way they handle his development throughout the series is rather  impressive. Of course, as with every anime there will be your stereotypical types (mostly Lelouch's school friends) but they for the most part are handled well enough that it doesn't really get bug me at all. Speaking on this season alone, the villains and antagonists are good to great depending, with the main antagonist being a very good foil to Lelouch due to their difference of points of view and life experience. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound : 8\\n\\n\r\nI'm not really an expert when it comes to this sort of stuff, so take whatever I say here with a grain of salt. The anime looks and sounds very good, I enjoy the character models and the fight scenes are very nicely animated. I really enjoy the first op and the music throughout the series,  which made every big battle even more epic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall rating: 8.5\\n\\n\r\nThe show at times can be a blast to watch, with great cliff hangers forcing you to watch a bit more then you were planning to that day. Unfortunately due to the frequency of the mech fights and how long the season is, they do begin to become a bit tedious and repetitive in terms of circumstance and end result which does hurt my enjoyment a bit. Overall, Code Geass has a great story with great and interesting characters throughout. Repetitive fights, out of place comedy and distracting side plots keep the show from receiving a 9 rating. I still highly recommend it. This is my first ever review so I hope it was helpful!  \\n",

            "content": "Code Geass is one of the most popular anime here on MyAnimeList and is still talked about a lot after 13 years. What makes the anime this popular and why is it still talked about so often?\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of Code Geass takes place in a fictional version of Japan in 2017, where Japan has been conquered by an alternate version of the United States, where it is a monarchy called Britannia. The Japanese people have a lot less rights than the Britannian people have and they are called elevens, as the new name given to Japan by Britannia is Area 11. In Japan aBritannian student called Lelouch Lamperouge gets involved into a certain series of events causing him to come into the middle of a battle between Britannian forces and Area 11 rebels. Here he meets C.C. who makes a contract with him granting him the power of the Geass with which Lelouch can order anyone to do anything he asks which is within their power, when he looks them in the eyes. Lelouch uses this power to start a rebellion against Britannia, as he was banished to Japan by his father, the king of Britannia. He also wants to defeat Britannia to make a better world for his sister. Just after he obtained the power of the Geass he leads a group of rebels through a combination of his tactical skills and his power of the Geass. Here he establishes his new identity, the masked man \u2018Zero\u2019. Code Geass has a very large story with a variety of characters and themes. The anime can get very political at certain points with in what regards you should use diplomacy as well as different countries and characters having different political ideals. For example, Britannia believes in the right of the strongest and that the poor and weak should not be helped. However, some of the governors argue that the Japanese people (the elevens) should get more rights and be helped in certain ways. Aside from that the anime uses themes like how power can change people in certain ways as well as deception and misinformation which is used by the Britannian government to keep the people under control and used by Lelouch to take advantage of certain situations. Although the story is pretty big with many different aspects and themes, a downside is that there are somewhat too many coincidences in the anime. This can take some of the realism of the events in the story away. However, overall the story is very interesting using a multitude of different genres and keeping excitement and some mysteries to keep the viewer watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 7/10\\n\r\nCode Geass has some interesting character designs with a more thin body design for most of the characters in the show. There are also a lot of battle scenes which are often animated pretty nicely. However, the animation of the show did not really impress me and the quality of the animation seems a bit outdated looking at it from our current perspective. The openings for example can vary on animation level a lot as well. While the first opening had a lot of animation not shown in the anime itself and the animation fit well with the theme song, the second opening reuses almost all the animation of the first opening and then shuffles them in an order which almost totally does not fit with its theme song. If this anime would air today I probably would give the art and animation a 6/10, but as the anime is already 13 years old, I will give the art and animation a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCode Geass\u2019s soundtrack is great. It really fits the mainly political and militaristic atmosphere the anime has as well as several drama and other moments within the anime. The themes of the openings are very well used overall as well, although the first and third opening themes are better than the second opening theme in my opinion. The voice actors also do an excellent job performing the several characters, which can be especially seen with Lelouch performed by Jun Fukuyama. Overall, the soundtrack of Code Geass fits the anime very well and the voice actors also did a very good job performing the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nCode Geass has a lot of characters with many developed very well, like Lelouch Lamperouge and Suzaku Kururugi. Other characters can be more stereotypical, but almost everyone has a real motivation for their actions. Lelouch\u2019s primary motivations for his actions in the anime are revenge on his father and thereby the country Britannia as well as the love for his sister, as he wants to create a nicer world, like she wants. To achieve these two primary goals, Lelouch wants to stop the tyrannical rule of Britannia. One of Lelouch\u2019s friends called Suzaku Kururugi wants to stop the tyrannical rule of Britannia, just like Lelouch does. However, he wants to do this in a completely different way than Lelouch does. He joined the Britannian army to change the country from the inside out. Lelouch on the other hand wants to start a rebellion as he does not think changing the country from the inside out will be an effective strategy. He argues that the ends justify the means and does not mind killing people and using his Geass on people if they stand in his way. Throughout the series their ideals often clash with each other, sometimes when Lelouch is Zero and sometimes when he\u2019s just himself at school. As Lelouch wants to take revenge on his father and the Britannian army, he in part causes others to take revenge on him (Zero) and this can cause a chain reaction of motivations for characters throughout the anime. Aside from the motivation of revenge, motivation for many characters also come from loyalty, love, freedom or making up for sins of the past. These are all very normal reasons for motivations for characters, but do add depth to characters as almost every important character has his or her motivation explained. Jeremiah Gottwald has loyalty as a motivation, Kallen Stadtfeld freedom, Shirley Fenette love, Suzaku Kururugi making up for sins of the past and many other examples can be named for motivation. There is also not a clear good and bad in this anime, as all the characters have different ideals and act upon those. Lelouch himself has clear motivations for his actions, kills people to achieve his goals and sometimes gets consumed by his power, but he wants to create a better world, is good for the people under him and really cares about his friends and family, so can he really be called good or bad? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, Code Geass was a very enjoyable anime for me. The storyline is very fun to see unfold, as it sets up for a big story with political aspects, action, mystery, tactics and several themes to tell. The characters are also very interesting to see with their different motivations and ideals they have. The anime also ends many episodes on cliffhangers making you excited to watch more of it and it also keeps several mysteries left for season 2. It is also interesting to see Lelouch\u2019s character developing throughout the anime and seeing how he fares in several situations. The only real downsides were some of the school moments of the anime and some of the coincidences happening, but overall I really enjoyed watching Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Categories: 8/10\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nAction: 8/10\\n\r\nCode Geass uses a lot of action scenes, primarily using mecha\u2019s. These action scenes combined with the strategies used, are overall very well executed with nice choreography and surprises throughout the fight, keeping you engaged in the action. There is also a real threat of people dying within fights, which does occasionally happen. Overall, the action in the anime is very good and adds very well to the atmosphere of the story. \\n\\n\r\nStrategy: 8/10\\n\r\nCode Geass uses a lot of different strategies throughout the anime, of which the most strategies are thought of by Lelouch. As Lelouch is very good at chess, many of his strategies draw comparisons to chess strategies (which is also seen by him sometimes treating his troops as chess pieces). In the first episode a part of the chess match between Lelouch and a noble is shown. In this match, Lelouch moves his king first to get in a certain position to make room for his tower and achieve checkmate within several moves. His opponent thinks moving the king is a stupid move and gets checkmated, because of that. Unfortunately, the rest of the match was not shown on screen. Lelouch also mentioned later that the king must move first in order to let his subordinates follow, which is a good philosophical statement in combination with this chess game. However, in another game Lelouch loses a lot of pieces without capturing any pieces of his opponent, which would not happen in a normal chess game, as any good player would try to improve his position constantly and capture at least a few pieces from his opponent. Lelouch also wins in strategies against his opponent by other means as predicting what an opponent will say and recording a pre-recorded message for example, to use to his advantage. Although many of the strategies in the anime are thought out very well, others fail to deliver on that same point, hence making this an 8/10. \\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (8,5/10)\\n\r\nOverall, Code Geass is a pretty great anime. It has an interesting story with many different elements such like political elements, mystery, action, drama between characters as well as the themes of ideals clashing against each other. The characters are overall well written, as most of the characters have been given a clear motivation for their actions and many of the main characters change in characters throughout the anime and can act very differently, but still in character, in different situations. The anime also has a soundtrack really fitting the anime, although the animation quality is not very high, but still decently good. Overall, Code Geass is a pretty great anime and sets up very well for its second season. It is no wonder that this anime is very popular with and still talked about a lot to this day. \\n",

            "content": "I still don't understand why people love Code Geass so much. i'll keep this review spoiler free. This anime is just average and doesn't deserve all the praise it receives. I will be blasting this show because I don't think it deserves to be so highly rated. This is all PERSONAL OPINION, so don't show up at my house with a crowbar and a gun.\r\nCode Geass has some of the worst characters I've seen in any form of media. How do you even manage to create such a cliche yet boring group of characters. Just based off their character archetypes you can predict everything that'sgoing to happen. This bad character design ruins all the suspenseful scenes/episodes because you know right away what each person will do, and you just sit there bored watching through 15 min of dialog to see exactly what you thought would happen occur.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's has some mecha. The mecha scenes we see are cool but serve no purpose, there is nothing significant about the mechas they do not symbolize anything. The only purpose of the mechs are to fill in the gaps of boredom with some well animated action.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I hated most about Code Geass however, was that Code Geass tries so hard to be a political drama. There is nothing wrong with a political drama, but when you make a political drama that's overwhelmingly confusing, fake smart, and boring cliche characters, you get Code Geass. A political drama well done would be the Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex series, and that series seems to be rated lower than CG for whatever reason. The fake smartness gets old, you can't have plot twist every other episode, it get predictable and boring. And, introducing new characters doesn't make your show more action packed and suspenseful, it just makes it harder to follow and confuses you by giving the illusion of chaos, and most of the cast added throughout the show are even more boring and predictable than the main cast. The premise of the show is also very boring, it's just another generic anime character who got superpowers, and the weirdest aspect of the superpower is that Lelouch isn't making it useful at all, it isn't utilized in the same way as for example; Death Note and how the use of the death note is driving factor behind the characters actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming aspect of this anime is the art, and sound. The action scenes are beautifully animated and the music would have been perfect for this show if it wasn't such a mess.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3 Art: 6 Sound: 6 Character: 3 Enjoyment: 3 Overall: 5",

            "content": "Which did it better?  Season 1 or Season 2? That is the real question. \r\nThat's honestly the only real comparison here. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, while drawing on a lot of genres and anime that came before it, there really is nothing quite like it. \r\nI don't pretend to be some expert on mecha anime. I watched a bit of Gundam on Toonami when I was young, and I watched most of canon Evangelion. But how can we really compare Code Geass to anything, if it's a war drama mecha philosophical action-romance, and then we throw in some superpowers to spice thingsup? \\n\\n\r\nWell? Imagine being the poor soul who pitched this at Sunrise headquarters in 2005. What horrible chimeric beast would they have let out of their storyboard panels. What it was was absolutely beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nIf anything, Code Geass deserves praise for being so complex and wrapped up in its own intricacies, and yet never failing to deliver in any department. The action is great. The characters, although there are mainly four characters, they are all compelling. Music, GORGEOUS. And then there's that little-important thing, called, idunno, plot? Yeah, Code Geass's plot is a beautiful trainwreck, but it's one we all want to ride and then cheer when we're upside down and inside out, crying tears through our nostrils. \\n\\n\r\nCode Geass is frankly one of those series that is so well-thought out that often I feel that any attempts to amend or add to this universe is extremely difficult: every action has an action and a reaction, leading to its ultimate finale in either season. That said, because it's so difficult to get your bearings on where the story will end up, unless you are some sort of clairvoyant or professional skeptic, once you begin this series, you will be led by the nose from one point to another, not knowing who what or how unless the story tells it to you. Perhaps this is why each week seemed infamously long when waiting for the next episode, because the amount of cliffhangers in this series could hang all of Nordstrom rack. \\n\\n\r\nWhat honestly can I say about this series that you would not get by watching it on your own? Well I suppose I can tell you what it's not. It's a very thematic anime, and it is absolutely strewn with themes of rejection of the status quo and societal callings. If we're talking an anime that talks about lies and hiding one's emotions, Code Geass is probably the first one to think of. However, it's not to say it's particularly an introspective study on these philosophies. It moreoften presents them in certain lights that makes sense given the world, but it doesn't really care to explain it. In other words, if you as the reader are already aware that these themes exist, watching Code Geass won't convince you one way or the other of a stance being any more legitimate than it is on paper. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for that matter, while Code Geass often means to speak some truth through it's themes, it can come off as a platitudinous quite often. It's those scenes where those who are more annoyed with simple 8th-grade philosophies might stare at the ceiling to let the scene pass. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I should concede that as my opinion because I'm sure some people might really have a change in perspective by watching this show. I'm not one to speak of these things like they're beneath me, because I DID watch this when I was growing up, so it's natural these themes were pretty cool and new to me back then. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, lightning round finish-ups: \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. Great. A little bit flat at times, but no style comes close to this anime, and there is a lot of charisma and beauty to be found in the designs. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10. It is a VERY compelling watch. Once you start, you will not put it down. However, when we're done with the season, we'll be ending up asking ourselves \"What in the heck did I really just watch?\" because plot points travel so darn fast in this series. Sometimes, slow and steady does win the race, for us with sub-5000 IQs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 Each character is basically a moral parable. They are pretty iconic as of this point, and definitely interesting in the stories and relatable in a point of discussion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. Just watch it, you'll see. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10.  Great! Excellent. Read the review for more. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At this point in time, we can say that Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion has become one of the most unforgettable anime of all time to many anime fans. To be honest, I was quite skeptical watching it first and asked questions like \u201cIs this any good\u201d or \u201cCan I enjoy this from its story?\u201d \r\nAs usual, being an anime, it sparks many different opinions. Is it good or bad? Is it somehow relative to the real life? Or just plain b*******?\r\nAnd I decided to go along with the bandwagons the public says about this series. And guess what I found? A masterpiece witha great story, lots of theatrics, equipped with a cliffhanger at the finale. (That\u2019s why it has a second season)\\n\\n\r\nMind Games. An exiled prince. An impending rebellion. If we look at it carefully, we can somehow predict what will happen if we dive deeper in the series. Lelouch Lamperouge, the main character of the series, is a student in Ashford Academy, which is located in Area 11, which is Japan before it was conquered by Britannia, a kingdom that controls 1/3 of the whole world. He is smart, but chooses to cut classes and instead, have chess with nobles whom he easily beats without a sweat. He also has a younger sister named Nunally Lamperouge.\\n\\n\r\nSeems ordinary, right? Can a high school student lead a rebellion? (Like the title says) Until a revelation that he is actually an exiled prince from Britannia, and holds a grudge with its emperor, Charles zi Britannia to the point that he actually plans to destroy it in a future date. \\n\\n\r\nThen he meets a girl named C.C., a mysterious girl who was unfortunately shot point-blank to a vital organ, enough to kill her. But before she collapsed, she bestowed Lelouch the power called Geass, the power to bind anyone to follow his will. That caused him to start his rebellion, lead a double life and create a very influential figure named Zero.\\n\\n\r\nIts story mainly focuses on the drama from the various victims of various onslaughts, and the strategies perpetuated by Lelouch as Zero and the Black Knights while maintaining his mask as a student with a story which makes viewers very eager to watch the next episode until they finish it. Each episode seems to end with a cliffhanger, all the more reason to continue watching it.\\n\\n\r\nIt also kind of focuses on best friend relationships slash ultimate rivals, which is kind of unique in its own way, making the story more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art utilized in the series was great, concerning the character design, the Geass activation scenes, and the epic battle scenes between the protagonists and the antagonists in mecha armors, which reminds me about the Gundam Series. The KnightMares, however, is also unique in its own way including the L******t, the G***n ** II, and the G****n. I also commend the arts made in the advanced technologies both sides have (like the A****n and I*****a), and especially, Zero and his costume, which seems to have left a big mark in the anime world today.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the art made by CLAMP (usually people with elongated bodies) were fantastic. It is utilized perfectly along with those various poses of Lelouch and others.  Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the sounds, OST\u2019s and the theme songs, I found them to be highly appreciable, especially the songs by FLOW and Ali Project (My little brother kind of hates \u201cYuukyou Seishunka\u201d). The background music also blends well with the events in the story, especially those head tone voices that can be heard in some serious points in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, I really liked the main character Lelouch Lamperouge. Once again, he is smart, handsome, and his voice actor is one of my most favorite voice actors ever, although his physique is kind of weak. How about C.C, Suzaku, Kallen, and the others? They all strike different fancies in me as they have different personalities, different backgrounds, different stories, but who knows? Many hate Suzaku, but I like him. Maybe because I\u2019m me and they\u2019re them? He has a unique past, and unique moves, albeit impossible to perform. Now let us end this character review before I say any more bandwagons.\\n\\n\r\nUtter Enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Code Geass. NO more, no less. I kept asking to myself: \u201cWhat will happen next?\u201d or \u201cWill they win?\u201d, and some other more questions that really heightened my expectations about what I can see in this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I commend Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion as it is a masterpiece to me. A perfect epitome of anime with countless battles, strategies, suspense, and mind games situated within. Kudos.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I forget, the subplots in the anime sometimes had comedic routines which I found very easy to laugh at. But interestingly enough, they are somehow connected to the plot, if you analyze it enough.\\n",

            "content": "Code Geass seems to be an incredibly divisive show. One scroll through the reviews and we get a clear binary of 'INCREDIBLE!!' vs 'THIS SHOW IS NOT THE MASTERPIECE EVERYONE SAYS IT IS :@'.\r\nI went in having seen the first episode about a year ago and thinking it was messy as hell, thus never retried until recently. However, I am really glad that I did give Code Geass a second chance. I'll summarise my review in little categories, so here goes:\r\nStory - \r\nFirstly, the basis of the show is a very good idea - a world in which Japan has been taken over by thenation of 'Britannia' is a very interesting idea and makes for a very unique storyline. Watching Lelouch's journey to defeat Brittania is riveting, however the story isn't seamless. It's incredibly fast-paced and something important can happen in the span of 30 seconds which can be easily missed, so this is definitely an anime you should pay all your attention to. There are also a multitude of things happening on the side at once, so it can get a little messy, however the overall quality of the story and it's intricacies should make up for this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - \\n\r\nThe characters are AMAZING. For a show that has so many characters, Code Geass really manages to give its characters multiple layers and truly makes each character stand out. The characters are very likeable too - I, personally, adore Lelouch and some of my other favourites include C.C, Rivalz, Lloyd, Kallen and Ohgi. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Code Geass is actually a reaally good show - maybe not THE BEST ANIME OF ALL TIME EVER but after you watch it you will see exactly why it's so acclaimed and influential. My only criticism would be it can be a bit too fast-paced and therefore can seem a bit messy, but persevere because its definitely worth it.\\n",

            "content": "I am not sure where to begin. But if I save just one person from wasting time on this anime then I will feel I have succeeded.\r\nSummarily: Code Geass is a ~25 hr long Pizza Hut commercial. \r\nIt's the most heavy-handed monstrosity I've ever seen. They basically took an interesting idea, wrote a story, and then tried to amp everything to the max.\r\n1. Characters - I don't require that the MC be perfect, dazzling, or even lovable. But I can't just plain despise them. There is an art to making characters you love to hate, too. But this anime fails at even that. Lelouch isa terrible person, embarrassingly egotistical with no redeemable qualities. The character design reminds me of insects, especially those mantis-shaped heads and scrawny, flailing limbs. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like feeling like George R R Martin is always lurking around the corner waiting to ax your favorite character then just save yourself the heartache and pass on this one.\\n\\n\r\n2. Plot - I expect to suspend my disbelief to some extent with most anime, but there has to be a balance. A cleverly written series can make even the craziest things seem possible. Code Geass negelcts to fill its plot holes or even to bridge those gaps with some semblance of reason. As it plows along, it gets increasingly convoluted and it is obvious that they don't care if it makes sense as long as it has plenty of twists and turns.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of season two I was certain that they had started this journey with no direction, and changed their minds on MAJOR plot points. They then try to mask the obvious flaws that emerge with more confusion. \\n\\n\r\nMecha battles are filler and there are lots of them. They are all the same except that every time a new, more unlikely tech is added to the bots.\\n\\n\r\nWith every battle there are an unbelievable number of casualties. Halfway through I wondered what was going to be left of this world they are sort of trying to save?\\n\\n\r\n*IF YOU ARE HOPING IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE IN THE END, I'LL SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE; IT WON'T.*\\n\\n\r\n3. Art - As I said I hate the character design. And the mecha looks like all mecha ever since Transformers. Lelouch's dramatic posturing is just comical. The animation isn't terrible, for its age, but it isn't special either.\\n\\n\r\n4. Music - With the worst intros ever you can expect the track to be uninspired as well. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I am disappointed that I kept watching to the bitter end. I feel betrayed by the false hope of it being worthwhile. Suffice it to say I won't be watching the movie coming in 2019.",

            "content": "I've mentioned Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch once before, when I mentioned that the main actors from Gakuen Heaven also voiced lead characters in this. The series was brought to us by Sunrise in 2006-2007. It's an original work by the same studio that brought us the Gundam franchise and many, many other anime. Let's take a look at Code Geass and see how they did with this one.\r\nStory:\r\nCode Geass is set in an alternate future where there are three great powers, the Chinese Federation, the EU and the imperialistic Britannia. Japan has been brought under Britannian rule and lost its name, being called area11. One day, a Britannian student named Lelouch Lamperouge accidentally falls into a truck being taken by a Japanese resistance group. On board is a strange canister and Lelouch finds himself taken for a ride while Britannian forces chase the group. In the process, the canister opens and a strange woman comes out. Lelouch's old friend, Kururugi Suzaku, catches up to them, attached to the Britannian forces as an honorary Britannian. He's ordered to kill the two and refuses, getting shot by the commanding officer. The woman is shot as well, psychically granting Lelouch a contract afterwards. This gives him the titular Geass, the power to give anyone an order that they can't disobey. Lelouch figures that out and decides to use it for the one thing he wants the most, to destroy Britannia and he plans to start by liberating Japan. To accomplish this goal, he disguises himself, taking the moniker Zero and takes command of resistance forces. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw with the series is the ending. A lot of multi-series anime I've reviewed will finish their first series with some kind of big climax that gives you some closure to one of the major sub-plots but that leave more to accomplish. In Code Geass, the entire first series ending is a giant cliffhanger. It's a right mess that's focused on setting things up for the second series rather than on giving the audience any real closure. Does it make you want to watch the second series? Absolutely. But it doesn't make for a satisfying stopping point, at all. The second biggest issue is with the advertising. This series just really wants you to buy Pizza Hut. The advertising is pretty shameless and it comes up quite a bit as a visual element in various scenes. It's a bit distracting.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the main narrative is really compelling and the series is really good about establishing its rules early on so that it has its major plot elements in place when it needs them to become important. I like that the major conflict has facets to it and verisimilitude. The series is also big on consequence, which I appreciate. It really plays up the idea that Lelouch's actions are impacting real people. The quieter, more slice of life moments can also be really funny and serve the important purpose of giving the audience more of an opportunity to connect with the characters and letting them unwind from the action and more serious aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is pretty large and, mostly, pretty well developed. They seem like actual people. The friendship between Lelouch and Suzaku is really well done, as is their antagonism on the battlefield. It's interesting to compare Lelouch's more pragmatic approach to Suzaku's more idealistic. Lelouch also has a really strongly developed relationship with his little sister, Nunnally. His protectiveness of her is definitely his most endearing character facet. I also like that the various resistance members are portrayed as having different motives for fighting and even goals for when it's all over. It really makes them read as more human.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the artwork is the character designs. You can tell that Clamp worked on the designs. The character limbs are really elongated and their bodies are incredibly thin, giving them an emaciated appearance. It's not nearly as bad as the Clamp proportions in, say, Xxxholic, but they still look pretty awkward. That being said, the action sequences are really well done and I like the mecha designs. Particularly for the various unique robots. The visual geass effect also looks pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is really good. Fukuyama Jun, Sakurai Takahiro, Yukana and Koshimizu Ami all give strong performances, as do the various side characters. About the weakest you get is Shiratori Tetsu, who really plays up the \u201cmad scientist\u201d aspect of his character with an odd vocal quality that really doesn't sound natural. It's still not a bad performance, it's just not on par with the others. The music is pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a little bit. Milly likes to grope other girls and Nina develops a really massive crush on another girl.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThat's Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch, series 1. It's a really good series with a strong narrative. Well-crafted characters and strong acting. It has its flaws but, overall, nothing too bad that would ruing the experience. My final rating is going to be a solid 8/10. Maybe I'll look at the second series at a later date but, for next week, it's going to be Kekkai Sensen.",

On top of that, the invading countries are all developed countries, I thought the world was done with annexing other countries?..\r\nAfter the beginning of the anime the story line gradually grew better (thank god).Much more interesting and has a good futuristic feel to it. However, what the hell happened to the end?!? It ended so suddenly ( I didn't read the manga so I don't know if that's how it ended ) and for any anime to end like that is already a 'D' in my book. A cliff hanger ending is ridiculous.",

            "content": "Best Review: 10/10     Worst Review: 9.8/10    Average Review: 9.9/10\r\nReview: Code Geass\r\nFirst off, this review is for the entire code geass series, meaning both seasons. I see no point in separating them. *Also Beware of Spoilers*\r\nThis was a breathe taking spectacular anime that doesn\u2019t disappoint. Right from the start, you get foreshadowing of what the story will be about. Lelouch sitting in rubble from a war stricken country, tells his friend Suzaku that he will obliterate Britannia. From there, you know what the story will be about. A beginning is set with an end goal in mind, and thenthe story is told of how it all happens from then on. \\n\\n\r\nIt jumps right into the story; Lelouch is thrown right into action as he accidentally gets involved in an incident between terrorists and the Britannian army. He meets his friend underground in the stolen terrorist truck and C2 from the capsule; from there on he is forced to run in mortal danger as his life is at risk. He is put into a life or death situation where he is helpless. Then C2 jumps in and grants him an amazing power which saves his life and consequentially speeds up his initial plans. He has gained the magnificent power which allows him to compel others to do his bidding. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is one that is filled with action and all sorts of drama that will leave you wanting more. There is little to almost no filler as almost everything has a significant role to play throughout the story.  \\n\\n\r\nAll sorts of characters are brought to life that all have their own significant history and purpose in some way. The characters are introduced one at a time. Kallen whose mother was an \u201celeven\u201d and her father who is Britannian has her story and her reasons why she joined and fights with the terrorists. Nunnally who is blinded and crippled has her story of hardship as she endured what Lelouch has and stayed with him the whole time. Suzaku who killed his father when he was young, endures the torture of living as he wants to die but can\u2019t die due to the geass Lelouch put on him telling him to live. He joins the army and does whatever he can as a sort of way to repent for his previous mistake, which in the end is what he ends up doing as he gives up his life to serve as the icon of zero for the rest of his life. C2 who is immortal and cannot die is burdened with living for eternity as she struggles through points in time that she would not otherwise wanted to live through. Her tale is a tragic one and explains much about her and her nature. Euphy, who is much like a princess, cannot escape her child like state where she is constantly guarded and used as a figure head as she is protected and binded down. Shirley who is in love with Lelouch would even give her life for him despite the fact that he killed her father; she dies a very tragic death as she killed by Rolo. Rolo was also an interesting character who loves Lelouch as a brother and ends up giving his life to protect him as the only time that felt real to him was when he was with Lelouch despite it being fake. All the characters portrayed were simply all amazing in their own way and truly added to the story in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nThe way that Lelouch and Suzaku both take opposing sides and have different views of justice really adds to the action and drama. Two best friends that cannot agree with each other destined to clash at some point. Though it\u2019s slightly tragic, it certainly adds to the overall appeal. It\u2019s also quite unexpected that they ended up working together in the end to realize their plan for the world.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch\u2019s goal is a farfetched one as taking down such a predominant country is very unlikely, this one goal that starts it all is brought into a real perspective as Lelouch gets the power of Geass and slowly gains more power with his group/ allies/connections. It\u2019s quite interesting to see how his complicated and ornate plans will turn out and what sort of plot twists will come up next.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime introduces and combines all sorts of popular aspects that can be found from other relevant material; Gundam like robots, Death Note like properties, 13 Knights of the Round Table, The Order of the Black Knights , Romeo and Juliet, etc. If you look hard enough you can find a lot of reference material that you wouldn\u2019t think about at first. It\u2019s all brilliantly meshed together in one awesome anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime truly keeps you guessing and on edge wanting more as you progress further into it. The battles are fantastic and action packed filled with excitement. The ways Lelouch uses his Geass power in very intricate ways to get his plans to work is quite fascinating as well. As things progress, it gets more serious, the whole slip up with using Geass on Euphy, then the huge battle afterword. Nunnally getting kidnapped, the cliffhanger mid-way through with Suzaku and Lelouch, then the events that follow, all the people escaping out of Japan, the china forces joining Lelouch, King Charles being betrayed by his country and Schneizel. Everything sort of builds up you could say. Throughout the story, all the plot twists really take you for a spin but will leave you wanting more. When I think about this anime, I think that I couldn\u2019t have made it better myself even if I wanted to. \\n\\n\r\nLelouch\u2019s goals initially included getting revenge on Britannia, his father, and making a better world for his sister Nunnally. Once he got his revenge, he then decided to follow through with his decision to improve the world for the better for his sister\u2019s sake. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was also quite significant as Lelouch was killed by zero, the hero he invented at the beginning. He formed his plan with the symbol of zero in mind. Zero stood for freedom and prosperity and it served as a icon for the people from the start. Zero wasn\u2019t necessarily represented as one person. Anyone can be zero so long as they represent what he stands for. That idea and thought was shown as the end as that\u2019s what occurred. Lelouch allowed himself to be killed by zero as zero was their icon that brought the people hope from the start. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending, as tragic as it was, you have to admit, there could have been no better ending. It fits perfectly and really goes with the story quite well. The ending really gets to you as well.Whether or not you\u2019re the emotional type, you have to admit the ending was extremely sad and emotional. I personally cried at the end, and I\u2019ve never really done that over any anime before. But it was also a quite fair anime with a brilliant ending that gave you a choice on how you chose to perceive it. You could think that Lelouch died or that he somehow survived and was there at the end with C2 on the carriage. An ending that gives you that kind of choice is certainly a well thought out one that deserves its credit. If anything, it was a certainly different perspective compared to those generic endings which all end up happy. \\n\\n\r\nNo matter how you look at this anime, it is one of a kind. Whether you do or don\u2019t agree with some certain aspects about it, you cannot deny that it is one of the best out there. I don\u2019t really see much wrong with it. I give it a 10/10. I would even go as far as to put this in my top 10 anime list as it was an amazing anime that left an impression on me. If this isn\u2019t a 10, then I don\u2019t know what is. Others that would give this a 9 are just buttheads because they don\u2019t really know what an amazing anime really is; on their scale no anime is perfect, so screw them. Anyways, that about sums it up, hope you liked my review.\\n",

            "content": "\"She look'd so lovely, as she sway'd; The rein with dainty finger-tips; A man had given all other bliss; And all his worldly worth for this; To waste his whole heart in one kiss\" - Sir Lancelot and Queen Guienevere, by Alfred Tennyson. \r\nIntroduction: Hello, and welcome to the third installation of Smart Reviews. Rather than doing Part 1 (R1) and Part 2 (R2) of Code Geass separately, I'm going to write this review for both parts, since it's one of those stories that really should be considered as a whole, rather than as two separate parts. Let's begin. \r\nThe connection between Code Geass andthe Legend of King Arthur is unmistakeable. Excalibur chooses Arthur as its wielder and the masses come fawning toward him. Using his newfound influence, Arthur seeks the guidance of Merlin, who sets him on the path of kingship. Meanwhile, his best friend, Lancelot, a born a commoner, builds a name for himself as the strongest knight in the land, and subsequently falls in love with Guinevere, a member of royalty and former love of King Arthur. After discovering their love affair, King Arthur orders Guinevere's death. Despite a valiant attempt, Lancelot fails to save her. Wanting revenge, Lancelot seeks out Arthur to exact his vengeance. Although Lancelot kills several of Arthur's knights, he is ultimately unsuccessful and the two reconcile. After Arthur's death, Lancelot lives out the rest of his life as a masked hermit in the woods, sometimes referred to as the black knight.\\n\\n\r\nOftentimes, viewers struggle to describe just what Code Geass is - is it an adventure, is it a tear-jerking romance, is it a fun-filled slice of life, is it a mecha action romp, is it a supernatural mystery, is it a psychological thriller? Although Code Geass is rightfully all of these things, I think the comparisons to the Arthurian legends best exemplifies it's most prevailing characteristic - it's a Shakespearean tragedy. So if you're into dramatic stories with an action/adventure/supernatural/romance/psychological/mecha/comedy/mystery twist, then Code Geass is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\n(Warning: Spoilers ahead)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nCode Geass boasts one of the most multi-faceted (and brilliantly complex) stories in anime. It takes a deep look into several different genres without over-indulging on anything. In short, Code Geass is able to succeed because of its attention to detail, and the fact that it takes its sweet time constructing each of its storylines, while simultaneously keeping us interested. The most important byproduct of their patience is that the relationships portrayed in the story are actually realistic. They don't jump at you out of the blue like in some Animes (I'm looking at you, Angel Beats!). A good example of this is the romance between Suzaku and Euphemia. In the portrayal of a budding romance between a chivalrous knight and the sweet princess, the author succeeds where many before him have failed miserably, and I mean miserably. In general, goodie-goodie romances in anime are terribly written and make no sense. That's why typically anime/manga writers will make the guy or girl have a bit of a bad-boy/bad-girl streak, like in Clannad. But Code Geass has no such problem. As a result, when Euphemia finally confessed how much she loved Suzaku's awkwardness around cats (yes, it's a spoiler, but you'll have no idea what I mean until you watch it), even the most hardened viewers couldn't help but shed a few tears, even if you hated those two characters as individuals. And because of the tragedy that befall these two star-struck lovers, it was the only time I ever wished that the author would actually pull out the old deus ex machina switcheroo on us and change their tragic fates. But of course Code Geass doesn't take fan requests. It shouldn't. Because Suzaku and Euphemia's  demise subsequently sets up the perfect mechanism to drive the rest of the story into fruition. That's not to say the author left us high and dry. For those who actually wanted to see an ending that wasn't ridiculously sad, the author gave us Ogi and Villetta, two side characters that paralleled the Suzaku/Euphemia arc, just not as terrible. And that's not even the main story. The main story is about a high schooler who tries to take over the world with a supernatural power and the help of an immortal companion. Sound familiar? (see below)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nNo, this isn't Death Note, although one can make a lot of comparisons between the two shows, Code Geass, at its core, distinguishes itself from Death Note with its far more impressive cast of characters. Like Light Yagami of Death Note, Lelouch Lamprouge of Code Geass is an evil genius who wants to take over the world, in order to make it a better place, according to him. But unlike Light, Lelouch isn't just some emo high schooler - GASP! - Lelouch actually has feelings - DOUBLE GASP! - and is very relatable. Even though his intentions are somewhat selfish and ill-advised, viewers will often find themselves rooting for him after seeing his interactions with his friends, and how he actually cares about the people who suffer because of his actions. Unlike Light, Lelouch is capable of regret, and this regret is portrayed on several different levels throughout the entire show. However, although Lelouch is noted as a genius, and considered by many viewers to be the smartest character in anime, to say he's a genius is a bit of misnomer. In my opinion, he's actually not that smart. Specifically, he's very mistake-prone. But that's a good thing. Not only does that add to his relatability, it is because of his mistakes along the way that he is ultimately able to succeed in his goal, albeit at extreme costs, where Light was ultimately nothing but a complete loser in the end. Beyond Lelouch, our main character (who's also sort of an anti-hero), the remaining cast of characters - from the psychotic lesbian groupie Nina Einstein, to the annoying-to-hero assassin Rolo, to the gullible sidekick Kallen, to the perpetually guarded Villeta, to the obsessively loyal Orange Boy, to the beloved sister Nunally, to the conflicted friend/lover Shirley, to the Knight in Bloodied armor Suzaku and the strong-but-weak Euphemia - are all unique individuals who grow along their own sidestories. And all of the side-stories conclude in a very satisfying manner. The writer doesn't leave the viewers hanging like in some animes. Also, it might be worthwhile to note that, as I said in the intro, a lot of the characters are based off characters from the Legend of King Arthur. Lelouch is Arthur, of course. Geass is Excalibur. CC is Merlin. Most of the characters including Kallen, Ogi, and Suzaku are knights. Suzaku, of course, is Lancelot. His mecha is actually named Lancelot, and he has a cat named Arthur, as if it wasn't obvious enough. There are many more comparisons, but I won't get into that here. Watch the show!\\n\\n\r\nThere's actually one more thing I wanted to point out before we move on - pacing. The pace of this story is very steady throughout the entire show... until the end. The final couple episodes covered a lot of ground in very little time, and it only got faster and faster, as suddenly a year was gone in the blink of an eye. And it's not like how some stories will have that \"1 year later...\" sequence where they tell you how everyone's doing after the conclusion of the story - no, this one year skip (smack dab in the middle of the episode) was before the conclusion. I believe this is because the creators of Code Geass: Lelouch's Rebellion absolutely despised fillers, they detested anything that even resembled a filler. They could have easily added a whole other series in that period of time, but declined to so because they didn't have any other storylines to wrap up, and it would have amounted to something of a filler. Now compare that to shows like Naruto, that just wants to make a quick buck off their success. Code Geass was created by artists, not businessmen, and the results are obvious to everyone who watches it. My only gripe with that point, however, is the transition from R1 to R2. But it will take too many hard spoilers for me to explain, so you'll just have to watch it to see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nHere's where the score starts to fall a bit. The art in Code Geass is nothing to brag about. The characters all look like the anime version of Olive Oyl (Popeye's GF). Everyone is way too lanky and skinny, and why are all of their shoulders so pointy? The character faces are not really distinct beyond their hair (which is true of most anime outside of a few exceptions), all their clothing look stupid, and they all kind of look like aliens. The mecha designs and animation are only average for an anime, and downright bad for a mecha-show. Some of the mechs look really ugly, and the animation pales in comparison to Code Geass: Akito the Exiled, the successor to Code Geass: Lelouch's Rebellion (the story in Akito is far inferior though). Lelouch's mech, in particular, looks quite dumb. But luckily most of the fighting is done by Kallen and Suzaku who have great looking mechs. So it's not all bad. There are some great fight scenes, though. Basically anytime you see Kallen or Suzaku fight, you have reason to get excited. (And that happens quite often) But the best thing about the fight scenes in Code Geass is really that all the fights are meaningful. They're not just fighting for the sake of fighting, and they're not trying to beat up the other side so that they'll see eye to eye. No, there's always a real reason behind every fight, which is important because it adds weight behind the action. In fact, if the purpose suddenly disappeared for whatever reason, Lelouch will actually tell his men to stop fighting. That almost never happens in lesser anime where it's all about punching your opponent until he understand the value of friendship (Hey there, Naruto!). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 (Good)\\n\r\nThe sound is not bad, but again, it falls short of the standards set by the story. The sound effects were not spectacular, when it easily could have been. The intro/outros were only half decent. COLORS, by Flow, was the show's only good song. The rest were not really that memorable. Other than Mosaic Kakeru, I honestly can't remember how the other two intros and outros went. I just remember that they sounded like evil marching music, which fits with the show, I guess. There is another redeeming quality to the sound though - the voice acting. Both the Japanese and English dub voice actors have won a plethora of awards for their work on Code Geass. And it shows. Watch it in either version and you won't be let down, at least not by the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nCode Geass is a very enjoyable experience. It doesn't get a 10, however, because it's exposition is a little on the slow side, and hard to take in all at once - Great Britain conquering Japan - wah? But it's a very good show that's light-hearted when it wants to be - and does a good job of it, and serious when it wants to be - and does a good job of that. It has a healthy dose of pretty much everything. And although I wouldn't consider Lelouch a genius by a long shot, and I get annoyed everytime someone calls him a genius, I do agree that he CAN be very clever at times, staying true to his character, without being unrealistic. Even though Lelouch is trying to take over the world, he does it in a way that tries to sway the hearts and minds of the people at the risk of endangering himself, rather than simply using his magical powers to force people to obey him. And in a lot of ways, Lelouch is like Ikarus, just a kid who wants to fly as close to the sun as he can. That, in and of itself, is sort of admirable, and so he's very easy to cheer for - as oppose to Light Yagami of Death Note, who's practically impossible to root for. That adds a lot to the intangibles of this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (Great)\\n\r\nAll in all, Code Geass: Lelouch's Rebellion is a great show. Although it's multi-genred, it stays focused on telling its story, and does a great job of fitting all the pieces together. There is a smidge of touching upon social views and racism as well. If you want to watch a show that's smart, touchingly sad, and action-packed - watch Code Geass. It's one of those shows, that, as you're watching the final episode, you wish would never end. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Code Geass is the answer to the question \"What if the stereotypical mastermind villain was the good guy?\" A marvel of a series and very unique and different. It applies shoujo-style layered character, melodramatic tragedy to a shounen-style mecha war story, producing something unique and engaging that is neither overblown in style and structured yet brutally unsentimental, Code Geass is defined by the meticulous scheming of Lelouch, the anti-hero who carries the show. . The CLAMP character designs, fluid animation, and varied mecha combat are all part of the picture, but when it comes down to it the reason you watch are for those momentswhen Lelouch smiles sadistically and you realize he's already won, usually by savage blindide. His personality and willing decent into a hell of his own making are backed by a commanding Japanese performance and framed by a colorful cast of people doomed to be broken by fate.\\n\\n\r\nCasting villain as hero and hero as villain, Code Geass twists a stock melodramatic war story into something new and deliciously malicious. The series rides almost entirely on the shoulders of its ultimate anti-hero, which turns out to be its greatest strength. It's neither uplifting nor weepy--it's a ruthless chess match set to a symphony of brutality that is as gripping as it is unusual. In short, wicked, tragic fun. Code Geass also emphasizes on the general theme of \"revenge\". If you ever seen Death note where the show took more of a verbal approach at trying to out do each other between L and Light yagami's both genius minds who are rivals that are trying to defeat each other. To win the war against Kira. Thats kind of how code geass is portrayed, the one question you have to ask your self when watching this show is \"who is the good guy'? \"who is the bad guy\". Throughout this show, there is some one on the darker side and the one that is behind the curtain so to speak, then there is one character that is on the good side. But you will never realize who it is, because the show uses alot of confusing complex multi sided personalities for each character that keeps you guessing. But just that complex reality of two characters thrown into a chaos of war, both with genius minds trying to strategize every action keeps you wanting more and more and its hardly a show you will drop because of that. Its very satisfying, new and refreshing and i think fans of mecha action and serious character dramatic overtones will enjoy this series.",

Thanks to a new weapon, called the Knightmare Frames, the Holy Britannia was able to dictate its will. Now the Land of the Rising Sun is nothing but a colony declared as Area 11. The EU, as well as China, are at the verge of extermination and the hope is lost. However, an unknown person appears becoming the last hope of the oppressed. Alas, it is still unclear if he will truly become the Messiah or the devilhimself. How will that mysterious person change the feature? Find out about it right now! \\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch(Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion) tells a story about a student, Lelouch Lamperouge, who has his reasons to pay his homeland back. To fulfill the plan our hero will need a super power, or a technology giving him the needed superiority. By a pure fluke, Lelouch encounters a woman granting him that power. But even with that special power it would be simply unreal to fight against the whole empire alone! That is where Lelouch remembers about the dying Japan helping a group of separatists trying to create a better future for their land. This group of separatists has neither an army nor a leader, and it seems that that group of people is simply useless. Thankfully, everything is not that easy. Lelouch becomes the leader of this group, little by little strengthening it and revealing his true aim. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this concept may sound not promising for one, Code Geass is able to prove its superiority in every possible aspect. The first season doesn\u2019t leave unanswered questions; it gives shrewd reasoning explaining every problem you are interested in. I didn\u2019t find any captious objections to the story-line; it is simply great.\\n\\n\r\nOne may think that an anime about robots is senseless and should be avoided at any cost. Indeed, but CG doesn\u2019t have that mecha feel as the most mecha anime do. It is not a Gundam, it is an anime about Lelouch\u2019s rebellion. On top of that, Britania has conquered almost the whole world thanks to that technology and it made it important for the story-line.\\n\\n\r\n-Animation-\\n\\n\r\nThanks to the CLAMP ladies the anime is catching for both males and females. Even in spite of the fact that this anime is pretty old, there is charm in it, and you will surely appreciate it. The action scenes are also well done. \\n\\n\r\n***Note: Clamp is an all-female Japanese manga artist group that was formed in the mid-1980.***\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nThis show has, indeed, a weird set of the main themes. The first opening simply doesn\u2019t suit this anime; it is an anime about aristocracy, war, intrigues and this opening is simply a bad idea. And after hearing such themes as: Yuukyou Seishunka by Ali Project and Innocent Days by Hitomi, you understand that incongruity of the themes even more. But it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that this anime has some god-like tracks, which will make you feel like you are in the heaven. It is very difficult to describe that beauty of the soundtrack, but this anime has one of the best music tracks you will ever find in your life. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nCode Geass (s1) doesn\u2019t have any noticeable flaws, but when it comes to the characters, the whole picture changes dramatically. The title of this anime makes it clear that this anime is about Lelouch and Lelouch only. So, it is pretty obvious that he will take all the screen-time. On top of that, taking into account the number of characters, it would be impossible to give them all the same development.\\n\\n\r\nLamperouge Lelouch is the only figure, which makes this anime that amazing. He is like Yagami Light to Death Note, but the difference is their nature. Yagami Light\u2019s hard-hearted nature can\u2019t make him a remembering character. Without a doubt, he is a remarkable hero to mention, but this lack of feelings was a big problem. Lelouch, however, is more humane. Both Yagami Light and Lamperouge Lelouch are students, geniuses, have masterminds;yet, that difference in their nature makes the difference between their characters definitely obvious. It is an open secret, that we all watch anime for emotions and seeing an emotionless protagonist wouldn\u2019t be a good thing. Thankfully, Code Geass offers us a hero, who loves his sister (No, he doesn\u2019t have a little sister complex, his attachment is a bit different), has a girlfriend and has an old-friend he cares about. He is both a hero and an anti-hero, but don\u2019t think about it now. You will have to think about it a little bit later. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is the real problem of Code Geass. For example take Suzaku. This person doesn\u2019t make sense at all. Sometimes he tries to make us think that what he did is a good thing;yet, sometimes he shows that uncertainty about his deeds. The rest of the supporting cast has also some problems, but nothing major to mention. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t be upset about the supporting cast. It is not a Code Geass: Hangyaku no Suzuku, it is Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch. And the supporting cast isn\u2019t that bad to avoid this anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThe good: \\n\r\n1)It is realistic. It doesn\u2019t leave you a feeling that some random people found some stuff on Wikipedia and made a show about it. \\n\r\n2)The music is simply brilliant. \\n\r\n3)The story-line is well-written, which makes it enjoyable to watch this show.\\n\r\n4)The main character.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\r\n1)Supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9,5=~10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Code Geass is one of these anime, which will be appealing for both males and females. However, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this show for kids. (Drugs, deaths (following one after another, mild fan service and other unpleasant things.))\\n\\n\r\nAre you still unconscious after seeing Death Note? Do you want to see the continuation, which may become your new favorite? Haven\u2019t you seen Code Geass yet? What are you waiting for?",

            "content": "*Sees that some people rise their guns towards him* Wow! Hold on! Let me explain why a 6, okay!? ...\r\n*People lowing their guns*\r\nOk... *clears throat* Code Geass is what you have when a pussy tries to be Light Yagami. *people rise their guns again* Okay, fine! I get it. You guys just love Code Geass!\r\n*Sigh* Even before I started to watch a lot of anime like I do nowadays about a year ago, I knew about Code Geass. It's just one of those great 00's Animes like Death Note (that actually were emitted at the same time), Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, Samurai Champloo, Full Metal Alchemist,Ergo Proxy, Welcome to the NHK, etc. And well... I thinks I was expecting more.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one word that would describe Code Geass for me that would be: Melodramatic. Honestly, I have seen \"Telenovelas\" less dramatic that this series. I have only watched the first episode of Season 2, but in Season 1 they pretty much forced a lot to feel something, without a proper construction.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I expected the most were brilliant plans by Zero, similar to the ones from Kira in Death Note... And well for me that never happens, the only time that I can see a plan similar to Kira is the one to (Spoiler) save her sister Nunnally from Mao. (End Spoiler) And it's just amazing how they ruin everything so fast, I mean, the construction itself by the end-half the season is quite good, and it has some amazing scenes, but oh my god do they ruin every scene in the end at the worst way possible. For example, the fact that (Spoiler) Shirley knows about Zero, the way the arc ended while it was quite good, the way they continued the story was just mediocre. While I can see how the strategy worked for Lelouch at the beginning by convincing everyone, the fact that they never ask a thing to her it's just shockingly stupid. (End Spoiler) Something that I loved from Death Note was that with these types of situations, Light tried his best to get out of them while taking a risk to get more involved in it, a bigger lie to cover a lie and so on, in Code Geass this never happens. Another really good scene is when (Spoiler) Zero kills Euphemia, this scene is actually really good, but by God does the production of it it's stupid, I mean seriously a fucking sentence that he didn't wanted to say and boom, everything fucked up. I cringed and watch the following scene in little jumps because I was ashamed of watching this. In the end, when Zero kills her, he says that she was probably his first love... Are you fucking serious!? We never had a romantic scene between you, not even as kids, I believe Shirley was more your first fu***** first love. (End spoiler). While you can see some decent military tactics, at least 3 times Lelouch is saved by luck *cof* *cof* C.C. *cof* *cof*. Which comes the next point.\\n\\n\r\nThere are actually some pretty good characters and construction of them, such as C.C., Mao and Shirley, but they are wasted by the end or how they act in the end and doesn\u2019t let them appreciate them. The episodes where Mao appears are for me the best ones that this series have. But again, the strategies from Lelouch are not quite good, for example (Spoiler) If Mao could read the mind\u2026 What happens if you think in another language? Apparently Lelouch is good in English and they\u2019re speaking Japanese, what would have happen? Or any other language. Other thing is in the last game of chess\u2026 If everything reduced to the weight of the pieces why not simply put yourself in the balance to deactivate the bomb? Because as far as I know, if he got the balance to be in his favor because of the weight, he would deactivate the bomb, and yes, it might have not work out, but I\u2019m just surprised that this obvious option was never mentioned (End Spoiler). Yet, the romance is relatively good in this series, not anything exceptional but certainly not bad.\\n\\n\r\nI consider an insult (at least in this first season) to compare Lelouch and Light, it\u2019s pretty obvious that in getting information and doing a plan with it, Light is WAY better than Lelouch, otherwise, Lelouch would have known in short time that Suzaku was the pilot of Lancelot.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, CodeGeass has a relatively good construction, and some great scenes, but these scenes don\u2019t last too much because of the execution that they follow and plot armor Lelouch has. This is why I consider Code Geass to be tolerable, not bad, but certainly not good.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope it gets better in Season 2, and by the scores it appearently is.",

            "content": "I started this knowing nothing other than the fact that it has a great opening and it's very very very popular. I finished it with a new anime on my top 5 all-time-favourites list.\r\nStory 10/10: The premise is interesting enough that it pulled me in from the very beginning, and then it kept getting better and better to the point where I gave up even trying to guess where it would go because I'm obviously not smart enough to ever be right. It had a quite a few plot twists that left me with my mouth hanging open, and the whole Geass power thingy isone of the most interesting abilities I've encountered in anime, so I'm satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I know not everyone agrees with this but I found the overall art style incredibly beautiful and a pleasure to look at, everything is pretty much perfect from colour use to special effects and action scenes (especially in the last two episodes), which is very interesting considering that this anime came out in freaking 2006 and I don't tend to like older anime when it comes to the art. My favourite part other than the fight scenes has to be the colour combinations used in the character designs - the lack of harmony between hair and eye colours might be jarring for some but to me it makes the characters feel really unique. Another positive is that this show might have my favourite anime tears in existence.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: The first opening is one of the best anime openings like ever, but it took some time until I grew to love any of the other opening or ending themes. On the other hand, the background music was pretty amazing, it always fit the mood perfectly and there were a lot of songs that really set the mood of the scenes they were used in. The voice acting was incredible as well, and Jun Fukuyama has now become one of my favourite voice actors because of his ability to use a different voice for all of Lelouch's personas.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: I spent way too much time trying to decide whose side I should be on, and I'm still not sure, so that must say something. Every major character was developed in some way, although it was always in a way that furthered the plot, but that made it even better, and the side characters were treated so so well, I absolutely did not expect to grow to love so many characters this much, and most of all Lelouch, who is defintiely one of the best protagonists I've come across in fictional media. I also didn't expect this anime to have such a wonderful cast of female characters :')\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Getting through the first four episodes was quite difficult for some reason but then episodes five pulled me in and never let go, so I ended up binge-watching the rest of it in about 2 days. I even cried a few times, and that ending absolutely destroyed me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I must say, this anime absolutely deserves the hype that it gets even 12 years later, and, in my humble opinion, is the only anime that could be said to almost be on par with FMAB. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, and I'd guess it doesn't fail as an introduction to anime in general either. It is also one of the shows that deserve to be rewatched, even if you don't typically tend to do that.\\n",

            "content": "Note: This is sort of a preliminary review because I am still watching R2. After watching it, it may change my opinion of the show. I\u2019ll also say that this review is spoiler free so don\u2019t you worry.\r\nWhen I think of mecha anime, they can be mostly about politics (lookin\u2019 at you Sunrise) which they can be a bit of a bore so I tend to stay away from watching any of them. However, there is one mecha anime that sort of caught my eye. It may have a few political elements that may bore me a bit, but its cast, its storytelling, the supernaturalelements and among a few other things (you know what I\u2019m talking about) makes me want to watch this certain mech anime. That anime is of course, Code Geass. \\n\r\nI\u2019ve been really wanting to watch this show for quite a while, but sadly I didn\u2019t have any time to watch it. So now that I finally did, I could say that this show can be one of my personal favorites. But not really the best anime I\u2019ve ever witnessed. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10/10\\n\r\nThe Holy Empire of Britannia conquered the country known as Japan and now call it Area 11. Its residents lost their rights to self-govern and are now called Elevens. The Empire uses powerfully destructive robotic weapons called Knightmares to ensure control, but someone is about to stand up against it. Lelouch, the black prince, has endless ambition and uses the power of the Geass to build a world based on his ideals. \\n\r\nAs you can see, Code Geass is not your average mech anime. It may have a few political elements (remind you of Gundam), but it has a couple of supernatural elements with the Geass and all. They way they mix mecha and the supernatural is great. It is quite rare to see something like this which is why this anime is one of the best mecha anime ever. Not only that, but I also find the political part quite interesting. Mainly because it deals with different races (plus I am a sucker for stories with different races having war with each other). In this case, the Britannians and the Japanese. Also, the action scenes with the mechs are also pretty damn good. Definitely the highlights of the series.\\n\r\nThere are also the Ashford Academy scenes, which can be out of place with the more political scenes (since they mostly have comedy and romance elements in). But they mostly calm you down and they also make the characters more likeable. Overall, the story\u2019s great.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nCode Geass may have a very large cast, but a lot of them have quirks that makes them quite memorable. \\n\r\nFirstly, there is Lelouch Lamperogue aka Lelouch vi Britannia; aka Zero; aka Light Yagami\u2019s distant brother. Why did I say Light Yagami\u2019s distant brother? Well it\u2019s because they are the exact same person. Only that Lelouch is a better character in my opinion. Anyways, he is an exiled prince who just wants his sister, Nunally to be happy. But in a somewhat disturbing way like killing off a bunch of people. What makes him a great character is his unique motives and his great personality (among other things like having a harem). No wonder why he\u2019s MAL\u2019s most favorited character.\\n\r\nSecond there\u2019s Suzaku, the rival/best friend/whatever to Lelouch, who wants to make a more peaceful approach to Lelouch/Zero\u2019s plan where Britannians and Japanese can live peacefully. His relationship with Lelouch is very great and contrasts with each other. \\n\r\nThen there are the main female characters, CC and Kallen. CC is an immortal witch who gave Lelouch his Geass, as well as having a pizza addiction (oh yeah, Pizza Hut sponsors this show). Kallen is a Britannian-Japanese who helps Lelouch/Zero with the Black Knights. Both girls are very good characters and are also very umm\u2026 attractive.\\n\r\nThere are also many other great characters in the show like \u201cOrange\u201d, Lloyd, Cornelia, Euphy, Viletta, Shirley, Nunally and many others. All characters are great. Oh wait, screw that. Most characters are great. There are some like the Emperor (aka one of the biggest d***heads in anime) and Nina. Why does Nina even exist? No seriously why?\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation done by Sunrise is absolutely fantastic, especially with the Knightmares. Despite looking a bit similar to each other for the most part, the design of the Knightmares look very unique compared to other notable mechas such as the Evas or the Gundams. The movements of the mechs are also very smooth making them feel real.\\n\r\nThe character designs are also very iconic which makes many of the characters some of the most notable characters in all of anime. And oh, by the way, do you guys wonder why the characters look so damn skinny compared to other anime designs you know? Give those credits to CLAMP who are very well known for their skinny af character designs. \\n\r\nCode Geass\u2019 animation is quite well done. Heck, despite not being into it, the fanservice is well done as well. However, there are a few nit-picks I have with the fanservice parts. By that, some can be quite uncomfortable to watch (I mean some can be quite ehhhhh) which is the reason why I only gave it a 9. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 10/10\\n\r\nI have to say that Code Geass\u2019 OST has to be one of my favorites. The music in this anime is filled with epic battle music with hints of jazz and orchestral elements. Other than the battle music, there are also softer tracks too that cover up the sweet and emotional scenes. These tracks are very catchy and are very nice to hear.\\n\r\nThe first opening, Colors by FLOW is a great start for the anime. The second opening, however, is not that great. The song isn\u2019t really that good; visually, they just copy the same footage from the first opening. They did the same for the second ending, however the song is quite nice. I also know the fact that no one likes the first ending done by Ali Project. But, I find it okay (I find their music quite unique).  \\n\\n\r\nDUB: 9/10\\n\r\nThe dub for this anime is actually quite good. Especially with people like Johnny Yong Bosch. He may mostly sound a bit like his other roles, but he is still absolutely perfect as Lelouch. The rest of the cast is also good as well too (especially with Orange, Suzaku and CC). However, I find Nunally a bit too pitchy. Anyways the dub is still good.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nCode Geass overall is a great mecha anime to watch. An amazing story that mixes different genres, a memorable cast of characters, spectacular animation and a soundtrack that is a mixture of epic and nice. If you like mecha anime (that is not Gundam or NGE), watch Code Geass. Even if you are not a mecha fan yourself.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ A great mecha story with a supernatural twist\\n\r\n+ Amazing thrills and twists here and there\\n\r\n+ A unique cast of characters with great relationships\\n\r\n+ Mech battles are spot on\\n\r\n+ Great animation with some iconic designs\\n\r\n+ Catchy and beautiful sounding music\\n\r\n+ Dub is very good\\n\r\n+ Lelouch deserves to be the most popular character in this website\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Comedy scenes can be a bit out of place\\n\r\n- Opening and endings are visually repetitive\\n\r\n- Fanservice can be a bit uncomfortable\\n\r\n- Why does Nina even exist?!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nDub: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, I command you to go watch this show (if you haven\u2019t).\\n",

            "content": "What can I say about Code Geass that hasn't already been said? Let me say it is a rollercoaster ride. You never know what is going to happen with this show. Tensions are always high from the word go and the intensity does not slow down. Even in the most innocent looking scenes will arise major points. Just when you think something will go right for a change, something else will happen to change it.\r\nLelouch, the main character, is in it for revenge. Without spoiling to much, his whole fight is to find out the culprit of one crime. With such a 2D motivation fora character's reasons to fight, how can he be a likable protagonist?\\n\\n\r\nWell, he isn't, and his amazing theme song titled Nightmare supports that in both name and nature. You know that no one is in the right in this story. There are those who fight for reasons of loyalty, there are those who fight for their own ideals, there are those who fight just to bring peace, but everyone is morally gray. You respect the characters of both sides of the conflict and you don't want to see the tragedy that lies behind any of them.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest, sometimes this anime might be full on. I personally dropped that anime once or twice because I couldn't handle the full impact of the storyline. This doesn't mean I didn't like the anime. I picked it back up and continued to watch, not forgetting what tragedies made me both love and hate this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is one of beauty as well, and the music, minus the second opening, was all perfectly placed. I think that the art was a good mix between the regular cartoon style of animes like Lucky Star and the more refined style of animes like Zankyou no Terror. It perfectly suits it. And the music perfectly fits the scenes, the characters, and the show overall.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend Code Geass to everyone. It is quite full on. As I previously mentioned I had to drop the series because it was too much. But if you can reach the end of the rollercoaster, I assure you that you will enjoy almost every minute, so long as you can handle it.",

            "content": "Firstly sorry for my bad english, but after watched this series I want to share some thoughts with you.\r\nWhen I saw the score 8.87 for ss1 and 9.00 for ss2, I was highly expecting this anime to be very good or very enjoyable. But it isn't.\r\nStory: 7/10. Most of first season are boring plots. Maybe it has some good episodes at the end but the rest are painful to watch. I didn't enjoy the robots and school life in this movie very much, the plot barely moves and I had a hard time to keep watching and waiting for something interesting to happen.\r\nArt: 7/10. OnlyCC and Suzaku are really well-made, Lelouch looks decent though but his hair is so annoying. Robots look very cool but I don't really care much. The other characters look very boring and can be seen in any animes. But the art keeps getting better and at some point you will get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10. I really like CC, she is unique and interesting. Lelouch is really well-written, but again the other characters are mediocre, Kallen and Suzuka are a bit better though. The character development in this anime is just so-so, I can't see much aspects from the characters in this anime except Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10. Most of the screentime are boring but I got excited and surprised at the end of both ss1 and ss2. But that's not enough, I was nearly going to drop this anime about 3~4 times at some back-to-back boring episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. I think this anime is highly overrated due to the very good ending,or maybe it is more interesting if you like robot fighting and school life. But after all it still has some amazing moments that will be hard to forget though.",

Code Geass as many say, is a variation of Death Note, but holds its own, especially in originality.\r\nThe storyline is the Code Geass' strongest point, an array of goals with both good and bad intentions. What truly makes it great is the lack of good side and bad side, as there are good principleson each. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not flawless, but they are strong, characterizing human nature and its flaws and strengths as well as the desire to do good. The evolution and deterioration of friendship as well as the personal goals drives each character to change and grow.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Lelouch and the robots is exceptional. The hand movement and facial expressions by Lelouch bring out the depth of his character as harsh cold yet in love with this world.\\n\\n\r\nNow it has been awhile since i last watched Code Geass (watched twice) but as i can recall the music did not detract from any part of Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite animes I highly recommend this somewhat mind blowing anime that contains a lot of originality. It is definitely worth watching and is the closest anime to masterpiece, which I am still hunting for!",

It's pretty crazy at times, there's a little campiness here and there, and it is definitely hilarious. The hilarity is magnified by the fabulous characters like Lelouch.\\n\\n\r\nIt experiences a few of the same mood swings that Valvrave has. There several times in the series where the episodes will be absolutely mind-screwing crazy and slowly rip you to pieces. The plot goes along with this by being pretty insane and over-the-top on more than one occasion. It is mostly covered for by the overt awesomeness that the series exhibits though.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a complete aversion of the usual hero character because he exhibits far more traits of an anti-hero. This was an entertaining exploitation of this plot device because his jerkness completely blindsides you sometimes. It mixed up the formula and I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is good for someone looking for a series that bleeds craziness and awesomeness into a mecha show at the same time. This means that if you liked Valvrave the Liberator, you'll probably like this. It digs a bit deeper than Valvrave and the ending is better. Generally speaking, everything in Code Geass comes across more seriously (but more flamboyantly) than it did in Valvrave.",

There is a constant dark tone throughout the entire anime which makes every moment suspenseful and also makes you want to keep watching after an episode is done. Trust me I've watched this anime several times and i still cant stop. Although the dark tone, the writers were able to loosen thingsup just in the nick of time. Every few episodes there is an episode that is more funny and light hearted to loosen the mood. From valentines day parties to chasing a cat around school. Even though these episodes are funny and light hearted doesn't mean they dont effect the story in any way, heck they are pretty important to the story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, i really enjoyed this anime and i suggest it to anyone who likes awesome mechs and war strategy. I rated this 10/10 and its my all time  favorite anime.\\n\\n\r\nthanks for reading my review :D \\n\r\n~Aggronian (Josh)",

Before you just give it unhelpful please let me explain why.\r\nHowever Code Geass was one of the best stories I've ever seen/heard/red and almost everything about it was great. I caught myself that I was counting how much more episodes till the end. Normally I just always wanted to see the next episode and didn't want the serie to end. Maybe it was because of the mecha, maybe because of the way they brought it, maybe cause the story wasn't going fast enough or maybe because of everything.To be honest I do not really know why, but I can tell for sure that I didn't enjoyed it most of the time. Of course that is just my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is said, I would like to tell why it still deserves a 7 in my opinion.The story and the characters were outstanding. There were almost no holes in the plot and the characters. The way they let you see the story from 2 friends fighting for the same ideal but on a completely other way, even that different that they become enemies because of it. Is very original and well done. The way they fight for it and the psychological questions they handle with their way of judgement is really superb.\\n\\n\r\nI still recommend this to anyone who like psychological series about politics.",

            "content": "What makes an anime addicting? A cool main character? Giant robots? Half-naked girls? \r\nCode Geass takes all of that and tries to make a killing.\r\nIts premises are not so original. The year's 2017: it's been seven years since the Britannian Empire has conquered Japan, now renamed Area 11, thanks to the overwhelming power of the Knightmare Frames, the show's giant mechs; but the war's not over yet, since terrorists who still call themselves Japanese are trying to retake their country, with no result. At least until our protagonist shows up. \r\nThe main story has a unique direction, but the methods it uses to develop itselfare kinda questionable: bluntly put, it's a sequence of ridiculously convenient plot devices that result in a forced situation more than just a couple of times; every episode ends up in a cliffhanger, and the fact that there's actually no ending means that the Sunrise guys are making sure that you'll come back for season two.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, the only remarkable ones are the main ones. Lelouch is one likeable fella: smart, authoritative and with a natural flair for melodrama, he's the guy who makes the anime go round. However, you're obliged to accept the fact that he's some sort of genius-strategist, and they (the Sunrise guys) didn't even bother to explain his backgrounds a bit better, although Kallen gets a whole episode to look deeper in her \"Japanese side\" (and for your information that was IMO the best episode); C.C. is interesting too, but I don't think they've done much with her. She's just 'there', period.\\n\r\nI found almost all of the rest of the cast either dull, irritating, or just too stupid.\\n\r\n Fanservice has been added in massive doses, and a great part of the ladies isn't... left unseen.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about graphics, I must say that I'm not exactly a fan of the character design and style of drawing, while animation's well done.\\n\\n\r\nThen, even if I often had a feeling that robots were there just \"because giant robots\", the mech battles were neat: robots were like infantry, and battles were fought and won by giving orders with an actual tactical value. Nothing too complicated though, the show makes it sound like a big deal, but it's nice to see something different from an ultimately-customized-robo clash. Which is exactly what you'll get in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Code Geass does its job as pure entertainment: it's ambitious, albeit exaggerated, and the fact that it tries not to disappoint every fandom in the universe drags the quality down. Still, I did like it the first time I watched it, but without any doubt it could have been something more than just a pretty average show.",

            "content": "I'll admit I'm not a fan of any anime that uses robots to fight, but this anime doesn't revolve around simply technology and mechanisms; it includes what I love most: psychology and action with a purpose. I did not expect to like this anime nor did I expect an anime to from 2006 to have the aesthetics I typically prefer. So I dismissed it as an anime I wouldn't enjoy. Lo and behold a year later, I decided to give the anime a shot out of my lack of things to watch. I freaking love this anime so much that I'm reviewing it at only20/25 episodes at night because I feel the urge to let others know before I continue to watch another episode that this is worth your time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nA British teen boy named Lelouch is fighting against Brittania all derived from his own ideology of what justice is. However, in order for immediate change in a strict corrupt society violence is necessary. Violence may only physically harm the individual targeted, but it simultaneously psychologically injures those who witness or are indirectly affected by it. His counter part Suzaku an eleven (Japanese citizen under control of British rule) wishes for justice too, but his methods of achieving it contradict what Lelouch believes. Long story short, various events lead these characters to their own paths whether the path is the same or different. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThat summary was pretty poor and did the story little justice, so please let me give you a chance to see the anime holistically without spoiling anything.\\n\\n\r\n1) The characters are like-able, interesting, and appealing. Some will argue that said character is annoying/obnoxious but I found all of them to be enjoyable. I found myself empathizing with both the \"enemies\" and the \"heroes\" at certain points. I switched back and forth on which side was right, and at times I found myself hating all of the actions taken. Yet when I asked myself \"What would I do?\" I had no solutions or even a remote idea.\\n\\n\r\n2) There's always action going on, I watched 10 straight episodes with my eyes glued to the screen...\\n\\n\r\n3) Progression, the anime gets better as the episodes pass. That's one of the most important things. I like not being able to predict what will happen next, but I also dislike silly plot twists with no logic. Code Geass managed to trick me plenty of times whilst staying realistic. \\n\\n\r\n4) Morals. I like those. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAddition: (Just finished season 1, season 2 will go by so quick...)\\n\r\nEven though the plot didn't always go the way I wanted to, no matter how strongly I wished some things didn't happen in the story. I can't bend the anime to a happy fairy tale in which everything I'd like to occur happens. That's unrealistic, this anime made me awfully happy and sad at the same time at some events, but that's what I like the most. I'm not being spoon-fed or lied, I'm given reality in each episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime does have it's high points as well as low. It shows that even with special powers and brainpower, you can still be defeated.

            "content": "I had no idea what to expect when I first started watching this anime series. I don\u2019t even remember why I watched it to begin with. However, by the end of the first episode I was hooked. The main character Lelouch is an exiled noble and high school student living as an average Britannian (one of society\u2019s upper-class) in a conquered and annexed Japan. After attempting to help at a car accident he gets wrapped up in a heist led by Japanese rebels which ends in him being given a strange power by a mysterious girl named C-2. His power, called Geass, allows him tocommand a person to do absolutely anything, as long as he can make direct eye contact with that person.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch, who despises his government and his father (who is the emperor that exiled him and his sister) becomes \u201cZero,\u201d a mystery hero for rebels across the world. He lives a double life as a student at a prestigious school, and the leader of the world\u2019s fastest growing terrorist/rebel organization.\\n\\n\r\nLelouch is a strategic genius, and he uses his Geass power with horrifying efficiency. Even though he can only use it on a person one time, he easily discovers ways to outclass Britannia\u2019s greatest military generals. He manipulates powerful global forces while never disturbing the image of himself as an innocent school boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe story becomes more dramatic as Lelouch\u2019s personal school friends began getting involved with the large-scale wars that are enveloping the world. His best friend, Suzaku, enlists in the military and quickly progresses to the top as a genius mech pilot. Suzaku, a staunch believer in righteousness and taking the moral high ground, is often at odds with Zero (who he doesn\u2019t realize is his best friend) who uses deceptive and underhand tactics to get his way. Another of Lelouch\u2019s classmates, Collin, is secretly a rebel fighting under Zero, and even she doesn\u2019t know of Zero\u2019s true identity.\\n\\n\r\nThe tension between all of these characters steadily increases as their school personalities diminish in favor of their increasingly important lives as soldiers, rebels, and tacticians. Meanwhile, Lelouch, as Zero, becomes drunk with power and invents increasingly dastardly and morally questionable schemes to overthrow the government of Britannia. Hiding his identity becomes increasingly difficult, especially when it comes to light that Lelouch isn\u2019t the only person with special powers. At one point a man named Mao confronts him, someone with the ability to read people\u2019s minds. He is jealous of Lelouch for having won the affection of C-2 and will do anything to get her back. His power poses a serious problem for Lelouch, who is physically weak and has always relied on his strategic mind. The resulting battle between them is epic, and requires Lelouch to take chances that he would normally avoid.\\n\\n\r\nEventually Lelouch\u2019s identity becomes known to more and more forces within the world, and this gives others ways to blackmail him or to understand his goals better. As Lelouch becomes increasingly distant from his friends and relatives, he must decide whether to continue on the path of blood or turn back and salvage any hope of living a peaceful life. His maddening desire to dominate drives him to the brink, and by the end of the series he will have to decide whether or not to take the most extreme of measures to create the ideal world that he dreams of.\\n\\n\r\nThe series isn\u2019t perfect. There are some embarrassingly bad moments, such as the Super Electromagnetic Shrapnel Cannon (oh god), and a rough, perhaps unnecessary, plot transition into the second season. However by the end all is forgiven. Code Geass is a masterful story about friendship and sacrifice, one in which the characters experience blissful happiness between bouts of exceptional suffering. This series is a must for fans of action or drama, though I would personally recommend it to anyone who considers themselves a fan of anime in general. If you haven\u2019t seen Code Geass yet, prepare yourself for a treat.",

Truth be told, I went in head first because of that but little did I knew that there was more to it...\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is your regular ol' payback story but amplified. Lelouch wanted revenge at first but found a better motive; to create a world which is softer and more peaceful by the time Nunnally opens her eyes. The plot twists were really well done and made the anime much moredramatic by involving side characters who we thought would become irrelevant and forgotten afterwards but were proved wrong. Furthermore, this was an original so an adaptation OF the manga was out of the question. How Jeremiah got easily dismissed was kind of stupid though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nFor an anime that started in 2006, DAMN! The animation crew did a great job! I would've given it a 9 but I didn't like how they made their characters that much. Still the animations and Knightmare effects were awesome\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI liked all the openings, endings and even the OSTs regardless of how much some of them were hated, ESPECIALLY Kaidoku Funou. I didn't really care if it suits the anime or not, just how good it was. The BGM gave a more intense touch to the battles which were well done too\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nLelouch - Your typical oujidere but a bit more filled with pride and mentally fragile. As an oujidere, he is obviously not athletic. I also loved how he kept calm most of the time during fights.\\n\r\nSuzaku - The very definition of Brawns over Brains. I think ,to some extent, he was used as a plot device. Maybe thta's why the studio decided to make him irrational. The perfect example would be when Zero rescued him and offered him to join them but he refused and said that Britannia can be changed from within. Britannia is a reign that strongly hates the Japanese which also controls 33% of the world.\\n\r\nSee what I mean?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nWith every point required for this sect already mentioned above, what all do I need to explain anyway? I liked how they included little hampers of comedy that could make a big difference if otherwise\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nCode Geass was an amazing watch and nothing makes me regret watching it even in the slightest. I recommend it to anyone who loves revenge-plot stories ^_^\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Has tits, is good watch, not cliched, has tits\\n",

            "content": "Do you feel like nobody loves you and the universe is out to ruin your life? Are you too smart for your own good? Then Code Geass is the anime for you.\r\nCode Geass is very visually appealing, and the alternate universe setting is intriguing. Unfortunately these are squandered by melodramatic writing and obnoxious characters. The chief offender is Lelouch, the protagonist himself, who is one of those holier-than-thou genius characters with beautiful eyes and a tragic backstory. C.C., the geas-giver, is a prime example of women as plot devices; and Nunnally, Lelouch's poor little blind sister, is like a throwback to the uselessly delicate girlsof Victorian literature. Even Kallen, supposedly a strong female character, is the frequent subject of the male gaze, and furthermore cannot help herself from falling in love with Lelouch, who is a heartless cardboard cutout whose one redeeming feature is his fashion sense.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a show where nothing good ever really happens. I watched half the season and felt that anything this show was trying to make me feel was not worth feeling. Lelouch is not a lead deserving of my sympathies or attention - all of his choices are milked for utmost drama possible, not substance. Code Geass is like a hamfisted JV mecha version of Death Note.",

            "content": "This review is for that one guy, out of the entire crowd, who freaking hates this show, so I'm expecting some \"not helpful\" but I just HAD to write this. Decide if you want to give this anime a try after you read the entire review. You may add it as your favorite or hate it with your entire soul and body!\r\n&bull;Story: How many of you liked death note? Why? Because at some point you get that death note feeling. You know! The one where a guy has a super natural power that nobody but him and the one who gave him the power knowabout. And he tries to change the word, but there's this one guy who thinks they are friends when in fact they are enemies, etcetera etcetera. \\n\r\n           This show is death note, only with a more childish sound to it, and worst twists and plot.\\n\\n\r\n&bull;Art: The art was great, can't complain about much on that level, it's a matter of taste.\\n\\n\r\n&bull;Sound: The sound had it's ups and downs, but it didn't stand out as great, neither did it disappoint.\\n\\n\r\n&bull;Characters: Oh boy... This is where things really started to go downfall... the death note plot... yeah I can deal with it... but the characters, different story. \\n\r\n The fact that you get attached to a character for 12 episodes, and he is taken out in the most horrific way possible, and forgotten after only 1 episodes of their death, yeah that freaking pisses me off. It's like they didn't matter at all!\\n\r\n            The characters also suffer way to fast/dramatic changes! They go from right to left and from left to right in a matter of 3 minutes.\\n\\n\r\n&bull;Enjoyment: Until the middle of the series I quite enjoyed the series. It had some drama, a little bit of slice of life, some romance, it definitely had action and enough comedy to keep things cool. I found myself more than once very moved by certain events. \\n\r\n             Now this is where the crap stars! Keep in mind this is enjoyment not the story/art/sound or any other section. So, I'm at the final episodes, everything is going steady, something just pops out of nowhere that looks like it's going to end the series with a little bit of drama, but it will all end up in a good way. It's that type of happy ending, where you know some stuff is gonna happen before you get to it, but it's obvious it's gonna come and it's gonna be good. And as I expected, it came, everything was very good, a 4/5 star ending, beautiful. But then! Everything gets turned 360 degrees! Because of a stupid mistake, and no I don't mean a well calculated, well placed, well timed mistake, I mean DOWN RIGHT STUPID, OUTRAGEOUSLY STUPID, mistake that changes everything and ensures the most, rage worthy ending!\\n\\n\r\n&bull;Overall: Watch the show, you might find it very entertaining, it has some very good episodes that really stand out, but as I said, the ending screws up, big freaking time! And the second season is just an excuse to drag. As mentioned at the top, you might love it, you might hate it. I know I did.\\n",
