            "content": "We all have those series. Which for some unknown reason we can't help to love. We know we shouldn't, we know it's not good. But we can't help but watch the series and be totally entranced by it. Buso Renkin is that anime for me. It's a totally predictable, cliche, crony shonen anime. It's nothing new, it literally brings nothing new to the table, but I just can't help but love this series.   \r\nBuso Renkin is your typically shonen experience. It's got a main character who is given a power by another and mysteriously keeps powering up and doesn't ever seem tolose any of the battles he is in. This literally sums up Buso Renkin, it's fight after fight, power up after power up, but Kazuki doesn't ever seem to lose. Each episode for the most part does have some pretty humorous comedy in it. Just random outbursts by the characters ect...but it helps keep the action somewhat fresh. It's got some nice romance that develops along the way(I am a sucker for anything love related). One thing that was a let down was the action in this show. I have never been one to enjoy shonen's were it is just power ups and beat downs. There is one really amazing fight, where I can only imagine most of this anime's budget was spent. But the action isn't that good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this the show is still incredibly enjoyable. If I had to attribute why this show is so enjoyable, I would have to say it's the chemistry. Everything comes together so well, and I would have to say this show's main success is the pacing. It lays everything down in front of the viewer in a very logical coherent path. Nothing is ever rushed. Despite Kazuki gaining as many power ups as he does, it never feels overwhelming. It never feels like he is always meant to win, or that he is over powered. It feels like he is just growing. The show allows time for comedy, but it never forces it. It doesn't add comedy in dramatic moments for the effect of comedy, it simple puts comedy in places where it belongs. Even the relationship that starts to develop between Kazuki and Tokiko isn't forced. You really get to see the chemistry between these two characters grow and  you get the see the feelings manifest, something of which I did not expect to see in this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show's characters(Mainly Tokiko) also made me fall in love with this shows. While Kazuki isn't anything new in terms of characters, he certainly isn't bad. He is just a typical shonen good-guy. He wants to do what ever it takes to protect everyone around him, even if it means scarfing himself. However Tokiko is the real star of this show. She starts out, cold, brash, and filled with hatred. But by the end of the series she is, open, shy, and full of love to give. She truly goes through amazing development through the series. Most of it comes from being around Kazuki, and beginning to learn what it is to like to love and want to protect things dear to you. Now what made Tokiko so awesome in my eyes, to be blunt, was the fact that she was a badass. Screaming \"I will rip out your guys\" killing all the Homunculus in her sight, and to be honest, not to many people can sport a scar as hers and remain that sexy. Her personality and development just made her a truly enjoyable character. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, nothing changes with Buso Renkin though. It is still your predictable, cliche shonen series were the good guy always wins. This series brings nothing new to the table, but at the end of the day it's enjoyable. And that is all that really matters.  So if you are looking for a good action anime(That mixes several anime concepts), with some very awesome characters, and a good mix of comedy and romance. Then I suggest you try Buso Renkin.",

            "content": "Busou Renkin is a story that takes many of its elements from other anime.  You'll see elements of Fullmetal Alchemist, Ruroui Kenshin, Shakugan no Shana, Fate/Stay Night, and probably a bunch more.  Though Busou Renkin was developed by the creator of Rurouni Kenshin, Nobuhiro Watsuki, it is not as epic as the story of Kenshin was.  However, despite some of the obvious points of this series, Busou Renkin manages to uphold fairly well and be a relatively enjoying series.\r\nBusou Renkin means Arms Alchemy.  In this story, there are homunculi that are running about the land and its up to alchemic warriors,using these Arms Alchemy devices (which spring forth a weapon based on the users personality) to vanquish the homunculi.  This does sound a little bit familiar but Busou Renkin does manage to throw in its own elements and enough plot twists to keep it original.  Deep down, however, its still your run of the mill &quot;regular kid rising up out of nowhere to save the world&quot; theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is up to par with todays standards, but in some episodes however, you'll see it lacking.  Or rather, in some places and characters.  Otherwise, there isn't too much to complain of about the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and such in Busou Renkin isn't all that bad, but its also nothing spectacular.  The opening theme song is pretty catchy and the music scores during battles do raise your tension a bit, but what I found missing from this particular anime was that one, catchy song, piece of music that reels you in no matter what was happening in the anime.  And thus, at some points, I found myself losing concentration a different points in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNobuhiro Watsuki must have some kind of fetish with scars, because as with Kenshin, the main female protagonist here has a defining scar too (though the scar is not as important to the plotline as Kenshin's was).  Anyway, back to the characters.  Kazuki, the main male lead, is your typical hero who I found to be a little too perfect.  Without giving too much away, you can say it was hard to go against him in battles.  However, Kazuki was your only typical character.  Nobuhiro Watsuki has created a plethora of unique (and some rather a little *too* unique if you ask me) characters which is a nice change of pace from the norm.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a lot of Busou Renkin is pretty cliche and obvious as to what may happen.  The ending, in my taste, was a little too premature, in other words, it seemed as if it was put together forcefully to have that particular ending.  The pace of the story starts off rather quickly, immersing you immediately without giving all the details, but soon starts to slow back down to a reasonable pace. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a series that's 26 episodes long that's rather enjoyable to watch, but nothing &quot;eye-popping,&quot; as well as something with romance, Busou Renkin is something you definitely should check out.",

            "content": "EDIT: There is one thing i have to say. Watch the first three (or four) episodes, consisting of Papillon. If you enjoy them, continue watching. If you don't, stop watching. It's as simple as that.\r\nThe first three episodes is like the mini-arc going into the main arc, setting the scene, and making the expression known. If you do not enjoy the style (art, characters, all around) then you won't enjoy the rest. I'm not saying that it's all exactly like that, but it is enough to tell if you will like it or not.\r\nThis was a generally good anime. Though some of the aspects ofthe anime are stereotypical (Boy with strong convictions, girl who doesn't understand, fall in love when they understand eachother, etc.) there are some atypical points to it. And watching it along side by side with Shakugan No Shana has made it very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nFirst off; the Story is relatively good. Not great, but good. The plot goes along the lines of &quot;Hidden Monsters inside the City that we have to eliminate&quot;. Very stereotypical. They eat humans to survive, and they must prevent this. But, there's an added danger. Humans can become these homunculus creatures. Albeit they never actually take advantage of this added conflict, there is a point where it is used. I would've liked to have seen more of this aspect, to diverge itself from the other anime. If i could give this story an &quot;Average&quot; score, i would, because it's definitely an average story.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art was very impressive, and very flashy. The combat scenes were definitely Shounen, along with the other &quot;relaxing&quot; scenes, from the vibrant display of femininity in certain characters, all the way to the flashy display of masculine grittiness. I enjoyed the art sometimes more than the story, because a lot of the time they'd have pretty pictures to go along with the flashbacks that usually distracted me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nThe opening was fairly good, but nothing that inspired inspiration for me to watch it again, like Bleach or even Erementar Gerad. The ED sequences were fairly interesting, though by that time you're usually just wanting to go on to the next show (whether to see what happens, or in my case to get it over with).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7 (10 for Tokiko)\\n\r\nThe two main characters were interesting enough, but my favorite characters were the captain and tokiko. I enjoyed the captain because he strayed away from the typical &quot;I will do the right thing, in my own opinion&quot;, and went with &quot;I will do the right thing whether it hurts me or not&quot;. And, i enjoyed Tokiko because she went out of the stereotypical beautiful female lead, and was more masculine and gritty rather than perfectly manicured fingernails while weilding a sword. That was my favorite aspect of the characters, was that she was animated and voiced perfectly for the role she was in. I didn't like the submissiveness of the other characters, because it seemed like it was too convenient for the Writers. I give the general cast a 7, and Tokiko a 10.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8\\n\r\nOverall, it's fun to watch. To see how everything turns out. But that's why you watch them after episode 1, yes? There are plenty of good love scenes, mainly battle scenes, in all its purest Shounen. This was a great anime to watch on a sick day. It definitely makes you happier and in some cases it'll make you angry with &quot;The Man&quot;. So if you like action sequences and Dragon Ball Z style &quot;Levelling up because i am inspired&quot; sort of deal, then this is the Anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed this Anime, for its atypical points more than not, but frowned upon the easy plotline. This isn't as epic as Rurouni Kenshin, or as deep as some of the other anime developed by these people. Though, if you start watching this show past the third or fourth episode, you might start to enjoy it! Be warned! It is enjoyable as a whole, but not really much unique value. The best part, i will say, of this series is past episode 18. You think that after the first three episodes that the plotline is over (Which it could've been), then new circumstances arrive.\\n\\n\r\nI'll just leave you with this. Watch the first three episodes, if you like them, continue. If you don't. Stop.",

            "content": "Busou Renkin is an anime for those who are looking forward to see lots of action, great battles and a great variety of weapons and characters. So if you are a Naruto/Bleach fan you should watch this one, it will be for sure of your liking and probably (in some aspects) may be considered better than the previously named animes.\r\nThe story in this anime is pretty much straight forward, those of you who are familiar with Bleach plot will find the storyline very tentative and it will be very likely of your interest, being similar to Bleach's. A boy wakes up from a nighmare, inthis nightmare he protected a girl from a monster, but he was murdered in the process. Later on he realizes that he really died and that, what keeps him alive, is a alchemic artifact known as \"Kakugane\". Tokiko-san (the girl who saved him) explains that this artifact materializes it's warrior's battle instict into the form of a weapon, an arm, Arms Alchemy: Busou Renkin. The enemies here are called \"Humunculus\" (is this similar to Full Metal Alchemist by any chance?) and do have \"another type\" of alchemy power. This monsters have a strong appetite for humans because of the unconscious desire they have to recover the humanity they've losed. Then there are other more powerful enemies like Human-Humunculus (Humunculus with Busou Renkin powers), Alchemic warriors made into something similar to humunculus, you get the point. Similar indeed to Bleach's concept of Vizards, Hollows and Arrancars. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the story has a very common sequence, used in most action-shounen animes: you first got a treat to eliminate, you eliminate the enemies in episode one then another more powerful enemy comes in episode 2 and another and then another, the usual. But this sequence asures that the anime has a very wide range of characters which makes the story more interesting and worthwhile. It got it's twists, almost all being around the main character (Kazuki). This twists are what really will make you keep watching the anime to the end, because you will feel very attached to Kazuki, but not to any other character really.\\n\\n\r\nThe artistic design is in a very high level. The locations look very good, even when thay get destroyed, and believe me, this happens a lot. But on the other hand the character's design is a bit... gay. Characters like Papillon and Moonface really look like taken out from fairytales. If you have watched animes like Speed Grapher you will find the appereance of the characters (enemies specifically) very similar and probably like it, if not and you are planning on watching this then get used to it, but don't worry you will learn that this characters really are scary (excluding Poke-Moonface Mooooooooon! Definitely one of the most stupid character's I've seen.) \\n\\n\r\nContinuing on let's talk about the sound. I have to say that this anime's soundtrack rocks. The opening is superb and almost all sountracks are just the perfect match for the Busou Renkin concept. Without the appropiate music the battles really would have been boring but, actually, the strength of this anime lies here: the battle soundtracks are stunning, they do give the battles more drama and spice and definitely makes them feel really sort of heroic, far from being boring. The ambience themes are also perfectly inputted and give the peaceful / critical feeling depending the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are as various as episodes are in the anime. We've got personalities from idiotic and childish to sorrowful and really evil. Most of the characaters, as mentioned before, have a staraflarious look that doesn't escape from being stupid. But even so the personalities are not reflected by the looks. Take Papillon for instance: he may look like a butterfly, and some times act really gay but when he get's serious he really does look scary as hell. Every character has a different power (at least those who posses a Kakuganes). These powers are really original and different, are mainly represented as weapons. But actually each weapon have a different property, this properties go from high speed regeneration to gravity control, so really a wide difference between weapons.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the personalities itself I have to say it's impossible not to take notice Kazuki's stubborn and \"I wat to save everyone\" behavior. At some times the way he acts is really annoying but you will get used to it and, at the end, really love this character. Also these guy get's trashed really bad and, supposedly,  killed many times (I counted 4). But somehow he manages to stand up and win the fights, so we've got a hero that always wins and never gives up, even if he is supposed to be dead. A pretty often used model of character in modern Shounen animes to create sympathy around the main lead. The character development, again, only centres around Kazuki. He goes from having no powers to become the most powerful warrior in the Alchemic Society, and that progress does take time but still it gives a good amount of anxiety to go on watching it. Also note he always learns new techniques and, at some point, he unleases his real powers.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a pretty good example for an anime that is good, not perfect, has factors similar to other animes, and can still manage to deliver great fun and satisfaction. I really enjoyed watching Busou Renkin. It ended good and there was not need for more content after it's conclusion. I recommend it to anyone, it doesn't matter if you don't watch this kind of animes, because really it's just the same formula that other animes, like Bleach, use. But Bleach is popular isn't it?  So that means the formula works, it worked for me at least.   \\n",

            "content": "This is as good as neo shonen get. It's not too long, but not too short. Fuck Ichigo and Ed, Kazuki has his Kakugane on lock down. \"I'LL SPLATTER...YOUR GUTS!\"\r\nThis is an IIP- \"Impossible is possible\" anime. The story revolves around alchemy and although it is SUPER played out this anime does well of  lacking straying from any comparisons to FMA Quite frankly the only good plot in ALL of Shonen Jump's manga turned anime.\r\nThe art is pretty great. What would you expect from Nobuhiro Watsuki? I'm amazed that Xebec ACTUALLY did great designs. The fight scenes are quick, but leave you wanting more.The final fight between two epic characters is so brilliantly colored and shaded that it leaft nothing to be desired. The only problem I have is that some characters look plain. Mahiro looks so stereotypical... But Papillon is such a fresh character that he makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM in this anime is a bit bad. It goes in at the moments when not needed. (Romantic music AFTER Kazuki talks to Tokiko about his feelings) The dubs for both the Japanese and English are great, but my complaint is Tokiko. Her mouth flaps at the weiderst times in both dubs. She's not even talking at some points. It IS Viz after all.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are here. The pervert, the fat guy, the tranvestite, the love sick loser, the ditz, the tsundere, etc. They aren't really original, but they do their job. Plus, this is the only anime where I was pairing up characters.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime and well worth the 60 bucks on both sets. I highly recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Great plot that moves fast and doesn't leave you hanging.\\n\r\n- Papillon is the most vibrant character in history.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- The characters are a bit stereotypical.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is out now by Viz Media.",

One of the things that the story packs in a lot into each episode BUT it really flows. The plot twists are pretty good and there aren't many spots were things just seem too convenient, which a lot of anime tend to have. One thing that this story has that I really like is that the story has dark moments but also has good humor that lighten things somewhat. \r\nI try not to give away spoilers in reviews but This story is good soWATCH IT!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: Great animation in my opinion even though there isn't really anything that sticks out here the fight scenes are well done and character design is really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: They did really well on choosing voice actors!!! Everyone does well on voice acting which is suprising because usually there is usually at least one person that just drives you nuts with their voice but Busou Renkin does a good job of not having that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters are great in this anime! While the two main characters have similarities to Shakugan no Shana's two main character these two aren't nearly as annoying. Both characters are genuine and make since while the supporting characters are interesting and not worthless.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the characters was that the supporting characters had more air time BUT with the air time they did have its awesome so its very minor just it would've been nice to have a lil more character development on them\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really thought this anime was awesome because there wasn't any issues that really stuck out. There weren't any &quot;too convenient&quot; parts that were just out of no where. Also, due to the voice acting being good, you didn't have to deal with annoying voices that drew you away from the anime. The fights were interesting as well plus some of the parts of the series have you smiling from hwo things work out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: GREAT SERIES!!!! I just wish it would get more recognition because this is far better than shakugan no shana, which it is similar too.\\n\\n\r\nI def recommend this to anyone looking for a truly enjoyable anime.",

            "content": "The first thing to mention, is that Busou Renkin uses terms like \"alchemy\" and \"homunculus\". I want to make this clear, Busou Renkin is not a full metal alchemist rip-off. (because that's what I thought it was when I read the plot summary... boy was I wrong.)\r\nStory:\r\nBusou Renkin's story is fairly simple \"us\" vs \"them\" goodies vs baddies. But it's the way it's executed that makes the story great. Although there are not many actual plot twists as such (there are a few good ones, though) the plot manages to keep the viewer guessing. What's going to happen? Who is the main villain? How willthey defeat them? All these questions are asked, and depending on which episode your at, they have totally different answers. You might be able to guess where the series is going, but it'll jump in leaps and bounds. What might take another series 10 episodes to do, Busou Renkin does in 3. This is a good thing, because it means there is little filler in Busou Renkin, all the battles and every episode serves to progress the plot/characters. It's a well-lengthed series, that really ramps up at around episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOne thing to say on this. It's \"magnificent\". The battles are great, the CGI is well used, but more prominently are the character costumes. This anime has some of (if not the most) memorable characters ever... (although, those that have seen the series, sometimes wish they were not so memorable...)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe intro theme in particular is one of the most catchy, hot-blooded and awesome pieces of music in anime. The in-series sound effects are good, and likewise the voice acting. I couldn't fault the sound at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where the series shines. The characters are ... well. Words simply can't describe them without plunging into spoilers. Let's just say, the characters make the series. The are unique (which is a hard thing to do in modern anime) and there are enough of them for everyone to find at least 1 character to love or hate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBusou Renkin is a thoroughly enjoyable series. I could liken it to the comedic-yet-serious nature of Trigun or Kenshin, and I say it's one of the best. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's not for everyone, if you want a serious, dramatic anime, your out of luck here. But if you want a good, enjoyable, action packed, but believable anime, Busou Renkin is for you. It really must be watched, and then you can come to your own conclusions. But probably the biggest stand-out feature is how unique it is.",

            "content": "This isn't my favorite genre of anime with all it's magic action, but because this was like the anime that made me watch anime (I think it's called a bridge anime?) I thought I'd write a short review on it. I may be biased since it brings back memories of when I first started anime, but Busou Renkin was really enjoyable for me, and I think others should give it a try. Busou Renkin is actually a show more fit for kids - teens, not so much mature adults. \r\nStory: In the world that Busou Renkin takes place, there are monsters called homonculus, and thepower of alchemy. The protagonist, Mutou Kazuki is a normal high school student whose life changes forever one night when he died (stabbed in the heart) while trying to save a mysterious girl, Tokiko from a monster (a homonculus). Feeling guilty for his death, Tokiko saves Kazuki by replacing his heart with a kakugame, an item that contains the power of alchemy. It's revealed that Tokiko is an alchemist warrior that works for an alchemy organization that fights off homonculus's in order to protect the human race. Kazuki then joins the organization as an inexperienced rookie warrior filled with potential (but sort of rejects his role), and later as he goes through suffering and lots of crazy twists, Kazumi finally accepts who he is and his destiny (He gets a lot stronger). There are lots of action scenes, but in addition to that, there's normal school life, lots of funny comedy, and tragic mysteries that unravel beneath the surface of everything that goes on. The story isn't all that great or original, it's just your average shounen anime, but I really did enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't fantastic, but it's still good. I really really liked the portrayals of all the character, especially one of my favorite characters ever: Captain Bravo! The kakugane and the weapons that the alchemy forms were well drawn up. Art is so hard to grade...\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song for Busou Renkin was really energetic & exiting and it really set the mood before every episode. There were lots of great soundtracks during action, and sad scenes that elevated my sense of emotion. For example, \"Hoshi Akari\". One of my favorite anime soundtracks ever, made me tear up when it played. The voicing for each character was really nice, Captain Bravo had a deep voice~! \u2665\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Probably the best part of the anime was the diversity of a lot of highly enjoyable and likable characters. There were so many villains, but there really was no real bad guys. All the bad guys had a reason for their actions, they almost all have a tragic past, and there's just no character you can hate. I guess the main antagonist would have to be \"Koushaku Chouno\" who is one of the funniest, most-likeable villains ever. He honestly isn't all that evil. In fact, for most of the series he helps the main character because he doesn't want anyone else to defeat him; he wants to defeat Kazuki himself in a fair fight (they have a friendship developing beneath all the hatred). The good guys were all so likeably! Captain Bravo!! \u2665 Tokikok's character development was unbelievable as well as Kazumi's. Honestly nothing to dislike about the character's except for maybe Chouno's very disturbing cloth and nature. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable: A very solid anime. I'm going to have to re-watch it again to refresh my memory of it but I remember enjoying it so much that I decided to watch other anime. But there's no scary, psychological, or \"deep\" side to the anime, it's just pure enjoyment and comedy/action. The characters are all soooo likeable!",

I did and I was very pleased with this anime. It can relate to Bleach and Shakugan no Shana in several ways. In Busou Renkin, you have this boy (Mutou Kazuki) who has died trying to save this girl (Tokiko) who saved him by giving him the power of this kakugane. As I predicted, he wants to save everyone with this new power and protect the ones he loves.\r\nOf course he struggles and gets stubborn at sometimes but he grows stronger, not only his powers but his character too.\\n\\n\r\nThe story stays interesting and it has a couple of plot twists but it is worth watching. It has lots of action, some comedy, and romance. The characters are really cool. I liked Chouno the best because he has that dark, humorous side but can be caring when he wants.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 9 overall because the storyline is quite good, the characters are cool, I like the special abilities of the villians and they seem kinda cool too, the bonds the characters have with each other (mainly Tokiko and Kazuki and Kazuki and Chouno), and the action and comedy. Great series overall.",

            "content": "Buso Renkin is a fun show to watch. It does have a lot of the typical shonen elements that's to be expected: like the main character wanting to fight fight fight all so he can fulfill the glorious role as the noble \u201cprotector\u201d also there are those battles where they spend most of the time explaining how great each other's powers are and then of course pull that one \u201cmiracle move\u201d out of their ass. I never understood the point of all that fighting and explaining. Either way Buso Renkin has a lot of this and yet nonetheless I  found it enjoyable perhaps mainlybecause it could all be interpreted as making fun of itself as well as the entire Battle/Adventure genre. At times it is so damn tacky it's magnificent!\\n\\n\r\n~ Art\\n\r\nA little above standard as far as post millennial anime goes and as with most of these type of multi-fighter battle adventure anime you will see plenty of weapons and super-powers that  provide some incredible special f/x. With this show in particular the fights seem to be on a much larger scale with powers being a little too grand. That's why personally I prefer fighting shows where they have swords or use martial arts because the movements are smaller and more intricate and when animated properly, they can be ten times more amazing than this shit...i.e., Cowboy Bebop, Kenshin and Samurai Champloo just to name a few.  But some of the f/x in this show I was pretty impressed with, like most of the pyro f/x and also that one scene where like a million missiles were launched at the same time.\\n\\n\r\n~ Sound\\n\r\nHonestly? Not impressed. Right off the bat I'll tell you I had  an issue with the English voice cast on this one. While they sound cool they do not emotionally match up with the character's expressions. You can pick up on this instantly from episode 1, the dude gets stabbed thru the heart and yet he sounds like he's surfing on a boogie board? Dude! you just got stabbed thru the [effin] heart by a giant [bleeeeep] tentacle! you should be SCREAMING like bloody murder and sputtering and choking on blood, guts and shit...not go \"whooooooaaaaa\" like you're Keanu Reeves! And she, the heroine Tokiko, at this point calmly and coolly says \u201cThis wasn't supposed to happen...\u201d WTF reacts that way, seriously? Don't get me wrong the VA for Tokiko has a nice smooth voice but it's a total miscast for her to play this role. Though sophisticated it is a little too mature for a teenage voice....and I just think her emotional range is rather limited. Same for most of the other casting, they're good but they lack a certain amount of that genuineness or intensity as a particular scene may have required. \\n\r\nThe OP song is this totally sped up rubbish pop-wannabe-rock music stereotypical of shonen anime; couple this with the visuals of seeing that guy, whatshisface Kazuki, running around all amped up like some crack-head doofus with all this pseudo-aggression on his face was enough for me to skip the intro altogether. Both ED songs were decent but not enough to make you want to get the soundtrack or anything.\\n\\n\r\n~ Story\\n\r\nBuso Renkin has a pretty straightforward story: guy gets imbued with super-powers, guy meets nemesis, fights nemesis, of course saves the world [which is always in peril these days] and finally [...inevitably] gets the girl, the end. Typical fare for shonen-type anime which is usually a thinly veiled excuse to get all violent and fight and demonstrate superpowers. And of course there are the beach scenes and the fan-service, but the show is also very funny...I'll give it that.\\n\\n\r\n~ Characters\\n\r\nThis show has a pretty large cast of characters, and they are drawn in standard anime fashion. My favorite character hands-down is the Butterfly Dude [Papillon] he is a freak!  But there are many many more for you to choose from.\\n\\n\r\n~ The Verdict\\n\r\nIt's cute, and it has it's funny moments. Nothing epic but a great way to pass the time if you have nothing better to do. I would only buy this if it were on sale, otherwise Youtube or Crunchyroll.",

Buso Renkin is also written by the  authir of the highly acclaimed series, Rurouni Kenshin. Buso Renkin is an all around good anime. It isnt particularly expectional in any regard, but it doesnt have any glaring flaws. Finally, there are a few aspects about itthat make is refreshing compared to many of the other shounen battle anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is 26 episodes. No filler arcs, no slow paced episodes, it doesnt require you to watch hundreds of episodes, its tells a concise story in 26 episodes. If you dont like shounen battle anime because they are so long, this might be the shonen for you!\\n\\n\r\nIts main female character who supports the lead is an awesome character. She is strong, intelligent, has an intriguing origin, and is an all around bad-ass character. Shounen anime dont always offer the most compelling female leads, but Buso Renkin does.\\n\\n\r\nA simple aspect that you think would be standard, but it really isnt met in the shounen battle genre. There is a romance involving the main characters, the romance has an impact on the characters, and the romance actually progresses. Again, its not a romance anime, but having a little romance actually present during the main storyline is a refreshing aspects of Buso Renkin for me personally.\\n\\n\r\nI watched it on a whim due to my love for the classic shounen battle experience, and I was pleasantly suprised. The storyline has some interesting parts, I would almost compare it to Full metal Alchemist in some ways.\\n\\n\r\nBuso Renkin is a solid battle shounen, nothing more, nothing less. If you have the itch for another shounen, if your looking for a shounen that isnt incredibly long, or you just want another anime to watch that isnt too controversial, give Buso Renkin a shot.",

Just what you would expect of an action-genre anime. But what I think that makes this anime unique is  the absurd comedy scenes. I just can't stop laughing while watching this.What also makes it unique is how the idea of alchemy is applied in this anime. Onethat will watch this will surely enjoy it and I hope that they will enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nMutou Kazuki and Tokiko Tsumura are good progtagonists. Mutou Kazuki symbolizes a common protagonist, someone that is weak at first and then an incident changes his life that causes him to have powers. Tokiko is also a typical heroine, someone that will eventually fall for the main character.I also liked Chouno Koushaku(my favorite character), one of the antagonists of the story. I really like how he transformed from one that is just trying to survive to being one of the best antagonist I have seen in a while (though I'm not a fan of his mask and clothes :P)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is good. I have no problem with the plot. I also have no problem with the characters of this anime.I also liked the comedic scenes in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a score of 8 out of 10. If you're looking for something to watch, definitely watch this one. It's more than worth it!",

I mean i get how some newer viewers can have a jaded opinion about this anime cause they have seen a ton of similar shonen anime but if they give this a true chance they will find a great anime that had a lot of potential. This was definitely great for its time.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is pretty straight forward at first but takes an even more dangerous turn later on that really suprised me and helped me enjoy this more. Its not a hugely amazing story but its one of the better storiesin shonen. My only real issue with this is that i saw SO much more potential with this series if it expanded beyond just 26 eps but oh well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMan there were a good amout funny and good characters for a 26 ep series. Ill forus on the two leads though. Man Kazuki has one of my favorite Male MC personality. I love how hes a really driven, determined and funny MC. I know it sounds like there are a ton of him but its actually pretty rare to see a MC that has his type of charisma that pretty much influences all others. Also Tokiko, i just like her tough personality but i liked even more how she started to become a \"defrosting ice queen\" so to speak cause of the MC. They are pretty much one of my favorite \"Battle couple\" teams ( im using anime \"tropes\" incase your confused).\\n\\n\r\nOther:\\n\r\nAnyway the art and animation were pretty good for its time and the action was great at sertain areas and over all i enjoyed this a lot. If your pretty biased against shonen manga cause you seen so much then skip this but if enjoy older anime and can give every new series its own individual chance then id recommend this",

            "content": "Busou Renkin is a shounen anime. I don't really like shounen, and I started (and dropped) Busou Renkin in the past. Still, I recently decided to watch it again...\r\nI would say it is pretty much Shounen done right. Characters do not throw angsty fits, do not preach mid battle, there are plenty of comedic episodes inserted into the story, and fights do not last two episodes. Animation is quite fluid, even though art style is somewhat simple. There's nice music, and the whole thing feels believable, or even touching at times. It is much, much, much better than I expected.\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nStory - it isfairly simple/straightforward story about a school boy getting powers, meeting a companion and then fighting enemies. However what sets it apart is light-hearted handling of many scenes, many nicely done comedic moments. I would say the story finds just the right balance between drama/fights and slice of life elements. Rather than plot devices characters look like actually believable people, and for most of the time events that happen sorta make sense. So, while the story is relatively simple, straightforward and even stereotypical, it is quite pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is quite simple, however, the animation is of high quality. Even though characters have  fairly low amount of detail, they move very fluidly in most scenes. There's some CG that doens't *quite* match the 2d art, but it is tolerable enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMusic is generally nice, and opening theme is entertaining. The ending of the second half is interesting to listen to. It is not very memorable, but it works to complement the story. I would say it is slightly below the level of music in Keijo (where musical part was done perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are three or characters total that pull this anime through and make it memorable. Those are Tokiko, protagonist's sister Mahiro and one of the initial bad guys (with very interesting fashion sense). Tokiko is just plain adorable at times, and rather easy to sympathize with. As far as I can tell, she is supposed to be an archetype, but in the end rather than archetype she looks like a person, plus seiyuu did a great job voicing her. The second important character was mahiro, who mostly works as comedic relief, and even though does not really have much of a character on her own, she does a great job adding comedy when she arrives. And then there's bad guy with strange fashion sense....  \\n\r\nIn comparison to strong female lead, protagonist himself is rather generic \"shounen good guy protagonist\". Thankfully he isn't spineless, isn't perverted, doesn't preach too much, isn't prone for fits of angst, so for this kind of anime the character works quite well. However he is not very memorable by himself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI liked first half a bit more, since it had more of light-hearted episodes. The 2nd half for a while looked like it is about to devolve into standard cliched anime with drawn out fight, but it narrowly dodged it. Overall first 12 episodes were definitely more interesting for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIt is interesting to watch, mostly because of female lead and light comedy that often pops up across the series. The art is a bit low on detail, but it is compensated with very fluid animations, which makes the whole thing much more entertaining. Decent music, great voice acting on main heroine, and even though it is fairly cliched, the story was not boring.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend to check it out, if you have the time.",

            "content": "Intro to the Review: (skip 2 paragraphs to get into the review)\r\nAfter reading some of the reviews for this anime, I am somewhat surprised that many express the same thoughts: \"this anime was generic as heck, but I still love the darn anime and give it an 8 or higher!\" \r\nFor me, this anime should not receive anything higher than a 6 because it does not bring anything new to the table of overused concepts and cliches. Most, if not all anime, share some of the same concepts, but exceptionally good ones bring a twist to them that make it enjoyable. For this anime, notso much. However, I think those who like the anime might be due to the guy in the butterfly mask (in the anime cover picture), known as Papillon or Chouno in the anime. For more info on that, gloss over to my Character and Art portion. In the review below, I'll explain why this anime is \"mediocre\" and not \"very good\".\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt's pretty much like Bleach. Mysterious girl meets boy who saves her...girl gives guy immense power and later you get to meet the organization that she works for. What's different in this anime is that the organization is not as established as the one in Bleach. Instead of meeting a few of them little by little, you meet chunks of them in an episode, giving you time to barely care about them. You barely know about it and the rest of its members until more than halfway through the anime. And then there's the Kakugane (what every alchemist warrior in this show has) that has the ability to transform into a powerful weapon. What is so annoying about this is how the kakugane makes so much BS in the show and yet it is given the least explanation and care about it. But of course, how is our main protagonist going to power up if we can't add some random superpowers along the way? The comedy was stale, the fight scenes were somewhat boring, and there was less and less suspense as the show progressed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe first ED was the main reason why I wanted to watch this series. The song had a beautiful and sad melody to it and it felt poignant to me. This music didn't fit in with 95% of the anime, which was mainly filled with corny jokes, generic fight scenes, and nakama moments. The second ED and OP were cheesy, so it went with the anime. The OST in the anime is pretty much your typical shounen fight scene music. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe animation was consistent throughout the show; not noteworthy, but not poorly done a majority of the time. The setting in the beginning of the anime is in a generic school scene. What does make this anime memorable to most who have seen this anime would be the character design, most notably Papillon. Shown in the poster of this page, he is not your typical antagonist (at least in the fashion sense). His flamboyant attire is the only thing he's got going in terms of \"uniqueness\" and it overshadows the rest of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, let's start off with Papillion since that's what the show ever cares about (he even has the entire second ED to himself). At first, I thought he'd have a major impact in the story, but he's just there ...to be there in all of his bizarre glory. I swear that whoever made this story up made a character as flamboyant as he was just to hide the fact that the story is lackluster and offers nothing new in the shounen category. If you have seen HxH, he might remind you of Hisoka, an antagonist of a story whom several anime watchers might like because of his eccentric attitude, attire, personality, and strength. To me, Papillon gave me the feeling of, \"Oh, it's you again\" (kinda like Team Rocket) every time he appeared on the screen. I just feel like he is more like a moth than a butterfly...always flying over your head, making sure you don't forget about him. His personality and reason for going against the MC is so lame that sometimes you think the author just threw on a butterfly suit on him just to make him more appealing as a villain. If you pay attention enough, he'll say hypocrite whenever he appears.\\n\\n\r\nAll you need to know about the MC, Muto, is that he is the perfect mold of a shounen character: he's got the hair, the \"I gotta save the world without getting anyone killed\" catchphrase, the power to overpower anyone that overpowered him before in less than a month, and the ability to easily overcome life and death situations every time. You can't hate this guy as the MC, right? Right? One thing I do like about him is that he doesn't have a sad past like the common shounen character.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Tokiko, the blue-haired girl with a scar across her face. She's a stern and serious girl, but she's also very caring inside. I do give her credit though for being able to hold up in most of the fights she's been in, despite the fact that Muto has been doing the heavy lifting a majority of the anime. That's pretty much it about her. The rest of the characters felt so generic, forgettable, and disposable, that you get expected responses from Tokiko and Muto and you probably won't remember their names while watching the show. Like I said before, a chunk of characters get shoved in one episode and over a span of some episodes, making you go \"meh\" every time they show up on the screen. There's really nothing exciting about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nWhat was there to enjoy in this anime? The characters were boring and annoying, the comedy was cheesy and short-lived, and the battle animation was sub par. Just because it adhered to the typical shounen genre with the flashy battle scenes and added in some weird characters that didn't really belong in this show, I didn't enjoy it at all. It didn't excite me enough to want to continue to the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story, it's characters, and the art didn't captivate me. Things that annoyed me the most were the lack of good storytelling, disposable side characters who waste precious screentime and an ordinary MC who preaches the same thing, and convenient power ups that feel like a cheat to a game.",

It wasn't exactly what I expected to see and I was quiet excited to watch the series at first.\r\nThe idea is not bad, basicly we have Alchemic warriors who are killing human eating homonculus.\r\nSeries start with the main character accidently getting involved in the fight. However, later on he gets completly dedicated to this new job.\r\nWhat put me off is that somehow I couldn't get into the atmosphere and half naked villian who thinks he is beautiful and keeps making weird poses, doesn't really help. Or when he keeps wearing weird outfits, evenBurger cafe workers of the show couldn't handle it. Was thinking of dropping it several times.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, at around episode 9 when twins get introduced show actually starts to pick up. It starts to involve more things and actual story seems to just start. Since then show mostly kept getting better and you start to forget about some random stuff like Papillon's weird outfits.To be true, Papillon started to become really entertaining and different. He is not like your typical villian out there, weird outfits are part of his uniqness. Also more characters gets introduced and some of them are quiet fun, twins are part of that good cast.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being shounen series, we actually get some decent romance development which doesn't ruin the story. Characters start to grow in strengh and emotionaly. They start to change and you become more attached to them.\\n\\n\r\nI actually wanted to raise my mark till 8 but decided against it because of very cheesy ending. It is not bad, but not my type... so 7 it is.\\n\\n\r\nBasicly if the show still doesn't interest you after episode 10 (small twin arc), series are not meant for you then. But you have to be patient and eventually your patience will be payed off.",

            "content": "We all have those series. Which for some unknown reason we can't help to love. We know we shouldn't, we know it's not good. But we can't help but watch the series and be totally entranced by it. Buso Renkin is that anime for me. It's a totally predictable, cliche, crony shonen anime. It's nothing new, it literally brings nothing new to the table, but I just can't help but love this series.   \r\nBuso Renkin is your typically shonen experience. It's got a main character who is given a power by another and mysteriously keeps powering up and doesn't ever seem tolose any of the battles he is in. This literally sums up Buso Renkin, it's fight after fight, power up after power up, but Kazuki doesn't ever seem to lose. Each episode for the most part does have some pretty humorous comedy in it. Just random outbursts by the characters ect...but it helps keep the action somewhat fresh. It's got some nice romance that develops along the way(I am a sucker for anything love related). One thing that was a let down was the action in this show. I have never been one to enjoy shonen's were it is just power ups and beat downs. There is one really amazing fight, where I can only imagine most of this anime's budget was spent. But the action isn't that good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this the show is still incredibly enjoyable. If I had to attribute why this show is so enjoyable, I would have to say it's the chemistry. Everything comes together so well, and I would have to say this show's main success is the pacing. It lays everything down in front of the viewer in a very logical coherent path. Nothing is ever rushed. Despite Kazuki gaining as many power ups as he does, it never feels overwhelming. It never feels like he is always meant to win, or that he is over powered. It feels like he is just growing. The show allows time for comedy, but it never forces it. It doesn't add comedy in dramatic moments for the effect of comedy, it simple puts comedy in places where it belongs. Even the relationship that starts to develop between Kazuki and Tokiko isn't forced. You really get to see the chemistry between these two characters grow and  you get the see the feelings manifest, something of which I did not expect to see in this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show's characters(Mainly Tokiko) also made me fall in love with this shows. While Kazuki isn't anything new in terms of characters, he certainly isn't bad. He is just a typical shonen good-guy. He wants to do what ever it takes to protect everyone around him, even if it means scarfing himself. However Tokiko is the real star of this show. She starts out, cold, brash, and filled with hatred. But by the end of the series she is, open, shy, and full of love to give. She truly goes through amazing development through the series. Most of it comes from being around Kazuki, and beginning to learn what it is to like to love and want to protect things dear to you. Now what made Tokiko so awesome in my eyes, to be blunt, was the fact that she was a badass. Screaming \"I will rip out your guys\" killing all the Homunculus in her sight, and to be honest, not to many people can sport a scar as hers and remain that sexy. Her personality and development just made her a truly enjoyable character. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, nothing changes with Buso Renkin though. It is still your predictable, cliche shonen series were the good guy always wins. This series brings nothing new to the table, but at the end of the day it's enjoyable. And that is all that really matters.  So if you are looking for a good action anime(That mixes several anime concepts), with some very awesome characters, and a good mix of comedy and romance. Then I suggest you try Buso Renkin.",

            "content": "Busou Renkin is a story that takes many of its elements from other anime.  You'll see elements of Fullmetal Alchemist, Ruroui Kenshin, Shakugan no Shana, Fate/Stay Night, and probably a bunch more.  Though Busou Renkin was developed by the creator of Rurouni Kenshin, Nobuhiro Watsuki, it is not as epic as the story of Kenshin was.  However, despite some of the obvious points of this series, Busou Renkin manages to uphold fairly well and be a relatively enjoying series.\r\nBusou Renkin means Arms Alchemy.  In this story, there are homunculi that are running about the land and its up to alchemic warriors,using these Arms Alchemy devices (which spring forth a weapon based on the users personality) to vanquish the homunculi.  This does sound a little bit familiar but Busou Renkin does manage to throw in its own elements and enough plot twists to keep it original.  Deep down, however, its still your run of the mill &quot;regular kid rising up out of nowhere to save the world&quot; theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is up to par with todays standards, but in some episodes however, you'll see it lacking.  Or rather, in some places and characters.  Otherwise, there isn't too much to complain of about the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and such in Busou Renkin isn't all that bad, but its also nothing spectacular.  The opening theme song is pretty catchy and the music scores during battles do raise your tension a bit, but what I found missing from this particular anime was that one, catchy song, piece of music that reels you in no matter what was happening in the anime.  And thus, at some points, I found myself losing concentration a different points in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNobuhiro Watsuki must have some kind of fetish with scars, because as with Kenshin, the main female protagonist here has a defining scar too (though the scar is not as important to the plotline as Kenshin's was).  Anyway, back to the characters.  Kazuki, the main male lead, is your typical hero who I found to be a little too perfect.  Without giving too much away, you can say it was hard to go against him in battles.  However, Kazuki was your only typical character.  Nobuhiro Watsuki has created a plethora of unique (and some rather a little *too* unique if you ask me) characters which is a nice change of pace from the norm.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a lot of Busou Renkin is pretty cliche and obvious as to what may happen.  The ending, in my taste, was a little too premature, in other words, it seemed as if it was put together forcefully to have that particular ending.  The pace of the story starts off rather quickly, immersing you immediately without giving all the details, but soon starts to slow back down to a reasonable pace. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a series that's 26 episodes long that's rather enjoyable to watch, but nothing &quot;eye-popping,&quot; as well as something with romance, Busou Renkin is something you definitely should check out.",

            "content": "EDIT: There is one thing i have to say. Watch the first three (or four) episodes, consisting of Papillon. If you enjoy them, continue watching. If you don't, stop watching. It's as simple as that.\r\nThe first three episodes is like the mini-arc going into the main arc, setting the scene, and making the expression known. If you do not enjoy the style (art, characters, all around) then you won't enjoy the rest. I'm not saying that it's all exactly like that, but it is enough to tell if you will like it or not.\r\nThis was a generally good anime. Though some of the aspects ofthe anime are stereotypical (Boy with strong convictions, girl who doesn't understand, fall in love when they understand eachother, etc.) there are some atypical points to it. And watching it along side by side with Shakugan No Shana has made it very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nFirst off; the Story is relatively good. Not great, but good. The plot goes along the lines of &quot;Hidden Monsters inside the City that we have to eliminate&quot;. Very stereotypical. They eat humans to survive, and they must prevent this. But, there's an added danger. Humans can become these homunculus creatures. Albeit they never actually take advantage of this added conflict, there is a point where it is used. I would've liked to have seen more of this aspect, to diverge itself from the other anime. If i could give this story an &quot;Average&quot; score, i would, because it's definitely an average story.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art was very impressive, and very flashy. The combat scenes were definitely Shounen, along with the other &quot;relaxing&quot; scenes, from the vibrant display of femininity in certain characters, all the way to the flashy display of masculine grittiness. I enjoyed the art sometimes more than the story, because a lot of the time they'd have pretty pictures to go along with the flashbacks that usually distracted me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nThe opening was fairly good, but nothing that inspired inspiration for me to watch it again, like Bleach or even Erementar Gerad. The ED sequences were fairly interesting, though by that time you're usually just wanting to go on to the next show (whether to see what happens, or in my case to get it over with).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7 (10 for Tokiko)\\n\r\nThe two main characters were interesting enough, but my favorite characters were the captain and tokiko. I enjoyed the captain because he strayed away from the typical &quot;I will do the right thing, in my own opinion&quot;, and went with &quot;I will do the right thing whether it hurts me or not&quot;. And, i enjoyed Tokiko because she went out of the stereotypical beautiful female lead, and was more masculine and gritty rather than perfectly manicured fingernails while weilding a sword. That was my favorite aspect of the characters, was that she was animated and voiced perfectly for the role she was in. I didn't like the submissiveness of the other characters, because it seemed like it was too convenient for the Writers. I give the general cast a 7, and Tokiko a 10.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8\\n\r\nOverall, it's fun to watch. To see how everything turns out. But that's why you watch them after episode 1, yes? There are plenty of good love scenes, mainly battle scenes, in all its purest Shounen. This was a great anime to watch on a sick day. It definitely makes you happier and in some cases it'll make you angry with &quot;The Man&quot;. So if you like action sequences and Dragon Ball Z style &quot;Levelling up because i am inspired&quot; sort of deal, then this is the Anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed this Anime, for its atypical points more than not, but frowned upon the easy plotline. This isn't as epic as Rurouni Kenshin, or as deep as some of the other anime developed by these people. Though, if you start watching this show past the third or fourth episode, you might start to enjoy it! Be warned! It is enjoyable as a whole, but not really much unique value. The best part, i will say, of this series is past episode 18. You think that after the first three episodes that the plotline is over (Which it could've been), then new circumstances arrive.\\n\\n\r\nI'll just leave you with this. Watch the first three episodes, if you like them, continue. If you don't. Stop.",

            "content": "Busou Renkin is an anime for those who are looking forward to see lots of action, great battles and a great variety of weapons and characters. So if you are a Naruto/Bleach fan you should watch this one, it will be for sure of your liking and probably (in some aspects) may be considered better than the previously named animes.\r\nThe story in this anime is pretty much straight forward, those of you who are familiar with Bleach plot will find the storyline very tentative and it will be very likely of your interest, being similar to Bleach's. A boy wakes up from a nighmare, inthis nightmare he protected a girl from a monster, but he was murdered in the process. Later on he realizes that he really died and that, what keeps him alive, is a alchemic artifact known as \"Kakugane\". Tokiko-san (the girl who saved him) explains that this artifact materializes it's warrior's battle instict into the form of a weapon, an arm, Arms Alchemy: Busou Renkin. The enemies here are called \"Humunculus\" (is this similar to Full Metal Alchemist by any chance?) and do have \"another type\" of alchemy power. This monsters have a strong appetite for humans because of the unconscious desire they have to recover the humanity they've losed. Then there are other more powerful enemies like Human-Humunculus (Humunculus with Busou Renkin powers), Alchemic warriors made into something similar to humunculus, you get the point. Similar indeed to Bleach's concept of Vizards, Hollows and Arrancars. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the story has a very common sequence, used in most action-shounen animes: you first got a treat to eliminate, you eliminate the enemies in episode one then another more powerful enemy comes in episode 2 and another and then another, the usual. But this sequence asures that the anime has a very wide range of characters which makes the story more interesting and worthwhile. It got it's twists, almost all being around the main character (Kazuki). This twists are what really will make you keep watching the anime to the end, because you will feel very attached to Kazuki, but not to any other character really.\\n\\n\r\nThe artistic design is in a very high level. The locations look very good, even when thay get destroyed, and believe me, this happens a lot. But on the other hand the character's design is a bit... gay. Characters like Papillon and Moonface really look like taken out from fairytales. If you have watched animes like Speed Grapher you will find the appereance of the characters (enemies specifically) very similar and probably like it, if not and you are planning on watching this then get used to it, but don't worry you will learn that this characters really are scary (excluding Poke-Moonface Mooooooooon! Definitely one of the most stupid character's I've seen.) \\n\\n\r\nContinuing on let's talk about the sound. I have to say that this anime's soundtrack rocks. The opening is superb and almost all sountracks are just the perfect match for the Busou Renkin concept. Without the appropiate music the battles really would have been boring but, actually, the strength of this anime lies here: the battle soundtracks are stunning, they do give the battles more drama and spice and definitely makes them feel really sort of heroic, far from being boring. The ambience themes are also perfectly inputted and give the peaceful / critical feeling depending the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are as various as episodes are in the anime. We've got personalities from idiotic and childish to sorrowful and really evil. Most of the characaters, as mentioned before, have a staraflarious look that doesn't escape from being stupid. But even so the personalities are not reflected by the looks. Take Papillon for instance: he may look like a butterfly, and some times act really gay but when he get's serious he really does look scary as hell. Every character has a different power (at least those who posses a Kakuganes). These powers are really original and different, are mainly represented as weapons. But actually each weapon have a different property, this properties go from high speed regeneration to gravity control, so really a wide difference between weapons.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the personalities itself I have to say it's impossible not to take notice Kazuki's stubborn and \"I wat to save everyone\" behavior. At some times the way he acts is really annoying but you will get used to it and, at the end, really love this character. Also these guy get's trashed really bad and, supposedly,  killed many times (I counted 4). But somehow he manages to stand up and win the fights, so we've got a hero that always wins and never gives up, even if he is supposed to be dead. A pretty often used model of character in modern Shounen animes to create sympathy around the main lead. The character development, again, only centres around Kazuki. He goes from having no powers to become the most powerful warrior in the Alchemic Society, and that progress does take time but still it gives a good amount of anxiety to go on watching it. Also note he always learns new techniques and, at some point, he unleases his real powers.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a pretty good example for an anime that is good, not perfect, has factors similar to other animes, and can still manage to deliver great fun and satisfaction. I really enjoyed watching Busou Renkin. It ended good and there was not need for more content after it's conclusion. I recommend it to anyone, it doesn't matter if you don't watch this kind of animes, because really it's just the same formula that other animes, like Bleach, use. But Bleach is popular isn't it?  So that means the formula works, it worked for me at least.   \\n",

            "content": "This is as good as neo shonen get. It's not too long, but not too short. Fuck Ichigo and Ed, Kazuki has his Kakugane on lock down. \"I'LL SPLATTER...YOUR GUTS!\"\r\nThis is an IIP- \"Impossible is possible\" anime. The story revolves around alchemy and although it is SUPER played out this anime does well of  lacking straying from any comparisons to FMA Quite frankly the only good plot in ALL of Shonen Jump's manga turned anime.\r\nThe art is pretty great. What would you expect from Nobuhiro Watsuki? I'm amazed that Xebec ACTUALLY did great designs. The fight scenes are quick, but leave you wanting more.The final fight between two epic characters is so brilliantly colored and shaded that it leaft nothing to be desired. The only problem I have is that some characters look plain. Mahiro looks so stereotypical... But Papillon is such a fresh character that he makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM in this anime is a bit bad. It goes in at the moments when not needed. (Romantic music AFTER Kazuki talks to Tokiko about his feelings) The dubs for both the Japanese and English are great, but my complaint is Tokiko. Her mouth flaps at the weiderst times in both dubs. She's not even talking at some points. It IS Viz after all.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters are here. The pervert, the fat guy, the tranvestite, the love sick loser, the ditz, the tsundere, etc. They aren't really original, but they do their job. Plus, this is the only anime where I was pairing up characters.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime and well worth the 60 bucks on both sets. I highly recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Great plot that moves fast and doesn't leave you hanging.\\n\r\n- Papillon is the most vibrant character in history.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- The characters are a bit stereotypical.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is out now by Viz Media.",

One of the things that the story packs in a lot into each episode BUT it really flows. The plot twists are pretty good and there aren't many spots were things just seem too convenient, which a lot of anime tend to have. One thing that this story has that I really like is that the story has dark moments but also has good humor that lighten things somewhat. \r\nI try not to give away spoilers in reviews but This story is good soWATCH IT!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: Great animation in my opinion even though there isn't really anything that sticks out here the fight scenes are well done and character design is really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: They did really well on choosing voice actors!!! Everyone does well on voice acting which is suprising because usually there is usually at least one person that just drives you nuts with their voice but Busou Renkin does a good job of not having that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters are great in this anime! While the two main characters have similarities to Shakugan no Shana's two main character these two aren't nearly as annoying. Both characters are genuine and make since while the supporting characters are interesting and not worthless.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the characters was that the supporting characters had more air time BUT with the air time they did have its awesome so its very minor just it would've been nice to have a lil more character development on them\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really thought this anime was awesome because there wasn't any issues that really stuck out. There weren't any &quot;too convenient&quot; parts that were just out of no where. Also, due to the voice acting being good, you didn't have to deal with annoying voices that drew you away from the anime. The fights were interesting as well plus some of the parts of the series have you smiling from hwo things work out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: GREAT SERIES!!!! I just wish it would get more recognition because this is far better than shakugan no shana, which it is similar too.\\n\\n\r\nI def recommend this to anyone looking for a truly enjoyable anime.",

            "content": "The first thing to mention, is that Busou Renkin uses terms like \"alchemy\" and \"homunculus\". I want to make this clear, Busou Renkin is not a full metal alchemist rip-off. (because that's what I thought it was when I read the plot summary... boy was I wrong.)\r\nStory:\r\nBusou Renkin's story is fairly simple \"us\" vs \"them\" goodies vs baddies. But it's the way it's executed that makes the story great. Although there are not many actual plot twists as such (there are a few good ones, though) the plot manages to keep the viewer guessing. What's going to happen? Who is the main villain? How willthey defeat them? All these questions are asked, and depending on which episode your at, they have totally different answers. You might be able to guess where the series is going, but it'll jump in leaps and bounds. What might take another series 10 episodes to do, Busou Renkin does in 3. This is a good thing, because it means there is little filler in Busou Renkin, all the battles and every episode serves to progress the plot/characters. It's a well-lengthed series, that really ramps up at around episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOne thing to say on this. It's \"magnificent\". The battles are great, the CGI is well used, but more prominently are the character costumes. This anime has some of (if not the most) memorable characters ever... (although, those that have seen the series, sometimes wish they were not so memorable...)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe intro theme in particular is one of the most catchy, hot-blooded and awesome pieces of music in anime. The in-series sound effects are good, and likewise the voice acting. I couldn't fault the sound at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where the series shines. The characters are ... well. Words simply can't describe them without plunging into spoilers. Let's just say, the characters make the series. The are unique (which is a hard thing to do in modern anime) and there are enough of them for everyone to find at least 1 character to love or hate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBusou Renkin is a thoroughly enjoyable series. I could liken it to the comedic-yet-serious nature of Trigun or Kenshin, and I say it's one of the best. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's not for everyone, if you want a serious, dramatic anime, your out of luck here. But if you want a good, enjoyable, action packed, but believable anime, Busou Renkin is for you. It really must be watched, and then you can come to your own conclusions. But probably the biggest stand-out feature is how unique it is.",

            "content": "This isn't my favorite genre of anime with all it's magic action, but because this was like the anime that made me watch anime (I think it's called a bridge anime?) I thought I'd write a short review on it. I may be biased since it brings back memories of when I first started anime, but Busou Renkin was really enjoyable for me, and I think others should give it a try. Busou Renkin is actually a show more fit for kids - teens, not so much mature adults. \r\nStory: In the world that Busou Renkin takes place, there are monsters called homonculus, and thepower of alchemy. The protagonist, Mutou Kazuki is a normal high school student whose life changes forever one night when he died (stabbed in the heart) while trying to save a mysterious girl, Tokiko from a monster (a homonculus). Feeling guilty for his death, Tokiko saves Kazuki by replacing his heart with a kakugame, an item that contains the power of alchemy. It's revealed that Tokiko is an alchemist warrior that works for an alchemy organization that fights off homonculus's in order to protect the human race. Kazuki then joins the organization as an inexperienced rookie warrior filled with potential (but sort of rejects his role), and later as he goes through suffering and lots of crazy twists, Kazumi finally accepts who he is and his destiny (He gets a lot stronger). There are lots of action scenes, but in addition to that, there's normal school life, lots of funny comedy, and tragic mysteries that unravel beneath the surface of everything that goes on. The story isn't all that great or original, it's just your average shounen anime, but I really did enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't fantastic, but it's still good. I really really liked the portrayals of all the character, especially one of my favorite characters ever: Captain Bravo! The kakugane and the weapons that the alchemy forms were well drawn up. Art is so hard to grade...\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song for Busou Renkin was really energetic & exiting and it really set the mood before every episode. There were lots of great soundtracks during action, and sad scenes that elevated my sense of emotion. For example, \"Hoshi Akari\". One of my favorite anime soundtracks ever, made me tear up when it played. The voicing for each character was really nice, Captain Bravo had a deep voice~! \u2665\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Probably the best part of the anime was the diversity of a lot of highly enjoyable and likable characters. There were so many villains, but there really was no real bad guys. All the bad guys had a reason for their actions, they almost all have a tragic past, and there's just no character you can hate. I guess the main antagonist would have to be \"Koushaku Chouno\" who is one of the funniest, most-likeable villains ever. He honestly isn't all that evil. In fact, for most of the series he helps the main character because he doesn't want anyone else to defeat him; he wants to defeat Kazuki himself in a fair fight (they have a friendship developing beneath all the hatred). The good guys were all so likeably! Captain Bravo!! \u2665 Tokikok's character development was unbelievable as well as Kazumi's. Honestly nothing to dislike about the character's except for maybe Chouno's very disturbing cloth and nature. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable: A very solid anime. I'm going to have to re-watch it again to refresh my memory of it but I remember enjoying it so much that I decided to watch other anime. But there's no scary, psychological, or \"deep\" side to the anime, it's just pure enjoyment and comedy/action. The characters are all soooo likeable!",

I did and I was very pleased with this anime. It can relate to Bleach and Shakugan no Shana in several ways. In Busou Renkin, you have this boy (Mutou Kazuki) who has died trying to save this girl (Tokiko) who saved him by giving him the power of this kakugane. As I predicted, he wants to save everyone with this new power and protect the ones he loves.\r\nOf course he struggles and gets stubborn at sometimes but he grows stronger, not only his powers but his character too.\\n\\n\r\nThe story stays interesting and it has a couple of plot twists but it is worth watching. It has lots of action, some comedy, and romance. The characters are really cool. I liked Chouno the best because he has that dark, humorous side but can be caring when he wants.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 9 overall because the storyline is quite good, the characters are cool, I like the special abilities of the villians and they seem kinda cool too, the bonds the characters have with each other (mainly Tokiko and Kazuki and Kazuki and Chouno), and the action and comedy. Great series overall.",

            "content": "Buso Renkin is a fun show to watch. It does have a lot of the typical shonen elements that's to be expected: like the main character wanting to fight fight fight all so he can fulfill the glorious role as the noble \u201cprotector\u201d also there are those battles where they spend most of the time explaining how great each other's powers are and then of course pull that one \u201cmiracle move\u201d out of their ass. I never understood the point of all that fighting and explaining. Either way Buso Renkin has a lot of this and yet nonetheless I  found it enjoyable perhaps mainlybecause it could all be interpreted as making fun of itself as well as the entire Battle/Adventure genre. At times it is so damn tacky it's magnificent!\\n\\n\r\n~ Art\\n\r\nA little above standard as far as post millennial anime goes and as with most of these type of multi-fighter battle adventure anime you will see plenty of weapons and super-powers that  provide some incredible special f/x. With this show in particular the fights seem to be on a much larger scale with powers being a little too grand. That's why personally I prefer fighting shows where they have swords or use martial arts because the movements are smaller and more intricate and when animated properly, they can be ten times more amazing than this shit...i.e., Cowboy Bebop, Kenshin and Samurai Champloo just to name a few.  But some of the f/x in this show I was pretty impressed with, like most of the pyro f/x and also that one scene where like a million missiles were launched at the same time.\\n\\n\r\n~ Sound\\n\r\nHonestly? Not impressed. Right off the bat I'll tell you I had  an issue with the English voice cast on this one. While they sound cool they do not emotionally match up with the character's expressions. You can pick up on this instantly from episode 1, the dude gets stabbed thru the heart and yet he sounds like he's surfing on a boogie board? Dude! you just got stabbed thru the [effin] heart by a giant [bleeeeep] tentacle! you should be SCREAMING like bloody murder and sputtering and choking on blood, guts and shit...not go \"whooooooaaaaa\" like you're Keanu Reeves! And she, the heroine Tokiko, at this point calmly and coolly says \u201cThis wasn't supposed to happen...\u201d WTF reacts that way, seriously? Don't get me wrong the VA for Tokiko has a nice smooth voice but it's a total miscast for her to play this role. Though sophisticated it is a little too mature for a teenage voice....and I just think her emotional range is rather limited. Same for most of the other casting, they're good but they lack a certain amount of that genuineness or intensity as a particular scene may have required. \\n\r\nThe OP song is this totally sped up rubbish pop-wannabe-rock music stereotypical of shonen anime; couple this with the visuals of seeing that guy, whatshisface Kazuki, running around all amped up like some crack-head doofus with all this pseudo-aggression on his face was enough for me to skip the intro altogether. Both ED songs were decent but not enough to make you want to get the soundtrack or anything.\\n\\n\r\n~ Story\\n\r\nBuso Renkin has a pretty straightforward story: guy gets imbued with super-powers, guy meets nemesis, fights nemesis, of course saves the world [which is always in peril these days] and finally [...inevitably] gets the girl, the end. Typical fare for shonen-type anime which is usually a thinly veiled excuse to get all violent and fight and demonstrate superpowers. And of course there are the beach scenes and the fan-service, but the show is also very funny...I'll give it that.\\n\\n\r\n~ Characters\\n\r\nThis show has a pretty large cast of characters, and they are drawn in standard anime fashion. My favorite character hands-down is the Butterfly Dude [Papillon] he is a freak!  But there are many many more for you to choose from.\\n\\n\r\n~ The Verdict\\n\r\nIt's cute, and it has it's funny moments. Nothing epic but a great way to pass the time if you have nothing better to do. I would only buy this if it were on sale, otherwise Youtube or Crunchyroll.",

It has a heroic- high school age protagonist, a large cast of fun characters with extraordinary abilities, it has interesting villains, it will include moments of laughter and moments of tragedy, and it has epic fight scenes. Buso Renkin is also written by the  authir of the highly acclaimed series, Rurouni Kenshin. Buso Renkin is an all around good anime. It isnt particularly expectional in any regard, but it doesnt have any glaring flaws. Finally, there are a few aspects about itthat make is refreshing compared to many of the other shounen battle anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is 26 episodes. No filler arcs, no slow paced episodes, it doesnt require you to watch hundreds of episodes, its tells a concise story in 26 episodes. If you dont like shounen battle anime because they are so long, this might be the shonen for you!\\n\\n\r\nIts main female character who supports the lead is an awesome character. She is strong, intelligent, has an intriguing origin, and is an all around bad-ass character. Shounen anime dont always offer the most compelling female leads, but Buso Renkin does.\\n\\n\r\nA simple aspect that you think would be standard, but it really isnt met in the shounen battle genre. There is a romance involving the main characters, the romance has an impact on the characters, and the romance actually progresses. Again, its not a romance anime, but having a little romance actually present during the main storyline is a refreshing aspects of Buso Renkin for me personally.\\n\\n\r\nI watched it on a whim due to my love for the classic shounen battle experience, and I was pleasantly suprised. The storyline has some interesting parts, I would almost compare it to Full metal Alchemist in some ways.\\n\\n\r\nBuso Renkin is a solid battle shounen, nothing more, nothing less. If you have the itch for another shounen, if your looking for a shounen that isnt incredibly long, or you just want another anime to watch that isnt too controversial, give Buso Renkin a shot.",

            "content": "My first review ^_____^\r\nI have no idea on what to expect on this anime before I watched it since I don't really know this title.\r\nNow I'm glad I watched this.\r\nThe story is typical with the action genre, putting emphasis on battle scenes rather than the plot of the story.The action scenes are good, but not that extraordinary. Just what you would expect of an action-genre anime. But what I think that makes this anime unique is  the absurd comedy scenes. I just can't stop laughing while watching this.What also makes it unique is how the idea of alchemy is applied in this anime. Onethat will watch this will surely enjoy it and I hope that they will enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nMutou Kazuki and Tokiko Tsumura are good progtagonists. Mutou Kazuki symbolizes a common protagonist, someone that is weak at first and then an incident changes his life that causes him to have powers. Tokiko is also a typical heroine, someone that will eventually fall for the main character.I also liked Chouno Koushaku(my favorite character), one of the antagonists of the story. I really like how he transformed from one that is just trying to survive to being one of the best antagonist I have seen in a while (though I'm not a fan of his mask and clothes :P)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is good. I have no problem with the plot. I also have no problem with the characters of this anime.I also liked the comedic scenes in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a score of 8 out of 10. If you're looking for something to watch, definitely watch this one. It's more than worth it!",

            "content": "Man This is definitely in my list of Top 20 favorite shonen Anime. I mean i get how some newer viewers can have a jaded opinion about this anime cause they have seen a ton of similar shonen anime but if they give this a true chance they will find a great anime that had a lot of potential. This was definitely great for its time.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is pretty straight forward at first but takes an even more dangerous turn later on that really suprised me and helped me enjoy this more. Its not a hugely amazing story but its one of the better storiesin shonen. My only real issue with this is that i saw SO much more potential with this series if it expanded beyond just 26 eps but oh well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMan there were a good amout funny and good characters for a 26 ep series. Ill forus on the two leads though. Man Kazuki has one of my favorite Male MC personality. I love how hes a really driven, determined and funny MC. I know it sounds like there are a ton of him but its actually pretty rare to see a MC that has his type of charisma that pretty much influences all others. Also Tokiko, i just like her tough personality but i liked even more how she started to become a \"defrosting ice queen\" so to speak cause of the MC. They are pretty much one of my favorite \"Battle couple\" teams ( im using anime \"tropes\" incase your confused).\\n\\n\r\nOther:\\n\r\nAnyway the art and animation were pretty good for its time and the action was great at sertain areas and over all i enjoyed this a lot. If your pretty biased against shonen manga cause you seen so much then skip this but if enjoy older anime and can give every new series its own individual chance then id recommend this",

            "content": "Busou Renkin is a shounen anime. I don't really like shounen, and I started (and dropped) Busou Renkin in the past. Still, I recently decided to watch it again...\r\nI would say it is pretty much Shounen done right. Characters do not throw angsty fits, do not preach mid battle, there are plenty of comedic episodes inserted into the story, and fights do not last two episodes. Animation is quite fluid, even though art style is somewhat simple. There's nice music, and the whole thing feels believable, or even touching at times. It is much, much, much better than I expected.\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nStory - it isfairly simple/straightforward story about a school boy getting powers, meeting a companion and then fighting enemies. However what sets it apart is light-hearted handling of many scenes, many nicely done comedic moments. I would say the story finds just the right balance between drama/fights and slice of life elements. Rather than plot devices characters look like actually believable people, and for most of the time events that happen sorta make sense. So, while the story is relatively simple, straightforward and even stereotypical, it is quite pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is quite simple, however, the animation is of high quality. Even though characters have  fairly low amount of detail, they move very fluidly in most scenes. There's some CG that doens't *quite* match the 2d art, but it is tolerable enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMusic is generally nice, and opening theme is entertaining. The ending of the second half is interesting to listen to. It is not very memorable, but it works to complement the story. I would say it is slightly below the level of music in Keijo (where musical part was done perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are three or characters total that pull this anime through and make it memorable. Those are Tokiko, protagonist's sister Mahiro and one of the initial bad guys (with very interesting fashion sense). Tokiko is just plain adorable at times, and rather easy to sympathize with. As far as I can tell, she is supposed to be an archetype, but in the end rather than archetype she looks like a person, plus seiyuu did a great job voicing her. The second important character was mahiro, who mostly works as comedic relief, and even though does not really have much of a character on her own, she does a great job adding comedy when she arrives. And then there's bad guy with strange fashion sense....  \\n\r\nIn comparison to strong female lead, protagonist himself is rather generic \"shounen good guy protagonist\". Thankfully he isn't spineless, isn't perverted, doesn't preach too much, isn't prone for fits of angst, so for this kind of anime the character works quite well. However he is not very memorable by himself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI liked first half a bit more, since it had more of light-hearted episodes. The 2nd half for a while looked like it is about to devolve into standard cliched anime with drawn out fight, but it narrowly dodged it. Overall first 12 episodes were definitely more interesting for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nIt is interesting to watch, mostly because of female lead and light comedy that often pops up across the series. The art is a bit low on detail, but it is compensated with very fluid animations, which makes the whole thing much more entertaining. Decent music, great voice acting on main heroine, and even though it is fairly cliched, the story was not boring.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend to check it out, if you have the time.",

            "content": "Intro to the Review: (skip 2 paragraphs to get into the review)\r\nAfter reading some of the reviews for this anime, I am somewhat surprised that many express the same thoughts: \"this anime was generic as heck, but I still love the darn anime and give it an 8 or higher!\" \r\nFor me, this anime should not receive anything higher than a 6 because it does not bring anything new to the table of overused concepts and cliches. Most, if not all anime, share some of the same concepts, but exceptionally good ones bring a twist to them that make it enjoyable. For this anime, notso much. However, I think those who like the anime might be due to the guy in the butterfly mask (in the anime cover picture), known as Papillon or Chouno in the anime. For more info on that, gloss over to my Character and Art portion. In the review below, I'll explain why this anime is \"mediocre\" and not \"very good\".\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt's pretty much like Bleach. Mysterious girl meets boy who saves her...girl gives guy immense power and later you get to meet the organization that she works for. What's different in this anime is that the organization is not as established as the one in Bleach. Instead of meeting a few of them little by little, you meet chunks of them in an episode, giving you time to barely care about them. You barely know about it and the rest of its members until more than halfway through the anime. And then there's the Kakugane (what every alchemist warrior in this show has) that has the ability to transform into a powerful weapon. What is so annoying about this is how the kakugane makes so much BS in the show and yet it is given the least explanation and care about it. But of course, how is our main protagonist going to power up if we can't add some random superpowers along the way? The comedy was stale, the fight scenes were somewhat boring, and there was less and less suspense as the show progressed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe first ED was the main reason why I wanted to watch this series. The song had a beautiful and sad melody to it and it felt poignant to me. This music didn't fit in with 95% of the anime, which was mainly filled with corny jokes, generic fight scenes, and nakama moments. The second ED and OP were cheesy, so it went with the anime. The OST in the anime is pretty much your typical shounen fight scene music. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe animation was consistent throughout the show; not noteworthy, but not poorly done a majority of the time. The setting in the beginning of the anime is in a generic school scene. What does make this anime memorable to most who have seen this anime would be the character design, most notably Papillon. Shown in the poster of this page, he is not your typical antagonist (at least in the fashion sense). His flamboyant attire is the only thing he's got going in terms of \"uniqueness\" and it overshadows the rest of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, let's start off with Papillion since that's what the show ever cares about (he even has the entire second ED to himself). At first, I thought he'd have a major impact in the story, but he's just there ...to be there in all of his bizarre glory. I swear that whoever made this story up made a character as flamboyant as he was just to hide the fact that the story is lackluster and offers nothing new in the shounen category. If you have seen HxH, he might remind you of Hisoka, an antagonist of a story whom several anime watchers might like because of his eccentric attitude, attire, personality, and strength. To me, Papillon gave me the feeling of, \"Oh, it's you again\" (kinda like Team Rocket) every time he appeared on the screen. I just feel like he is more like a moth than a butterfly...always flying over your head, making sure you don't forget about him. His personality and reason for going against the MC is so lame that sometimes you think the author just threw on a butterfly suit on him just to make him more appealing as a villain. If you pay attention enough, he'll say hypocrite whenever he appears.\\n\\n\r\nAll you need to know about the MC, Muto, is that he is the perfect mold of a shounen character: he's got the hair, the \"I gotta save the world without getting anyone killed\" catchphrase, the power to overpower anyone that overpowered him before in less than a month, and the ability to easily overcome life and death situations every time. You can't hate this guy as the MC, right? Right? One thing I do like about him is that he doesn't have a sad past like the common shounen character.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Tokiko, the blue-haired girl with a scar across her face. She's a stern and serious girl, but she's also very caring inside. I do give her credit though for being able to hold up in most of the fights she's been in, despite the fact that Muto has been doing the heavy lifting a majority of the anime. That's pretty much it about her. The rest of the characters felt so generic, forgettable, and disposable, that you get expected responses from Tokiko and Muto and you probably won't remember their names while watching the show. Like I said before, a chunk of characters get shoved in one episode and over a span of some episodes, making you go \"meh\" every time they show up on the screen. There's really nothing exciting about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nWhat was there to enjoy in this anime? The characters were boring and annoying, the comedy was cheesy and short-lived, and the battle animation was sub par. Just because it adhered to the typical shounen genre with the flashy battle scenes and added in some weird characters that didn't really belong in this show, I didn't enjoy it at all. It didn't excite me enough to want to continue to the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story, it's characters, and the art didn't captivate me. Things that annoyed me the most were the lack of good storytelling, disposable side characters who waste precious screentime and an ordinary MC who preaches the same thing, and convenient power ups that feel like a cheat to a game.",

It wasn't exactly what I expected to see and I was quiet excited to watch the series at first.\r\nThe idea is not bad, basicly we have Alchemic warriors who are killing human eating homonculus.\r\nSeries start with the main character accidently getting involved in the fight. However, later on he gets completly dedicated to this new job.\r\nWhat put me off is that somehow I couldn't get into the atmosphere and half naked villian who thinks he is beautiful and keeps making weird poses, doesn't really help. Or when he keeps wearing weird outfits, evenBurger cafe workers of the show couldn't handle it. Was thinking of dropping it several times.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, at around episode 9 when twins get introduced show actually starts to pick up. It starts to involve more things and actual story seems to just start. Since then show mostly kept getting better and you start to forget about some random stuff like Papillon's weird outfits.To be true, Papillon started to become really entertaining and different. He is not like your typical villian out there, weird outfits are part of his uniqness. Also more characters gets introduced and some of them are quiet fun, twins are part of that good cast.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being shounen series, we actually get some decent romance development which doesn't ruin the story. Characters start to grow in strengh and emotionaly. They start to change and you become more attached to them.\\n\\n\r\nI actually wanted to raise my mark till 8 but decided against it because of very cheesy ending. It is not bad, but not my type... so 7 it is.\\n\\n\r\nBasicly if the show still doesn't interest you after episode 10 (small twin arc), series are not meant for you then. But you have to be patient and eventually your patience will be payed off.",

I guess is because I was planning to watch some cliche shounen anime, and Busou Renkin just surprised me in a very good way. \r\nI loved the anime! The story is not something very impressive or original, but in some way, it was very nice. \r\nThe sound... what can I say of it?? I just loved the first ending! And the opening was great, too. The second ending... well... it's hard to describe it with words, because it's very random... It leftme with a weird feeling: I didn't know wether to laugh or stare at the computer dumbfounded. You'll understand me when you'll watch the anime. \\n\r\nI really love the main characters! Kazuki is kawaii in my opinion, and Tokiko, at the beggining, she's somewhat scary and cold, but she changes during the story, and she becomes a very nice and smiling girl at the end, because of her love for Kazuki. The love relationship between these two it's just adorable, and it develops in a good pace. \\n\r\nI really, really enjoyed watching this anime, and I'm very happy to gave it a chance, because I wasn't very sure to watch Busou Renkin, but now I'm relieved I started to see it.",

It is a very standard enemy-of-the-week arc-based super hero show, notable mostly for its superb OP (Makka Na Chikai) and some very amusing characters (Papillon).\r\nHowever, if you want one of these sorts of shows and don't want a massive time sink, it's worth looking into. It's only 26 episodes and has a standard two-arc plot - a first villain who was NOT THE REAL VILLAIN and a power up etc etc.\r\nSome of the supervillains and superheroes have creative abilities, often underused (like the 3 guys who form a Getter Robo/Macross homage) and some get theshort end of the stick (the girl whose power is atmosphere manipulation, for example). The fights, the bread-and-butter of the series after all, are exciting (even if the final confrontations are a little anticlimactic) and don't rely too much on sword clashes followed by dramatic shouting. There's some good fight choreography, even if the villains are very much set up to be in a league above the sidekicks.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as a straight character comedy/action show it is very enjoyable despite the plot not being anything special. The dub is not bad at all, either. Well worth giving a shot if you want something funny, exciting and formulaic.",

Although I wasn't really ecstatic about the ending, overall I have to say its an anime to watch if you like sci-fi, romance and supernatural stuff all in one =D",

            "content": "Remember your first anime? Me too. This was not my first anime, but it /is/ the first series I ever watched from beginning to end, and as such it holds a special place in my heart. That was my disclaimer to let you know that I'm reviewing one of my favorite series, and while I tried to mitigate it, there may still be some inherent bias found within. Busou Renkin is a fairly unimpressive production, but was the first anime that fully captivated me with its entertaining characters, exciting battles, and easygoing attitude.\r\nBusou Renkin's animation is about par for the course for 2005. That isto say: the visuals are probably its weakest element. Some of Watsuki's character designs are fun and original, but a good few are just uninspired or bland. The animation can range from bad to pretty good, but it's never really great. Characters are semi regularly off model, and there are budget shots abound, but also infrequent creative direction that really takes advantage of the digital medium. Conspicuous CG is present in most episodes, and while it doesn't look great, it isn't overly obtrusive.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Dragon Ball, this is one of those series I can only watch in English, just because the voices are so ingrained into my memory and experience of it. That said, it's a pretty middle of the road dub. The lead roles are cheesy yet fun, but many side characters are dismally devoid of emotion in their delivery. I've only tried to watch a few episodes in Japanese, but I'm sure it's just as good if not better!\\n\\n\r\nI simply adore the soundtrack, but that may be reinforced by my love for the series. I don't think it does anything bold or surprising, but it serves its purpose nonetheless. The tracks range from light and whimsical, to atmospheric and mysterious, to grand, powerful orchestral pieces. The opening, Makka na Chikai, is a classic to me, with its squealing guitars and overwhelmingly hot blooded shounen attitude. The first ending theme is sweet, sappy, and stuck in my head, while the second is dark and fabulously groovy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where Busou Renkin really shines, and are the reason why I love it so much. While none of them are terribly deep or complex, their strength lies in their simplicity and relationships. Many fit typical shounen archetypes, and most of them don't have much depth, but the easily understandable dynamics between them are delightful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nKazuki's friends that are entirely separated from the battles are always a hoot, and give me the warm fuzzy feelings in their moments of sincerity. Papillon is a wonderfully developed rival for Kazuki, against whom the romantic rival Gota pales. A few important opponents have actual back stories, but for the most part enemy characters simply are their special powers. There are more characters still that I would like to detail (Bravo!), but let's keep this review rolling.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a compelling, nuanced narrative, you probably won't find it here. Many twists, turns, and character actions are cliche and predictable, but I still have fun going along for the ride every time. Of course all the enemies become allies, and nobody really dies when they're defeated, so as long as you can forgive standardized shounen tropes like these you'll be fine. It risks an atypical narrative style in the final episodes, which makes it feel a bit slow, but this may just be the anime adaptation. For as much as I love this series, I still haven't read the whole manga, which I'm pretty ashamed of.\\n\\n\r\nSo who should watch Busou Renkin? Watch this if you like battle anime with special powers, strong but simplistic characters, or just want a feel good show that you don't have to think about too much.",

Probably what I liked most is the lead female character, I just really enjoyed the character dynamic shown throughout. Even the 'filler' content was very enjoyable.",

After he starts training with Bravo, Kazuki's power unreasonably skyrockets. All the anime I have seen until now will include romance , because the hero always becomes strong fastly because he wants to protect the loved one, but in this the only romance is the only part that they kiss in episode 23 end, and the part that a new male rival comesafter nearly 15th episode even though he loses in winning her heart. So this is what made me give 5% romance.\\n\\n\r\n8% comedy + fantasy\\n\r\nSome non-lame comedy was not bad, gave me a good laugh. Fantasy is the idea of the powers and the powers strength and use.\\n\\n\r\n6% non exaggerated action\\n\r\nOnly at the starting of anime because the hero's power had not yet started to skyrocket.\\n\\n\r\n6% slice of school life\\n\r\nEven though the anime is all about some homunculus and alchemy weapon, they managed to pull of some school life with the hero and heroine which was not bad.\\n\\n\r\nAND THE MAIN PART COMES HERE FOR WHY THE WHOLE STORY IS JUST A EXAGGERATION \\n\\n\r\n1. The fact that there is no physics applied here at all. Actually this whole story became a bullshit at episode 24. \\n\r\nThe hero takes Victor with him and lands on moon by passing through space without rupturing any body parts or blood vessels.\\n\\n\r\n2. THE MAIN FACT THAT THE HERO WAS \"HEAVILY BREATHING\" ON MOON DUE TO USING OF TOO MUCH POWER. JUST WHAT WAS HE BREATHING?VACUUM?  \\n\\n\r\n3. The fact that hero became super strong surpassing even his master Captain Bravo in just 2 months. AND AT THE END STAYED ON MOON FIGHTING VICTOR FOR 1 MONTH AND DIDN'T BECOME ENOUGH POWERFUL TO DESTROY THE MOON OR OVERPOWER VICTOR EVEN A BIT.\\n\\n\r\n4. THE FACT THAT MOON HAS GRAVITY SAME AS EARTH AND VICTOR USED ANTI GRAVITY POWER TO SEND KAZUKI AND HIMSELF FLYING INTO SPACE SO THEY CAN BE SAVED BY OTHERS.\\n\\n\r\n5. THE FACT THAT IT TOOK 1 MONTH FOR THE LIGHT FROM KAZUKI'S WEAPON TO BE SPOTTED AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CHOUNO FINISHES CREATING WHITE KAKUGANE. \\n\\n\r\nA LOT MORE WILL COME BUT THIS MUCH IS ENOUGH TO FIND THIS ANIME'S VALUE.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 :-\\n\r\nNot bad art for a 2007 created anime. The colors were used nicely.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 :- \\n\r\nThe sounds used were silly at times, but not bad while action scenes's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 :-\\n\r\nFair enough Character development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 :-\\n\r\nDue to Art, Sound ,Comedy , Fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nHERE ENDS MY REVIEW OF THIS ANIME.",

The only problem with most peoples reviews when others have looked into the anime is what other animes compare to that anime that was just watched. There are other animes just like this one currently, it may have nothing to do with the alchemy or the monsters in which they were facing up against but I have seen the reviews of others and I just plainly don't care for either of them. They tell youabout the anime, if you want to know what it's primarily about, all you have to do is read the introduction next to where it explains what the entire anime is about. However, people want to know what other animes are similar to this sword/ weapon experience. There are numerous of animes, you have FMA, Full Metal Alchemist, You also have this one which is Busou Renkin. You have Sword Art Online. Sword Art Online is a personal favorite because the primary character logs into this Virtual World and is forced to stay there against his will and must fight for his life to get out. Very good anime in my personal Opinion and as sad as it sounds, it's much better than Busou Renkin is every single aspect.",

Well it's not THAT bad, it just felt like one of those typical anikes thats out there just to support the anime comunity. \r\nThe story is a lot like FML, there are a few elements of alchamey that  Buso Renkin does a bit diffrent, but it was about alchamey and i think my love for FML completly drowned the feel and effect of Buso Renkin. The characters are ok, I did enjoy the female character, I thought she was pretty bad***. Her relashionship with the leading male was good and clean, but it waslike all those other guy and girl anime relashionship which also makes this even more unoriginal. So if you are looking for some mind numbing action and nothing really all that special, and your a fan of bleach and Full Metal Alchamist, then you might like Buso Renkin. \\n\\n\r\nTake care everybody.",

            "content": "It's been a long time since I've written a review, but Busou Renkin really inspired me to write a review.\r\nStory: 10\r\nWell, to be honest, the story isn't all that amazing for a fighting/adventure type shounen anime, but after all I don't think Busou Renkin's focus is there only. This anime seems to have quite a fair bit of drama, depressing tones and reality behind it. The anime from start to finish had a good going of emotional scenes which captivated me to watch this series in a few days, despite my busy schedule. Anyways, the way Kazuki changed the people and environment around him wasexcellently scripted, in my opinion. This is one of the best fighting/adventure animes I've watched, with regard to the amount of fighting and emotional scenes balanced. And for me, there are no story \"holes\".\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe colour is quite dull and lacklustre, but all the action scenes all quite well done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nGood, especially the bgm played during emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nArguably the best \"selfless character\" I've seen been constant, from start to finish. There were a lot of times I knew which character would make which action, highlighting how stable all the characters are, in the sense that their personalities would not change unless for a very strong reason showed in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nNeed I say more?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWell, this anime is very good in my opinion, but more for drama and character wise. However, more scenes could be dedicated to some of the main characters' past and possibly more into family and school life, instead of mostly just battle scenes. Character development could be more emphasised to increase the depth of the characters.\\n",

            "content": "Violence: Blood, mutilation\r\nLanguage: moderate\r\nNudity/Sexuality: minor (bath scene, no actual nudity.)\r\nInnuendo: moderate\r\nKazuki Muto is just an ordinary high school student, when one night on his way back to the dorms he sees a light at the abandoned factory behind the school.  Upon investigation, he sees a fantastic serpent-like creature stalking a schoolgirl.  In the moment that the monster strikes, Kazuki leaps in and knocks the girl aside, saving her life but also dying instantly as the serpent's spined tail pierces his heart.\r\nThe next thing Kazuki knows is that he has gained consciousness atop the school building, where the mysterious schoolgirl, Tokiko, has brought himback to life by joining his life force to the power of a mystical artifact known as a Kakugane.  Tokiko is an achemist warrior, protecting the world from the cannibalistic creatures known as Homunculi by using the powers of her Kakugane weapon, and Kazuki has just been drawn into her fight.  The world of alchemy and the continuous battle between alchemist warriors and homunculi is now Kazuki's world as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime strikes a good balance between lighthearted humor and more serious themes as Kazuki balances his new life as an alchemist warrior with the everyday concerns of education and dorm life.  The pacing of the story is quite good and has both action and drama throughout.  There seem to be two main story arcs in this anime, the first being the extermination of the LXE, the evil League of Extraordinary Elites, and the second arc concerning the rise of the being known as Victor and the struggle to bring him down.  Other minor themes are woven into the mix as well, including the developing relationship between Kazuki and Tokiko, Kazuki's training within the Alchemist Army, and Kazuki's interaction with his nemesis, the fabulous mastermind Papillon.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a fair amount of objectionable content in this anime; I would give it about a PG-13 rating.  Most notable is the violence, of which there is quite a lot, with limbs being sliced off and blood (red and other colors) splattering around everywhere during battle scenes.  Generally the only fatalities during these battles are the monsters, however, and no grievous injuries are sustained by human characters due to the regenerative powers of the Kakugane weapons which heal even extraordinary wounds fairly quickly.  From what I can tell, there is a bit of language in the Japanese version with subtitles, nothing major really and such language is not frequent at all.  In the English dub, most of the profanity has been replaced with less objectionable language.  \\n\\n\r\nAs in most anime, there are a few bath scenes and a character does have his clothes vaporized in one battle scene, leaving his immortal body inact.  During these scenes, however, nothing much is ever shown; in the bath scene, for example, everyone is in the bath, or fog covers all the naughty bits, etc.  There is a bit of sexual innuendo at places however; at one point all the guys compare the relative sizes of their manhood while in the bath, resulting in general despair and disillusionment.  One of the diabolical characters, Papillon, a male homunculus, wears a rather revealing leotard-like uniform and a mask (which leads other characters to refer to him as a \"masked pervert\").  At other times, Papillon wears only a thong or a rather awful suspender-type swimsuit (keep in mind this is a male character).  Given Papillon's obsession with Kazuki (although not in a romantic manner), his flair for melodrama, and his \"fabulous\" sense of style and taste in clothing, it is implied that he may be gay, though such an assertion is never explicitly declared.  There is very little female fanservice in this anime (if any).  Refreshingly, this is not a \"harem\"-style anime where tons of girls are all interested in the main character.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes this anime shine is the interesting characters; some of them are kinda stereotypical, but there are also some that are a little different from the usual.  I really like Tokiko's cool, mature, level-headed vibe.  Then there is the ultra-macho Captain Bravo, who never introduces himself by his real name because \"it's just cooler that way.\"  Kazuki Muto is kind of a cookie-cutter hero-type who will sacrifice himself for others and \"wants to get stronger,\" but he is still a likeable enough character despite being generic.  My personal favorite is Kazuki's nemesis Papillon, a diabolical genius student dying of a rare disease who seeks the power of alchemy in order to gain immortality.  Papillon's transformation from an unsightly caterpillar to devious butterfly master is quite entertaining and Pappy's violent and flamboyant personality makes things interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a well-balanced anime with interesting characters and a decent storyline.  If you like anime with lots of action, cool powers, and not too much ecchi content, this anime might be for you.  Also, it has a happy ending.  I give this anime a hearty thumbs up.",

He's a supervillain that's so sick he could cough up a lung any second while making his evil diabolical speeches. He is absolutely fantastic.\r\nSeriously, it is worth seeing this whole series JUST for him. Take him away, and you still got a pretty decent shonen battle anime.",

Voice actors are all well cast, now i'm talking about the English dub because i never watch the Japanese version, the one's that stood out for me were Papillon, Moonface and Captain Bravo, these three stole the spotlight when on screen with their unique voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nKazaki Mutou the main protagonist is a very bland shounen character in my opinion, at the start he is given a speical power and decides he wants to use it to save everyone with zero sacrifices and this can get annoying but you will grow to like this guy, Tokiko is our second protagonist who can go from fighting mercilessly to getting embarresed when wearing a swin suit. Papillon is a unique antagonist in that he is very camp in the way he acts and dresses, he also has a Gauron type obsession with Kazuki. All the other mini antagonist and good guys all were unique people who you can never get bored of, and the main characters friends were all fun and added a comic effect at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nBusou Renkin is an enjoyable shounen action series with a little romance added in there, it's sure to keep you interested with its wide range of original characters out main guy has to defeat or work with and is sure to please any fan of the genre.",

It wasn't. The romance is extremely minimal, and wasn't even brought up till the last couple of episodes.\r\n I was 19 when I watched this and I'm sorry to say it was a disappointment. I think it may be because it could have been aimed towards a younger audience. \r\nThere wasnothing very special about the main characters Kazuki and Tokiko and the villains are pretty dumb. As I saw someone else say it is an \"impossible is possible\" anime and in that sense is good for if you're looking for inspiration, although Gurren Lagann is an IPP that exceeds Busou Renkin greatly in my opinion. \\n\r\nIf you have other shows in your \"plan to watch \" list I'd say go watch them first. \\n\r\nWith all that said the opening song is really good C:\\n",
