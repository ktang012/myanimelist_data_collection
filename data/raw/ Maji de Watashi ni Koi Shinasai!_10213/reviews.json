            "content": "[contains some mild spoilers, some suggestive language, and some comparison to the visual novel]\r\nWhat a slaughter.\r\nMaji de Watashi ni Koishinasai (TV) is one of the two visual novels that was adapted this fall season. In comparison to Mashiro-iro, which was a decent adaptation, MajiKoi\u2019s adaptation was pure shit. In Mashiro\u2019s review, I stated that Mashiro was considered an \u201caverage visual novel\u201d, which made the mediocre storyline understandable. But, MajiKoi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of using the excuse \u201cthe visual novel was bad\u201d, it was considered a great visual novel (8.71@VNDB). In other words, it was a great source with great potential.\r\nNow, why exactly does theadaptation blow? Is it because they adapted it into a generic harem instead of an enjoyable slice of life? Or is it because they completely slaughtered the characters, and developed the cast of respectable female characters into homogenized whores craving the main dude\u2019s dick. Well, it would have to be a mixture of the two; but predominantly the latter.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can understand that Western tastes and tastes in Japan differ. They like excessive fan service, I find it irritating. There\u2019s an obvious difference, but it\u2019s bearable for the most part; it\u2019s not as prominent as it could be. But there\u2019s a limit to everything too. When every other scene is censored due to nudity, it\u2019s basically blatantly insinuating \u201cFuck you, buy the blue-ray release\u201d. It\u2019s probably a really effective way to catalyze sales in my opinion, but it\u2019s still a douche thing to do. That could be ignored if the other aspects of the show was actually adapted decently, but they weren\u2019t. .\\n\\n\r\nMy first major gripe would be the harem aspect of it. The first arc of MajiKoi, before branching out and choosing individual path, was essentially, a slice of life. It\u2019s really extenuating more on friendship then it is with the individual intimate relationships, it\u2019s reminiscent of AnoHana in a way. The main arc in the visual novel basically contains little to no romance and it\u2019s not hindered by infatuation until you begin to branch (but that\u2019s still only with one character). The arc is more than enough to be animated into twelve episodes, it took six hours to read. That\u2019s reading with skipping the majority of the voice acting, basically spamming enter. It\u2019s inevitably understandable on why they would adapt MajiKoi as a harem over a sexless slice of life (It\u2019ll probably sell well), but it was still something that could have been done.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the second gripe that basically ruins the visual novel, is slaughtering the characters. It\u2019s similar to reading a book and developing the \u201cideal archetype\u201d of the character, only to see it getting completely revamped in a movie adaptation. By slaughter, I don\u2019t mean some slight miscalculations, it\u2019s some pretty noticeable stuff. Some pretty notable ones would include the main character, Yamato. Now, in the visual novel, the main character is basically portrayed as an intelligent, devious tactician when it comes to facing everyday challenges; that carries on over in the anime. But in the VN, he wasn\u2019t lusting after his friends, and his philosophies were more complex. In the anime, he was basically painted as a kind person as a kid when it came to taking in Miyako. In the visual novel, he just mentioned that she could stay if she wanted, it wasn\u2019t through any good will, he was a nihilistic kid, I don\u2019t think he really cared. On the other hand, each female in the visual novel had their own individual personality, in the anime, they\u2019re basically homogenized into lusting after the dude(most notably Chris, she hated his devious dishonorable personality initially in the visual novel, however, in the anime, she doesn\u2019t mind it). In the VN, they thought of him as a friend, and nothing more unless you pursued it while branching out.\\n\\n\r\nObjective Score: 2/10. It\u2019s a disappointment. It did one of the worst things you could do in an adaptation, it slaughtered the character. It turned something with little fan service into something based off of fan service. Action was actually the focal centerpiece in the anime, in the novel, it\u2019s more of an underlying theme.\\n\\n\r\nSubjective Score: 4/10: If you didn\u2019t read the visual novel, you might actually like this. Most people reading the visual novel will probably dislike this immensely, it slaughtered the personalities of the majority of the characters. I guess you\u2019ll like this if you like action, boobs, and clich\u00e9 characters (excluding Miyako, she\u2019s basically the only characters that\u2019s pretty damn awesome in both versions, but then again, adapting a chick who\u2019s going after the dude probably wasn\u2019t the hardest in comparison to the rest).",

            "content": "First of all, my purpose writing this review for this anime is to clarify any negative comments about this anime, since so many review saying this anime is horrible because the anime itself didnt really like the VN. really? just for that reason? Honestly, why do people comparing the VN with the anime itself? we're talking about the anime in here not VN. oh god...\r\nWhen i finished this series i was kinda surprised, because the score in MAL itself didnt represent how good this anime was, i dont say this anime was the best but its quite entertaining, that 6.99 is just so UNDERRATED. rememberthat.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen the VN itself but i am not gonna compare it, so i judge this anime purely based on how excited when i watching this anime.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - The story itself , i am not quite sure if this anime have a plot. I though the preview in MAL has explain it all. its about a bunch of girls and some boy who lives in under one roof, they represent theyself as kawakami family (sounds like a mafia, huh?), and the first of the episode you will see a war (yeah a war) which happen like in three kingdoms era. if you're thinking WTF is this, then i said this was an extracurriculer from the school that they attends. Shortly, for me Maji de Watashi is like Angel beats (Bunch of people) + Oda Nobuna (the war from edo era).\\n\\n\r\nAt the first, it would quite hard to follow what happen in this anime since so many things that would make the viewers scratching their head. It cant be helped since, many scenes of this anime is slices of the Visual Novel itself, no wonder if the story is kinda messed up and didnt focus on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nbe reversed from the story itself, The jokes that appears in this anime was really hit the spot, its really funny and quite amusing. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nART - The artwork that the Maji de Watashi have is literally good, its not something that really exaggerate. The biright coloring that they use is pretty much increasing the atmosphere, Colorful scenery, and the character design itself is pretty well made, though the quality is seems a bit lower for the other anime but the art in this anime is still pretty enjoyable to watch. However, sometimes there is a lack in character drawn quality. In some scenes, the character face seems quite been \"distracted\", but thats doesnt really bothering. SO, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTOR - I am really attached by the voice for each character, they really represents the trait of each character, like Momoyo, she is tomboy, and the voice that they present was really like a real tomboy person, heavy voice and yet its cute. and anoher thing that should we mention is Gotou Yuuko. As the voice actor for MAyuzumi Yukie, her voice was so adorable and cute. No matter how many times you hear it, you wouldnt bored and helped to fallin love 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSONG - This is maybe the reason why i love to watch Maji de Watashi. especially the OP song + the animation for the OP itself. \"U-n-d-e-r--STANDING!\" by Endoh Masaaki, Kitadani Hiroshi, Misato Aki is quite catchy rock song, The beats is really hyped up the viewers like me, nor it was perfectly fit with the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Well, its like any other harem anime, we have a tsundere (Christiane Friedrich), Dandere ( Yukie Mayuzum), the energetic one (Kazuko Kawakami), Big boobs (Momoyo Kawakami), and of course the obssesive one (Miyako Shiina) which reminds me of Sacchan in Gintama and for the main lead we have Naoe Yamato, which is very fits for the male lead, he is smart and yet its doesnt easy to tease this guy with the flirt from all the girls and a point plus for this male lead is he is not \"shy\" like any other harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a bunch of unique girls, of course it was the standard of all harem. but somehow i found its really amusing. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION - Basically, its lack of the story like everyone had said. but i am not really like concern about that problem since for me harem anime is just for entertaining, so i score this anime based on how satisfaction i am when i watching this anime, so did i satisfied with this anime? yes it is. its funny and yet admirable, especially for each character. so 8/10 for me.\\n",

            "content": "There are basically two types of people who watch anime, Type A and Type B.\r\nI'm going to discuss Type B first because that's probably the main audience for this anime.\r\nType B anime watchers are people who enjoy having loads upon loads of characters, flashy action, costumes, lightsabers transforming robots, service, etc. without needing much reason for it to be present. In short, they don't care, as long as they have as much shit stuffed on the screen as possible, they'll eat it.\r\nIf you fit within that category this anime is for you. I'm not going to try and explain any further because you probablyabandoned any sense of reason a long time ago anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the Type A watchers who place story and development over flashy gimmick, in short, my fellow brothers.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nFrom the start of this anime I knew there was a problem... sub par art and the feeling that nothing was making sense from the very beginning. This was a rip off fusion of the concepts of Baka no Test and Dog Days. No improvement on the material, they manage to fuck it all up from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all there is no clear power gap between Classes S and Classes F. What happened to the classes in the middle? Does the S Class even exist? They seem to be equals, Class F seems to be stronger even, maybe it's because S if further back in the alphabet than F is, I do not know and I do not care.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also some romance plot shoehorned in with characters we have never seen before but are forced to show some sympathy when shown out of nowhere flashbacks that has nothing to do with what was happening at the time. If that's not bad enough, I have a reason to believe there was incest involved to some level. What the fuck does this do to progress the PLOT (word of the fucking day)? I hope they explain it in later episodes if they haven't managed to lose me by then.\\n\\n\r\nWhat peeves me off is that near the end there is a fight and the participants shout names of their special attacks every time they use them. It was pointless and was trying too hard every time they did it. It's alright and when used at the right moment, really cool to yell the name of your finisher move when you do it, just don't shout it for every freaking move that you just pulled out of your ass on the spot.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThis was the first thing that I noticed that let me know this was going to suck. The budget of this anime suddenly became clear and with what came after I began to realize that I had made a mistake somewhere in my life that led into me watching this anime. I look a sigh of disappointment as the cheap animation continued, with latest technology sincere art through anime is possible... They didn't even try. I have seen hentai with better animation than what they have in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThis is always a hard category in a review. This anime makes it harder. What hell do you want me to say? If I was asked I wouldn't even remember if there was even a soundtrack or BGM worth noting. No memorable score, but I have to give it to that robot Cookie. It's voice was kinda cute.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of voices, they have lots of high class seiiyu in this anime. However that does improve anything, it actually worsens it. Sugita Tomozaku could have been doing something worth a shit with his time. Oh well I guess he gotta eat too. I hope he gets paid lots.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nToo many. I am confused, I can't remember any names. We don't learn about any of their pasts, what their dreams are, why they fight. Sure that might follow in later episodes but its unacceptable presenting this crap as the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nPointless filler characters everywhere trying to desperately out categorize TVTropes, when will it end.?! It's retarded, it's as if they're trying to piss me off on purpose. Mission accomplished dickheads.\\n\\n\r\nThey don't even try with the character designs. All the clothing is bland, hair is unoriginal, Kyon is bald, and their personalities are a complete mystery or just the same crap you've seen a hundred times before.\\n\\n\r\nThat red haired eye patch chick, I've seen her in some hentai before... No really, I mean it. I'm more sure of it than the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis was a big waste of time. I stared agonizingly at the run time of this video, groaning every time I checked the progress to see that only thirty seconds had elapsed since I last checked... \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt's too late for me. I've already started this anime and I can't drop it now... I have to endure cause I can't let this shit beat me.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not to late for you, fellow Type A viewers. Spare yourself the pain and watch something that actually has something to offer. There is nothing for you here, NOTHING, and there probably won't ever be.\\n\\n\r\n\"It might get better as it goes along.\"\\n\\n\r\nBULLSHIT!\\n\\n\r\nThis review was not helpful for your ass. Screw me like this anime did.",

In my opinion, it's always the latter, because one never invests times in the former.\r\nMaji de Watshi is about a high school dude with no power surrounded by chicks with a lot of it. A plot we've seen a million times. This one is hardly refreshing. The only difference is that this anime tries to make some political statement, but fails in every way imaginable. In the meantime, there's cheap ecchi that's terrible and rehashed episodes within the arc itself so that one's viewing displeasure isn't focused onjust one thing. Awesome, right?\\n\\n\r\nMaji de Watshi is easily one of the worst anime I have ever watched. Not only is the main character rendered so impotent by weakness and stupidity, enough to make Perez Hilton look macho, but at the same time, the story is expecting the viewer to believe he's actually a genius tactician!!! The animation is fine, but the logic is missing in all aspects. One scene actually depicted a girl who is supposed to be able to move quickly enough to fight 5 people at once, shooting a bullet through an arrow AND through the string of the firing bow while in motion. Then, five seconds later, the powerless main character somehow grabs her arm and stun guns her. Epic retarded laziness is the only way to describe this.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no payoff, by the way, if you're looking for something to hope for. It ends as badly as it begins. Avoid... this... show!\\n",

Ok so before the last 3 episodes I was able to forgive this anime's short comings co'z of the comedy and the ecchi (even though it's censored) things in it and there is this thing that I was hoping that the muchacho (Yamato)  goes for Shiina, however things turned around with a corny ending. All the genres describe for this anime pertains not as a whole, but was divided each ona per episode basis that adds to the chaos, so for the story it is a \"POOR\" number 3.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre number 5.\\n\\n\r\nCo'z the art bears resemblance from another anime \"\"Kimiga Aruiji de Shitsuji Ga Ore De,\" where Kuki Ageha came from.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good number 7.\\n\\n\r\nSince I like both opening and ending themes and I also like the seiyus who did the voices of the female cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor number 3.\\n\\n\r\nOk, let\u2019s go to each of the main characters:\\n\\n\r\nNaoe Yamato- his character has him being a muchacho who prefers brains over brawn; actually he uses 2 heads one on top where he does all his thinking, analyzing and planning and one below his belt where he reads porn on one hand and plays with it.............. I'll leave to your imagination. He's a bit of a letdown co'z everything about his character falls short of expectation, this is due to the fact that everything about his role is a dichotomy:  examples are; he proposes his love for Momoyo in 1st episode but in another episode he makes gestures that he'll be willing to marry Momoyo's sister, Wanko, he has a vast collection of porn paraphernalia, let alone some of his winky flash to Kokoro and yet he\u2019s very reluctant to bang Miyako, his bragging that he prefers brains to brawn yet he ends up being a damsel in distress and what irritates me is his ridiculous and stupid excuse of  giving this anime a corny ending about his pet hermit crabs to his harem. Actually, my rating for this part falls on him.\\n\\n\r\nAs for his harem:\\n\\n\r\nFriedrich Christiane - her character has her to be part of Naoe\u2019s gang and class, she is a fencer by fighting standards. Since this anime has a harem genre in it, her role completes that of a rich tsundere with feelings for the muchacho (Naoe). The author of this anime seems to have limited her assistant Eberbach, Margit to a cameo role; she could have added something for this anime if she would have been made part of the main cast. Friedrich certainly adds certain class and finesse to the harem . By the way, I really hate the way she wore her uniform.\\n\\n\r\nKawakami Momoyo- she's the muchacho's love interest, she's one superb fighter and she's bisexual, it is now establish the she does love the muchacho. Since part of this anime's genre is super powers, it is safe to say that her character is that genre.\\n\\n\r\nKawakami \u201cWanko\u201d Kazuko \u2013 By fighting standards she\u2019s pike man co\u2019z she armed with a naginata, she\u2019s basically completes the harem genre as being wife material to the muchacho (Naoe) as well as an able competition from her elder sister, Momoyo. \\n\\n\r\nMayuzumi Yukie \u2013 Well, obviously she\u2019s a samurai and part of the harem, she\u2019s probably the only member of the muchacho\u2019s harem who\u2019s a bit weird co\u2019z she has a dual personally which compose of; the shy and conservative Yukie and the opinionated and outspoken Matsukaze which is represented by his horse like cell phone strap thing. What makes it more wired is that one can\u2019t determined whether or not if every cast knows about her condition or they just assumed that the horse like thing is has a mind of its own, if this anime has a psychological genre in it, she\u2019ll fit right in.\\n\\n\r\nShiina Miyako- according to info, she was once bullied and was saved by the muchacho during their elementary days. Question, how was she able to become a skilled archer, in a span of just a few years? It is also implied that she\u2019s not just any ordinary archer but she also has the same quick reflexes as all the members of the muchacho\u2019s harem. Frankly she also adds to the muchacho\u2019s dichotomy were it is implied that the muchacho may have a thing for her and yet he shoves her like some stray animal who wanders into his backyard. But one thing about her is that she contributes a lot to the comedy and ecchi genre of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the rest of the muchacho\u2019s gang:\\n\\n\r\nKazama Shiochi, Mooroka Takuya, Minamoto Tadakatsu and Gakuto Shimazu \u2013 well, it is kinda disappointing that the author has just limited the 4 to be support cast whereas \\n\r\nthey have the potential to spice up the anime, however it is only Kazama Shiochi who is the true support cast among the four since he has more air time than the rest whom were just limited to cameo roles.\\n\\n\r\nOthers: \\n\\n\r\nKuki Ageha \u2013 I really don\u2019t get as to why the author has to borrow her from another anime, when he/ she could have just come up with a new character. \\n\\n\r\nCookie \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to make out of that character and so are the rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Poor number 3.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so as I\u2019ve mentioned this anime is taken from a PC adult eroge visual novel, so it is a PC game, the enjoyment is only on the ecchi and comedy part of the anime which only extents up to the 8th episode and according to another review writer, the anime \u201cMajikoi\u201d didn\u2019t follow the intended arc of the title in fact the title itself  doesn\u2019t fit well and I agree, if we\u2019re to assigned  this title to another anime I\u2019d say that the title  should fit right with \u201cSchool Rumble,\u201d as for the said animes  title \u201cSchool Rumble\u201d I\u2019d say that is more appropriate to be assigned to this anime  since the setting always involves the students of Kawakami Academy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is completely detached from any of the VN routes, is not loyal to the personality of the characters, and is generally not an outstanding anime to begin with.\r\nI would strongly suggest avoiding this one.",

Allright lets make my review short.\r\nStoryline:\r\nI think the first impression of audience is the most important in anime storyline. For my first impression. I was Shocked, the anime started with no clues but more to action and then the development of the story is quite slow.The story has a few flashback,but I think the flashback does not even make me sense anything.(Shocked again).Recently, Ijust discovered the main hero and heroin on the 2nd episode.(Shocked again)\\n\\n\r\nArts:\\n\r\nThe arts ,umm I can only give this anime for 7/10 . I recently watch other anime which is more quality than this one. You can see it by yourself.\\n\r\nP/S: Ro-Kyu-Bu has better quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nToo many character.Sometime I quite confused,who is this and who is that. As the anime is harem anime,no wonder 4 girls is in love with their own brother,which is in love with his older sister.(All of them are siblings..Hahaha)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI dont really enjoy this anime,but as the story is confusing me all the time.At least this anime has the harem,romance, and ecchi elements make it more enjoyable but not the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIts not to late or it maybe too early to judge the anime.I misjudge some other anime by first impression but the end,it was a succesful work.For now,my overall rating for the anime is 8.\\n\\n",

We see each character possessing a clearly unique, dare i say, supernatural ability that seemingly obliterates any hope of the other side winning the interesting battles that are the common theme of this show.  I enjoyed baka test because of it's characters, comedy, and the idea of the battle system.  It was hard of me to find a favorite character and it's only the first episode but for now it will be Miyako eince im a huge archery fan, love the bow.  There isn't one characteri dislike so far, each of them are loveable in their own way.  \\n\r\nMoving into art, it's not the best but it kicks butt and it could have been a lot worse so i'm thankful it's not.  Sound is good, storyline is interesting to say the least, characters are a go, here's to hoping it stays a 10 till the very end, which it probably will since it earned my 10 just from episode one, it can only get better from here!",

And Christiane Friedrich (or Chris for short) seems like a character of perfect fit for her. Just your same, awesome Hinagiku, only with a thing for Justince(!!) and a noble bloodline.\r\nIf you'llhave the hots for Chris, I recommend you play her route in the Visual Novel. You won't be left disappointed. She's all innocent, sexy, just, strong, weak, ridiculous, and funny.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give the series a 10, but since we're just 3 episodes in, I'll stay on the safe side and settle for a 9.",

I get goosebumps everytime I see her in the OP)\r\nStory: Like many people have said, it doesnt have a \"story\" per se (at least not yet since theres only 2 episodes). However if you are into the kind of shows that have a lot of ecchi action fights and girls who all adore 1 guy then this show is perfect for you.\r\nPersonally I am more into the harem aspect of the show, the action is just a bonus for me.\r\nArt:Looks very nice. Very bright, and vibrant. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP is really good. I tend to skip OP but due to the fact that Ageha is in it, and that each girl is shown with their trademark abilities/weapons it just draws me in even more. Can't seem to remember the Ending though since I tend to just go to the next episode unless it's the ending of Fairy Tail (The one where Gray is walking alone, that song fits the animation so well)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are the usual bunch. Super Strong leader/object of guys affection but doesnt feel the same way about him, foreign german girl who is not used to the customs of Japan, spunky/cute/optimistic one, Psychotic/obsessed/loves the main guy like no other, shy/flustered/good cook chick.\\n\\n\r\nThis actually reminds me A LOT of Infinite Stratos now that I think about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very enjoyable.

Everyone compares it to the VN, I personally have not played it, so this is an unbiased review. \r\nStory- there really isn't one to speak of, other than trying to beat the former DEVA. It's the basic harem where the girls try to get the guy, but the girls are more forceful than other harems(miyako is my favourite, she would strip naked in public if Yamato asked). The action just from the first episode is so over the top with added superpowers makes it just awesome.\r\nArt- the art is enjoyable,the characters are well drawn, the backgrounds too. The fights, anything involving momoyo, are fast, which all you see is arms going back and forth, so it's like they got lazy. The art isn't amazing, but it's still good.\\n\\n\r\nSound-  it went good with most scenes, the fights had excellent soundtracks, the OP and ED were good but not catchy enough for me\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- they all followed their respective archetypes, but were more or less open with their feelings, except momoyo. With a half season, the show didn't focus on character development but the action aspect of it, each fight being better than the last.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-I watched this show purely for the harem and action that it had. If you don't like this type of anime don't watch it, if u think this is like the VN don't watch it cause u will bitch about it the whole time. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime didn't try to be anything that it wasn't, on the action part, it nailed it, the harem, miyako dull it down and mayu be just a little less awkward, the ecchi was fine, always just in the bath, never in fights to keep focus on the action. It was enjoyable, but it could've been better with 24-26 episodes and a clear choice on who he would choose out of the five.",

However,  while list most eroge have adapted into H anime since it got most of the H since, some of the eroge theme School Days, Koihime Musou series, and even Happy Days are adapted into the regular Ecchi anime since they are much more better in the non H anime and much popular to the Moe fashion that became the  popular phenomenon in manga and anime industry.\r\nNevertheless, like most of there type, the anime itself  focus on the fighting genre andromance which I have never seen since 2005. As most of the fighting genre anime almost found in Shoenen only or gory like Baki the Anime,  this anime is the only fighting genre might actually combine with romance and ecchi  elements.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I give the artwork 9/10 as I like the way the art was drawn. Hopefully that the anime really dosen't let us down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever had a feeling of watching a show that was really close to another? Well I have been having that with this show. This show is much like that and reminds me of Martial Heart although not as bad. Both have school girls fighting duals against other people in many different get ups from kimono\u2019s to bad ass ninja clothing and they all have a different way of fighting. There is also a lot of nudity, the difference though being that the nudity isn\u2019t actually in the fighting. It\u2019s all in the school life drama that unfolds. The school life is just as it soundslike, like every other school life genre with the gags running wild from perverted school mates to love life triangles. \\n\\n\r\nWe have 5 girls all fighting for attention of one man, Yamato. We have the stupid one, the overly perverted one, the shy one, the girl who is from another country, and then the tomboy childhood friend. Sorry but that\u2019s pretty much how each of the characters are. They may fight really well but under the surface, it\u2019s just another school life. And then they had to add a bit of a underlining story that goes along with the show about the government or something but it just doesn\u2019t seem to fit all that well. And sadly, the government part would be a big spoiler if I explained it so I\u2019m in a little bit of a loss as to how to make this seem like a different show then all the other ones like it. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I have to say is I like Yamato\u2019s undying love for Momoyo Kawakami. He pretty much never really falters in his love for her though he is a major pervert in ways. They had to make it so that he would be going after dirty magazines and movies. I guess it\u2019s a normal high school boy thing but it seriously, it\u2019s a bit overboard. And then there is a point where he gets hurt just because the girls fight over him in one of the most stupid ways. He is a weakling and yet all the girls love him. I\u2019m not against him being skilled in mind but he should be a bit stronger if he\u2019s around those girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is what I would expect from a 21st century anime and like many before that I have reviewed, it really didn\u2019t stand out much. It was nice and rather clean lines with characters looking standard to the moe genre. That is really all I can say about it, its standard. It was made on a computer which means that the art style is pretty much the same as other bright shows. Not saying that every anime is made exactly the same but sometimes means that there is nothing to really talk about other then its good.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are pretty perfect for the characters with none of them really standing out except for me thinking I heard the same voice somewhere else. The same voice actor that does Yamato, Josh Grelle, is also the same one who did Satan in The Devil is a Part-Timer. The person who did Yamoto\u2019s friend Shoichi also did one of the twins in Ouran High School. Things like that stick out for me because it seems that these people were dominating the voice acting industry when these were dubbed. \\n",

Well I'll start with the good things, the things I enjoyed before I get into what is wrong with it.\r\nThe art, beautiful and should be the benchmark level of quality for all anime these days. The character's all looked unique and had their own amazing look about them. \r\nAs an ecchi lover, the straight up nudity and scenes of the 'ecchi' nature were pretty damn good but they're just not enoughto fix the rest of this train wreck.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's talk about story. Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai! actually felt like it was a third season to a long running anime rather than a single season. There were so many things that were 'assumed', that the viewer would know. Not only that, the pacing was absolutely pathetic. When you spend over half of an episode with the same scene of the protagonist getting stomped and trying to convince one of his girls that being naked in front of him wasn't weird, you've got some serious pacing problems with your anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves, not bad, except for the bloody protagonist! The protagonist is, and I quote\\n\\n\r\nThe main figure or one of the most prominent figures in a real situation.\\n\r\nSynonyms\\n\r\nhero\\n\\n\r\nA hero, someone who's prominent, somebody you're supposed to feel emotions for. Compare Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!'s protagonist to Sword Art Online's protagonist, Kirito. Huge emotion coming from him, especially in the novel but I honestly wished Yamato would go ahead and get killed.\\n\r\nOh, you think SAO is too different an anime to Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!? Okay then, let's compare it to Highschool DXD. Issei, again but with a similar position to Yamato, shows far more emotion and is a way more likeable character. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, unless you're just in it for the nudity, NOT worth watching, otherwise, episode 4.

Also, I haven't read the visual novel, so I probably gave it more credit than it deserves.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThis anime has an underlying story that starts somewhere in the middle. The first episode is one that reveals all the characters and is an amazing showcase of animation and lack of plot-like elements. This anime is very much so similar to Highschool DxD in that regard. However, unlike DxD, this anime doesn't fill up the non-story related episodes with something that builds character and insteaduses them for pure fan service.\\n\r\n*SPOILER ALERT maybe* the end of the ending just screamed deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is pretty decent. While I did not enjoy this anime overall, the art and animation were definitely on the brighter side of things.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing too memorable or dis-likable about the soundtrack they used. It was something I ignored for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nWhile I would like to give it lower, Momoyo is one character that I truly liked from beginning to end. She stays true to herself and helps to salvage this anime. The protagonist, however, having been the focal point of the anime is one that is bland and pretty over used. He is pretty useless in comparison to the lovely ladies that surround him and is a complete pervert. His development is THE reason I rated character so lowly. I can't say too much without spoiling anything, so I'll just say the one thing he's supposed to be good at is completely forgotten as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nBetween the pretty art and animation and the irritating characters, that one badass character and irritatingly boring filler this anime is at times enjoyable and at other times made me want to tear my face off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nWhile I haven't read the VN, I definitely bore witness to this tragically awful anime. The fan service is just distracting at times and the lack of ANY plot or character development really dug this anime a deep hole. The redeeming factors are its art, animation and ability to have at least one not irritating character.",

Actually, it makes me pretty addicted to visual novels after play that one.\r\nStory:\r\nIf I haven't played the VN, I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna wondering and goes \"Huh?\". There's no proper introduction of who they are, what their relation is, how can they involved in the war and so on. You have to guess it yourself. One of the reasons why I give a bad score on the story is because, the story doesn't revolves around the \"Kazama Family\". It's only the main characterand the heroines. And it's too many ero scenes. I mean A LOT. It such a big let down if you compare it to the VN. But, I like the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI like the art. The girls are so pretty cute and the guys are cool. This is one of the good sides of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell, I pretty much like the opening and ending song. I like how all of the heroines singing at the ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMan, this is the worst. The main character is a really great tactician in the VN. But here, he's just a shitty hentai. And the girls, how can you have an interest in someone like him. I literally want to cry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, if you're a man you're gonna enjoy this. The battle scenes are pretty cool and the fan services is a wow. They serve it without censor. I don't know if there's a censored version or not. But as an anime lover, it's an okay.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI don't recommend this anime. Only watch this anime if you don't have another collection to watch. I recommend the VN though.",

            "content": "[contains some mild spoilers, some suggestive language, and some comparison to the visual novel]\r\nWhat a slaughter.\r\nMaji de Watashi ni Koishinasai (TV) is one of the two visual novels that was adapted this fall season. In comparison to Mashiro-iro, which was a decent adaptation, MajiKoi\u2019s adaptation was pure shit. In Mashiro\u2019s review, I stated that Mashiro was considered an \u201caverage visual novel\u201d, which made the mediocre storyline understandable. But, MajiKoi doesn\u2019t have the luxury of using the excuse \u201cthe visual novel was bad\u201d, it was considered a great visual novel (8.71@VNDB). In other words, it was a great source with great potential.\r\nNow, why exactly does theadaptation blow? Is it because they adapted it into a generic harem instead of an enjoyable slice of life? Or is it because they completely slaughtered the characters, and developed the cast of respectable female characters into homogenized whores craving the main dude\u2019s dick. Well, it would have to be a mixture of the two; but predominantly the latter.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can understand that Western tastes and tastes in Japan differ. They like excessive fan service, I find it irritating. There\u2019s an obvious difference, but it\u2019s bearable for the most part; it\u2019s not as prominent as it could be. But there\u2019s a limit to everything too. When every other scene is censored due to nudity, it\u2019s basically blatantly insinuating \u201cFuck you, buy the blue-ray release\u201d. It\u2019s probably a really effective way to catalyze sales in my opinion, but it\u2019s still a douche thing to do. That could be ignored if the other aspects of the show was actually adapted decently, but they weren\u2019t. .\\n\\n\r\nMy first major gripe would be the harem aspect of it. The first arc of MajiKoi, before branching out and choosing individual path, was essentially, a slice of life. It\u2019s really extenuating more on friendship then it is with the individual intimate relationships, it\u2019s reminiscent of AnoHana in a way. The main arc in the visual novel basically contains little to no romance and it\u2019s not hindered by infatuation until you begin to branch (but that\u2019s still only with one character). The arc is more than enough to be animated into twelve episodes, it took six hours to read. That\u2019s reading with skipping the majority of the voice acting, basically spamming enter. It\u2019s inevitably understandable on why they would adapt MajiKoi as a harem over a sexless slice of life (It\u2019ll probably sell well), but it was still something that could have been done.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the second gripe that basically ruins the visual novel, is slaughtering the characters. It\u2019s similar to reading a book and developing the \u201cideal archetype\u201d of the character, only to see it getting completely revamped in a movie adaptation. By slaughter, I don\u2019t mean some slight miscalculations, it\u2019s some pretty noticeable stuff. Some pretty notable ones would include the main character, Yamato. Now, in the visual novel, the main character is basically portrayed as an intelligent, devious tactician when it comes to facing everyday challenges; that carries on over in the anime. But in the VN, he wasn\u2019t lusting after his friends, and his philosophies were more complex. In the anime, he was basically painted as a kind person as a kid when it came to taking in Miyako. In the visual novel, he just mentioned that she could stay if she wanted, it wasn\u2019t through any good will, he was a nihilistic kid, I don\u2019t think he really cared. On the other hand, each female in the visual novel had their own individual personality, in the anime, they\u2019re basically homogenized into lusting after the dude(most notably Chris, she hated his devious dishonorable personality initially in the visual novel, however, in the anime, she doesn\u2019t mind it). In the VN, they thought of him as a friend, and nothing more unless you pursued it while branching out.\\n\\n\r\nObjective Score: 2/10. It\u2019s a disappointment. It did one of the worst things you could do in an adaptation, it slaughtered the character. It turned something with little fan service into something based off of fan service. Action was actually the focal centerpiece in the anime, in the novel, it\u2019s more of an underlying theme.\\n\\n\r\nSubjective Score: 4/10: If you didn\u2019t read the visual novel, you might actually like this. Most people reading the visual novel will probably dislike this immensely, it slaughtered the personalities of the majority of the characters. I guess you\u2019ll like this if you like action, boobs, and clich\u00e9 characters (excluding Miyako, she\u2019s basically the only characters that\u2019s pretty damn awesome in both versions, but then again, adapting a chick who\u2019s going after the dude probably wasn\u2019t the hardest in comparison to the rest).",

            "content": "First of all, my purpose writing this review for this anime is to clarify any negative comments about this anime, since so many review saying this anime is horrible because the anime itself didnt really like the VN. really? just for that reason? Honestly, why do people comparing the VN with the anime itself? we're talking about the anime in here not VN. oh god...\r\nWhen i finished this series i was kinda surprised, because the score in MAL itself didnt represent how good this anime was, i dont say this anime was the best but its quite entertaining, that 6.99 is just so UNDERRATED. rememberthat.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen the VN itself but i am not gonna compare it, so i judge this anime purely based on how excited when i watching this anime.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - The story itself , i am not quite sure if this anime have a plot. I though the preview in MAL has explain it all. its about a bunch of girls and some boy who lives in under one roof, they represent theyself as kawakami family (sounds like a mafia, huh?), and the first of the episode you will see a war (yeah a war) which happen like in three kingdoms era. if you're thinking WTF is this, then i said this was an extracurriculer from the school that they attends. Shortly, for me Maji de Watashi is like Angel beats (Bunch of people) + Oda Nobuna (the war from edo era).\\n\\n\r\nAt the first, it would quite hard to follow what happen in this anime since so many things that would make the viewers scratching their head. It cant be helped since, many scenes of this anime is slices of the Visual Novel itself, no wonder if the story is kinda messed up and didnt focus on the plot.\\n\\n\r\nbe reversed from the story itself, The jokes that appears in this anime was really hit the spot, its really funny and quite amusing. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nART - The artwork that the Maji de Watashi have is literally good, its not something that really exaggerate. The biright coloring that they use is pretty much increasing the atmosphere, Colorful scenery, and the character design itself is pretty well made, though the quality is seems a bit lower for the other anime but the art in this anime is still pretty enjoyable to watch. However, sometimes there is a lack in character drawn quality. In some scenes, the character face seems quite been \"distracted\", but thats doesnt really bothering. SO, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTOR - I am really attached by the voice for each character, they really represents the trait of each character, like Momoyo, she is tomboy, and the voice that they present was really like a real tomboy person, heavy voice and yet its cute. and anoher thing that should we mention is Gotou Yuuko. As the voice actor for MAyuzumi Yukie, her voice was so adorable and cute. No matter how many times you hear it, you wouldnt bored and helped to fallin love 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSONG - This is maybe the reason why i love to watch Maji de Watashi. especially the OP song + the animation for the OP itself. \"U-n-d-e-r--STANDING!\" by Endoh Masaaki, Kitadani Hiroshi, Misato Aki is quite catchy rock song, The beats is really hyped up the viewers like me, nor it was perfectly fit with the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Well, its like any other harem anime, we have a tsundere (Christiane Friedrich), Dandere ( Yukie Mayuzum), the energetic one (Kazuko Kawakami), Big boobs (Momoyo Kawakami), and of course the obssesive one (Miyako Shiina) which reminds me of Sacchan in Gintama and for the main lead we have Naoe Yamato, which is very fits for the male lead, he is smart and yet its doesnt easy to tease this guy with the flirt from all the girls and a point plus for this male lead is he is not \"shy\" like any other harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a bunch of unique girls, of course it was the standard of all harem. but somehow i found its really amusing. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION - Basically, its lack of the story like everyone had said. but i am not really like concern about that problem since for me harem anime is just for entertaining, so i score this anime based on how satisfaction i am when i watching this anime, so did i satisfied with this anime? yes it is. its funny and yet admirable, especially for each character. so 8/10 for me.\\n",

Also, I'm a big fan of Asakawa Yuu, she made a great job with Momo, and even when i hate Yuko Goto's voice, she's wonderful with Yukie and Matsukaze.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? well, besides this genre mess, it was a good anime, and I know that the VN is 100% better, but if I have the chance to buy the BDs, I will...",

            "content": "There are basically two types of people who watch anime, Type A and Type B.\r\nI'm going to discuss Type B first because that's probably the main audience for this anime.\r\nType B anime watchers are people who enjoy having loads upon loads of characters, flashy action, costumes, lightsabers transforming robots, service, etc. without needing much reason for it to be present. In short, they don't care, as long as they have as much shit stuffed on the screen as possible, they'll eat it.\r\nIf you fit within that category this anime is for you. I'm not going to try and explain any further because you probablyabandoned any sense of reason a long time ago anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the Type A watchers who place story and development over flashy gimmick, in short, my fellow brothers.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nFrom the start of this anime I knew there was a problem... sub par art and the feeling that nothing was making sense from the very beginning. This was a rip off fusion of the concepts of Baka no Test and Dog Days. No improvement on the material, they manage to fuck it all up from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all there is no clear power gap between Classes S and Classes F. What happened to the classes in the middle? Does the S Class even exist? They seem to be equals, Class F seems to be stronger even, maybe it's because S if further back in the alphabet than F is, I do not know and I do not care.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also some romance plot shoehorned in with characters we have never seen before but are forced to show some sympathy when shown out of nowhere flashbacks that has nothing to do with what was happening at the time. If that's not bad enough, I have a reason to believe there was incest involved to some level. What the fuck does this do to progress the PLOT (word of the fucking day)? I hope they explain it in later episodes if they haven't managed to lose me by then.\\n\\n\r\nWhat peeves me off is that near the end there is a fight and the participants shout names of their special attacks every time they use them. It was pointless and was trying too hard every time they did it. It's alright and when used at the right moment, really cool to yell the name of your finisher move when you do it, just don't shout it for every freaking move that you just pulled out of your ass on the spot.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThis was the first thing that I noticed that let me know this was going to suck. The budget of this anime suddenly became clear and with what came after I began to realize that I had made a mistake somewhere in my life that led into me watching this anime. I look a sigh of disappointment as the cheap animation continued, with latest technology sincere art through anime is possible... They didn't even try. I have seen hentai with better animation than what they have in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThis is always a hard category in a review. This anime makes it harder. What hell do you want me to say? If I was asked I wouldn't even remember if there was even a soundtrack or BGM worth noting. No memorable score, but I have to give it to that robot Cookie. It's voice was kinda cute.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of voices, they have lots of high class seiiyu in this anime. However that does improve anything, it actually worsens it. Sugita Tomozaku could have been doing something worth a shit with his time. Oh well I guess he gotta eat too. I hope he gets paid lots.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nToo many. I am confused, I can't remember any names. We don't learn about any of their pasts, what their dreams are, why they fight. Sure that might follow in later episodes but its unacceptable presenting this crap as the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nPointless filler characters everywhere trying to desperately out categorize TVTropes, when will it end.?! It's retarded, it's as if they're trying to piss me off on purpose. Mission accomplished dickheads.\\n\\n\r\nThey don't even try with the character designs. All the clothing is bland, hair is unoriginal, Kyon is bald, and their personalities are a complete mystery or just the same crap you've seen a hundred times before.\\n\\n\r\nThat red haired eye patch chick, I've seen her in some hentai before... No really, I mean it. I'm more sure of it than the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis was a big waste of time. I stared agonizingly at the run time of this video, groaning every time I checked the progress to see that only thirty seconds had elapsed since I last checked... \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt's too late for me. I've already started this anime and I can't drop it now... I have to endure cause I can't let this shit beat me.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's not to late for you, fellow Type A viewers. Spare yourself the pain and watch something that actually has something to offer. There is nothing for you here, NOTHING, and there probably won't ever be.\\n\\n\r\n\"It might get better as it goes along.\"\\n\\n\r\nBULLSHIT!\\n\\n\r\nThis review was not helpful for your ass. Screw me like this anime did.",

            "content": "What is worse? An anime that sucks from the beginning or an anime with promise that bombs? In my opinion, it's always the latter, because one never invests times in the former.\r\nMaji de Watshi is about a high school dude with no power surrounded by chicks with a lot of it. A plot we've seen a million times. This one is hardly refreshing. The only difference is that this anime tries to make some political statement, but fails in every way imaginable. In the meantime, there's cheap ecchi that's terrible and rehashed episodes within the arc itself so that one's viewing displeasure isn't focused onjust one thing. Awesome, right?\\n\\n\r\nMaji de Watshi is easily one of the worst anime I have ever watched. Not only is the main character rendered so impotent by weakness and stupidity, enough to make Perez Hilton look macho, but at the same time, the story is expecting the viewer to believe he's actually a genius tactician!!! The animation is fine, but the logic is missing in all aspects. One scene actually depicted a girl who is supposed to be able to move quickly enough to fight 5 people at once, shooting a bullet through an arrow AND through the string of the firing bow while in motion. Then, five seconds later, the powerless main character somehow grabs her arm and stun guns her. Epic retarded laziness is the only way to describe this.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no payoff, by the way, if you're looking for something to hope for. It ends as badly as it begins. Avoid... this... show!\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so I've just finish this 12 episode anime, I must say that I generally describe this anime a chaotically crappy for something that is taken from an adult visual PC eroge novel. Ok so before the last 3 episodes I was able to forgive this anime's short comings co'z of the comedy and the ecchi (even though it's censored) things in it and there is this thing that I was hoping that the muchacho (Yamato)  goes for Shiina, however things turned around with a corny ending. All the genres describe for this anime pertains not as a whole, but was divided each ona per episode basis that adds to the chaos, so for the story it is a \"POOR\" number 3.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre number 5.\\n\\n\r\nCo'z the art bears resemblance from another anime \"\"Kimiga Aruiji de Shitsuji Ga Ore De,\" where Kuki Ageha came from.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good number 7.\\n\\n\r\nSince I like both opening and ending themes and I also like the seiyus who did the voices of the female cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor number 3.\\n\\n\r\nOk, let\u2019s go to each of the main characters:\\n\\n\r\nNaoe Yamato- his character has him being a muchacho who prefers brains over brawn; actually he uses 2 heads one on top where he does all his thinking, analyzing and planning and one below his belt where he reads porn on one hand and plays with it.............. I'll leave to your imagination. He's a bit of a letdown co'z everything about his character falls short of expectation, this is due to the fact that everything about his role is a dichotomy:  examples are; he proposes his love for Momoyo in 1st episode but in another episode he makes gestures that he'll be willing to marry Momoyo's sister, Wanko, he has a vast collection of porn paraphernalia, let alone some of his winky flash to Kokoro and yet he\u2019s very reluctant to bang Miyako, his bragging that he prefers brains to brawn yet he ends up being a damsel in distress and what irritates me is his ridiculous and stupid excuse of  giving this anime a corny ending about his pet hermit crabs to his harem. Actually, my rating for this part falls on him.\\n\\n\r\nAs for his harem:\\n\\n\r\nFriedrich Christiane - her character has her to be part of Naoe\u2019s gang and class, she is a fencer by fighting standards. Since this anime has a harem genre in it, her role completes that of a rich tsundere with feelings for the muchacho (Naoe). The author of this anime seems to have limited her assistant Eberbach, Margit to a cameo role; she could have added something for this anime if she would have been made part of the main cast. Friedrich certainly adds certain class and finesse to the harem . By the way, I really hate the way she wore her uniform.\\n\\n\r\nKawakami Momoyo- she's the muchacho's love interest, she's one superb fighter and she's bisexual, it is now establish the she does love the muchacho. Since part of this anime's genre is super powers, it is safe to say that her character is that genre.\\n\\n\r\nKawakami \u201cWanko\u201d Kazuko \u2013 By fighting standards she\u2019s pike man co\u2019z she armed with a naginata, she\u2019s basically completes the harem genre as being wife material to the muchacho (Naoe) as well as an able competition from her elder sister, Momoyo. \\n\\n\r\nMayuzumi Yukie \u2013 Well, obviously she\u2019s a samurai and part of the harem, she\u2019s probably the only member of the muchacho\u2019s harem who\u2019s a bit weird co\u2019z she has a dual personally which compose of; the shy and conservative Yukie and the opinionated and outspoken Matsukaze which is represented by his horse like cell phone strap thing. What makes it more wired is that one can\u2019t determined whether or not if every cast knows about her condition or they just assumed that the horse like thing is has a mind of its own, if this anime has a psychological genre in it, she\u2019ll fit right in.\\n\\n\r\nShiina Miyako- according to info, she was once bullied and was saved by the muchacho during their elementary days. Question, how was she able to become a skilled archer, in a span of just a few years? It is also implied that she\u2019s not just any ordinary archer but she also has the same quick reflexes as all the members of the muchacho\u2019s harem. Frankly she also adds to the muchacho\u2019s dichotomy were it is implied that the muchacho may have a thing for her and yet he shoves her like some stray animal who wanders into his backyard. But one thing about her is that she contributes a lot to the comedy and ecchi genre of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the rest of the muchacho\u2019s gang:\\n\\n\r\nKazama Shiochi, Mooroka Takuya, Minamoto Tadakatsu and Gakuto Shimazu \u2013 well, it is kinda disappointing that the author has just limited the 4 to be support cast whereas \\n\r\nthey have the potential to spice up the anime, however it is only Kazama Shiochi who is the true support cast among the four since he has more air time than the rest whom were just limited to cameo roles.\\n\\n\r\nOthers: \\n\\n\r\nKuki Ageha \u2013 I really don\u2019t get as to why the author has to borrow her from another anime, when he/ she could have just come up with a new character. \\n\\n\r\nCookie \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to make out of that character and so are the rest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Poor number 3.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so as I\u2019ve mentioned this anime is taken from a PC adult eroge visual novel, so it is a PC game, the enjoyment is only on the ecchi and comedy part of the anime which only extents up to the 8th episode and according to another review writer, the anime \u201cMajikoi\u201d didn\u2019t follow the intended arc of the title in fact the title itself  doesn\u2019t fit well and I agree, if we\u2019re to assigned  this title to another anime I\u2019d say that the title  should fit right with \u201cSchool Rumble,\u201d as for the said animes  title \u201cSchool Rumble\u201d I\u2019d say that is more appropriate to be assigned to this anime  since the setting always involves the students of Kawakami Academy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is completely detached from any of the VN routes, is not loyal to the personality of the characters, and is generally not an outstanding anime to begin with.\r\nI would strongly suggest avoiding this one.",

Allright lets make my review short.\r\nStoryline:\r\nI think the first impression of audience is the most important in anime storyline. For my first impression. I was Shocked, the anime started with no clues but more to action and then the development of the story is quite slow.The story has a few flashback,but I think the flashback does not even make me sense anything.(Shocked again).Recently, Ijust discovered the main hero and heroin on the 2nd episode.(Shocked again)\\n\\n\r\nArts:\\n\r\nThe arts ,umm I can only give this anime for 7/10 . I recently watch other anime which is more quality than this one. You can see it by yourself.\\n\r\nP/S: Ro-Kyu-Bu has better quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nToo many character.Sometime I quite confused,who is this and who is that. As the anime is harem anime,no wonder 4 girls is in love with their own brother,which is in love with his older sister.(All of them are siblings..Hahaha)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI dont really enjoy this anime,but as the story is confusing me all the time.At least this anime has the harem,romance, and ecchi elements make it more enjoyable but not the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIts not to late or it maybe too early to judge the anime.I misjudge some other anime by first impression but the end,it was a succesful work.For now,my overall rating for the anime is 8.\\n\\n",

We see each character possessing a clearly unique, dare i say, supernatural ability that seemingly obliterates any hope of the other side winning the interesting battles that are the common theme of this show.  I enjoyed baka test because of it's characters, comedy, and the idea of the battle system.  It was hard of me to find a favorite character and it's only the first episode but for now it will be Miyako eince im a huge archery fan, love the bow.  There isn't one characteri dislike so far, each of them are loveable in their own way.  \\n\r\nMoving into art, it's not the best but it kicks butt and it could have been a lot worse so i'm thankful it's not.  Sound is good, storyline is interesting to say the least, characters are a go, here's to hoping it stays a 10 till the very end, which it probably will since it earned my 10 just from episode one, it can only get better from here!",

Yes, it is an Eroge adaptation. Yes, it looks generic. But I just LOVE it. It's funny. It's enjoyable.\r\nIn additional, I'm a big fan of Itou Shizuka's (Hinagiku Katsura, Haruka Morishima) voice. And Christiane Friedrich (or Chris for short) seems like a character of perfect fit for her. Just your same, awesome Hinagiku, only with a thing for Justince(!!) and a noble bloodline.\r\nIf you'llhave the hots for Chris, I recommend you play her route in the Visual Novel. You won't be left disappointed. She's all innocent, sexy, just, strong, weak, ridiculous, and funny.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give the series a 10, but since we're just 3 episodes in, I'll stay on the safe side and settle for a 9.",

I get goosebumps everytime I see her in the OP)\r\nStory: Like many people have said, it doesnt have a \"story\" per se (at least not yet since theres only 2 episodes). However if you are into the kind of shows that have a lot of ecchi action fights and girls who all adore 1 guy then this show is perfect for you.\r\nPersonally I am more into the harem aspect of the show, the action is just a bonus for me.\r\nArt:Looks very nice. Very bright, and vibrant. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP is really good. I tend to skip OP but due to the fact that Ageha is in it, and that each girl is shown with their trademark abilities/weapons it just draws me in even more. Can't seem to remember the Ending though since I tend to just go to the next episode unless it's the ending of Fairy Tail (The one where Gray is walking alone, that song fits the animation so well)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are the usual bunch. Super Strong leader/object of guys affection but doesnt feel the same way about him, foreign german girl who is not used to the customs of Japan, spunky/cute/optimistic one, Psychotic/obsessed/loves the main guy like no other, shy/flustered/good cook chick.\\n\\n\r\nThis actually reminds me A LOT of Infinite Stratos now that I think about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very enjoyable. I understand how people can either LOVE IT or hate it but I for one am not one of those nitpicky people that dissect shows and analyze every aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nGive me a good story, with good art, cute girls and some romance.

Everyone compares it to the VN, I personally have not played it, so this is an unbiased review. \r\nStory- there really isn't one to speak of, other than trying to beat the former DEVA. It's the basic harem where the girls try to get the guy, but the girls are more forceful than other harems(miyako is my favourite, she would strip naked in public if Yamato asked). The action just from the first episode is so over the top with added superpowers makes it just awesome.\r\nArt- the art is enjoyable,the characters are well drawn, the backgrounds too. The fights, anything involving momoyo, are fast, which all you see is arms going back and forth, so it's like they got lazy. The art isn't amazing, but it's still good.\\n\\n\r\nSound-  it went good with most scenes, the fights had excellent soundtracks, the OP and ED were good but not catchy enough for me\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- they all followed their respective archetypes, but were more or less open with their feelings, except momoyo. With a half season, the show didn't focus on character development but the action aspect of it, each fight being better than the last.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-I watched this show purely for the harem and action that it had. If you don't like this type of anime don't watch it, if u think this is like the VN don't watch it cause u will bitch about it the whole time. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime didn't try to be anything that it wasn't, on the action part, it nailed it, the harem, miyako dull it down and mayu be just a little less awkward, the ecchi was fine, always just in the bath, never in fights to keep focus on the action. It was enjoyable, but it could've been better with 24-26 episodes and a clear choice on who he would choose out of the five.",

As most of the fighting genre anime almost found in Shoenen only or gory like Baki the Anime,  this anime is the only fighting genre might actually combine with romance and ecchi  elements.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I give the artwork 9/10 as I like the way the art was drawn.

            "content": "Ever had a feeling of watching a show that was really close to another? Well I have been having that with this show. This show is much like that and reminds me of Martial Heart although not as bad. Both have school girls fighting duals against other people in many different get ups from kimono\u2019s to bad ass ninja clothing and they all have a different way of fighting. There is also a lot of nudity, the difference though being that the nudity isn\u2019t actually in the fighting. It\u2019s all in the school life drama that unfolds. The school life is just as it soundslike, like every other school life genre with the gags running wild from perverted school mates to love life triangles. \\n\\n\r\nWe have 5 girls all fighting for attention of one man, Yamato. We have the stupid one, the overly perverted one, the shy one, the girl who is from another country, and then the tomboy childhood friend. Sorry but that\u2019s pretty much how each of the characters are. They may fight really well but under the surface, it\u2019s just another school life. And then they had to add a bit of a underlining story that goes along with the show about the government or something but it just doesn\u2019t seem to fit all that well. And sadly, the government part would be a big spoiler if I explained it so I\u2019m in a little bit of a loss as to how to make this seem like a different show then all the other ones like it. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I have to say is I like Yamato\u2019s undying love for Momoyo Kawakami. He pretty much never really falters in his love for her though he is a major pervert in ways. They had to make it so that he would be going after dirty magazines and movies. I guess it\u2019s a normal high school boy thing but it seriously, it\u2019s a bit overboard. And then there is a point where he gets hurt just because the girls fight over him in one of the most stupid ways. He is a weakling and yet all the girls love him. I\u2019m not against him being skilled in mind but he should be a bit stronger if he\u2019s around those girls. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is what I would expect from a 21st century anime and like many before that I have reviewed, it really didn\u2019t stand out much. It was nice and rather clean lines with characters looking standard to the moe genre. That is really all I can say about it, its standard. It was made on a computer which means that the art style is pretty much the same as other bright shows. Not saying that every anime is made exactly the same but sometimes means that there is nothing to really talk about other then its good.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are pretty perfect for the characters with none of them really standing out except for me thinking I heard the same voice somewhere else. The same voice actor that does Yamato, Josh Grelle, is also the same one who did Satan in The Devil is a Part-Timer. The person who did Yamoto\u2019s friend Shoichi also did one of the twins in Ouran High School. Things like that stick out for me because it seems that these people were dominating the voice acting industry when these were dubbed. \\n",

            "content": "Absolutely awful. My god, not sure if I can do over a hundred words for this one but I'll give it a go.\r\nSo what can I say about Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!? Well I'll start with the good things, the things I enjoyed before I get into what is wrong with it.\r\nThe art, beautiful and should be the benchmark level of quality for all anime these days. The character's all looked unique and had their own amazing look about them. \r\nAs an ecchi lover, the straight up nudity and scenes of the 'ecchi' nature were pretty damn good but they're just not enoughto fix the rest of this train wreck.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's talk about story. Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai! actually felt like it was a third season to a long running anime rather than a single season. There were so many things that were 'assumed', that the viewer would know. Not only that, the pacing was absolutely pathetic. When you spend over half of an episode with the same scene of the protagonist getting stomped and trying to convince one of his girls that being naked in front of him wasn't weird, you've got some serious pacing problems with your anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves, not bad, except for the bloody protagonist! The protagonist is, and I quote\\n\\n\r\nThe main figure or one of the most prominent figures in a real situation.\\n\r\nSynonyms\\n\r\nhero\\n\\n\r\nA hero, someone who's prominent, somebody you're supposed to feel emotions for. Compare Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!'s protagonist to Sword Art Online's protagonist, Kirito. Huge emotion coming from him, especially in the novel but I honestly wished Yamato would go ahead and get killed.\\n\r\nOh, you think SAO is too different an anime to Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!? Okay then, let's compare it to Highschool DXD. Issei, again but with a similar position to Yamato, shows far more emotion and is a way more likeable character. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, unless you're just in it for the nudity, NOT worth watching, otherwise, episode 4. You're welcome.",

            "content": "I'll start out by saying that it's really hard to say why I disliked this without spoilers, but I'll do my best. Also, I haven't read the visual novel, so I probably gave it more credit than it deserves.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThis anime has an underlying story that starts somewhere in the middle. The first episode is one that reveals all the characters and is an amazing showcase of animation and lack of plot-like elements. This anime is very much so similar to Highschool DxD in that regard. However, unlike DxD, this anime doesn't fill up the non-story related episodes with something that builds character and insteaduses them for pure fan service.\\n\r\n*SPOILER ALERT maybe* the end of the ending just screamed deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is pretty decent. While I did not enjoy this anime overall, the art and animation were definitely on the brighter side of things.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing too memorable or dis-likable about the soundtrack they used. It was something I ignored for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nWhile I would like to give it lower, Momoyo is one character that I truly liked from beginning to end. She stays true to herself and helps to salvage this anime. The protagonist, however, having been the focal point of the anime is one that is bland and pretty over used. He is pretty useless in comparison to the lovely ladies that surround him and is a complete pervert. His development is THE reason I rated character so lowly. I can't say too much without spoiling anything, so I'll just say the one thing he's supposed to be good at is completely forgotten as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nBetween the pretty art and animation and the irritating characters, that one badass character and irritatingly boring filler this anime is at times enjoyable and at other times made me want to tear my face off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nWhile I haven't read the VN, I definitely bore witness to this tragically awful anime. The fan service is just distracting at times and the lack of ANY plot or character development really dug this anime a deep hole. The redeeming factors are its art, animation and ability to have at least one not irritating character.",

            "content": "I watched the anime and my impression is like \"hmmm... okay...\". I played the visual novel and it's like \"awesome dude...\". Actually, it makes me pretty addicted to visual novels after play that one.\r\nStory:\r\nIf I haven't played the VN, I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna wondering and goes \"Huh?\". There's no proper introduction of who they are, what their relation is, how can they involved in the war and so on. You have to guess it yourself. One of the reasons why I give a bad score on the story is because, the story doesn't revolves around the \"Kazama Family\". It's only the main characterand the heroines. And it's too many ero scenes. I mean A LOT. It such a big let down if you compare it to the VN. But, I like the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI like the art. The girls are so pretty cute and the guys are cool. This is one of the good sides of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWell, I pretty much like the opening and ending song. I like how all of the heroines singing at the ending song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMan, this is the worst. The main character is a really great tactician in the VN. But here, he's just a shitty hentai. And the girls, how can you have an interest in someone like him. I literally want to cry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, if you're a man you're gonna enjoy this. The battle scenes are pretty cool and the fan services is a wow. They serve it without censor. I don't know if there's a censored version or not. But as an anime lover, it's an okay.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI don't recommend this anime. Only watch this anime if you don't have another collection to watch. I recommend the VN though.",

The sound is REALLY funny, and by that I mean, it has some parts in the episode with nudes, but the concept of the english voice is quite funny.
