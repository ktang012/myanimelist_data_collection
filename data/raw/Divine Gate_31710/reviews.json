            "content": "During this period, the anime industry suffers \"Material lacks\". Ideas are getting narrower but productions are getting wider. Many companies suffer to bankruptcy, and to anticipate this they must broaden the marketing ground. In order to broaden it, they throw many adaptations to stabilized the situation. Because of it, there is dozens adaptation appear in various sources. One of those sources is game. But the truth is until this period, not many game adaptation live up to its expectation.\r\nDivine Gate, is a smartphone game developed by Acquire. While the animation is in the hand of Studio Pierrot. As the series went, there are some flawsthat can be spotted.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story goes, they do throw out dozens of information to construct the world building. Unfortunately, it failed. There are too many things unexplained things and the story doesn't start explaining things but keep throwing information dump, hoping the viewer felt a mystery thingy. And if it's too late to explain those things, this can cause a backfire to the plot and can wreck any of the plot elements, make the story felt pointless. All of the elements could be floating in the water without any clear directions. The anime have a hard time to compel dark themes to the story, the truth is the story was failed to bring that feeling. It has terrible exposition and dull storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nNext one is flashbacks. The anime didn't use the flashbacks effectively and producing a slow pacing to the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quite decent, characters have different colorful designs. While there are some scenes using CG, but the fighting scenes still tolerable. The World seems to be set with advanced technology, with robots, gadgets and other futuristic elements occur.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music seems to be mediocre. Seiyuu do their job fairly. There aren't anything that can outshine this anime except the OP theme. It's quite catchy itself.\\n\\n\r\nDivine Gate wanted to be more focused in characterizations than story, they trying to develop the main characters at the early episodes, but it's failed in the execution, the anime more like want to explain how it's their past, not more or less. It tries to blend dark past to the character but failed to relate those past with the story.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 7, I'm totally disappointed by this anime. Divine Gate has a huge number of supporting casts. The bad thing is those characters are not getting any single development. They're purely just a plot device to help the fight more dramatical, which make it more pointless. \\n\\n\r\nDivine Gate is a great example of a pathetic attempt to draws many viewers as quickly as possible. It has been coated into 12 episodes of disaster with forced conclusion in the end. This anime really makes you don't want to watch anime again, so it is obviously not recommended.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is Divine Gate? Even Einstein can't answer this.....\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10",

            "content": "As a player of the original game \"Divine Gate\" who has at least some knowledge on the original story, I had some hope on this series before. Unfortunately, cramming such a convoluted story (involving dozens and dozens of characters, five different worlds, and having probably storylines that couldn't be counted by one hand) that would be otherwise more fitting for a multiple-storyline novel into a 12-episode anime proved to be an absolute disaster.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nIn a nutshell, the story is a kudzu plot full of irregular jumps. Allow me to briefly outline what happened in the first 7 episodes.\r\n1: Introduction and Aoto's flashback\r\n2: Aoto accepting thecall and Akane's flashback \\n\r\n3: Aoto in school and Midori's flashback\\n\r\n4: Blue Christmas \\n\r\n5: The Seconds\\n\r\n6: Divine Gate chores\\n\r\n7: Evil Arthur\\n\\n\r\nThe three flashbacks in EP 1-3, albeit occupying most of the episodes, are unresolved and disconnected to each other. The jump from Blue Christmas to the Seconds to Divine Gate in EP 4-6 is even more of an eyesore, almost like they are merely poorly-placed information dump. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nQuite good. The fighting scene between Aoto and Samidare in EP4 is particularly well done. I deducted some points for the designs of various characters like the Nordic Gods, though (just google their original versions in the game and the anime version, and you will immediately know the graphic decay).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's probably one of the few redeeming features of the adaptation. The OP, one-Me two-Hearts, is a catchy song, and numerous OSTs, like the one playing on Aoto's reflection in EP1 and Midori's one in EP3, also enhanced the otherwise bland scene (which, in my opinion, falls into wangst for the lack of character development as will be described below).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother direct result of squeezing dozens of characters into a 12-episode anime. The first 3 episodes zigzag between Aoto, Akane and Midori's background without even giving us some time to develop sympathy towards them. The various threads are left unwound for the next 4 episodes. Hikari, Yukari and Ginzi are not even properly introduced until EP5 (and then, they are merely shoved away with a \"tell, don't show\" description that will not make any sense to anyone who hasn't know them in the game before). \\n\\n\r\nAnd there are serious problems of \"What happened to the mouse?\" (laconic: characters disappear all a sudden without any apparent addressing) for many characters, like Ifrit, Undine and Sylph, the Seirei-\u014d \u7cbe\u970a\u738b that should be guiding the protagonists; Samidare, the machine that should be in Aoto's possession; so on and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and for the part where Aoto finally addresses Undine by her first name in EP6? I don't even know why that happened all a sudden. Poorly enforced character development.\\n\\n\r\nBut the greatest victims so far are the Knights of Round Table. Amond the 12 members, only probably half of them actually showed up in front of the protagonists, and only Breunor and Bedivere are properly named. Then there comes Episode 7, and we are expected to show some shock and sympathy over their fates...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe random mumbling of K and the ubiquitous poem recitations ruin the scene. End of story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI have dropped this anime, feeling the adaptation will go to nowhere. If the whole thing doesn't even ring a bell to a fan of the original game like me, then its meaning to the general audience is self-explanatory. I can only hope that the game developer will spend more effort back to the original game (irrelevant to the anime, but the rate of update of the game has slowed down considerably after the plan for the adaptation), and that Gungho will learn a lesson for the next adaptation of PADZ.",

            "content": "*spoiler-free*\r\nWhat happens when you bundle up all your favorite anime ideas and tropes and dump them into one anime? While I would say this anime, it is really hard to discern what even happened in this anime to find out, but dissecting it anyways!\r\nStory: All in all, the story is well a mess. Constantly shifting focus from episodes to episode, there really is no clear main character nor main goal in the anime except for the idolized Divine Gate. But a lot of the time, the Divine Gate really just feels like its there and then everyone else is just sobbing about how they wantit. There were a lot of cool concepts from technological sci-fi world with robots and elemental drivers that gave you cool weapons but besides that, the story is too confusing and underdeveloped\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this anime is gorgeous! While it isn't mystifying or particularly memorable or even matching really a certain mood of the anime, the art is clear and polished, and a lot of the character designs and environments appear dazzling. Honestly, the designs of the main characters are great, but they lacked something about them that just would have made it all clicked. Oh right, their actual personalities.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: No character was thoroughly fleshed out. The anime starts off focusing on the woeful life of depressed water boy. Seems ok, but then the anime switches to the two government worker kids, earth girl and fire boy, without much transition and tries to detail us on all the reasons why we should empathize with their sorrow and need of the Divine Gate. Except its all terribly done for such a convincing synopsis idea, there lies little emotion nor compulsion for character actions in both their pasts or the present, so even when we get explanations, they don't make sense or fail to evoke any feelings of compassion.\\n\r\nFurthermore, practically every other character isn't explained at all but the anime tries to make you pity them or understand their warped ideas. The other 3 kids that the anime tries to show off as a contrasting trio? They add NOTHING. They randomly appear, and while they look cool and their contrast is cool, they literally follow the group around, disappear, come back but with opposing mentalities, only to be dragged off the show for an arbitrary reason (like really dumb and random reason). The anime will add a ton of government workers as characters and all of them will have backstories, and unfortunately, none of them are detailed and they all are basically minions until their deaths(?). (so imagine the Angel Beats cast except the useless half is twice as useless). Overall, poor character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: You won't notice the sounds of the anime sadly, because there will be an obnoxious omniscient kid narrator constantly reading you ALL THE CHARACTER AND PLOT DEVELOPMENT, leaving nothing to be characterized by characters' actions, emotions, or backstory. Nope, a dude walking down the street? Suddenly, \"the man felt regret as he walked down the street, alone as he had always been.\" Indirect characterization exists for a reason folks. It makes characters more human and creates an empathy link, but when I'm told that someone hates themselves, it's like k. cool.\\n\r\nBut the opening song is rather catchy and probably the most promising thing of the show. if you only watched the opening music video then you would probably think this anime is really good.\\n\\n\r\nEtc: So a lot of what I just complained about revolves around the fact that the anime tries to be something it is not. It acts like a vague mystery anime, reaching for some salvation and human futility undermined by the Gods (imagine the obscurity of Mekaku City Actors, the confusion of Steins; Gate, and some cool elemental concept of powers. Mush them together with Gorilla Glue and that's what you get), and this causes a lot of characters to be left out because the anime is indecisive. It wants to tug at your heart strings but it also wants you to try to warp your mind around it. It has a cool plot concept which would earn it a solid 7 if it went the typical shounen route or something, but it reached too far and ended up being incomplete. Lots of potential, but it's just a Jack of all trades and a master of none.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You'll find yourself liking the first 3 or so episodes. They're not too bad. But then after that you'll start not comprehending things and things become loose and silly. Character behavior becomes inexplicable and trifle. But you really liked the idea of teens with element-charged weapons fighting similar counterpart adults for a all saving deus ex machina goal, so you keep going. But you won't find anything, just like this anime did, and that is why I give it a 6/10. Most people will find this anime, overall, unenjoyable, regardless of tastes.",

            "content": "(First review and all that so forgive me if there's some stuff I missed or didn't explain correctly).\r\nWhere to begin with this absolute abomination of an anime.\r\nThe story is a convoluted mess. The writing is appalling. The dialogue is awful, and the attempts at being poetic, especially in the first episode, were so cringe worthy it hurt. The story seems to jump between episodes, often giving little explanation as to what the characters are doing, why they're doing it or why the audience should even care. The characters are especially unmemorable, each having their own motivations for finding the 'Divine Gate'. Unfortunately, their reasons areeither unclear, boring or just plain stupid, making it incredibly hard to get invested or root for any one of them. None of the characters are interesting in the slightest, perhaps with the exception of Aoto. (Is he the main character? Is the fire guy? Or green girl? Forgive me for being unable to remember their names, but it seemed to start with the show pushing Aoto as its main character before moving on to the other two then just giving all of them the spotlight without actually doing anything with them. By the end they just seem to exist because they'd already been introduced and the writers couldn't come up with anything more for them to do after the \"plot\" shifted and seemed to focus more on Loki and Arthur and their situations.) Aoto caught my interest in the first episode but then that quickly went downhill when he turned out to be nothing more than a whiny, angsty kid with family issues. The story finishes on a terrible cliffhanger, not solving anything. Please God don't let a second season be made, please.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't terrible but it's nothing to write home about. Battles, when they do happen, aren't difficult to watch and occasionally looked decent. (The battles, for me at least, were the only enjoyable thing about this show but they seemed to fade towards the end). Animation is okay, not particularly impressive. The show looks like an average anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a mixed bag. The OP is fantastic and I never skipped it. (Same goes for Luck & Logic and that show was baaaad too but I digress). Voice acting is okay, but no-one stands out. The soundtrack itself...well, aside from the OP, I can't remember another track, but nothing was terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was an absolute pain to slog through every Friday. 25 minutes of boredom watching angsty teens try and reach this mythical 'Divine Gate', which I'm not sure of what it even does, with rare moments of fun when battles occurred, was not enjoyable, at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf it's not apparent, I hate this show. So, so much. The story is pathetic, the characters boring and it was exactly the opposite of what, I think, anime should be. Enjoyable. Fun to watch. Ah well, at least it gave me a great OP.",

            "content": "Divine Gate is the absolute worst show I've ever had the displeasure of watching to completion, let's go over a rundown of our characters and what they're trying to do.\r\nBefore you go any deeper let me explain that this isn't a review, this is a complete summary of this series and why you should never, NEVER watch it.\r\nI'm not going to bullshit you with any of the plot or on their names either, it's really going to be as bad as it sounds.\r\nThe Divine Gate is basically an all powerful wish granting device and it was used previously to inadvertently tear apart the borders betweenthe realm of the gods, spirits, and Earth.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our protagonist Blue, his \"friends\" Green and Red (yup, those are their names) Blue is the suspect to a very serious massacre that happened years ago but there's an adapter academy that doesn't actually have any classes that wants to recruit him to join their school (adapters are people capable of using supernatural elements). A boy named Arthur is something like the student council president and has The Knights of the Round Table featuring a bunch of ripped off names left and right such as Lancelot. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Arthur was a boy he was sent to some other world to escape something, while here he met a young boy who called himself Santa Clause. Ever since Arthur met Santa he's been bent on restoring order to the world by using the Divine Gate to segregate the realms to their original planes. Arthur seems to be friends with 2 gods that find him interesting for whatever reason and so they say they're \"observers\" of how he plans to go about reaching the Divine Gate; Loki and The Wizard of Oz... The world is run by a \"council\" which doesn't necessarily explain how order is kept. The council isn't against the idea of Arthur seeking out the Divine Gate but pulls more of a \"We don't care if you try to get there, but if you get there we'll have to kick your ass\" kind of approach towards him. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so begins Arthur's adventure to the Divine Gate, naturally he brings all the members of the Knights of the Round Table but also invites our 3 little classmates Blue, Red, and Green. Arthur opens a portal which everyone goes through to start their journey to the Divine Gate which basically is a seemingly endless amount of hallways with additional doors to open until you finally reach the gate. Halfway or so through these endless corridors our heroes are met by the Scandinavian gods, who were sent by the Wizard of Oz with super powered weapons to \"stop\" them from continuing their journey, and so the Wizard of Oz knows just how powerful these gods with these weapons are and knows there's absolutely no chance for them to be defeated. Oz assumed Arthur and friends will turn tail and give up on the Divine Gate, but that doesn't quite happen. they fight their hardest, until just about everyone that's a part of the Round Table becomes a sacrifice to allow Arthur, Blue, Red, Green to continue going through the corridors. The Wizard of Oz finds out the Scandinavian gods killed everyone and starts to act like he's all butt hurt over sending his pals to kill everyone, so then he tries to make things right, by crying about it. After narrowly escaping the Scandinavian gods Arthur and the color brigade have to face the next trial before they can reach the Divine Gate, which is that everyone attempting to reach the gate has to have experienced a massive amount of despair. Arthur is excluded from needing to go through despair, Blue has been through despair his whole life being abused by his family because he wasn't supernaturally gifted \"yet\" while his brother was loved by them, Red thought his father had died in a lab accident, and Green had a childhood friend that wanted to be her \"one and only best friend forever\" and Green was like \"that's too heavy, why can't we just Netflix and chill?\" and her best friend was like \"I don't understand!\" and runs off never to be seen again. so now Loki joins the fray with his pal Shakespeare who has the ability to write a story that traps whoever she wants within an illusion to act out a play. Amidst the entrapment set by Shakespeare, Red meets his deceased father and believes it to actually be him, but then realizes that he was too nice to be his father and dissipates the illusion, as for Green she meets her long lost best friend within the illusion and then realizes it's not her because she said it was fine that they didn't need to be the best of friends. Immediately after breaking free of the illusion, Red is faced with his real father who actually isn't dead and said the council used that as a cover up, but just as they rejoice to find each other again, one of the Scandinavian gods shows up and his dad tells him to escape while he fights off the god, naturally his dad really dies this time right in front of him and he experiences enough despair to reach the gate, then we move on to Green, after her illusion she's confronted by her long lost best friend; who had actually been with the Wizard of Oz this whole time for some reason and changed her name to Dorothy. You know what happens next; that's right, a Scandinavian god shows up and kills her right in front of Green. Blue has to fight to the death against his brother who was the actual culprit of the massacre years ago, but Blue loves his brother he can't just kill him. so then Blue defends himself until he has to retaliate and his brother's all like \"I knew you didn't love me, because you wouldn't let me kill you!\" and then he walks off, so now that everyone has the appropriate amount of despair to get them to look at the Divine Gate they go through the final corridor and reach the gate, the color brigade then uses their powers of despair to open the door to the Divine Gate to let Arthur inside, but soon as he gets in there Loki shows up and now it's time for Arthur to pull out Excalibur and fight Loki off, Arthur loses of course but he's not really hurt, Loki throws down a demonic mind control sword and says \"just grab that sword and everything will be okay\" and of course he picks the sword up after saying \"you won't take control of me!\" and then he gets mind controlled. Soon as he gets mind controlled Lancelot who miraculously survived the onslaught of the Scandinavian gods shows up and runs to Arthur asking how things are going, and mind-control Arthur stabs him through the chest just to make sure none of the Knights of the Round Table survive. The color brigade knows better than to fight against mind control Arthur and Loki so they get outta there real quick and plan to come back for Arthur later.\\n\\n\r\nSo they're back in town and the council knows they got to the Divine Gate and even though they didn't get to use it they're so mad that they're gonna pull the color brigade in for questioning and send them to prison. They had a guy who was like their friend at school who says he's gonna help them explain themselves and so he runs off to see the council, when this fucker comes back he literally brings the swat team to their hiding spot and is like \"JUST TURN YOURSELVES IN YOU CRIMINALS!\" and then Santa Clause shows up through some magic portal for the first time in front of the color brigade to help them gtfo of this mess, the color brigade is like \"how we gonna trust someone named Santa that carries around a bat with nails in it like some delinquent\" and eventually they're like \"alright let's see how this goes\" and then Santa goes berserk mode on the swat team and they get the hell outta dodge.\\n\\n\r\nSanta's got a plan, they're gonna go back to the Divine Gate and rescue Arthur so they go back through the endless corridors and get to the Divine Gate a second time, so they get there and the color brigade is totally talked out of using the Divine Gate because they're told \"is your wish worth changing the entire world?\" because any wish made would have the fabric of the universe change for some reason but then the corridors start to collapse and shit's falling everywhere and so they just up and get the fuck out of there, didn't even save Arthur yet or anything. They're outta there and are greeted by Lancelot and everyone now is just like \"I THOUGHT ARTHUR KILLED THIS GUY?!\" and then he's just like \"Nah, all the Knights of the Round Table are safe too\" after we saw them all die, and then Lancelot's like \"We're gonna get Arthur back though\" then you hear the council say \"The location of the Divine Gate cannot be confirmed.\" \\n\\n\r\nBAM series ended.\\n\\n\r\nThere are slight minor details I skipped over obviously being that I don't want to recall this pile of shit, but I think most of it is right there for you to understand.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you never watch this series because oh my god it was horrible.",

The fact that it was able to surprise without losing consistency and keep on point all while being clear what's going on was a fantastic asset. \r\nThe incorporation of gods and the references to famous medieval people was brilliantly done.\r\nThe show also incorporated the use of Happiness and Despair to a perfect degree. A lot of original Ideas came out of it. No other anime that I have watched has used a plot like that before. \r\nThe only real criticism that can be had here is the deus exrevive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show deserves a 9/10 at worst.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, this anime was the cancer of the Winter 2016 season. How bad could this be you may ask? So bad that I wanted to drop it but continued anyways to write this review so you people would know never to watch this. Well lets continue on with this review.\r\nStory 1/10: \r\nWell this was one of the worst things about this anime. I didn't even understand what the heck was going on during the entire story. Nobody understood what happened in this story from what I could see on the comment sections of KissAnime. It's so hard to follow this story at all. It justjumps all over the place and seems like the writers didn't even care. Nobody cares about half the things that happen in this story too. Even the confusing story of Mekakucity Actors was still better, more straightforward, less confusing, and more interesting than this story. The backstories in this anime are also god awful. They don't make you care for any of the characters at all unlike what a backstory is suppose to do. Even the backstories of the characters of Mekakucity Actors was much better than this. Some other stuff that never made sense in this series was the entire play mini-arc of the series, getting to the divine gate, and like everything else in this series. \\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10:\\n\r\nSo the art wasn't that bad in this anime. It was smooth and pretty beautiful in some scene. For me though, I just could not get used to the unusual art style of this anime and didn't really like it that much but that's just me. Some scenes also look amazing but others just look god awful. Most of the time, it looks decent. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: \\n\r\nSo to be honest I only think that the opening of this anime was good compared to the rest of the sound tracks and the anime for that matter. Maybe it's because the opening is the most prominent song you will hear in this anime but most of this soundtrack is pretty forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10:\\n\r\nOne of the worst things in this anime. Once again like what I did with my Sky Wizards Academy review, I'll go through many of the characters that I can remember.\\n\\n\r\nGreen haired girl:\\n\r\nBoring bland girl with backstory nobody cares about. Kinda annoying and has a normal character design.\\n\\n\r\nRed hair guy:\\n\r\nSome arrogant dude that I would like to see die in a hole. You can't bring yourself to like this kid and for me, I just wished he just died. \\n\\n\r\nAoto:\\n\r\nSo backstory is about being abused by parents and some brother leaving or something like that. 1st part sounds like something from this season *cough* Erased *cough*. Easily forgettable too. \\n\\n\r\nArthur:\\n\r\nBlond dude that wants to go to the divine gate and also makes tons of decisions that doesn't kinda make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nLoki: \\n\r\nOkay so this character is sort of interesting with an interesting character design. Wants to rebuild the world or something for some random reason.\\n\\n\r\nOz: \\n\r\nSome dude that appears for like 15 minutes in the entire show and you really don't care about him. He apparently is some sort of god but I don't really know due to this anime not explaining anything\\n\\n\r\nDorothy:\\n\r\nSome childhood friend of the green haired girl. Don't really care about him and has some personality shift from the past to the present. Loved by Oz apparently. \\n\\n\r\nRed haired guy father:\\n\r\nSome guy who appears for 10 minutes in the entire anime and it expects you to love him and care about him. Don't even bother.\\n\\n\r\nAoto's brother: \\n\r\nAppears again for like 10 minutes and you don't care about him. \\n\\n\r\nNordic gods:\\n\r\nOkay so these people would have been interesting but they are sadly wasted and just put on the sides to die. \\n\\n\r\nElemental teacher people:\\n\r\nSo 3 girls that you don't care about at all. \\n\\n\r\nShakespeare: (yeah there is someone named Shakespeare in this)\\n\r\nSome random green haired girl that comes out of nowhere and you probably will not care about at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of Arthur's army: \\n\r\nThe army of Arthur that appears for like 2 episodes and you will never care about even though the anime tries hard to make you love them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10:\\n\r\nThis anime was a drag to watch. The first few episodes may have been interesting but it fell off and was like watching Sky Wizards Academy again. The ending of episode 12 also made me rage. If you ever watch it which I recommend you don't you will want to kill yourself if you watched everything and didn't skip to the end. Don't even attempt it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10:\\n\r\nSome of the most important parts of an anime, the story, characters, and the enjoyment of it really bring this anime down. The art and the sound though help to bring it up to something better than the absolute worst of the worst. Please save the time you have and watch something that is not this piece of crap.",

This review will be spoiler free.\r\nStory: With an immediate sense of who the characters are at heart and their troubles in the past Divine Gate really gets you excited quickly. Any parts of the story that seem unclear are explained efficiently with the flashbacks in the episodes to come as the flashbacks are few in number and are highly informative. The story follows multiple characters and their own personal grief and what they haveto do to rid themselves of the guilt that has swallowed them. This is all done with the help of the expert writers at the forefront of this anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Words cannot describe the beauty that this shows art style has. The mixing of 2D and 3D make the fight scenes not only entertaining but interesting to watch and then re-watch later. I've never seen an art style capture the story within it so well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack of Divine Gate really made me hyped up during the battles that happen throughout. While I'm not much of a sound critic in particular I will say that the music during the battles was quite enjoyable. The opening is quite amazing I have downloaded it on to my phone and wish to play it on the piano.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: They're all great, every single one. I'm not a huge fan of Akane but having someone that you don't like as much really shows why the others shine so brightly KEK sorry Akane.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review and I hope it made you want to go out there and watch Divine Gate right away! It will not be a mistake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, BGdealer",

The idea was nice but they failed in developing it. I couldn't tell what they wanted to do with it because it was so chaotic.\r\n- The art was.. how to say it.. it wasn't bad or good.. it had some 3D effects too... but I didn't really enjoy it.\r\n- About sound - I liked both opening and ending. The seiyuu and sound tracks weren't bad too..\r\n-The characters were pathetic, very pathetic. It's not that It had poor character development, It hadn't it at all. They were just put there with no character. Maybe they had a history behind them but for me they looked like dolls without souls.\\n\\n\r\nI was watching this with thinking - when it will end?

            "content": "Divine Gate is, by any means, not \"divine\" at all.\r\nThe story is your run-of-the-mill \"let's obtain the MacGuffin\" (that being the Gate) plot line, which really has no impact all the way through the end. The first half is establishing the back stories of the main characters that has no payoff. There was hardly any \"search\" for the Gate in the first place. The ending was just a jumbled mess with an anti-climax that I didn't bother caring about anyway. Plus, there is a literal \"deus ex machina\" in the finale (if you've seen it, you'll understand).\r\nWith characters, the only thing I liked about themwere the concepts. They have names based on things like color, the gods, medieval, and even the Wizard of Oz. That's all I liked about them. As actual characters, they're bland. For the ones that get the back story treatment, like I mentioned before, have these payoffs that are mediocre and are put to the side like it was nothing. Speaking of, there are there set of characters that were given no purpose whatsoever. They're supposed to be \"important\", but in reality are completely useless.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is probably the only thing that's eligible for praise. I liked the character designs and the color schemes used for each. There is also a strange but interesting blend of 2D and CG in this. While, for the most part, the characters are 2D, scenes where they fight are done with CG models, and it's not distracting at all. Also, the background is done in this CG that looks like an old computer game, and I liked that contrast between that and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStill, with uninteresting characters, a story that is rushed about halfway through, and overused themes that come off as pretentious, Divine Gate is like the big finale of firework that turn out to be a weak little \"pop\" (that's the only kind of metaphor I can come up with).",

It was okay, but there are times where it seems that they have dragged on for too long.\r\nCharacters 7/10: There was a lot of characters that are introduced in the series. They have cool powers called \"Drivers\" & they are based on the elements (like Earth, Fire & Water). Akane is honest and straight-forward. His Driver is the power of FIRE. Aoto is very distant and monotone. His driver involves the power ofWATER. Midori is very cheerful and happy. Her driver has the power of WIND. There are also some references to the medieval timeline & fairy tales (i.e.: Shakespeare, King Arthur & Lancelot, Loki & Oz -- who I'm pretty sure is has a contemporary look/reference to the Wizard of Oz). There was a really cool character development on the main characters that explores their past & reasons of going to the Divine Gate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment 6/10: As I said previously, a lot can happen in 12 episodes! I enjoyed watching it. It was ok. I just don't like seeing the good guys dying. I hope there is a season 2 that can let us continue seeing the characters grow and see their fates afterwards. There's a lot of sad moments and action scenes that makes you shocked but wanting to continue finishing the series.",

Basically the most important part for this anime to be goodwas bad, the only way to save this anime was the course of the story, that didn't saved it al all, also this is not a complete anime, it doesn't ends the story, it ends urging a new season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has some 3D aspects, they are not bad, but neither are OK, I would say they are mediocre, 3D animation actually is something that usually doesn't please people, so that makes it worse for the anime image, even the 2D animation is not good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, if I have to say I think it is the only thing that is actually \"good\" of this anime, the OP is pretty good, the ED is good, the OST are fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty bad though, they have bad motivations, they have strange pasts, and made strange choices all their life, the protagonist is very dumb though, he is always blaming himself for things he didn't do, there are characters that according to MAL are main characters, but they hardly appear, I really can't understand it, the others main characters are not bad, but also not good.\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoyed this anime, don't really know why I watched it until the final, I think in the two or three last episodes I was curious about what would happen, maybe that's a good point about this anime, I recommend you not to watch it unless you really have nothing to do.\\n\\n",

I would like to state this show is pretty much a waste of time to watch. if you have seen a trailer it might look pretty animation wise but does not cover the hot mess this show is. \r\nStory 2/10\r\nThe first two episode where ok story wise but what followed those two episode where the following problems. The only story the viewer are interested in after watching the first two episodes is the story of Aoto. However they decided tomike in a load of subplots and introduce a load of characters over the course of the ten episodes that follow. Other problems include pacing that was extremely fast and loads of flashbacks that don't help the viewer understand the characters better but only make things more confusing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nthe only plus with this series is its art style. In the first few episode its ok however in other episodes some of the art is lacking. Character designs are also the only plus with the series however looking cool didn't make the characters any more interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10 \\n\\n\r\nsome of the sound effects used seemed highly repetitive while the opening being the only decent song in the ost. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series had a lot of characters with a lot being introduced  especially in the middle episodes. It felt like the plot was just introducing characters in general. The three mcs who take most of the screentime are introduced in the first episode as confident heroes who are going to battle a lot of enemies while in a majority of the series they just stand around and watch other characters just introduced fight. The bad guys like the good guys are introduced in large numbers and not seen again till the end except for the villain loki. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished the show I was happy It was done in hope of something better will take its slot next season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n",

Let's get the first problem out of the way, this anime is up it's own ass pretentious grandiose bullshiting it's characters and plot all together, what does LA mean by this?, well mostof the main cast members get their character development and backstories told in some of the most pretentious and on-the-wall annoying trying desperately to sound grandiose that they strip the plot and plot armor down to outright boring and pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nLA gets it we have the Akane voiced by ''Tetsuya Kakihara'' the fiery-hot head with daddy issues and he has the element of fire, Midori voiced by ''Kanae Ito'' the wind user with friendship issues with one of her childhood friends and is the typical genki girl but is really depressed and finally we have Aoto voiced by ''Soma Saito'' the water user who had a typical tragic backstory just thrown at us over and over and over and over and over and over and OVER again ohh did LA mention he's a water user and doesn't even eat anything hot...just god damn really?.\\n\\n\r\nSee what LA means by on-the wall annoying?. Divine Gate also has terrible pacing issues from trying to go into too much detail about the characters to hardly telling us what \"Divine Gate\" even is besides a generic wishmaker that wishes it was the Holy Grail from ''Fate/Zero''.\\n\\n\r\nDivine Gate is more worried and focused on it's characters backstory that they hardly give any focus on the plot at hand and when they do, they rush that to no end, LA NEVER got invested in ANY of these characters, the closest character LA got to like was Midori only because everyone else wasn't the depressed elemental idiots they embodied and even before the halfway point even Midori got succumbed to it that LA just gave up on characters altogether, how about the fact that there is a group of characters that later on get killed off for dramatic purposes only for the anime to forget that we hardly knew them so in terms of plot progression or character development from that group were almost meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the animation was at the very least by Studio Pierrot decently animated although there were times where the battle scenes go into 3D CGI for no good reason, however even with the \"decent\" animation it doesn't help solve the utter trainwreck of plot and characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending?...well that's a laugh, making characters deaths pretty much moot and the entire ending just circle-jerks you into caring but it just becomes pointless and just telling a dumb message of \"we control our own fates\"...and making the vaguest mess of a rushed climax against the main villain it just leads to this entire anime being JUST POINTLESS.\\n\\n\r\nDivine Gate for LA is by far thee WORST anime for the Winter of 2016, it has rushed pacing to no end, grandiose character development too cliched it's pretentious that by that end almost worthless characters to get invested in and lots of minor characters that get the axe just for sympathy points. We get it Divine Gate, your trying to be symbolic, however when that symbolism is soo blatant and pretentious that's what makes you boring and annoying as hell, that's why your the worst anime of Winter 2016 for LA.",

            "content": "Every season, you\u2019ll have at least one anime that is terrible and has a good amount of people watching it. This season, it\u2019s Divine Gate. There are anime that no words can describe them. Divine Gate fall into that category, not because it\u2019s good, but because it\u2019s halfheartedly made that I can\u2019t explain how lazy it is. Its narrative is uninteresting, the characters are outrageously poorly-written, and the plot is all over the place. When the best thing about your anime is the OP, you know there\u2019s something wrong with that anime. It\u2019s better off as smartphone game, because the anime is nothing short ofpretentious. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise about some large organization or something that wants to find something called the \u201cDivine Gate\u201d, which is apparently a myth. They need to find the gate for the sake of finding the gate\u2026 nothing more. A bunch of teenagers were chosen to find the gate, because it\u2019s definitely a smart idea to send kids to find something hard, instead of adults. The premise isn\u2019t anything special, however they could have gone somewhere from here, but unfortunately no. The execution is extremely poor. The plot twists, if you can even call them one, are pathetically written. I couldn\u2019t care less about what was going on in this anime. Every time I watched an episode, it felt like I missed an episode since it feels all over the place. And there\u2019s so many things that were left unresolved that it\u2019s ridiculous. It better not get a second season, because I rather have a terrible anime with loose ends, rather than a terrible anime with twice the content. And the funniest thing is that Divine Gate is filled with info dumps, yet, so many things weren\u2019t even properly explained. What the hell is the Divine Gate? Why did edgy MC-kun see it when he was little? Who the hell is that kid that follows MC-kun? Why do most characters wear clothes that match their hair? Was it some kind of trauma they got? Did they forget about MC\u2019s brother at the end? \\n\r\nStory: 1.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nI normally don\u2019t want to call an anime pretentious because I don\u2019t know what the studio were keeping in mind when making an anime, but I have a strong feeling that Divine Gate is definitely pretentious. The anime tries so, so, SO hard in making it looks edgy and dark. It only took 5 minutes for me to realize that this is pretentious. That\u2019s even longer than the time it took for me to realize Bubuki Buranki\u2019s completely CGI. When an anime makes you laugh harder than KonoSuba when characters are dying, you know that there\u2019s something wrong. That\u2019s the only enjoyment I got from this anime \u2013 comedy. The flashbacks for characters are so poor. They just feel tragic for the sake of being tragic. The direction was so bad that had to search up whether or not Divine Gate was given a director. And even if it had a director, he either must be a goat or a newbie director. The director is actually someone who was called GOAT by some people for directing Bleach, Great Teacher Onizuka, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Kuroshitsuji\u2019s better seasons. Abe-san, where did you go wrong?\\n\r\nPresentation: 1.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nIf you think that characters can be a redeeming point after all that, you\u2019re wrong. The characters are so clich\u00e9, poor-written, and outrageously plot-device-y that you can\u2019t help but cringe. The main character, Aoto, Is literally one of the most pretentious characters out there. He\u2019s given such a tragic backstory just to make him a tragic character. When they showed his flashback, how he was treated like a dog by his parents while his brother was treated like a god, I laughed hard enough to almost suffocate myself. I wondered to myself am I just a sick, sadistic person, or is this anime so bad it\u2019s funny? I guess it\u2019s the latter. He\u2019s so edgy that it feels like this anime is lighthearted. And his behavior is so damn inconsistent. For most of the part, he acts all gloomy and depressed, however, at times, he seems like his enjoying thing and he never went through that tragic past. What\u2019s going on with that character? Then you have Akane, some dude with daddy issues for 80% of the anime, until suddenly in 1 minute, his personality changes to a daddy\u2019s boy. Talk about sudden. And then you have Midori, some chick whose tragic past happens to do something with her best friend. Then you have other characters that you\u2019ll never remember their names because it\u2019s easier to call them by their hair color rather than searching them up online. There\u2019s a moment in the anime where they introduce a large cast of characters and killed them off the next second. Am I supposed to be emotionally attached to these characters? I\u2019m sure the main characters in this anime are attached so should I be too? When the anime ends and shows off their huge cast of characters\u2019 normal lives, I wonder to myself\u2026 who the hell are these people? They\u2019re that forgettable.\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to say the art is bad because Studio Pierrot is behind this anime, because they can do good stuff when they care. However, this anime\u2019s art just felt lazy, and the studio tries to cover it up. The art style is really different, but that doesn\u2019t make it better. It certainly makes the anime look more dark and edgy, and also pretentious at the same time. The shading and shadows are downright terrible. The shading should make the colors slowly get darker, not one color and then suddenly black. Look at the characters\u2019 hair for example; it feels like shading it bitmapped onto their hair. The anime will have lighting directly pointed at shadows, but the shadows still remain. Do they even physics? And the backgrounds are pretty lame too. A lot of the time, they use a solid color with so shading. That\u2019s it. Come on, even I can do better with MS Paint.\\n\r\nArt: 3.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations aren\u2019t too bad in Divine Gate. It\u2019s not very good either. The action animations don\u2019t impress at all. A lot of the fights are CGI heavy and they\u2019re distracting since they\u2019re not that well done. It can look really messy at times. And when they\u2019re not using CGI during action scenes or fights, it just looks very unorganized and cruddy. The flow between frames are pretty bad. However, the normal scenes in Divine Gate don\u2019t looks too bad. It\u2019s not mind blowing, but it works. It\u2019s sad that above average animation is one of the highlights of Divine Gate. However, this might just be one of Studio Pierrot\u2019s laziest work\u2026 and that\u2019s saying a whole lot about Divine Gate. \\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Divine Gate isn\u2019t bad nor good, just average. Saito Soma does Aoto averagely. He\u2019s able to make his character sound as edgy and pretentious as the script wants him to be. For most of the time, he sounded uninterested in his role and I don\u2019t blame him. Kakihara Tetsuya does Akane, who does a better job than most of the other seiyuu in Divine Gate. He shouldn\u2019t spent his talent on something else though. Then there\u2019s Itou Kanae who does Midori, and she also does alright, but she did make her character feel irritating at times, but that might just be the scripts fault. Some really talented seiyuu, such as Ishida Akira and Nakamura Yuuichi, are in minor roles, which is disappointing because they can make the anime more enjoyable. Most of these seiyuu feel disinterested when voice acting probably because they also can\u2019t feel for these character. However, the voice acting isn\u2019t bad because at least it didn\u2019t make my ears bleed, but the dialogues sure did (and that\u2019s the presentation that\u2019s lacking).\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nFinally, the best part about Divine Gate \u2013 the OP. The OP, \u201cone-Me two-Hearts\u201d, isn\u2019t just the best thing about this anime, but one of the best things about this season. The OP is a personal favorite of mine as it really makes my mood. However the rest of the episode doesn\u2019t. Just listen to the OP, then drop this anime as if it\u2019s hotter than the sun. The ED, \u201cCONTRAST\u201d, is alright. It\u2019s nothing to special, but it doesn\u2019t hurt when you listen to it. However, Divine Gate can never be good in a category as there\u2019s one major flaw in its music, which is its background music. The background music is very lackluster and they don\u2019t help to make scenes better, but only worse. When something emotional is happening, but instead you\u2019re laughing, the music only adds to the comedy with its overdramatic music. Even the music is pretentious. \\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re wondering whether or not I enjoyed Divine Gate, how can you possibly think that after I barely said anything good about this anime. For half of the time, this anime feels so boring and makes you lose your purpose in life. For the other half of the time, makes you laugh, even though the anime doesn\u2019t want you to. Divine Gate sets the standard high for overly pretentious and unnecessarily edgy anime. Every Friday I was excited to see the new Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ajin episode, but Divine Gate always made my day bad. It\u2019s not like this was destined to be bad. The premise can go somewhere, but the execution is just so, so poor that I couldn\u2019t care less about the plot or characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Divine Gate is definitely not worth your time at all. Save yourself the pain and trouble by skipping this one from this season. The narrative is terrible as I didn\u2019t even know what was going on for most of the time. The characters are tragic for the sake of being tragic and their behaviors are so inconsistent. The art style is just a way for the studio to hid their lazy work. This anime is one of the most pretentious (I used this work ten times so far for a reason) piece of entertainment. Search up the OP, listen to it, and never turn back. That\u2019s the only thing you need from this anime. \\n\\n\r\n+ The OP is really good and catchy \\n\r\n- Overly pretentious content that tries to be a tragedy but ends up being a comedy\\n\r\n- Characters are poorly written, inconsistent in their actions, and lack emotional impact.\\n\r\n- Narrative is uninteresting, all over the place, and leaves too many plot holes.\\n\r\n- Art style is pathetic and backgrounds and character designs are lazy.\\n\r\n- Overdramatic music just adds to the lameness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.9/10",

            "content": "During this period, the anime industry suffers \"Material lacks\". Ideas are getting narrower but productions are getting wider. Many companies suffer to bankruptcy, and to anticipate this they must broaden the marketing ground. In order to broaden it, they throw many adaptations to stabilized the situation. Because of it, there is dozens adaptation appear in various sources. One of those sources is game. But the truth is until this period, not many game adaptation live up to its expectation.\r\nDivine Gate, is a smartphone game developed by Acquire. While the animation is in the hand of Studio Pierrot. As the series went, there are some flawsthat can be spotted.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story goes, they do throw out dozens of information to construct the world building. Unfortunately, it failed. There are too many things unexplained things and the story doesn't start explaining things but keep throwing information dump, hoping the viewer felt a mystery thingy. And if it's too late to explain those things, this can cause a backfire to the plot and can wreck any of the plot elements, make the story felt pointless. All of the elements could be floating in the water without any clear directions. The anime have a hard time to compel dark themes to the story, the truth is the story was failed to bring that feeling. It has terrible exposition and dull storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nNext one is flashbacks. The anime didn't use the flashbacks effectively and producing a slow pacing to the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quite decent, characters have different colorful designs. While there are some scenes using CG, but the fighting scenes still tolerable. The World seems to be set with advanced technology, with robots, gadgets and other futuristic elements occur.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music seems to be mediocre. Seiyuu do their job fairly. There aren't anything that can outshine this anime except the OP theme. It's quite catchy itself.\\n\\n\r\nDivine Gate wanted to be more focused in characterizations than story, they trying to develop the main characters at the early episodes, but it's failed in the execution, the anime more like want to explain how it's their past, not more or less. It tries to blend dark past to the character but failed to relate those past with the story.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 7, I'm totally disappointed by this anime. Divine Gate has a huge number of supporting casts. The bad thing is those characters are not getting any single development. They're purely just a plot device to help the fight more dramatical, which make it more pointless. \\n\\n\r\nDivine Gate is a great example of a pathetic attempt to draws many viewers as quickly as possible. It has been coated into 12 episodes of disaster with forced conclusion in the end. This anime really makes you don't want to watch anime again, so it is obviously not recommended.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is Divine Gate? Even Einstein can't answer this.....\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10",

            "content": "As a player of the original game \"Divine Gate\" who has at least some knowledge on the original story, I had some hope on this series before. Unfortunately, cramming such a convoluted story (involving dozens and dozens of characters, five different worlds, and having probably storylines that couldn't be counted by one hand) that would be otherwise more fitting for a multiple-storyline novel into a 12-episode anime proved to be an absolute disaster.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nIn a nutshell, the story is a kudzu plot full of irregular jumps. Allow me to briefly outline what happened in the first 7 episodes.\r\n1: Introduction and Aoto's flashback\r\n2: Aoto accepting thecall and Akane's flashback \\n\r\n3: Aoto in school and Midori's flashback\\n\r\n4: Blue Christmas \\n\r\n5: The Seconds\\n\r\n6: Divine Gate chores\\n\r\n7: Evil Arthur\\n\\n\r\nThe three flashbacks in EP 1-3, albeit occupying most of the episodes, are unresolved and disconnected to each other. The jump from Blue Christmas to the Seconds to Divine Gate in EP 4-6 is even more of an eyesore, almost like they are merely poorly-placed information dump. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nQuite good. The fighting scene between Aoto and Samidare in EP4 is particularly well done. I deducted some points for the designs of various characters like the Nordic Gods, though (just google their original versions in the game and the anime version, and you will immediately know the graphic decay).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's probably one of the few redeeming features of the adaptation. The OP, one-Me two-Hearts, is a catchy song, and numerous OSTs, like the one playing on Aoto's reflection in EP1 and Midori's one in EP3, also enhanced the otherwise bland scene (which, in my opinion, falls into wangst for the lack of character development as will be described below).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother direct result of squeezing dozens of characters into a 12-episode anime. The first 3 episodes zigzag between Aoto, Akane and Midori's background without even giving us some time to develop sympathy towards them. The various threads are left unwound for the next 4 episodes. Hikari, Yukari and Ginzi are not even properly introduced until EP5 (and then, they are merely shoved away with a \"tell, don't show\" description that will not make any sense to anyone who hasn't know them in the game before). \\n\\n\r\nAnd there are serious problems of \"What happened to the mouse?\" (laconic: characters disappear all a sudden without any apparent addressing) for many characters, like Ifrit, Undine and Sylph, the Seirei-\u014d \u7cbe\u970a\u738b that should be guiding the protagonists; Samidare, the machine that should be in Aoto's possession; so on and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and for the part where Aoto finally addresses Undine by her first name in EP6? I don't even know why that happened all a sudden. Poorly enforced character development.\\n\\n\r\nBut the greatest victims so far are the Knights of Round Table. Amond the 12 members, only probably half of them actually showed up in front of the protagonists, and only Breunor and Bedivere are properly named. Then there comes Episode 7, and we are expected to show some shock and sympathy over their fates...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe random mumbling of K and the ubiquitous poem recitations ruin the scene. End of story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI have dropped this anime, feeling the adaptation will go to nowhere. If the whole thing doesn't even ring a bell to a fan of the original game like me, then its meaning to the general audience is self-explanatory. I can only hope that the game developer will spend more effort back to the original game (irrelevant to the anime, but the rate of update of the game has slowed down considerably after the plan for the adaptation), and that Gungho will learn a lesson for the next adaptation of PADZ.",

            "content": "*spoiler-free*\r\nWhat happens when you bundle up all your favorite anime ideas and tropes and dump them into one anime? While I would say this anime, it is really hard to discern what even happened in this anime to find out, but dissecting it anyways!\r\nStory: All in all, the story is well a mess. Constantly shifting focus from episodes to episode, there really is no clear main character nor main goal in the anime except for the idolized Divine Gate. But a lot of the time, the Divine Gate really just feels like its there and then everyone else is just sobbing about how they wantit. There were a lot of cool concepts from technological sci-fi world with robots and elemental drivers that gave you cool weapons but besides that, the story is too confusing and underdeveloped\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this anime is gorgeous! While it isn't mystifying or particularly memorable or even matching really a certain mood of the anime, the art is clear and polished, and a lot of the character designs and environments appear dazzling. Honestly, the designs of the main characters are great, but they lacked something about them that just would have made it all clicked. Oh right, their actual personalities.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: No character was thoroughly fleshed out. The anime starts off focusing on the woeful life of depressed water boy. Seems ok, but then the anime switches to the two government worker kids, earth girl and fire boy, without much transition and tries to detail us on all the reasons why we should empathize with their sorrow and need of the Divine Gate. Except its all terribly done for such a convincing synopsis idea, there lies little emotion nor compulsion for character actions in both their pasts or the present, so even when we get explanations, they don't make sense or fail to evoke any feelings of compassion.\\n\r\nFurthermore, practically every other character isn't explained at all but the anime tries to make you pity them or understand their warped ideas. The other 3 kids that the anime tries to show off as a contrasting trio? They add NOTHING. They randomly appear, and while they look cool and their contrast is cool, they literally follow the group around, disappear, come back but with opposing mentalities, only to be dragged off the show for an arbitrary reason (like really dumb and random reason). The anime will add a ton of government workers as characters and all of them will have backstories, and unfortunately, none of them are detailed and they all are basically minions until their deaths(?). (so imagine the Angel Beats cast except the useless half is twice as useless). Overall, poor character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: You won't notice the sounds of the anime sadly, because there will be an obnoxious omniscient kid narrator constantly reading you ALL THE CHARACTER AND PLOT DEVELOPMENT, leaving nothing to be characterized by characters' actions, emotions, or backstory. Nope, a dude walking down the street? Suddenly, \"the man felt regret as he walked down the street, alone as he had always been.\" Indirect characterization exists for a reason folks. It makes characters more human and creates an empathy link, but when I'm told that someone hates themselves, it's like k. cool.\\n\r\nBut the opening song is rather catchy and probably the most promising thing of the show. if you only watched the opening music video then you would probably think this anime is really good.\\n\\n\r\nEtc: So a lot of what I just complained about revolves around the fact that the anime tries to be something it is not. It acts like a vague mystery anime, reaching for some salvation and human futility undermined by the Gods (imagine the obscurity of Mekaku City Actors, the confusion of Steins; Gate, and some cool elemental concept of powers. Mush them together with Gorilla Glue and that's what you get), and this causes a lot of characters to be left out because the anime is indecisive. It wants to tug at your heart strings but it also wants you to try to warp your mind around it. It has a cool plot concept which would earn it a solid 7 if it went the typical shounen route or something, but it reached too far and ended up being incomplete. Lots of potential, but it's just a Jack of all trades and a master of none.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You'll find yourself liking the first 3 or so episodes. They're not too bad. But then after that you'll start not comprehending things and things become loose and silly. Character behavior becomes inexplicable and trifle. But you really liked the idea of teens with element-charged weapons fighting similar counterpart adults for a all saving deus ex machina goal, so you keep going. But you won't find anything, just like this anime did, and that is why I give it a 6/10. Most people will find this anime, overall, unenjoyable, regardless of tastes.",

            "content": "(First review and all that so forgive me if there's some stuff I missed or didn't explain correctly).\r\nWhere to begin with this absolute abomination of an anime.\r\nThe story is a convoluted mess. The writing is appalling. The dialogue is awful, and the attempts at being poetic, especially in the first episode, were so cringe worthy it hurt. The story seems to jump between episodes, often giving little explanation as to what the characters are doing, why they're doing it or why the audience should even care. The characters are especially unmemorable, each having their own motivations for finding the 'Divine Gate'. Unfortunately, their reasons areeither unclear, boring or just plain stupid, making it incredibly hard to get invested or root for any one of them. None of the characters are interesting in the slightest, perhaps with the exception of Aoto. (Is he the main character? Is the fire guy? Or green girl? Forgive me for being unable to remember their names, but it seemed to start with the show pushing Aoto as its main character before moving on to the other two then just giving all of them the spotlight without actually doing anything with them. By the end they just seem to exist because they'd already been introduced and the writers couldn't come up with anything more for them to do after the \"plot\" shifted and seemed to focus more on Loki and Arthur and their situations.) Aoto caught my interest in the first episode but then that quickly went downhill when he turned out to be nothing more than a whiny, angsty kid with family issues. The story finishes on a terrible cliffhanger, not solving anything. Please God don't let a second season be made, please.\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't terrible but it's nothing to write home about. Battles, when they do happen, aren't difficult to watch and occasionally looked decent. (The battles, for me at least, were the only enjoyable thing about this show but they seemed to fade towards the end). Animation is okay, not particularly impressive. The show looks like an average anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a mixed bag. The OP is fantastic and I never skipped it. (Same goes for Luck & Logic and that show was baaaad too but I digress). Voice acting is okay, but no-one stands out. The soundtrack itself...well, aside from the OP, I can't remember another track, but nothing was terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was an absolute pain to slog through every Friday. 25 minutes of boredom watching angsty teens try and reach this mythical 'Divine Gate', which I'm not sure of what it even does, with rare moments of fun when battles occurred, was not enjoyable, at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf it's not apparent, I hate this show. So, so much. The story is pathetic, the characters boring and it was exactly the opposite of what, I think, anime should be. Enjoyable. Fun to watch. Ah well, at least it gave me a great OP.",

            "content": "Divine Gate is the absolute worst show I've ever had the displeasure of watching to completion, let's go over a rundown of our characters and what they're trying to do.\r\nBefore you go any deeper let me explain that this isn't a review, this is a complete summary of this series and why you should never, NEVER watch it.\r\nI'm not going to bullshit you with any of the plot or on their names either, it's really going to be as bad as it sounds.\r\nThe Divine Gate is basically an all powerful wish granting device and it was used previously to inadvertently tear apart the borders betweenthe realm of the gods, spirits, and Earth.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our protagonist Blue, his \"friends\" Green and Red (yup, those are their names) Blue is the suspect to a very serious massacre that happened years ago but there's an adapter academy that doesn't actually have any classes that wants to recruit him to join their school (adapters are people capable of using supernatural elements). A boy named Arthur is something like the student council president and has The Knights of the Round Table featuring a bunch of ripped off names left and right such as Lancelot. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Arthur was a boy he was sent to some other world to escape something, while here he met a young boy who called himself Santa Clause. Ever since Arthur met Santa he's been bent on restoring order to the world by using the Divine Gate to segregate the realms to their original planes. Arthur seems to be friends with 2 gods that find him interesting for whatever reason and so they say they're \"observers\" of how he plans to go about reaching the Divine Gate; Loki and The Wizard of Oz... The world is run by a \"council\" which doesn't necessarily explain how order is kept. The council isn't against the idea of Arthur seeking out the Divine Gate but pulls more of a \"We don't care if you try to get there, but if you get there we'll have to kick your ass\" kind of approach towards him. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so begins Arthur's adventure to the Divine Gate, naturally he brings all the members of the Knights of the Round Table but also invites our 3 little classmates Blue, Red, and Green. Arthur opens a portal which everyone goes through to start their journey to the Divine Gate which basically is a seemingly endless amount of hallways with additional doors to open until you finally reach the gate. Halfway or so through these endless corridors our heroes are met by the Scandinavian gods, who were sent by the Wizard of Oz with super powered weapons to \"stop\" them from continuing their journey, and so the Wizard of Oz knows just how powerful these gods with these weapons are and knows there's absolutely no chance for them to be defeated. Oz assumed Arthur and friends will turn tail and give up on the Divine Gate, but that doesn't quite happen. they fight their hardest, until just about everyone that's a part of the Round Table becomes a sacrifice to allow Arthur, Blue, Red, Green to continue going through the corridors. The Wizard of Oz finds out the Scandinavian gods killed everyone and starts to act like he's all butt hurt over sending his pals to kill everyone, so then he tries to make things right, by crying about it. After narrowly escaping the Scandinavian gods Arthur and the color brigade have to face the next trial before they can reach the Divine Gate, which is that everyone attempting to reach the gate has to have experienced a massive amount of despair. Arthur is excluded from needing to go through despair, Blue has been through despair his whole life being abused by his family because he wasn't supernaturally gifted \"yet\" while his brother was loved by them, Red thought his father had died in a lab accident, and Green had a childhood friend that wanted to be her \"one and only best friend forever\" and Green was like \"that's too heavy, why can't we just Netflix and chill?\" and her best friend was like \"I don't understand!\" and runs off never to be seen again. so now Loki joins the fray with his pal Shakespeare who has the ability to write a story that traps whoever she wants within an illusion to act out a play. Amidst the entrapment set by Shakespeare, Red meets his deceased father and believes it to actually be him, but then realizes that he was too nice to be his father and dissipates the illusion, as for Green she meets her long lost best friend within the illusion and then realizes it's not her because she said it was fine that they didn't need to be the best of friends. Immediately after breaking free of the illusion, Red is faced with his real father who actually isn't dead and said the council used that as a cover up, but just as they rejoice to find each other again, one of the Scandinavian gods shows up and his dad tells him to escape while he fights off the god, naturally his dad really dies this time right in front of him and he experiences enough despair to reach the gate, then we move on to Green, after her illusion she's confronted by her long lost best friend; who had actually been with the Wizard of Oz this whole time for some reason and changed her name to Dorothy. You know what happens next; that's right, a Scandinavian god shows up and kills her right in front of Green. Blue has to fight to the death against his brother who was the actual culprit of the massacre years ago, but Blue loves his brother he can't just kill him. so then Blue defends himself until he has to retaliate and his brother's all like \"I knew you didn't love me, because you wouldn't let me kill you!\" and then he walks off, so now that everyone has the appropriate amount of despair to get them to look at the Divine Gate they go through the final corridor and reach the gate, the color brigade then uses their powers of despair to open the door to the Divine Gate to let Arthur inside, but soon as he gets in there Loki shows up and now it's time for Arthur to pull out Excalibur and fight Loki off, Arthur loses of course but he's not really hurt, Loki throws down a demonic mind control sword and says \"just grab that sword and everything will be okay\" and of course he picks the sword up after saying \"you won't take control of me!\" and then he gets mind controlled. Soon as he gets mind controlled Lancelot who miraculously survived the onslaught of the Scandinavian gods shows up and runs to Arthur asking how things are going, and mind-control Arthur stabs him through the chest just to make sure none of the Knights of the Round Table survive. The color brigade knows better than to fight against mind control Arthur and Loki so they get outta there real quick and plan to come back for Arthur later.\\n\\n\r\nSo they're back in town and the council knows they got to the Divine Gate and even though they didn't get to use it they're so mad that they're gonna pull the color brigade in for questioning and send them to prison. They had a guy who was like their friend at school who says he's gonna help them explain themselves and so he runs off to see the council, when this fucker comes back he literally brings the swat team to their hiding spot and is like \"JUST TURN YOURSELVES IN YOU CRIMINALS!\" and then Santa Clause shows up through some magic portal for the first time in front of the color brigade to help them gtfo of this mess, the color brigade is like \"how we gonna trust someone named Santa that carries around a bat with nails in it like some delinquent\" and eventually they're like \"alright let's see how this goes\" and then Santa goes berserk mode on the swat team and they get the hell outta dodge.\\n\\n\r\nSanta's got a plan, they're gonna go back to the Divine Gate and rescue Arthur so they go back through the endless corridors and get to the Divine Gate a second time, so they get there and the color brigade is totally talked out of using the Divine Gate because they're told \"is your wish worth changing the entire world?\" because any wish made would have the fabric of the universe change for some reason but then the corridors start to collapse and shit's falling everywhere and so they just up and get the fuck out of there, didn't even save Arthur yet or anything. They're outta there and are greeted by Lancelot and everyone now is just like \"I THOUGHT ARTHUR KILLED THIS GUY?!\" and then he's just like \"Nah, all the Knights of the Round Table are safe too\" after we saw them all die, and then Lancelot's like \"We're gonna get Arthur back though\" then you hear the council say \"The location of the Divine Gate cannot be confirmed.\" \\n\\n\r\nBAM series ended.\\n\\n\r\nThere are slight minor details I skipped over obviously being that I don't want to recall this pile of shit, but I think most of it is right there for you to understand.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you never watch this series because oh my god it was horrible.",

A lot of original Ideas came out of it. No other anime that I have watched has used a plot like that before. \r\nThe only real criticism that can be had here is the deus exrevive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show deserves a 9/10 at worst.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, this anime was the cancer of the Winter 2016 season. How bad could this be you may ask? So bad that I wanted to drop it but continued anyways to write this review so you people would know never to watch this. Well lets continue on with this review.\r\nStory 1/10: \r\nWell this was one of the worst things about this anime. I didn't even understand what the heck was going on during the entire story. Nobody understood what happened in this story from what I could see on the comment sections of KissAnime. It's so hard to follow this story at all. It justjumps all over the place and seems like the writers didn't even care. Nobody cares about half the things that happen in this story too. Even the confusing story of Mekakucity Actors was still better, more straightforward, less confusing, and more interesting than this story. The backstories in this anime are also god awful. They don't make you care for any of the characters at all unlike what a backstory is suppose to do. Even the backstories of the characters of Mekakucity Actors was much better than this. Some other stuff that never made sense in this series was the entire play mini-arc of the series, getting to the divine gate, and like everything else in this series. \\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10:\\n\r\nSo the art wasn't that bad in this anime. It was smooth and pretty beautiful in some scene. For me though, I just could not get used to the unusual art style of this anime and didn't really like it that much but that's just me. Some scenes also look amazing but others just look god awful. Most of the time, it looks decent. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: \\n\r\nSo to be honest I only think that the opening of this anime was good compared to the rest of the sound tracks and the anime for that matter. Maybe it's because the opening is the most prominent song you will hear in this anime but most of this soundtrack is pretty forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10:\\n\r\nOne of the worst things in this anime. Once again like what I did with my Sky Wizards Academy review, I'll go through many of the characters that I can remember.\\n\\n\r\nGreen haired girl:\\n\r\nBoring bland girl with backstory nobody cares about. Kinda annoying and has a normal character design.\\n\\n\r\nRed hair guy:\\n\r\nSome arrogant dude that I would like to see die in a hole. You can't bring yourself to like this kid and for me, I just wished he just died. \\n\\n\r\nAoto:\\n\r\nSo backstory is about being abused by parents and some brother leaving or something like that. 1st part sounds like something from this season *cough* Erased *cough*. Easily forgettable too. \\n\\n\r\nArthur:\\n\r\nBlond dude that wants to go to the divine gate and also makes tons of decisions that doesn't kinda make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nLoki: \\n\r\nOkay so this character is sort of interesting with an interesting character design. Wants to rebuild the world or something for some random reason.\\n\\n\r\nOz: \\n\r\nSome dude that appears for like 15 minutes in the entire show and you really don't care about him. He apparently is some sort of god but I don't really know due to this anime not explaining anything\\n\\n\r\nDorothy:\\n\r\nSome childhood friend of the green haired girl. Don't really care about him and has some personality shift from the past to the present. Loved by Oz apparently. \\n\\n\r\nRed haired guy father:\\n\r\nSome guy who appears for 10 minutes in the entire anime and it expects you to love him and care about him. Don't even bother.\\n\\n\r\nAoto's brother: \\n\r\nAppears again for like 10 minutes and you don't care about him. \\n\\n\r\nNordic gods:\\n\r\nOkay so these people would have been interesting but they are sadly wasted and just put on the sides to die. \\n\\n\r\nElemental teacher people:\\n\r\nSo 3 girls that you don't care about at all. \\n\\n\r\nShakespeare: (yeah there is someone named Shakespeare in this)\\n\r\nSome random green haired girl that comes out of nowhere and you probably will not care about at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of Arthur's army: \\n\r\nThe army of Arthur that appears for like 2 episodes and you will never care about even though the anime tries hard to make you love them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10:\\n\r\nThis anime was a drag to watch. The first few episodes may have been interesting but it fell off and was like watching Sky Wizards Academy again. The ending of episode 12 also made me rage. If you ever watch it which I recommend you don't you will want to kill yourself if you watched everything and didn't skip to the end. Don't even attempt it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10:\\n\r\nSome of the most important parts of an anime, the story, characters, and the enjoyment of it really bring this anime down. The art and the sound though help to bring it up to something better than the absolute worst of the worst. Please save the time you have and watch something that is not this piece of crap.",

This review will be spoiler free.\r\nStory: With an immediate sense of who the characters are at heart and their troubles in the past Divine Gate really gets you excited quickly. Any parts of the story that seem unclear are explained efficiently with the flashbacks in the episodes to come as the flashbacks are few in number and are highly informative. The story follows multiple characters and their own personal grief and what they haveto do to rid themselves of the guilt that has swallowed them. This is all done with the help of the expert writers at the forefront of this anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Words cannot describe the beauty that this shows art style has. The mixing of 2D and 3D make the fight scenes not only entertaining but interesting to watch and then re-watch later. I've never seen an art style capture the story within it so well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack of Divine Gate really made me hyped up during the battles that happen throughout. While I'm not much of a sound critic in particular I will say that the music during the battles was quite enjoyable. The opening is quite amazing I have downloaded it on to my phone and wish to play it on the piano.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: They're all great, every single one. I'm not a huge fan of Akane but having someone that you don't like as much really shows why the others shine so brightly KEK sorry Akane.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review and I hope it made you want to go out there and watch Divine Gate right away! It will not be a mistake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, BGdealer",

I couldn't tell what they wanted to do with it because it was so chaotic.\r\n- The art was.. how to say it.. it wasn't bad or good.. it had some 3D effects too... but I didn't really enjoy it.\r\n- About sound - I liked both opening and ending. The seiyuu and sound tracks weren't bad too..\r\n-The characters were pathetic, very pathetic. It's not that It had poor character development, It hadn't it at all. They were just put there with no character. Maybe they had a history behind them but for me they looked like dolls without souls.\\n\\n\r\nI was watching this with thinking - when it will end?

            "content": "Divine Gate is, by any means, not \"divine\" at all.\r\nThe story is your run-of-the-mill \"let's obtain the MacGuffin\" (that being the Gate) plot line, which really has no impact all the way through the end. The first half is establishing the back stories of the main characters that has no payoff. There was hardly any \"search\" for the Gate in the first place. The ending was just a jumbled mess with an anti-climax that I didn't bother caring about anyway. Plus, there is a literal \"deus ex machina\" in the finale (if you've seen it, you'll understand).\r\nWith characters, the only thing I liked about themwere the concepts. They have names based on things like color, the gods, medieval, and even the Wizard of Oz. That's all I liked about them. As actual characters, they're bland. For the ones that get the back story treatment, like I mentioned before, have these payoffs that are mediocre and are put to the side like it was nothing. Speaking of, there are there set of characters that were given no purpose whatsoever. They're supposed to be \"important\", but in reality are completely useless.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is probably the only thing that's eligible for praise. I liked the character designs and the color schemes used for each. There is also a strange but interesting blend of 2D and CG in this. While, for the most part, the characters are 2D, scenes where they fight are done with CG models, and it's not distracting at all. Also, the background is done in this CG that looks like an old computer game, and I liked that contrast between that and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStill, with uninteresting characters, a story that is rushed about halfway through, and overused themes that come off as pretentious, Divine Gate is like the big finale of firework that turn out to be a weak little \"pop\" (that's the only kind of metaphor I can come up with).",

It was okay, but there are times where it seems that they have dragged on for too long.\r\nCharacters 7/10: There was a lot of characters that are introduced in the series. They have cool powers called \"Drivers\" & they are based on the elements (like Earth, Fire & Water). Akane is honest and straight-forward. His Driver is the power of FIRE. Aoto is very distant and monotone. His driver involves the power ofWATER. Midori is very cheerful and happy. Her driver has the power of WIND. There are also some references to the medieval timeline & fairy tales (i.e.: Shakespeare, King Arthur & Lancelot, Loki & Oz -- who I'm pretty sure is has a contemporary look/reference to the Wizard of Oz). There was a really cool character development on the main characters that explores their past & reasons of going to the Divine Gate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment 6/10: As I said previously, a lot can happen in 12 episodes! I enjoyed watching it. It was ok. I just don't like seeing the good guys dying. I hope there is a season 2 that can let us continue seeing the characters grow and see their fates afterwards. There's a lot of sad moments and action scenes that makes you shocked but wanting to continue finishing the series.",

But nonetheless, if you want something decent that you can safely watch,this is a great one to go with!",

I really expected too much from this anime and i've never wrote so bad about an anime in my life i think.\r\nAnyway, this anime is about 3 kids trying to search for the divine gate hence the name because they have their own problem.\r\nThe story is bad but not normally bad, it's really really bad, i didn't understand a single thing throughout the whole anime.. And the ending so disappointing, it's like they wasted 12 episodes in my opinion.\r\nStory :\r\nLike i said before the plot is bad, it became bad after the first couple of episodes (2-3), many thing left unexplained and the endingseriously, it's so disappointing and waste of time, that this became the worst anime of the season instantly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nWell they did develop the character by focusing on the background story most of the time until the end which by showing those story has achieved nothing or close to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nNothing special, you're everyday art these days.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nThe only thing that was good about this anime was the opening, it feels like they have wasted it on such an anime full of plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nBad and in my opinion not worth watching, seriously it's a waste of time unless you want to watch some plotless anime..",

Basically the most important part for this anime to be goodwas bad, the only way to save this anime was the course of the story, that didn't saved it al all, also this is not a complete anime, it doesn't ends the story, it ends urging a new season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has some 3D aspects, they are not bad, but neither are OK, I would say they are mediocre, 3D animation actually is something that usually doesn't please people, so that makes it worse for the anime image, even the 2D animation is not good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, if I have to say I think it is the only thing that is actually \"good\" of this anime, the OP is pretty good, the ED is good, the OST are fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty bad though, they have bad motivations, they have strange pasts, and made strange choices all their life, the protagonist is very dumb though, he is always blaming himself for things he didn't do, there are characters that according to MAL are main characters, but they hardly appear, I really can't understand it, the others main characters are not bad, but also not good.\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoyed this anime, don't really know why I watched it until the final, I think in the two or three last episodes I was curious about what would happen, maybe that's a good point about this anime, I recommend you not to watch it unless you really have nothing to do.\\n\\n",

I would like to state this show is pretty much a waste of time to watch. if you have seen a trailer it might look pretty animation wise but does not cover the hot mess this show is. \r\nStory 2/10\r\nThe first two episode where ok story wise but what followed those two episode where the following problems. The only story the viewer are interested in after watching the first two episodes is the story of Aoto. However they decided tomike in a load of subplots and introduce a load of characters over the course of the ten episodes that follow. Other problems include pacing that was extremely fast and loads of flashbacks that don't help the viewer understand the characters better but only make things more confusing.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nthe only plus with this series is its art style. In the first few episode its ok however in other episodes some of the art is lacking. Character designs are also the only plus with the series however looking cool didn't make the characters any more interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10 \\n\\n\r\nsome of the sound effects used seemed highly repetitive while the opening being the only decent song in the ost. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series had a lot of characters with a lot being introduced  especially in the middle episodes. It felt like the plot was just introducing characters in general. The three mcs who take most of the screentime are introduced in the first episode as confident heroes who are going to battle a lot of enemies while in a majority of the series they just stand around and watch other characters just introduced fight. The bad guys like the good guys are introduced in large numbers and not seen again till the end except for the villain loki. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished the show I was happy It was done in hope of something better will take its slot next season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n",

Let's get the first problem out of the way, this anime is up it's own ass pretentious grandiose bullshiting it's characters and plot all together, what does LA mean by this?, well mostof the main cast members get their character development and backstories told in some of the most pretentious and on-the-wall annoying trying desperately to sound grandiose that they strip the plot and plot armor down to outright boring and pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nLA gets it we have the Akane voiced by ''Tetsuya Kakihara'' the fiery-hot head with daddy issues and he has the element of fire, Midori voiced by ''Kanae Ito'' the wind user with friendship issues with one of her childhood friends and is the typical genki girl but is really depressed and finally we have Aoto voiced by ''Soma Saito'' the water user who had a typical tragic backstory just thrown at us over and over and over and over and over and over and OVER again ohh did LA mention he's a water user and doesn't even eat anything hot...just god damn really?.\\n\\n\r\nSee what LA means by on-the wall annoying?. Divine Gate also has terrible pacing issues from trying to go into too much detail about the characters to hardly telling us what \"Divine Gate\" even is besides a generic wishmaker that wishes it was the Holy Grail from ''Fate/Zero''.\\n\\n\r\nDivine Gate is more worried and focused on it's characters backstory that they hardly give any focus on the plot at hand and when they do, they rush that to no end, LA NEVER got invested in ANY of these characters, the closest character LA got to like was Midori only because everyone else wasn't the depressed elemental idiots they embodied and even before the halfway point even Midori got succumbed to it that LA just gave up on characters altogether, how about the fact that there is a group of characters that later on get killed off for dramatic purposes only for the anime to forget that we hardly knew them so in terms of plot progression or character development from that group were almost meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the animation was at the very least by Studio Pierrot decently animated although there were times where the battle scenes go into 3D CGI for no good reason, however even with the \"decent\" animation it doesn't help solve the utter trainwreck of plot and characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending?...well that's a laugh, making characters deaths pretty much moot and the entire ending just circle-jerks you into caring but it just becomes pointless and just telling a dumb message of \"we control our own fates\"...and making the vaguest mess of a rushed climax against the main villain it just leads to this entire anime being JUST POINTLESS.\\n\\n\r\nDivine Gate for LA is by far thee WORST anime for the Winter of 2016, it has rushed pacing to no end, grandiose character development too cliched it's pretentious that by that end almost worthless characters to get invested in and lots of minor characters that get the axe just for sympathy points. We get it Divine Gate, your trying to be symbolic, however when that symbolism is soo blatant and pretentious that's what makes you boring and annoying as hell, that's why your the worst anime of Winter 2016 for LA.",

            "content": "Every season, you\u2019ll have at least one anime that is terrible and has a good amount of people watching it. This season, it\u2019s Divine Gate. There are anime that no words can describe them. Divine Gate fall into that category, not because it\u2019s good, but because it\u2019s halfheartedly made that I can\u2019t explain how lazy it is. Its narrative is uninteresting, the characters are outrageously poorly-written, and the plot is all over the place. When the best thing about your anime is the OP, you know there\u2019s something wrong with that anime. It\u2019s better off as smartphone game, because the anime is nothing short ofpretentious. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise about some large organization or something that wants to find something called the \u201cDivine Gate\u201d, which is apparently a myth. They need to find the gate for the sake of finding the gate\u2026 nothing more. A bunch of teenagers were chosen to find the gate, because it\u2019s definitely a smart idea to send kids to find something hard, instead of adults. The premise isn\u2019t anything special, however they could have gone somewhere from here, but unfortunately no. The execution is extremely poor. The plot twists, if you can even call them one, are pathetically written. I couldn\u2019t care less about what was going on in this anime. Every time I watched an episode, it felt like I missed an episode since it feels all over the place. And there\u2019s so many things that were left unresolved that it\u2019s ridiculous. It better not get a second season, because I rather have a terrible anime with loose ends, rather than a terrible anime with twice the content. And the funniest thing is that Divine Gate is filled with info dumps, yet, so many things weren\u2019t even properly explained. What the hell is the Divine Gate? Why did edgy MC-kun see it when he was little? Who the hell is that kid that follows MC-kun? Why do most characters wear clothes that match their hair? Was it some kind of trauma they got? Did they forget about MC\u2019s brother at the end? \\n\r\nStory: 1.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nI normally don\u2019t want to call an anime pretentious because I don\u2019t know what the studio were keeping in mind when making an anime, but I have a strong feeling that Divine Gate is definitely pretentious. The anime tries so, so, SO hard in making it looks edgy and dark. It only took 5 minutes for me to realize that this is pretentious. That\u2019s even longer than the time it took for me to realize Bubuki Buranki\u2019s completely CGI. When an anime makes you laugh harder than KonoSuba when characters are dying, you know that there\u2019s something wrong. That\u2019s the only enjoyment I got from this anime \u2013 comedy. The flashbacks for characters are so poor. They just feel tragic for the sake of being tragic. The direction was so bad that had to search up whether or not Divine Gate was given a director. And even if it had a director, he either must be a goat or a newbie director. The director is actually someone who was called GOAT by some people for directing Bleach, Great Teacher Onizuka, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Kuroshitsuji\u2019s better seasons. Abe-san, where did you go wrong?\\n\r\nPresentation: 1.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nIf you think that characters can be a redeeming point after all that, you\u2019re wrong. The characters are so clich\u00e9, poor-written, and outrageously plot-device-y that you can\u2019t help but cringe. The main character, Aoto, Is literally one of the most pretentious characters out there. He\u2019s given such a tragic backstory just to make him a tragic character. When they showed his flashback, how he was treated like a dog by his parents while his brother was treated like a god, I laughed hard enough to almost suffocate myself. I wondered to myself am I just a sick, sadistic person, or is this anime so bad it\u2019s funny? I guess it\u2019s the latter. He\u2019s so edgy that it feels like this anime is lighthearted. And his behavior is so damn inconsistent. For most of the part, he acts all gloomy and depressed, however, at times, he seems like his enjoying thing and he never went through that tragic past. What\u2019s going on with that character? Then you have Akane, some dude with daddy issues for 80% of the anime, until suddenly in 1 minute, his personality changes to a daddy\u2019s boy. Talk about sudden. And then you have Midori, some chick whose tragic past happens to do something with her best friend. Then you have other characters that you\u2019ll never remember their names because it\u2019s easier to call them by their hair color rather than searching them up online. There\u2019s a moment in the anime where they introduce a large cast of characters and killed them off the next second. Am I supposed to be emotionally attached to these characters? I\u2019m sure the main characters in this anime are attached so should I be too? When the anime ends and shows off their huge cast of characters\u2019 normal lives, I wonder to myself\u2026 who the hell are these people? They\u2019re that forgettable.\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to say the art is bad because Studio Pierrot is behind this anime, because they can do good stuff when they care. However, this anime\u2019s art just felt lazy, and the studio tries to cover it up. The art style is really different, but that doesn\u2019t make it better. It certainly makes the anime look more dark and edgy, and also pretentious at the same time. The shading and shadows are downright terrible. The shading should make the colors slowly get darker, not one color and then suddenly black. Look at the characters\u2019 hair for example; it feels like shading it bitmapped onto their hair. The anime will have lighting directly pointed at shadows, but the shadows still remain. Do they even physics? And the backgrounds are pretty lame too. A lot of the time, they use a solid color with so shading. That\u2019s it. Come on, even I can do better with MS Paint.\\n\r\nArt: 3.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations aren\u2019t too bad in Divine Gate. It\u2019s not very good either. The action animations don\u2019t impress at all. A lot of the fights are CGI heavy and they\u2019re distracting since they\u2019re not that well done. It can look really messy at times. And when they\u2019re not using CGI during action scenes or fights, it just looks very unorganized and cruddy. The flow between frames are pretty bad. However, the normal scenes in Divine Gate don\u2019t looks too bad. It\u2019s not mind blowing, but it works. It\u2019s sad that above average animation is one of the highlights of Divine Gate. However, this might just be one of Studio Pierrot\u2019s laziest work\u2026 and that\u2019s saying a whole lot about Divine Gate. \\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Divine Gate isn\u2019t bad nor good, just average. Saito Soma does Aoto averagely. He\u2019s able to make his character sound as edgy and pretentious as the script wants him to be. For most of the time, he sounded uninterested in his role and I don\u2019t blame him. Kakihara Tetsuya does Akane, who does a better job than most of the other seiyuu in Divine Gate. He shouldn\u2019t spent his talent on something else though. Then there\u2019s Itou Kanae who does Midori, and she also does alright, but she did make her character feel irritating at times, but that might just be the scripts fault. Some really talented seiyuu, such as Ishida Akira and Nakamura Yuuichi, are in minor roles, which is disappointing because they can make the anime more enjoyable. Most of these seiyuu feel disinterested when voice acting probably because they also can\u2019t feel for these character. However, the voice acting isn\u2019t bad because at least it didn\u2019t make my ears bleed, but the dialogues sure did (and that\u2019s the presentation that\u2019s lacking).\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nFinally, the best part about Divine Gate \u2013 the OP. The OP, \u201cone-Me two-Hearts\u201d, isn\u2019t just the best thing about this anime, but one of the best things about this season. The OP is a personal favorite of mine as it really makes my mood. However the rest of the episode doesn\u2019t. Just listen to the OP, then drop this anime as if it\u2019s hotter than the sun. The ED, \u201cCONTRAST\u201d, is alright. It\u2019s nothing to special, but it doesn\u2019t hurt when you listen to it. However, Divine Gate can never be good in a category as there\u2019s one major flaw in its music, which is its background music. The background music is very lackluster and they don\u2019t help to make scenes better, but only worse. When something emotional is happening, but instead you\u2019re laughing, the music only adds to the comedy with its overdramatic music. Even the music is pretentious. \\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re wondering whether or not I enjoyed Divine Gate, how can you possibly think that after I barely said anything good about this anime. For half of the time, this anime feels so boring and makes you lose your purpose in life. For the other half of the time, makes you laugh, even though the anime doesn\u2019t want you to. Divine Gate sets the standard high for overly pretentious and unnecessarily edgy anime. Every Friday I was excited to see the new Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ajin episode, but Divine Gate always made my day bad. It\u2019s not like this was destined to be bad. The premise can go somewhere, but the execution is just so, so poor that I couldn\u2019t care less about the plot or characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Divine Gate is definitely not worth your time at all. Save yourself the pain and trouble by skipping this one from this season. The narrative is terrible as I didn\u2019t even know what was going on for most of the time. The characters are tragic for the sake of being tragic and their behaviors are so inconsistent. The art style is just a way for the studio to hid their lazy work. This anime is one of the most pretentious (I used this work ten times so far for a reason) piece of entertainment. Search up the OP, listen to it, and never turn back. That\u2019s the only thing you need from this anime. \\n\\n\r\n+ The OP is really good and catchy \\n\r\n- Overly pretentious content that tries to be a tragedy but ends up being a comedy\\n\r\n- Characters are poorly written, inconsistent in their actions, and lack emotional impact.\\n\r\n- Narrative is uninteresting, all over the place, and leaves too many plot holes.\\n\r\n- Art style is pathetic and backgrounds and character designs are lazy.\\n\r\n- Overdramatic music just adds to the lameness. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.9/10",

            "content": "Divine Gate is an asshole; a literal asshole that opens and closes like a tunnel, and inside are all the worms and dried shit from when someone eats shrimp at a local diner, much like yours unless you're one of those special snowflakes who rinse their asses. In other words, it's full of shit.\r\nNow let me be the first to admit that I was pumped for this. I saw the PVs, I liked the art of the phone game and fanboyed at the fact that HITORIE was doing the opening song. And who could blame me for feeling this way? I wasn't expecting a lotbut I was expecting something. Lo and behold, the first episode was one huge edgefest. And from then on, I stopped caring. So why am I writing this review? Basically, to inform you, the potential viewer, to stay the fuck away.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the story. In its premiere, Divine Gate introduces us to a world of... I have no fucking idea. And that, right there, ladies and gents, is the biggest problem of Divine Gate. In a fantasy type story, it's mandatory that you explain the way your world works in a smooth and organized way, having important information matter to the viewer and giving the details early on without going through an infodump and most series do this through good use of exposition, much like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and even Sword Art Online. Divine Gate explains diddly-fucking-squat. I can't call the world building anything because there is none in the first place! They show us all these neat aspects but put zero effort into explaining what they are, how they work or why we should give a fuck in the first place! And the results? Plot holes as far as the eye can see! The story takes all different kinds of directions that constantly create these subplots that ultimately amount to nothing. To give an example, this is what the usual Divine Gate episode boils down to:\\n\\n\r\n- Characters are doing something\\n\r\n- Characters are suddenly doing something else\\n\r\n- Several second shot of some aspect of the world we've never seen before nor will we ever see again\\n\r\n- Back to doing the characters being ass\\n\r\n- Something bad happens\\n\r\n- Resolved with shitty action\\n\r\n- Several minutes of edgy dialogue\\n\r\n- Characters being ass again\\n\r\n- Roll credits\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of the characters, they all suck ass. Let's start off with our beloved main character who can out edge even the roughest square in the galaxy, Aoto. While he is your stereotypical emo kid with a darker than darkness itself past, the creators decided they wanted to make him worse by making him probably the edgiest character in the entire season. How edgy you ask? Throughout episode, we're shown him eating only cold food so someone found the reason why. And the answer? Drumrolls please!!--------- \"Just like your cold heart, you can only eat cold food\".  Yes, it was even better than you could ever possibly imagine! Thanks to this new discovery, scientists everywhere decided to add an entirely new shape into the world of geometry called the Aotogon, consisting of an infinite amount of refined edges only possible in a fucking anime. The rest of the cast were stereotypical and awfully one-note with piss-poor development and just as shitty dialogue, including edgy fire-user, edgy staff-user, edgy-trio no one cares about, edgy-round knights, edgy-male saber, edgy- evil clown, edgy-deities, edgy-top hat, edgy-dad, edgy-brother, edgy-BFF and fucking Santa Claus. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have a bad habit of writing reviews for shitty series that just happen to have good art and animation, but not in Divine Gate. Studio Pierrot has proved time and time again just how shitty they've been doing the past few years. Ever since Naruto saw its end, the quality of animation and direction deteriorated and this is has never been more evident in this show. The CGI looks terribly dated and unpleasing to the eye as were the colors that didn't have a good sense of contrast. The animation itself is fuzzy, glitchy and makes for some pretty bad action sequences and this is mostly the fault of the direction which didn't stand out at all and was sub-par at best. The score is overall unmemorable save for a few piano pieces that are stuck in my head at the moment that I may forget very soon.\\n\r\nWe're finally boiled down to the question, does Divine Gate have any merits? Yes, it does. And that was with the opening song, HITORIE's One Me Two Hearts. If I had to choose the best opening of the season, it was definitely this. It sucks the viewer right into the series through some decent imagery before going right into the chorus with a huge BOOM! \"NEE! SONO KOKORO KAISHITE YO, TOBIRA WO AKETE SHIMAU KARA!\". Not a reason to watch, but is still worthy of acknowledgement.\\n\\n\r\nSo did I enjoy Divine Gate?\\n\r\n...Meh. It's easy to stop caring about the series and just laugh at everything bad about it. It may make you want to stop living but I can assure you, this show can only go so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, shitty world building, shitty characters and pretty bad production has earned this series a 3/10. I do not recommend this series to anyone unless you're a masochist or if Konosuba wasn't funny enough for you.",

Whats worse is how hard the writers try to make the characters interesting with backstories.  I adore characters that have a solid backstory that adds to their progression.  This way I can see and appreciate how far a character has grown and changed.  This doesn't happen with this show.  The characters have nothing to them but their backstories. After a while these characters become so unenjoyable because of their obsession with theirpast that they becomes really cheesy and unbelievable.\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started on the main protagonist. Hes probably the most annoying \"tragic\" character there is.\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n while at first seems appealing it later dissolves into cgi the anime and becomes almost unbearable to watch.  They tried to make the anime artistic by creating bright colors with the backgrounds and the characters but it really didn't work.     \\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nBoring. Only the opening is fun but that's about the only thing I can give props to this show.  I remember nothing about the soundtrack and I just finished watching the thing.\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nConfusing and ends with a lackluster ending with what I guess can be considered a cliffhanger. This maybe would have worked better if this show would have been expanded but I kind of doubt it. Whats frustrating about this story is how hard they tried to make it philosophical with its constant dialogue of choice and the idea of changing the future.  With a setting and characters that seem stuck in the past this really doesn't really work.\\n\r\nSo in conclusion\\n\r\nnope\\n\r\nMaybe watch this if your drunk and you want to laugh at a really bad show",

Instead, I must force myself to recall the horrors of the anime with one of the most annoying narrators in my entire existence....Divine Gate.\r\nI have no history with this. I don't know anything about the mobile game this is based off of. This is something that purely caught my interest and that's about it. Let's just get this over with as I do another review after a long time of not doing them....oh yeahspoiler warning I guess cause I might spoil something....on with the review\\n\\n\r\nStory:......Where the holy f*ck do I begin....Guess the fact that this show is about some gate that has been around for decades or centuries in this world and can granted any wish to those who open it. This special gate is known as....ahem...THE DIVINE GATE! THE HOLY GRAIL...THE CREAM OF THE CROP OF ALL GATES...ALL THE MAGICAL BEING IN THE UNIVERSE IN EVERY ANIME EVER! HA! NOTHING IS MORE SUPREME THEN THY DIVINE GATE! THOU SHALL BOW DOWN AND WORSHIP IT! WORSHIP THIS HOLY GATE YOU UNGRATEFUL SWINES! WORSHIP IT I SAY! WORSHIP!\\n\r\n....\\n\r\n....\\n\r\n....Now moving on the story has 3 main characters (If you think it is 6 based off the image or poster or whatever of six people and the opening which highlights them, then you are sorely mistaken). We have Aoto the brooding emo, Akane are obligatory spiky red hair protagonist and Midori the green hair cheerful one of the 3 all who have their own wishes and wish be the first person to reach the gate as the gate will granted that persons wish. They aren't the only ones though as the headmaster of their academy Arthur who has his own wish he wishes to achieve with the help of his Knights of the Round Table (It's called knights of round in the anime but let's be real. It's based off the Knights of the round table) along with those 3 other very 'important' adapters on the cover with our heroes Ginji, Hikari and Yukari along with Loki and Oz. let's not forget the 3 spirit gypsies...fairies....ah whatever f*ck it.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is a clustered mess. Multiple plot threads that go unanswered, a plot that while not original is semi interesting but feels like it was glued together sometimes at the last minute..extremely underdeveloped character development, the bland characters we follow in the story...the fact it try's to be deep and symbolic when it really isn't if we are being honest...the f*cking cop out at the end of the anime and....the narrator. Dear god the narrator. The narrator tries to give you them feels. From trying to explain motives, to explaining character personalities in a nutshell (trust me I'll get to that soon enough.) or plain random stuff if they aren't explaining events. I can normally deal with a narrator. Practically have been hearing the Pokemon narrator for most of my life. I can deal with Bobobo-bo-Bo-bobo's narrator. I could deal with JoJo's Narrator. Hell I could sit through the 4kids One Piece narrator better and I hate the 4kids dub of that with a passion. But this?! This has to be the most annoying and most hysterical narrator I have heard in a long time. The narration either has you laughing out loud at how deep and symbolic it will try to be or have have you hitting your head against a brick wall. The narrator really serves no purpose to the show and probably should have been scrapped.\\n\\n\r\nArt- This anime was produced by everyone's favorite punching bag that isn't Toei, Studio Pierrot and honestly...It's actually alright. It's not anything stellar or breath taking and I don't hate Pierrot with a Firey passion like some people do so I got to be honest when I say I have no major issue with it. I have an issue with the CGI. Not Skeleter Sh*t or Mayioga laughable levels of bad but it isn't good. It's subpar-to bad. Other then that I have no major complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: If there is one thing I got out of this anime...it has a kick ass opening. The opening is honestly the only thing that kept me watching at this point when I was seeing the anime.i love it. The ending is okay and seeing the fact I watched the dub, the cast was alright for it. Not great but not horrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Step right up! Step right up! We got your underdeveloped characters here. From the blonde emo Aoto whose is called a parent killer cause his brother went AWOL and he took the blame, to the Akane who has daddy issues all the way to Midori who seeks to find her childhood best friend and is arguably the blandest of the mcs. The 2nd place price is Arthur who seeks to destroy the gate and bring peace to the world along Loki, the lone shining star in this entire anime as the villain and Oz.....f*ck Oz.\\n\\n\r\nWe then have the bronze prizes as....no you know what no. I'll just do my own narration of how the narrator described these 3 'important' characters who happen to be adapter like our main cast.\\n\\n\r\nHere we go. Ginji personality description (as told by the narrtor of the show and reinterpret by yours truly)\\n\\n\r\n\"The boy didn't give a sh*t about anything in the world. Thus, as he didn't give a sh*t about the world and cares for nothing in it.\"\\n\\n\r\nHikari-\\n\r\n\"The girl with blonde hair who has a smile plastered on her face cause we always need that obligatory happy, cheerful, in LaLa land smiling girl in our animus. Nothing damping her mood as she somehow gets people to smile come rain or shine.\\n\\n\r\nYukari-\\n\r\n\"She broods in the night, loving it but hating the daytime. More emo then Aoto was at the beginning, at night she dons the persona of the hero of the night. She goes out and says with pride every night...\"\\n\r\n\"I'm batgirl....yeah...\"\\n\\n\r\nSuch wonder and deep characters here don't you think. So deep that the narrator feels the need to describe their personalities to us. The most deepest characters and the most interesting non development of character you will ever see. To this day it amazes to how the characters and their astonishing development came to be. Hell it might need further study since it always feels like it is non existent. Even the 1st place prize MCs development is questionable at best. Such great writing I tell you what.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- This was an anime that went to alright to bad in a heart beat. It definitely isn't anywhere near the likes of School Days, Pupa or Idea Factories Turd sandwiches but it is still bad. The cluster story, the bad characters the god awful narrator and so on. Only things I got out of this was the animation and the kick ass opening. It's a 4/10 anime to me. If you like great, I am not stopping you since this is just my silly opinion written in a review. If you agree with me alright. If you want to check it out, I ain't stopping you. But overall this anime was just bad. It started off alright and seemed to get worst, especially towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThat is all I have to say. If you like my review great. If you hate it...I won't lose any sleep, we just got to agree to disagree. With that being said I am out. Peace people\\n",

I dropped it thrice on the first ep before finally deciding to complete it. Bad concepts. Generic. Trying too hard to impress with \"deep\" dark extremely edgy inner monologue-like moments and failing spectacularly. The animation was pretty, but that should be a given at this day and age. I guess I wouldn't be hating it so much if I had not watched it right after katanagatari which I really enjoyed. Maybe I'll go rewatch SAO and then rewatch this (never)so I can get a complete and unbiased picture of how bad it is.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: It's nothing special. Actually it's special in how bad it is. Do not watch. Do not read the synopsis. DO recommend it to people you do not like. Tell em it's the new DB.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT* Actually doesn't even really matter\r\nDivine Gate... When I first saw it I thought this would be like the newest shounen 100+ episode fairy tail anime... I was absolutely disappointed with what was presented here though. I'm a guy who enjoys the shounen genre because I really like seeing people getting stronger overtime to overcome obstacles. But this is not shounen, it's overhyped disappointing mess.\r\nStory 1/10\r\nStory? What story? Did you come here for a story? You should turn away before your mind will shut down or explode. All serious though, the story is just a mess... You understand what happens then something completely strangethen happens, which is unrelated to the previous event that happened the last episode. \\n\r\nThe first few episodes are flashbacks which are unrelated to each other at all. Then they jump to different things and different things like training which end up fighting some mutants which are then forgotten for the rest of the series. \\n\r\nThe first like half of the series is about stories that have like 0 connections to each other. But the last half albeit connected, are still mumbo-jumbo like people that are briefly talked about previously came out of nowhere and then immediately killed off. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow I must say the art is above decent, it's pretty nice. Designs are good, fight scenes are good, just a little flashy sometimes. But it doesn't really matter if it's a good-looking shit, it's still a pile of shit.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good! The best was the OP! Really nice to listen and I would play the OP after watching the series... (I stopped now though) OST is well-placed in some scenes. But again, nice sounding shit is still shit. (That didn't make the least sense whatsoever, but you get the picture).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI favour quality over quantity, but the characters oppose these ideals. They throw characters like a basket filled with rubbish and dropped it in the trash burner. They fill the anime with random minor characters who would later be dead or are so minor you forget about them in around 5 seconds. But I didn't care cause they don't even let me care. They also had 3 supporting characters with the other 3 main characters, but they also are more like minor characters than support cause they have no redeeming qualities. \\n\r\nThe main character's personalities are chli\u0107e. You got your typical emotionless guy, the guy always wanting to use his fist to do the talking and the girl who is brave yet whiny.. Your typical Naruto, Fairy Tail trio of main characters, adding to the shounen cliche.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI would've given it a 1, but the OP gave it higher. I enjoy some fight scenes and maybe some parts that get somewhat emotional but like at times my mind would not care about the situation or is mindfucked on what's going on. Which means I couldn't enjoy this anime well from all this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show got me interested, but in the end, just the biggest and most expected letdown I've seen in anime recently. But what can you expect from an adaption of a mobile phone game to TV? Spare your time and life and do something far better than spending a single millisecond of your time on this show. Don't be like me.\\n\\n\r\n2/10 that's the score I give, summarise my review.\\n\r\n+ Sound is good, OST and definitely that catchy OP\\n\r\n+ Art style is pretty decent, up to good standards for an anime\\n\r\n- Non-existent plot nearly, not connected enough, all messed up and not connected\\n\r\n- Poor character development, 90% of characters I won't give a fuck about\\n\r\n- Unenjoyable\\n\r\n- Extremely cliche plot and characters",

This review is based solely about the anime, which is a complete piece of crap.\r\nThey introduce characters left and right. At first it seems to start fine, the plot developement is stupid but you can still comprehend it but then it just keeps building up, relentlessly feeding you information about useless crap that it never utilises or introduces characters that are killed off in next episode.\r\nI have a feeling that they just wanted to cram everything into the anime hoping that it would be better for the fans to relate to but tothe people who knew nothing about the series, it was a complete mess. \\n\\n\r\nIt has 42 characters, 42. Oh my god, and it tries to make the viewer know every one of them but fails miserably. Asides from the characters the plot is similarly F-d since it doesn't do anything. As mentioned beforehand, it has so many characters so it just spends most of the time introducing them and not actually advancing the overall story which doesn't even exist that much.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want the story then you can watch the first and last episode and be done with it, nothing substantial happens inbetween.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if you want to see a video review I made about this anime that goes into it a bit more, then check it out here:\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85dZBcsoDjQ",

            "content": "Divine Gate, An anime with a poorly executed story and characters so bland I fell asleep while watching. This was by far one of the most disappointing anime out of the winter 2016 anime season I have watched. \r\nStory: 3/10 \r\nThe story starts off so confusing. I could find myself getting interested to see what this \"Divine Gate\" is. But the whole entire anime is just bullshit. The \"Divine Gate\" they keep talking over and over about is really just a plot device to attempt a actual \"story\" with a dark and edgy feel to it, but so far I'm not buying any of this.Plus, they give you a whole bunch of information dumps that fly from one place to another. It almost seemed like the writers were just thinking of ideas as they go along. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI actually really liked the art since it's not something I see often. It definitely gave me a different feel from other anime which is one of the main reasons I kept watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\r\nThe animation was meh. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The fighting scenes were one of the things that annoyed me about this anime. It would switch from 2D to 3D animation when doing the fighting scenes and that really bothered me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\n The sound was good. I could hear things clearly with the seiyuus making up for the piss poor characters with their voice acting. The op and ed for this anime were catchy and were nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10 \\n\r\nOMFG THE CHARACTERS ARE THE WORSE THING ABOUT THIS ANIME. They are so cliche that it's not even funny. You could literally go find most of these character types in other anime. Aoto is a boy with a dark past, Akane is some hot tempered kid with a father complex, and Midori is supposed to be a kind hearted girl with \"secrets\". I was just laughing at how bad it was. Then, there are a whole bunch of other characters that were so forgettable that I was like \" What was your name again?\" Seriously, these characters were horribly bland.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nMost of the time when I'm watching an episode I'm just waiting for it to end. I didn't enjoy this at all. I could even find myself cringing throughout this whole experience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nThis anime could've been great. It had a lot of potential but it was just poorly executed with its story and characters. If you have nothing else to do you can watch this anime, otherwise I'd skip this one and watch something better.\\n\\n\\n",

That's essentially what this anime is. \r\nDivine Gate looked so promising at the beginning of the season, only to fail and disappoint nearly anyone and everyone who's watched it.\r\nThe story is 3/10. They story revolves around the Divine Gate (roll credits!) which is said to grant any one wish you want. However, after a few episodes of entirely pointless character development, one of the side characters wishes to destroy it. Then there's whole ordeal with gods and humans not agreeing and it's all very bland and inefficient.\r\nTheart is 8/10. The one good thing I will give credit to this anime for is the art style. Well designed animes are becoming more common, and this one meets the quota. Interesting bold-shaded style made watching this at least slightly more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is 5/10. While the OP and ED are both okay, everything else was just... mediocre. There wasn't anything that really stood out and that was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are 3/10. Lord have mercy on anyone who forces themselves to finish this anime like I did. They spend the first three episodes (25% ffs) trying to explain why one of the main characters is so gloomy and depressed, while they inevitable go over it AGAIN through backstory. To further add insult to injury, they do this for almost EVERY relevant character. It's painful, the characters are bland, irritating, and just frustrating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is 3/10. I had such high hopes for this anime and it fell apart after the first three episodes. You should never have to force yourself to watch a 20 minute episode each week, but this anime makes you. The only reason I finished this is because I don't like to drop anything. If I were to drop anime though, this would be one of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall score is 4/10. Divine Gate had so much potential, and just fell apart with the pointless plot and storyline. The characters, sounds, and enjoyment were just not there. It was hard to want to like this. The one saving grace is that the art style is quite good. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Divine Gate? The answer is no, unless you enjoy being a masochist.",

You know the outcome, you know it will inevitably wind up as a shit storm, but you can't stop watching.\r\nIn the first thirty seconds of the show, it's established that our main character, Aoi-- if not the entire story-- is edgy. Like, walking-on-knives-and-the-rain-hides-the-tears-in-my-eyes-and-I-can't-stop-writing-poetry level edge. I'm not joking. Not even Edgar Allen Poe would be able to take this shit seriously.\r\nBut hey, who cares what the protagonist is like as long as the supporting cast and the plot's decent?

So, in short, a chaotic clusterfuck. Oh, and there're twenty other characters who are introduced and have noteworthy character designs only to later take a seat on the bleachers thanks to plot.\\n\\n\r\nWait, wait, plot? Which plot are we talking about? There are so many plotlines that are started and dropped that's it's almost impossible to make any sense of this story. I felt like I was watching an animated adoption of a school play where all of the actors want to add their own ideas to spice things up but none of them are on the same wavelength.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is terrible.

            "content": "So, like most of my current reviews, I'll mention beforehand that I'm not a huge anime watcher --\r\n-- This is my old review, updated to reflect the end of the series --\r\nSo, I did enjoy this anime, despite it's large amount of flaws, which a number of the reviews here point out.\r\nI did like the characters, the sounds, the animation and even the story, but that's just me; It was easy enough for me to watch and enjoy.\r\nI am going to point out the numerous flaws though:\r\nThe characters are extremely clich\u00e9 once you look at them and even after 9 episodes I still had noclue as to who was meant to be the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nWe later sort-of understand that Aoto, Midori and Akane are all protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episodes we think it's Aoto, then we have episodes purely for Akane and the same goes for Midori - so we think, \"ok the trio are all MCs\", but then we have other members of the academy popping up more and more - the \"rival team\" so-to-speak, then we have episodes centred solely on Arthur; it's a jumbled mess.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have character's backstories being shown, mentioned, teased, whichever. \\n\\n\r\nWe get to understand why Aoto is like he is, but not why he wants to go to the Divine Gate - as he keeps saying he has no wish and it becomes really confusing.\\n\\n\r\nWe then get a crumb of supposed backstory for Akane and Midori, but these don't really explain their pasts, but more explain why they're heading for the Divine Gate.\\n\\n\r\nAoto is the clich\u00e9 abused child who has never known love or happiness\\n\\n\r\nAkane is quite literally the hot-headed (and a fire user, go figure), get-angry, daddy issues character\\n\\n\r\nMidori is the always smiling happy-go-lucky type who is filled with regret after mis-treating her \"best\" friend.\\n\\n\r\nWe then get dumped into an almost different storyline with Arthur and his knights of the round table aiming to destroy the Divine Gate\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, I forgot to mention that we don't really know what the Divine Gate quite is (it merged the worlds and grants wishes) - where did it come from?\\n\\n\r\nWho are Loki and Oz meant to be exactly? What is up with Loki? Where did Shakespeare come from?\\n\\n\r\nI think this anime tried to squeeze way too much into its short running time and it ruined any order or understanding the story could have had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did enjoy watching it, but I just didn't take much notice of the bigger picture of the storyline, I just followed what went on episode by episode.\\n",

            "content": "Now  this shows promised a lot but failed to deliver.The main problem with this anime is how it tries to be phylosophical and deep although being just a typical shounen anime.  The first annoying thing you will notice is lot of narration describing what characters feel instead of showing this to way in other ways. The other big problem is the last episodes. They fight to the end to change their fate and break free from destiny and then give up and accept being controlled by the Council. This looks like NWO propaganda. They could have changed the world so that there isno more superpowers and that all the effects of the gates were gone, the council and the so called gods destroyed and no more gate, but no they decided to change themselves even though as long as they leave their fates to be controlled they cannot. This is bs. Is like running a race and when winning declining the prize. Who does that? The whole is all about the journey so prevalent in buddhist phylosophies is the biggest piece of bs ever.",

I lostinterest in it around episode 5.\\n\r\nNow i want to jump in more in depth of why i didnt like it.\\n\r\nSo while i did like the main cast of characters there were some that just didnt make sense for me like Loki, Oz, the Knights of Round, and the Gods. I didnt understand really why they felt the need to include characters like this and the whole \"play\" episodes really didnt make sense and seemed like it came out of no where. Then the whole Arthur wouldnt cave into Loki but does anyway and when they tried to act like all of the Knights of Round were killed but in the very last episode they show one of them and he says \"Oh yeah we werent really dead we cant die\" in lamest terms. So they wasted time making the viewer think they were dead just say \"hah nope gotcha\"\\n\r\nI thought going into this anime it was going to be awesome but i wasted my time. I wouldnt recommend this to people but if you truly want to watch it go ahead.",

            "content": "When I think about it this anime reminds me a lot of the TARDIS, it has so much bullshit crammed into it that when i was finished I had to take a step back just to make sure it was only 12 episodes. Despite its standard length this show manages to cram in every cliche, drawn out fight scene and mythological creature to create a mixture of so many things its difficult to care about any of them.\r\nLet's start with characters. The main protagonist is a typical, emotionally detached hero with a nondescript tragic backstory that manages to tell you nothing about him. To backhim up we have your typical moe female support who wants to see the good in him and the boy she doesn't realise is in love with her. For supporting characters we have every mythological figure ever. From the norse gods to Merlin to freacking Santa Claus this show has about forty of them, and tries to develop all of the leaving us with no one to actually care about.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the story. For this part I will only mention events and details revealed in the first episode. The main characters (and others as well) have elemental powers allowing them to perform attacks and even for weapons which (naturally) get bigger as the characters get stronger. The story centres around this \"divine gate\" which, if found, will grant anyone one wish. Everyone has something hey would really want to wish for but I honestly couldn't tell you any of them because, once again, they gave us way too much in very little time. Especially considering they actually go to find it less than halfway though the series. From their on it is a string of anti-climaxs and long, draw out battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe best parts of this anime are the art and music. The art style is beautiful, relying on its ability to change the colour theme to portray the mood of a scene very well, while still maintaining a constant underlying style. Both the opening and ending songs are very well put together and pleasant to listen to. During the anime the music is mostly out of the way but like with the art style helps set the mood of a scene very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i would have a hard tim recommending this anime to anyone. Its very boring and difficult to follow either the characters or story and you won't have a fun time doing so. The OP is worth giving a listen though.",

            "content": "Divine gate is an anime that is anything but loved. It's something new comes can enjoy, but that's the best I can say. I did enjoy parts of this show.\r\nTo start off with the best part, I'd say I really liked the main characters of this show. I thought they were good characters with good backstories. I even liked a few of the side characters. The problem is that there are multiple side characters that aren't very well fleshed out, because of the short length of the series.\r\nThe concept of the series is also pretty good, but yet again, doesn't get enough time to flesheverything out. There are plot points that look important, but mean nothing. There are characters who just make decisions without any logic. There are also characters who are too overpowered.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the music of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty good, but none if the animation is that great. Fight scenes are pretty bad. There was one fight that was one guy spamming the exact same attack repeatedly. There are some decent  fights, but those ones are scarce. The artwork for the series made me think it was going to be a shonen action series, which would've been better in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending really takes the cake though, I'm going to spoil anything other than that they wanted a sequel. It's highly unlikely at this point, but they wanted one.\\n\\n\r\nThe series tends to be all over the place in every category. I tried to like it, but kept thinking of Guilty Crown, which has similar problems to this show.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly can't recommend this show to anyone, it has nice moments, but fails in a lot of places for me. If you want to try it, that's fine, but proceed with caution.",

Reviewing only because this anime was so bad that it stuck out to me. .\r\nThe only reason why I toughed it out and finished this entire anime was because of its opening song. Other than that, the overall anime was lackluster.\r\nWatching the first episode led me to believe that this anime had a lot of potential. There were a lot of interesting ideas that could have been explored and further developed. However, as I watched on, I realized that this anime carried a lot of elements thatare strikingly similar to other animes. Firstly, the concept of this anime very closely resembled Fullmetal Alchemist. It resembled it so closely that it might as well have been a rip-off. Secondly, the three main characters' super powers very much reminded me of the starter Pokemon powers (fire, water, grass). Like really? They couldn't have wielded any other type of super power? And even if they didn't, couldn't the characters have utilized their powers more? Why did they even train to develop their super powers if they didn't even do anything with it in the end? It felt like a pointless waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nTl;dr - The director of this anime did a poor job in developing its concept. The story felt rushed. The characters didn't have any development. The dialogue was unsophisticated, even though the concept behind the Divine Gate was supposed to have a philosophical edge. Just watch FMA instead of this rip-off of an anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",
