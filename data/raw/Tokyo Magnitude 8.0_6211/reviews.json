            "content": "========\r\nConstructive Criticism would be appreciated through either PM or Comments\r\n========\r\nShe's Breaking Bit by Bit\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is something special. A human story told through naked eyes, this show did something that a lot of anime hasn't done for me lately, spark an emotional connection. It gently nudged me through the tale of a young girl named Mirai, her little brother Yuuki and a motorcycling delivery woman name Mari, as the world around them shattered into pieces. \r\nTokyo is crumbling; foundations are upheaved, buildings are leveled, and bridges are twisted till the tensions snap, as a magnitude 8.0 earthquake roars. Fires break out like crimson rashes,burning away homes all over the Kanto region. From the wake of the chaos, people stumble and endure, somehow crawling back home.\\n\\n\r\nMirai and Yuuki are tremendously endearing. Mirai is terribly pessimistic, always believing that fate has a bone to pick with her. She snaps at her brother for being her antithesis, a hopeless optimist at heart who believes that everything has to turn out alright. The older lead, Mari, serves as a nice foil to the pair, level headed and calm; she serves as a guide and guardian to the children. It's easy to appreciate how each character grew over the course of the tale; Mirai gaining a drop of her sibling's positivity, Yuuki gaining a touch of his sister's pragmatism and Mari learning she's not so invulnerable, as they hobble over the fractured roadways and splintering scenery.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot focuses on the trio as they trudge their way back to their families. The urgency is palpable as snapshots of destruction litter each episode from radio snippets to television clips. The three are twisted by stress and struggle to best figure out a way to deal with death and disaster. Even Mari, grounded and collected, stumbles from this tightrope. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is fueled by emotion and the most fundamental instinct any human has: to survive. It starts off slow, but it builds like a powerful crescendo into an unforgettable ending.\\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are inconsistent. I love how most of the character models were plain, unadorned figurines on the broken canvas of Tokyo. It lets the viewer focus on the detailed scenery; the cracks veining through the pavement, uprooted trees, shattered windows, twisted steel, and burning buildings. The artists captured the ruination and didn't seem to want ornate models taking away from it. On a more technical aspect, the CGI that is sprinkled throughout is done well, opting for a distinct cell-shaded look. It was irksome to find the animation to be uneven and, at some points, even choppy.  It's a shame, considering how much effort and thought was put into the art direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is nothing amazing, but it works with the show. The score moves with the ebb and flow of the small group's journey, cascading gently with the moments of calm before beginning to tumble with scenes of tragedy. I didn't quite enjoy the OP by the Abingdon School Boy, the upbeat tempo being too much of a contrast to the carefully paced tale. The voice acting is commendable for weaving the powerful tale. Mirai's faltering voice, echoing loneliness, pulled at my heartstrings, while Yuuki's voice brought a smile to my face.\\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe story slowly burns itself, never exactly rushing within the small frame of eleven episodes. I took Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 in tiny doses, an episode here and there. Nothing really pushed me to watch the next episode until I reached the last quarter. Things really pick up in the last three episodes, as the journey winds to an end, for a strong conclusion. It was only then that I felt satisfied with my investment in the series and appreciated the first eight episodes.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nIt's the realism that shook me. Every episode began with a disclaimer stating that the series was based on seas of research and simulations. Sure, the science is well and good; but it was really about the 'human' realism, overcoming the hopelessness. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a great anime, worth a watch by anyone who appreciates a good story.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a breath of fresh air amidst all the crazy ridiculous shows filled with giant mecha, deadly monsters, hot chicks, and moe guitar plucking girls. It takes a seemingly normal life of a bratty teenager and literally shakes up her world as she confronts the very face of humanity.\r\nStory [9]: Mirai is one of those bratty teenagers who is entering that stage of life where they just simply hate everything and anything. Being dragged to a robot exhibition by her younger brother Yuuki, in Odaiba, a catastrophic earthquake hits Tokyo and the city falls into chaos. The story follows Mirai's journey homeas she is accompanied by her brother and their guardian, Mari. It slowly paces itself through 11 episodes as Mirai and co. meet new people, and face the reality of such a life altering event. The pacing does seem slow at times, and there were certain events that could've been handled better, but it comes to a strong end as she reaches her destination.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7]: The animation is definitely not the strong point of this show. The character models were mediocre at best, and there were parts where it was just simply full of QUALITY. The backgrounds however, were designed quite well plus a mixture of CGI models interacting in the background gives it life. The OP and ED were done well consisting of montages of a ruined Tokyo. For a show that's not focused around sexy looking chicks or big bad explosions, the artwork by BONES is acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8]: There wasn't a lot of memorable music in the show but it does the job. The BGM is calm and serene as it is sharp and chaotic, and fits most of the scenes well. It's not like you really need some jarring suspenseful action music when you see buildings falling into pieces and such. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices fit the characters well. Mirai sounds like how a teenager should sound. Yuuki and Mari's voice job was done well too. They should like their own age, unlike some other characters in other shows where 16 year old girls would have deep silent voices, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, done by abingdon boys school, doesn't exactly get you pumped up and excited, but rather brings a sense of melancholic urgency. The ED fits in where it should be. An ending theme of everyday life as Mirai and co. look forward towards their destination.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9]: There wasn't a huge cast nor was it centered on many characters. The show reveals how humanity can react in such a crisis. There will always be the rash unreasonable people but there will always be the shining lights of hope who will assist you when you need it most. \\n\\n\r\nMirai got the brunt of all the development that was there in the show. She started off as a bratty teenager who rejects everything around her, like a prepubescent teenager should be, and slowly changes through the show as she faces the harsh reality that she's in. Yuuki is pretty much the catalyst in all of her development as he's the basic opposite of Mirai's initial personality. Yuuki was your typical happy kid. As the show progresses, we see a more mature face to his chippy exterior as he traverses through the desolate Tokyo city. Mari was their faithful guardian as she led them through the ruined city, in search of her own family. Mari started out as the cool, responsible, and protective character but as she finds out the whereabouts of her family, it is revealed that she is human just like everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall [9/8]: Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is not filled with giant beam shooting mecha. It doesn't have scantily clad magical girls. It has no moe school girl clubs nor giant tentacled monsters. It is a slice of a possible life that faces Tokyo in the modern day. The show may have its setbacks, but it is a show that reveals what realities we take for granted. It takes the everyday lives of regular people and turns their world upside down in the aftermath of an event that can happen to us all.",

            "content": "This anime is really bad.\r\nI watched this anime and suffered through it's entire 11 episodes. \r\nFirst of all I think some explaining is needed. I live in Chile, and I experienced three earthquakes of over 8.0 in the last 5 years. I have a niece 12 years old now, and in 2010 she was frozen solid with the 8.8 earthquake, she didn't move unless told to do so. This anime LIES about how people react to earthquakes.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThis show follows a couple of brothers and their amazing adventure in an all-too-shaky japan. How they UNREALISTICALLY live through all the aftershocks and find out that friendshipand family bonds are stronger than 10.7 megatons of energy.\\n\\n\r\nLittle tsundere-chan happens to have tremor immunity, because after standing in a dancing bridge, she walked head first inside a crumbling building.  \\n\\n\r\nThe land shook too much for a 8.0 earthquake, and Japan being Japan, it's highly unlikely for their buildings to be that poorly built. \\n\\n\r\nThat is NOT how people react to these events. Children like tsundere-chan end up traumatized and the odds of rebellious shit are null. \\n\\n\r\nHEY THE EARTH JUST SHOOK HARD ENOUGH TO DESTROY BUILDINGS AND BRIDGES, LETS JUMP INTO THE WATER. really japan?\\n\\n\r\nI also loved how people were free to walk wherever they wanted, almost as if there were no institution to keep public order. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 \\n\\n\r\nBones did a \"meh\" job, though the CGI sometimes made background people look like zombies. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nAww come one! That is no way near to how an earthquake sounds... SFX's were unnatural and didn't fit whatever was going on. Aside from music, sound sucked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nFrom the hyper annoying little brats to the extremely irresponsible lady, characters gave off a feeling of \"I don't give a fuck about earthquakes\". No, really. I insist, children become a bundle of stress and panic. If aftershocks are too strong, they may develop tremofobia, which happens a lot with kids. But tsundere-chan was fine enough to bitch at her little brother, that, ladies and gentlemen, is not stress nor panic nor fear nor related to earthquakes, that is being whiny.\\n\\n\r\nK KIDS IMMA GO LEAVE U GUYS ALONE AND BRB!!... really lady?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 3\\n",

            "content": "Among the debris of high school comedies and unoriginal harem anime that we find dumped at our feet every season, there is normally one or two series which look salvageable. Perhaps they have a premise that sounds interesting or an unusual art style. It may even just look like something that won't be filled with tsunderes and panty shots. For those who find themselves feeling dissatisfied with the majority of anime on offer every season, these titles provide a sense of hope. They are like a light at the end of a long, dark tunnel.\r\n But there is a downside to these shows that seemto promise so much, and that is that sometimes they fail to deliver. What sounded like an interesting premise has become nothing more than a change in setting; the eccentricities of that peculiar art style have been overlapped by substandard animation. We have escaped the torrent of lingerie, but still have to contend with that annoying tsundere character.\\n\\n\r\n Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 suffers from all of these faults to varying degrees, and it is an almighty shame, because it absolutely was not inevitable. While the emotional tale of two children caught in the middle of a natural disaster of an unprecedented scale will be enough to take in some, those who are not easily swayed by sentimentality will find themselves searching for the substance here, and be left feeling incredibly disappointed when it fails to materialise.\\n\\n\r\n The problem of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is twofold: the first is the nature of earthquakes and disaster relief; the second are the leading characters, the pre-teen girl Mirai and her younger brother Yuki. These two forces alone are largely responsible for the complete collapse of the show.\\n\\n\r\n The idea of a series which has a realistic take on an earthquake is one that would seem enticing to most; so often are stories of natural disasters exaggerated for dramatic effect that the idea of portraying them as they are in reality is quite refreshing. However, the reality of earthquakes is that they involve somewhere between ten seconds and two minutes of sheer panic and terror, after which they subside completely, barring the occasional aftershock or delayed building collapse. After the initial danger has passed and you've made your way to safety, it just becomes a matter of waiting to be rescued. \\n\\n\r\n Spending several episodes on \u2018waiting to be rescued\u2019 would of course be incredibly boring, and the creators recognised this. For this reason the children set out on the highly perilous and ludicrously impractical task of making their way back to their home, inconveniently located on the other side of one of the world's largest cities, which has just been struck by one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded. However as unlikely as this story seems, this is not the least of TM 8.0's worries: because even though it gives the cast a goal to work towards it still doesn't provide them with anything interesting to do on the way.\\n\\n\r\n There are times where we break away from the dullness of the main story, but sadly these are no more satisfying than the main plot. There is the occasional brush with danger, where an unfortunately timed aftershock will strike as the cast are stood underneath a swaying lamp post, are walking around carelessly inside a structurally unsound building, or just happen to be walking underneath a suspended grand piano... oh, what a rotten bit of luck.\\n\\n\r\n Alternatively the distraction will be minor sub plot. This will invariably take the form of a side story involving people the main characters encounter, and is always aimed at making the viewer realise that no matter how big you think your problems are, there is always someone worse off than you are. Some might say that a story about two young children separated from their parents by an earthquake would have already achieved that goal, but for some reason the writers decided that the point really needed to be hammered home; probably because otherwise people might notice just how uneventful this show really is.\\n\\n\r\n The experience of watching Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 feels somewhat similar to a being a passenger on a long car journey, a resemblance made all the more uncanny by the two annoying little children that accompany you throughout its run: the annoyingly self-centred preteen brat called Mirai, and her eternally optimistic young brother Yuki. Let us be grateful that this is one journey we can stop whenever we feel like it, without having to apologise to Grandma.\\n\\n\r\n While the series does not have a 'narrator' as such, Mirai takes the role of the main protagonist, and acts as our eyes and ears as we make our way through what was formerly known as Shibuya. Immediately this presents us with a problem, because unless you're a twelve year old yourself or are amazingly conscious of how you behaved at that age, then you are going to find it incredibly hard to identify with Mirai; and harder still to sympathise with her.\\n\\n\r\n What's so remarkable about her character is that she manages to remain her vain and selfish old self throughout the show. Almost unmoved by the catastrophic event she is stuck squarely in the middle of, not to mention the suffering all around her, she struggles to find the time to worry about anyone else for any longer than two or three consecutive scenes. It is hard to ignore the conscious effort being made to portray her character as human underneath all that self-absorption. That it seems so improbable only amplifies the problem; it's not hard to picture a twelve-year-old acting conceited, but to behave that way during the aftermath of a major earthquake?\\n\r\n Surely there is a point when instinct takes over, when the shallow front crumbles to reveal the scared little girl who is just old enough to recognise how powerless she really is amidst the chaos all around her? It's all just too much.\\n\\n\r\n While Mirai's character is annoying, she does have one redeeming quality and that is that she is not annoying as her younger brother's character. A little boy so filled with naivety and youthful optimism that it reaches out and pokes its finger down your throat. His very presence irritates his sister and she makes no attempts to hide her contempt, but Yuki doesn't bat an eyelid. He continues to talk, laugh and smile through it all, never once letting her nastiness form so much as a crack in his perpetual smile.\\n\\n\r\n While his character is much more believable than Mirai's is, because while it seems unlikely a preteen who is entirely aware of her situation would be able to distract herself enough to be self-conscious, the idea of a post-toddler not appreciating the gravity of the situation seems plausible enough. The problem is that while it is believable, it's still incredibly irritating. It all makes sense, but it's not in the least bit intriguing.\\n\\n\r\n Our two little darlings may be the leading roles but it is the guardian angel figure looking after them who is the true star of the show. While she is perhaps a little too idealistic to be believable, watching her is at least bearable. Her name is Mari and like all strong women she is a single mom who runs her own business. Needless to say these qualities make her not only dependable and quick-thinking, but also give her that caring instinct necessary to make someone go out of their way to help two lost young children. Of course, as the series progresses we become more and more aware of the imminent danger faced not only by Mari's young child, but also by her elderly mother. And of course, this does nothing to weaken her resolve to help our heroes or indeed to attempt to save her own family. It's a lovely thought, but sadly not one that seems terribly realistic.\\n\\n\r\n It's not all a shambles though, because the artwork for Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is of a reasonable standard. As a product of the Bones animation studio, it shares similar qualities to their other work- although the animation takes a noticeable plunge when compared to their cinematic works, which though hardly unsurprising or unique to this studio, since these are their most prominent titles it seems to become more noticeable. The backgrounds are fairly well detailed, although it should be noted that the promotional artwork is misleading in this respect. The animation is solid but alas, it does not attempt anything interesting either.\\n\\n\r\n The soundtrack however fits the show like a glove; the opening and ending theme is precisely the sort of music we would expect a pre-teen like Mirai to listen to, in other words Japan's answer to Linkin Park. The angsty sounding pseudo-metal, aside from being incredibly irritating, utterly fails to capture the seriousness of something as catastrophic as an earthquake. And if anything, this only emphasises the main story's failure to do so.\\n\\n\r\n As for voice acting, well I can tell you that the two main characters from the show are children. I believe no further explanation is necessary.\\n\\n\r\n Reflecting on the points that have been brought up over the course of this review, as well as its overall tone, it should not come as much of a surprise that I did not think much of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, and have gone to great lengths to justify that position. However while that may explain my overall perspective on the show it perhaps does not adequately explain why I dislike it so passionately. This was alluded to at the beginning of the review, but I would like to elaborate on it further before I conclude.\\n\\n\r\n Irrespective of the quality of the finished product, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 remains an example of something interesting; it shows a new direction for anime to take in the future. As it turns out, on this occasion it was a failure, and ultimately it failed to provide anything 'new' at all. This is the fault of the writers, who failed to make the best possible use of the great opportunity before them. Nonetheless, it has proved to be a success and TM 8.0 has managed to win awards and many fans. \\n\\n\r\n Do I think that it is worthy of such praise? No I don't, but I am very happy that it did, because it opens up more opportunities further down the line. If more animation studios recognise they can dare to be different, then they will. And from there it is simply a matter of finding the creativity or the talent to make something truly worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\n At the same time, the fact that TM 8.0 was not something great is the source of frustration, because while further opportunities may exist further down the road, at least one opportunity to make something fresh and exciting has presented itself, only to be squandered to provide some Land Before Time rip-off for twenty first century Japan.\\n\\n\r\n And just like real earthquakes, we can never quite work out when the next one is going to strike.",

            "content": "Score: 7.5 and here's why.\r\nImagine metropolis Tokyo. Full of large display screens, high-rise buildings, lights. People walk at a fast pace, cars honk through traffic, and trains drop off passengers. Now add in two vaguely drawn main characters and allow the seismism to begin. No, actually it's nothing like that. This isn't a Michael Bays' movie with stuff falling all over the place, you know?\r\nLet's get down to business.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWithout spoiling the main points, let's get to the point. Follow siblings, Mirai and Yuki Onosawa, into the world of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. One is in her rebellious teenage stage, the other is a talkative, curiousboy. As the story unfolds from a pre-earthquake state, the two embark on a journey to Odaiba, an artificial island located in Tokyo Bay, Japan (There goes away that mainland Tokyo scenery I just told you about). Little did the two know that what will behold them is a whopping (\"Forced\", I might add; Just watch for yourself) 8.0 on the Richter scale. The story unravels from there, depicting the hardships, the unpredictable, and a bond that seemingly grows stronger (Without being tedious in discord) as the series winds down. Portraying what would happen if an 8.0 actually hit Tokyo, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 actually does the trick in showing the realism of family, trust, and humanity. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 \\n\\n\r\nGood grief. What year are we in? The character designs, done by BONES and Kinema Citrus, could've been way better. It looked as though a first year elementary/grade school student did the work on the characters. In \\n\r\nthat sense, the characters seemed \"flat.\" The buildings and whatnot aren't too bad. But I'd tell you this. The animation quality could've used some more work on cell overlays and whatnot. However straightforward, the anime is still very effective in executing its job. Designs alone aren't judgmental in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nWith the widening chaos (Pictures) in the opening theme and a seemingly happy ending theme, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 did an excellent job in showing surrealism through the themes. The songs are pretty good, and go well \\n\r\nwith the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOpening Theme: \"\u30ad\u30df\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf (Kimi no Uta)\" by abingdon boys school\\n\r\nEnding Theme: \"M/elody\" by Shion Tsuji\\n\\n\r\nThe insert sounds, such as windows cracking and buildings falling, aren't too bad either. Put that in HD Audio and you got yourself something serious. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs stated in the Story review, the main characters undergo through carnage, building upon their indestructible (I don't know if that is the right word) bond along with bike rider, Mari. They undertake tough choices, cower from seemingly powerful aftershocks and other dangers, and most importantly, set an emotional standpoint where the viewer can see and sympathsize with. That, I believe, is the important element in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0's characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nAlbeit the \"forced\" situations and poorly drawn characters, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is still a must-see. In fact, it is a one of a kind anime - truly unique in that sense that it deals with realism. *This* realism that deals with the situation as it is and being prepared to deal with it accordingly. \\n\\n\r\nSide note: You will love life.",

            "content": "In Loving memory of those who died in the 11th March 2011 Tsunami tragedy.\r\n(Note to people, I'm not making a joke out of this review as I do with my other reviews)\r\nSo yeah, it's the latest news everyone is currently talking about. However since I'm not in Japan but I do want to have a feeling of empathy towards them so I decided to continue watching this series after dropping it. And I agree this is the best time to watch it (for those who have not) to get a feel of the situation\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is something unconventional. So you've seen before an animeservice about zombie outbreaks but how about something nearer to the fine line of reality? Sure, the story takes place in Tokyo whereas the current circumstances takes place in the north-eastern area of Japan, and based on this story, it was an 8.0 magnitude, whereas in reality this one is WAY bigger, a scale of 8.9. A natural disaster is always best told through the perspective of the 1st person rather than reported by the news network, which is what this anime is all about.\\n\\n\r\nOf course who would want to see their beloved land of the creation of animes and manga to be destroyed (though a lot of trolls and haters would joke about it) this is no laughing matter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers on three individuals as they try to live their best in their state of despair. Kusakabe Mari, Onozawa Mirai, and Onozawa Yuuki, three distinctive characters but with the same goal of returning to their families after enduring the tragedy. What holds before them is nowhere near anyone's guesses. What the anime have given us is a sense of realism. There's no macho superhero here to save them all. All you get is an everyday people, with their everyday life, trying to cope with what is in stored for them. I wont spoil further into the story as this is something you must experience for yourself. The first few episodes may be slow but it picks up fast during the climax of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI have heard criticisms and experience first hand the artwork of this anime. Although I much impress by the production of the CGI, there were other parts that needs serious amendments. The scene where countless of buildings are destroyed in an instant (not to mention the destruction daily routine of an average person) would send chills in your spines.\\n\r\nMusic is mediocre but blends in well with the scenario. The voice actors for each character brings out their true nature in the series. Their passionate voices during emotional scenes would send heart throbs throughout me during the course of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThough I would prefer a shorter or movie version of this anime, eleven episodes may tend to drag the story longer than it is needed. As I've said before, the story only started to get interesting nearing the ending. (But that doesn't mean you should just go skip it till the ending) Still it was enjoyable to watch nevertheless. No matter who's power you believe was responsible for this destruction, (God, mother nature, or even humans themselves) it gives us time to ponder, are we doing anything beneficial with our lives right now? Why are we wasting time reading manga and watching anime when disaster could strike anytime? Now you have a reason! To support back the rebuilding of Japan. Thus, don't only stop at watching free anime on streaming tubes, go buy yourself an original copy of the DVD! \\n",

            "content": "Note: If you found this review helpful (or not), leave me a PM or comment, and give me some constructive criticism!\r\nPost-note: All scores are compared to titles I have watched personally and represent the verbal \"score\" of that number, with a 7 meaning \u201cGood\". It is unrelated to the 1-10 grading that a lot of people seem to solely apply, without thinking of what it means.\r\nAnd now, without further ado, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 !\r\nFrom reading the synopsis, we come to understand that there is a 70% chance of a magnitude 7 or above earthquake occurring in Japan (and a 90% chance of one of 8.0or greater in the next 50 years for anyone interested). This is the major theme, if not the only one, due to which Tokyo Magnitude was created. We should keep this in mind when analyzing the strong and weak points of the plot. The fact that this particular anime was created with such a theme playing in the back of the minds has its effects on other parts of the plot, namely that one factor strongly determines how and what the plotline will look like.\\n\\n\r\nBONES chose to follow the life of a brother and sister, helped by a new (somewhat older..) friend, as they travelled across Tokyo following such an earthquake, as they try to find their way back home to their loved ones. We encounter both tragedy and hope, both misfortune and luck. The theme of the earthquake is however, ever-present; not only in the artwork (it's hard to ignore the major upheavals caused by it on the skyline and buildings of Tokyo..), but also in terms of the personal stories told by both the main characters and the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nThis is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it brings a breath of fresh air into an industry heavily influenced by highly unrealistic storylines which seem to break the laws of physics (and logic too, at times..) at every turn and twist. Tokyo Magnitude shies away from this, and tries to accurately represent how life in Tokyo would be like right after it was hit by a massive earthquake. This should be applauded, for obvious reasons; however it also causes one major problem with Tokyo Magnitude as a whole. Firstly, there's the fact that there really isn't much room for originality (story-wise), seeing as everything is already pre-determined. For the first half of Tokyo Magnitude, this makes the anime look more educative than enjoyable, while for the second half, when the creators try to move away from the earthquake \"theme\", new problems arise.\\n\\n\r\nThe major problem with moving away from a theme so ever-present is that it moves away from exactly that which BONES has endorsed, a \"realistic portrayal\" of life in Tokyo after a devastating earthquake. The last few episodes of Tokyo Magnitude, although very emotional, do not go along with the flow which has been set from the start. I see it as nothing more than the creators trying to fit in existing elements of anime, something which shouldn't happen. It has its merits and doubts, but I'd prefer if BONES had stayed true to their formula all along.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did find very enjoyable in this particular anime was how they represented society, the main characters, and how they dealt with such a disaster. We all know Japan to be a somewhat artificial and materialistic society, which sometimes cares too overtly about appearances and such. This is exactly how society is represented in the start of the anime, and also to a certain extent our main protagonist, Mirai. With the advent of the earthquake, these characters wake up to a nightmare. Their carefully created facades no longer hold any value. Although at first self-survival seems to be the norm, as the plot progresses, characters tend to open up and shed their facade. Nothing can so well illustrate this as the transformation that occurs in Mirai. Originally a spoilt girl, who cares more for texting than for her family, and who ridicules her brother's interest in robots, she opens up and sees that there's more to life than complaining and societal judgment. We can see this as a general criticism of Japanese society, although personally I tend to think that the difference between anime and reality in this particular case is somewhat overblown.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is generally simplistic. I won't criticize it extensively because it does after all grow on you, other than the fact that with current technology, especially that which is available to BONES, more effort should have been put into this department. Character faces are generally more realistic than many other anime, but they're not the epitome of realism either. Character designers should have made a more clear-cut decision on this particular aspect. Background artwork is very good though, well drawn and realistic. One could clearly picture oneself in a particular part of Tokyo just by looking at it, if you're familiar with the city that is.\\n\\n\r\nThe music score is nothing spectacular. The opening score by Abingdon Boys School (if the name doesn't hint it, I'll tell you that they're quite influenced by Radiohead) is enjoyable, yet not very original. The insert songs, although nice the first time, get somewhat overplayed, even for a 11 episode short anime such as Tokyo Magnitude. In short, nothing spectacular, but not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nComing back to my earlier argument of educative vs. enjoyment, I\u2019d have to say that you're somewhat more hard-pressed to find examples for the latter than for the former. This has its merits, but trying to counter-balance it with forced in emotional dialogue and events, which does happen, is not the way of doing this.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that this particular anime brings up somewhat mixed feelings in me. Although I\u2019ll readily highly praise the decision to give realism a go, I\u2019m just as likely to criticize this show when it moves away from it. It was moderately enjoyable. I did not like watching the series, nor did dislike it either. I am however quite ready to admit that this show is far from average when comparing to the rest of the anime industry, which is why a rating of 7 (\" Good\") should suffice quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nWho should watch this?\\n\\n\r\nRecommended: For those of you less interested in unimaginative drab and looking for something original, at the cost of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended: To those that like action, romance, fan service and whatnot, and watch anime for this reason, you will not find any of that here.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 deviates from the norm immediately in that it has a premise that's both interesting and factual\u2014researchers predict that within the next thirty years, a major earthquake will strike Tokyo, a city of over forty million people. \r\nThe series takes this science and humanizes it into a modern, disaster-induced coming-of-age story: Bitter, unreceptive teenager Mirai is on a trip with her annoyingly upbeat brother Yuuki. After a day in which just about everything goes wrong for her, she finds herself wishing that the world would be destroyed. Lo and behold, just as the thought enters her head, a colossal earthquake rocks the city.With much of Tokyo in ruins, Mirai, Yuuki, and a single mother named Mari band together in an effort to get back to their homes and loved ones using the only available means; their own feet. The story follows them as they navigate a veritable maze of dilapidated streets and buildings, with only each other to depend on when danger is encountered.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake that it isn't the kind of story that will have you on the edge of your seat, eager to start up the next episode. It's slow, and heavily focused on the interactions between characters, rather than on creating plot momentum. In the early episodes it's somewhat formulaic\u2014suspense is normally generated by either Yuuki or Mirai doing something stupid and becoming separated from the rest of the group, and when they're found, there's a lot of we're-so-happy talk. This quickly gets old, although, to its credit, the series finds a better stride five or six episodes in. There's also a lot of emphasis placed on the realistic reaction of the government to the crisis; various scenes show the army and other public bodies transporting citizens to safety, rescuing those trapped in debris, and handing out supplies to survivors. In a lot of ways that's neat, and it does lend a note of credibility to the series, but on the other hand I question how much of it is really necessary. After all, at its core the show is about the reaction of the three main characters to the crisis, not the crisis itself, so while the emphasis on the government relief effort is proof that the show's creators did their homework, it does end up feeling a a bit excessive at times.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, despite all of these efforts, the series falls a little short of creating the real atmosphere of panic that would have been necessary to make some parts of the show feel genuine. After the initial shock of the earthquake, nobody really seems overly concerned that large portions of their nation's capital have been destroyed; many of the extras just seem a tad irate, as if the wholesale decimation of the city is no bigger a deal than being late to the office. In fairness, Japan is a country that's not exactly a stranger to natural disasters, so a little bit of understatement in the reaction of the populace to the earthquake is expected, but this just felt off, as if some of the characters are third parties viewing the disaster rather than being there themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the high point of the series. The show presents us with Mirai, who is resentful of her parents and has a sour view on the world in general. However, at the same time, it doesn't villainize her or make her unlikable. It's clear even in the first episode that she has a bit of a soft spot for her brother, and we're given the sense that at least part of her bitterness is due to genuine neglect from her parents, and a very real teenage uncertainty about her future. The events of the earthquake show her just how fragile the world really is, and slowly force her to reconsider her thoughts towards her family and her life. The show strikes another excellent note with Mari, the single mother who accompanies Mirai and Yuuki on their walk home. She has her own child, who is at her home, but she opts to help the two siblings out of a sense of duty. As a strong-willed and optimistic woman who tends to make the best out of bad scenarios, she's a great role model for the pessimistic Mirai, and forces the teen to accept help and express herself in ways that she otherwise wouldn't have. At the same time, the attention she gives the children is a stark contrast to the apathetic attitude of their own mother, a career woman who's always just a little too busy for the kids. The cast's weakest link is Yuuki, who, aside from being one cheerful little bugger, doesn't have much going for him. This is forgivable in that he's mostly supposed to be a foil for Mirai, to show that she does, in fact, have a heart. The character relationships are effective enough to carry the show to places where its storyline and atmosphere alone could not have taken it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is notable for reasons both good and bad. In terms of background art and setting design, this is a reasonably high-caliber production. The metropolis of Tokyo is created (and destroyed) with an attention to detail that's definitely worth praising, and there is an impressive use of CGI for some of the more important structures (a huge bridge that's shown several times is a particularly good example). The CGI is sometimes conspicuous, but never to the point of being distracting or subtracting from the artistic quality as a whole. It's abundantly clear that realism was a goal for all facets of the series, and on this particular front, the art succeeds in generating a certain amount of believability. What doesn't work quite as well are the character designs, which are sub-par at best. All of the characters have abnormally broad, flat, oval-shaped faces with very few distinguishing features. They look generic, a little absurd, and rather unappealing in comparison to the distinct realism that characterizes the rest of the artistic effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack comes in at right about average. It's a musical score that's fitting, and not bad by any stretch, but also not memorable or particularly powerful. A lot of it is appropriately subdued and tending towards atmospheric, but in its more dramatic moments it can be overbearing, bordering on cheesy. For the most part it doesn't have a net negative or positive effect on the series; it's simply there.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some awkward stumbles, this series is a pretty solid coming-of-age tale with commendable character building, a strong premise, and a noteworthy emphasis on realistic depictions of a disaster in its art and story. I would recommend it with the caution that if you don't like slower dramas, this one probably won't change your mind. But for those who don't mind a more character focused series, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 has more than enough positive aspects to merit a viewing.",

            "content": "So first of all, hello everyone! This is my very first review on an anime even more so on myanimelist.net so... yeah. yoroshiku~ XD lol. Okay let's start shall we? \r\nStory- 9 (Great)\r\nThe story is great because it was something that I could relate to (even though this anime is not the type that I would watch) and I'm sure most of the people who watched this does too. It also pinpoints really good morals. It makes you feel guilty in a way and it makes you want to renew yourself you know. As you can see, my score is a 9 because although itwas really organized well and well thought of (the research that they gathered and the fact that this story is inspired by The Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923), the \"this would happen next feeling\" really comes true and I really hate it when that happens. But overall, I think the story was clever and well-made of. Didn't really seem that rushed in my own perspective. It will really touch your hearts watching this anime. :) (AND YES, THIS IS AN ANIME WORTH WATCHING) Honestly, I hate the genre but one friend really told me to watch it and I ended up watching the whole thing and it was just great. :D\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10 (Outstanding) \\n\r\nOk. Although the anime was not my type of art, to be honest, they did a really good job on making this as I watched throughout the whole anime. How they drew the different places that were mentioned in the anime was just superb. :D \\n\\n\r\nSound- 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nI am not lying! The opening of Tokyo Magnitude is really good. Why? It's because of the message (the lyrics) related to it word by word and I am really surprised how it turned out to be a good song. The ending too. (WILL DOWNLOAD IT AFTER I WRITE THIS... ^^) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10 (Outstanding) \\n\r\nHAHAHA. You ask another 10 why? Well, let's have Mirai as our explanation as to why. So in reality, I am an older sister and so is Mirai right? She really has the character of what an older sister would be: bossy, lazy, wishing that the world would end because her parents gives her a lot of responsibilities and that they nag at her a lot. I also really loved her character and I could even relate to it because when Yuuki (his brother) was missing at one point, she did her very best to find him, crying and saying \"I hope he didn't die yet. His not dead yet\". Well all sisters are exactly like this. Even if we fight with our siblings a lot of times, we do not hate them. We simply get angry over the littlest details but even we care for them when something bad happens to them exactly like Mirai. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10 (Outstanding) \\n\r\nIt was really fun to watch because it had it's silly moments and the enjoyment was really well-balanced in this anime (its happy moments and sad moments).  \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nOkay I have to be honest, it had its plot holes but this anime does not deserve bad ratings. This was something that the producers really researched on and when it came to the sad parts, this anime killed it because I really cried at the sad parts of the anime. This anime is really one brilliant anime I have to say. You don't really get to watch animes that have natural disasters so often so its really good. I highly recommend that you watch this anime guys!! ^^ \\n\\n\r\nSo this is the end of my review. I AM SO SORRY IF ITS LONG. I tried to keep it as short as possible but ugh. hahahaha! I hope that this was helpful in a way AND I AM BY OPEN TO YOUR REMARKS, SUGGESTIONS AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON MY REVIEW/S because I want to hear what you guys have to say about it and work on the stuff either I missed or lacked or on the way I write my review/s. Thank you so much for reading guys!!!~ ^^",

            "content": "I would like to start this review with a few words that truly express the ending of the first episode. \"Be careful what you wish for\".\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a 2009 anime that presents us with a what if situation and how people will react to said what if situation and it does a pretty good job showing what happens when a earthquake of that magnitude hits Tokyo.\r\nStory: The story is set around 3 characters who all meet up on the island of Odaiba after the initial quake and set of on a journey to make their way back home. The story in Tokyo Magnitude9.0 is great because it shows the journey it takes for our 3 MC's (Mirai, Yuuki and Mari) to get back to their homes but also explores what happens to friends, family and strangers as they traverse a destroyed Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty to look at and shows the world around them being destroyed and ripped apart. even the OP art design is beautiful to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a joy to listen to as the sound mixes in with the environment and changes to reflect the situation. If there was one complaint I had which is a minor one and I can look over is the lip syncing in the dub is sometimes off as in some scenes the characters mouths start moving and there is a slight delay but that shouldn't ruin your experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 was really essential to pull of such an amazing story and they pulled it off. Everybody had their own character development but the one I was interested in was Mirai's as she went from a 7th grader who always thought about the bad things of here family to caring for her younger brother and to getting him home safely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the anime's on my list that is a tearjerker and I will almost guarantee that someone would've have almost cried at some point of the anime as I almost did so it really deserves that nine and once you've watched one episode you will be hooked on it to see it to the end :)",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that this is my first ever review and I am no anime expert.\r\nGetting to the point is why Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a masterpiece to me is because I like series that shows the reality of life, the 'Slice of Life' genre. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 gave a beautiful portrayal of that viewpoint, also to mention that this is the first anime to make me cry, call me heartless and all but upon watching Angel Beats, AnoHana and other tear jerking anime this is by far the one and only anime that made me cry like a little annoying brat.\r\nStory10/10\\n\r\nTo avoid any spoilers I'll be only pointing out the plot.\\n\\n\r\n\"Everything should just be destroyed.\"\\n\r\nSo we have this brother and sister that went to a robot convention far from their home but then a sudden earthquake occurred with a magnitude of 8.0 now Mirai and Yuuki along with Mari (a person they met and help them all throughout) finds their way back home.\\n\\n\r\nThe story pretty much showed that how life can suck badly. Along the way you can see the tragedies that the Earthquake caused and the sufferings of other people. It gives you the other outlook of life and it just speaks to you how people strive hard just to live. Tokyo Magnitude's story at one point makes you question if your outlook in life is wrong. The story is so overwhelming that it makes it a little hard to explain.\\n\\n\r\nArt  7/10\\n\r\nI know the art isn't stunning like your typical moe anime or just the typical anime considering that anime is made at 2009, but you can digest the art and it isn't horrible at all. You'll get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI'll be really honest with this. I don't remember what the sound is like considering that I watched it a year ago but the sounds didn't bother me at all. The voice actors fits their characters so I say all is well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe developments of the characters are amazing, just straight up amazing, they changed in the few 11 episodes in this series.\\n\r\nAgain, not to spoil anything I'll just cover the icing on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up we have Mirai, a rebellious pessimistic girl who just really hates the whole world. Upon watching Tokyo Magnitude I found her development best you really see her change each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSecond we have Yuuki, the younger brother of Mirai, a cheerful optimistic boy that loves everything, the complete opposite of his sister, Mirai. Yuuki is a beautiful character you'll really like him at the start (at least I did) he is like the one that pulls you up in a bad day. Not much of a character development but Yuuki matured in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Mari, the girl they met at both the street and the mall, she's the adult that aided the two kids back home. When the earthquake occurred she helped Mirai find Yuuki when no one else wants to help Mirai, safe to say that Mari is a very good Samaritan. Like Yuuki, there wasn't much of a development for her but in every episode she matured more and more, not physically but mentally ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1000/10\\n\r\nEvery episode just sucks you back in. It makes you want to watch more and see what'll happen. Plus, I didn't feel that the story was rushed.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone just unless they can understand the story, it's just sad that many people overlook this series because of the art. It saddens me a bit that this is a very underrated anime.\\n\r\nWith that being said, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 landed top in my favourites.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0: catastrophe, and tremendous disaster.\r\nHave you already said to your family that you love them very much?\r\nDoes it necessary for you to someone to be disappear before you realize that they matters?\r\nHave you already realize the possibility that anytime from now a devastating tragedy will come?\r\nDo they need to disappear first before you act?\r\nThose are the possible questions that will sink into your mind while watching Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.\r\nStory depicts and illustrates the possible damages when a Magnitude 8.0 earthquake hits Tokyo. Still no one knows what would be the real damages when this one comes up.\r\nStory 9/10: Storyline of this anime isprecise and very detailed. It comes into a narrow classification which is Drama. Carrying only 11 episodes might not be enough to illustrate the whole story for this anime, yet still even the story was driven into a fast paced TV series  you\u2019ll end up into a tragic and yet inspiring ending. As this anime illustrates and replicates all of the reality here in this world, people will surely love this one, since most of us can relate with the story of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Art for this anime is excellent. It is obvious that too much effort was exerted just to make this one very realistic. When you come up and see, starting from the hometown of Mirai (Female Lead Character) all of the resources and structures are very detailed.  Also you can notice that the implemented art is realistic including the traditional houses, roads, and structure forms of every single location in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: When it comes to SFX elements, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 never failed to deliver the realistic illustration in any events. Plus Intro and Outro music are really nice and they were really fit for each animation. Voices of the characters really matched on how they act and how they speak.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Mirai contains the most annoying characteristics and traits in real life. But, this one is really good to demonstrate and illustrate both words which are \u201cREALIZATION \u201cand \u201cRELATE\u201d. Also having a personality that replicates a non-fiction individual in real life would be the best asset for this Anime. Since most of us can relate with the characters and to the story as well. \\n\r\nNot to forget that characters in here replicate the real life so they come up with generic and typical personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: If you are into an anime that replicates the real life, then you will probably enjoy this one. So I hardly recommend this one to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 would probably the best series that I\u2019ve already watched under this category, though I am not sure if there are some anime that is relevant with this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNote: This review never intends to please everybody. Also criticisms are always welcome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRegards,\\n\r\nAviJii Anne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Though it certainly reaches a level of quality that would warrant a detailed, gripping review, I don't think I can write one. There are a handful of very well handled reviews already for 8.0, however I don't feel that enough emphasis is placed on two pivotal aspects of this series; the leading trio, and the ending. Tokyo Magnitude is not without it's technical flaws, which I really have to keep reminding myself of. Because the cast completely blows away what you expect in any anime series, even the most artsy of shows. Mirai is a normal, broody, moody, angsty preteen. She has no superpowers, nosecret, she is not a hidden genius and she is not a kind-hearted maiden that treats even her enemies like kings. She's a prepubescent girl who gets bitchy and doesn't know why, which is a kind of realism no one else has yet to take a stab at. This is what teenagers are, and the little brother Yuuki is a great rendition of the classic little brother. While he isn't nearly as groundbreaking as his sister, his character works so well with hers, and it just creates this incredible atmosphere that really gets you rooting for them. Which leads me to probably the most noteworthy thing here: the ending. I really, truly have never cried in any movie besides American History X. And as far as anime, outside of Air, I don't think I've ever even teared up a reasonable amount. That is, of course, until I finished this show. I started to catch on to things around the second or third to last episode, and by the final one I think I cried for 3/4 of it. Maybe more. It is no doubt, more powerful if you have a sibling you are close to like I do, but if you have a soul at all, your going to cry to some extent. I bawwwww'd like I've never bawwwww'd before, and it's the only series that remembering makes me want to bawwww some more. I don't know if there will ever be an ending to rival the pitiful OH GOD WHY ending of this series, ever. When all is said and done, I think my biggest recommendation besides to be prepared for unstoppable sadness, and watch it alone. Unless you are having a crying party.",

            "content": "The ability to survive is something that exists in the core of every human being on this planet and it is always an experience to watch a piece of work try to depict what someone would do in a disaster scenario. Case in point Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.\r\nTokyo Mag 8 follows the experience of Mirai Onozawa, a freshman middle school  student who takes her younger brother, Yuuki, to a robot exhibition on a man-made island when, well read the title, in the course of this they meet Mari Kusakabe and then the three try to get back to the mainland and back home, and basedoff personal experience and from what I know off news reports and stuff, the production team has done a pretty good job for creating a Mag 8 earthquake, aftermath included. On a side note the recent earthquake and tsunami that hit the coast of Japan in 2011 was a Mag 9, just for comparison.\\n\\n\r\nWith the basic premise down, aside from the immediate shock one goes through when experiencing an earthquake, the anime goes a bit further by taking our characters through aftershocks and the general chaos that comes with an earthquake, hell the fucking Tokyo Tower comes down at one point, the only thing that the anime doesn't show really is looting.\\n\\n\r\nWith a cast of only three characters you will come to feel for these characters, even if the anime is a mere 11 episodes, granted it probably does this by somewhat breaking the trope of the protagonists being high school students, with Yuuki only being 8 and Mirai being at least 12 or so, the feeling of vulnerability inevitably creeps in, because these aren't capable  16 year olds, these are kids, granted they have an adult with them but still.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is average I supposed, although in my opinion the ED feelings out of place compared to the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is... difficult for me to describe, but the two things I can say about it is that the people's smiles are triangle and they manage to slip in some CG that you'll miss if you're not focused on the background.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Mag 8 is a great watch, it gives a refreshing break from the dim-a-dozen Shounen, Romance, Fantasy, and Mecha shows. There will be points where you are going to tear up in this anime, hell I teared up in the second episode, and the home stretch is a fitting end to a very good journey.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

            "content": "If you have an animelist similar too my own you're probably used to the typical action packed anime with a hint of drama and romance. You've seen the bit on \"believing in the strength of your friends.\" You've seen the occasional explosion wreck planets and cities and, if you're like me then you're probably looking for a breath of fresh air every now and then. For me, Tokyo Magnitude was more like a strong gale.\r\nStory: \r\nWhen starting this show I kind of figured what to expect considering it's title. It's, what I suppose you could call a \"disaster drama,\" or a series that starts witha natural disaster and plays from that point. While this was an accidental find I took the time to get into it, and in the very first episode I found myself hooked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nA rarity for me is that the art of this series caught my attention before the story. If you're a fan of Higashi no Eden's art style then I think you'll find adjusting to this anime very easy. That said, even if you don't like the art I think you should give it a try, after all, drawings alone makes no story.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs far as music and sound effects go, In my opinion Tokyo Magnitude does a good job at connecting the tone and the mood. Upon hearing it's opening theme I found myself a bit nostalgic and began a search as to where I heard the familiar beat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe characters are as real as any event in this show can be. No exaggerated reactions, no unexplained buffoonary, just typical people you'd find in everyday life. Mirai, a junior high girl troubled by her parents relationship. Yuuki a understandably naiive grade schooler, and Mari, a working single mother are the main focus of the story and it's not imposible to believe that people like them can exist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have to say that this series is highly captivating, although it took me a few days to watch from episode three onward, when I finally got the time I managed to finish it in a few hours. In the end, it was the type of series I was satisfied with the length of. It wasn't so long that it dragged out a story, and it wasn't so short that the story seemed rushed.",

            "content": "I\u2019ll be totally honest, I\u2019ve never been a big fan of disaster movies. The premise looks good on paper, certainly. A catastrophe of immense proportions occurs, usually a force of nature, and we follow a cast of characters as they, and mankind as a whole, brave the elements and fight for survival. It sounds great, but rarely do disaster films live up to that potential. More often than not, what we get is a trite drama with wooden characters set to the backdrop of said catastrophic disaster, and of course, a lot of collateral damage. Even worse, most of the time these disaster movies arehigh budgeted blockbusters that do more to sensationalize these disasters than capture the terror of actually experiencing one. Fortunately, this is not the case with Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, a well-researched and rigorously realistic account of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting Tokyo, and the disaster\u2019s aftermath. It is a simple but powerful story that captures the best and worst of the human species in the midst of an extreme situation.\\n\\n\r\nIn most respects, the plot of Magnitude 8.0 follows the same formula as most stories of this nature. It follows a small group brought together by the disaster, in this case middle-school student Mirai, her younger brother Yuki, and a single mother named Mari, who the siblings meet in the ensuing chaos of the earthquake. The three decide to travel together in order to get home and find their love ones: for Mari, her mother and 4 year old daughter; for Mirai and Yuki, their parents. As they travel through the ruined city, they encounter the great devastation and numerous tragedies caused by the earthquake, the various measurements put in place for such disasters, and individuals doing their best to pick up the pieces of their lives. At the same time, they must survive the earthquake\u2019s multiple aftershocks and the uncertainty of their loved ones\u2019 safety.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Magnitude\u2019s depiction of people during and after a major catastrophe is both harsh and humane. It captures the shock, panic, and sometimes indifference to the plight of others that people exhibit in dire circumstances. Even as Mirai runs around looking for her younger brother, worried sick about his safety, droves of people walk past her too shell-shocked to help. People push and shove and argue in lines for evacuation or supplies, sometimes even taking advantage of their seniority over Mirai and Yuki. These acts don\u2019t come from cruelty as much as desperation, people naturally put themselves over others during times of hardship. And yet, there are people like Mari, who go out of their way to help strangers who are clearly in need, even though they have worries of their own. There are trained professionals working hard to serve the needs of the countless affected by the disaster, and rescue teams searching through the rubble to find survivors. Even in the midst of such devastation, there is hope and admirability, and the show illustrates this just as strongly as its heart-breaking tragedy and harsh realism.    \\n\\n\r\nThe earthquake and its multiple aftershocks are horrifying and unsparing. Buildings crumble, landmarks like Tokyo Tower topple over, causing more devastation in their wake. People die by the dozens, even as they flee for safety. Homes are shattered and abandoned; families are torn apart. The damage is so wide-spread and expansive that the news can do nothing more than briefly summarize it, covering only a fraction of its extent. It\u2019s a horrifyingly realistic depiction of a natural disaster, one that resonates despite the fact it is animated. The research and effort that the staff put into creating as true-to-life a scenario as possible comes through clearly, and it is quite harrowing. Though the tragedy is very heavy here, it is justified by the realism of the situation. This is exactly how metropolitan area would look and feel if it was hit by an earthquake of this magnitude.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really separates Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 from other disaster movies/TV shows is its human story, which centers on the grueling and perilous journey of the three protagonists, particularly the negative-thinking Mirai. As the story progresses, Mirai transforms from a whinny and dissatisfied middle-schooler who is irritated by her life to a young lady who is grateful for all that she has. She does so through all the hardship and tragedies she encounters on her quest to reunite with her family; the things she learns, and the things she loses along the way. It\u2019s a conventional story, but one which is deeply impacting, both heart-breaking and uplifting. It\u2019s especially powerful considering the uncertainty of Mirai and Yuki\u2019s parents, and Mari\u2019s family, as the trio trek across the city. Plus, the last half packs a hard-hitting, if somewhat foreseeable, emotional dozy that very well might have some eyes watering. Enhancing the story is the sheer gravity of the situation, which is relatable in part because it is a terrifying possibility for anyone living near a fault line.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Tokyo Magnitude\u2019s technical merits go, this isn\u2019t one of the best animated shows by Studio Bones. That\u2019s not to say the animation here is bad by any means, in fact it is quite good, but it is not up to par with some of the studio\u2019s previous visual achievements. In particular, there are some character rendering issues and the character designs themselves do not allow for as much expressiveness as some other anime series the studio has done. The backgrounds on the other hand are incredibly well detailed, effectively capturing the cataclysmic devastation of a high magnitude earthquake. The direction is mostly straightforward, usually utilizing well composed medium and long shots to capture the characters traveling through the ruins of Tokyo, and close-ups for character reactions. There are some sequences and flashbacks which also add a bit more artistic flare in places, particularly in the last third of the show. The soundtrack by the great Ko Otani is simply exquisite, though the music is not used as often as in other anime. The music supports the material well when it is used, and frequent use of silence grounds the show a bit more in reality.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a powerful experience that stands as one of the best disaster stories put to screen. It is frequently sad and emotionally devastating, but also has faith in humanity. It is a reminder of the human spirit\u2019s ability to endure, and even find new strength in the face of great tragedy. The show came out in 2009, two years before the Tohoku magnitude 9.0 earthquake, and in that regard it is unsettlingly prophetic. It is not a stretch to think that there are some real-life stories which are similar to the one in this show. \\n",

The problems presented to the characters are tackled with great responses that may be irrational at times but are themselves genuine and believable. \r\nAdmittedly, the story is somewhat predictable minute to minute.However, there are few to no missed opportunities because of it; it won't leave you asking, \"Why didn't they...?\" \\n\\n\r\nLastly, there is an actual character arc, and an ending to a legitimate story with an epilogue; I felt very satisfied by the end. \\n\\n\r\nThough looking back on it, the show perhaps would have made a better movie.

Now we invent disaster that have never really happen. With Meteor (Armageddon and Deep Impact) a new ice age (The day after tomorrow) to the ultimate disaster film to date (2012). Since none of this has ever happen you rightly don't feel it will happen to you. \r\nNow with Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 we all know that this isn't just some possible science fiction but a real event that will happen. I myself live in Los Angeles andknow its only a matter of time before this actually does. And its that simple disaster of a normal earthquake that makes this piece so real. No super government organization will come to our rescue. It will be real heroes of everyday people that will do all they can for complete strangers. Hollywood has become so enamored with special effects that they have forgotten its actual the people that make the best stories. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 doesn't tell its story from the viewpoint of the military, public office or special services but from a 11 year old girl and her brother as they try to get home.   The characters are well thought out and believable. The music is very subtle and appropriate to the piece. You will quickly come to care from the characters and want to see then make their journey unharmed. Trust me even without all of the magic girls,mecha and vampires that are flooding anime of late this gem is definitely worth your time to watch. I sincerely hope it gets an American license I would love to own the actual dub.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, animated by Studio Bones back in 2009 and is 11 episodes in length. \r\nThis series is what my username is based off of and is also where my profile picture is from. This show is one of the few that has dragged me in from the very beginning until the very end, and I was completely in love with each and every aspect of this show. Partially due to my love of geology which is what I plan to pursue as a major in college, and mostly because of my love of world building. And now, on with the review!\r\n==================================================================\r\n~Story 8/10~\r\nThe storyof this show is just as the title implies, there is an earthquake at the beginning of the series with an magnitude of 8.0 that strike havoc in the city of Tokyo, Japan. Meanwhile the remaining part of the series picks up with two children that go by the names of Mirai and Yuuki that were off on their own when the quake had occurred and as the viewer you watch the two later unite with an older woman in her early 30\u2019s named Mari who ends up helping the two travel back to their home in order to reunite with their parents. But of course there are some obstacles in the way of these three in which they must overcome so that they can meet up with their family once again.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters 10/10~\\n\r\nAs I had previously mentioned above the main cast of characters include the following: Mirai, Yuuki, and Mari. \\n\r\nMirai, this 13 year old girl is a real brat at the beginning of the series but as time passes by she slowly becomes more and more mature for her young age. In the beginning of the show Mirai didn\u2019t care about what her little brother Yuuki had to say when considering what to get for their mother\u2019s birthday, but over time she slowly grew more and more attached with Yuuki to the point where she was worried even when he left her for just one moment in order to go get food or to go to the bathroom alone.\\n\r\nYuuki, the 8 year old boy who always made me want to reach into my monitor and give this kid a giant hug. Having to go through a catastrophic event at such a young age must have been traumatizing. This boy reminded me of my younger self in a way, always being needed to have been looked after and taken care of while also being someone who kept a smile on his face no matter what was going on in the world around him.\\n\r\nMari, the 32 year old mother who was brave and nice enough to take in two children that she just met and treat them as if they were her own children. Someone who always went out of her way to protect Mirai and Yuuki whenever an aftershock was to occur and to help provide food, water, shelter, and a sense of direction no matter where they were in the rubbles of Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\n~Music 6/10~\\n\r\nThe opening theme is a fun rock song but isn\u2019t memorable in the slightest. However the ending theme is calm and relaxing and just brings up a sense of joy in a show that can be quite saddening at times, but over time the song slowly represents a memory of how far the characters have come since the beginning of the show. As for the soundtrack, I don\u2019t remember much of it so there isn\u2019t much to talk about it.\\n\\n\r\n~Art/Animation 7/10~\\n\r\nThe artstyle is extremely realistic and detailed, tho the show doesn\u2019t have an extremely high budget so there are some derp faces here and there but that is not a big concern since it isn\u2019t impacting the series in any way. There is some cgi in the show but it is used in very short and small increments, nothing majorly important that would take you out of the show like for example the Fate/StayNight 2006\u2019s CGI Dragon. The animation is fluid throughout the show but never did anything groundbreaking that is worth pointing out.\\n\\n\r\n~World Building & Character Interactions 10/10~\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the show you can see people going to work or eating in a restaurant and doing other common day to day tasks until the initial quake occurs and then the city is near the verge of collapse within an instant, you can see pipelines bursted, electrical wires dangling, bathrooms flooding, and entire buildings destroyed while having hundreds upon thousands of people running for their lives in seek of shelter. Every street you look down there is a new structure that was just a hollow shell of what it once was, every way and which you look you can see people crying out for help, and every park you visit you will find free food and water distribution stations organized by the Japanese Government and/or from other emergency non-profit services such as The American Red Cross. Inside every church or school building you will find people who are offering blankets, food, and a place to sleep for the night while also having a rooms dedicated for those who are mourning the loss of a loved one.\\n\r\nAs for the character interactions, they are the most realistic and detailed that I have ever seen before in an anime. Complete and total strangers are helping out one another whether if it is to search through the rubble of an aftershock, or volunteer to help distribute supper or help wheel patients to the ER Room, and some who even to help guide other people by simply giving directions on where a certain building is located. There isn\u2019t a single person causing drama in the show because everyone has one goal in mind and that is to stay alive. \\n\\n\r\n~Final Thoughts~\\n\r\nThis show was originally my replacement series to fill the void that was left behind by Zankyou no Terror, however it not only filled it but made it even larger than it initially was. A series with extreme detail and research that was taken into consideration when making an extremely realistic series such as this one needs to be acknowledged and applauded for their hard work and dedication. For being someone who already wanted to study the field of geology, this show did nothing less but strengthen that desire. Long term short this series is nothing short of a masterpiece, but it is a shame at how this show went completely unnoticed to the general anime watching audience.\\n\\n\r\nI am awarding this show with an 9/10 and it has currently maintained its position in my Top 5 Anime List that I have seen up until this point in time. I just wish that I could find a series that is even remotely similar to this one.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. You are going to need a box of tissues because you will be crying like a baby while watching this show, unless if you are someone who has no soul or sympathy for human life.",

            "content": "A natural disaster is a frightening phenomenon. Even with modern society's advanced technology mankind has not yet been able to truly prevent them. When they do strike, cushioning the blow is the best we can hope for, and survival and recovery is a lengthy, arduous process. Such a shame then,, that disaster stories tend to neglect the human element in favor of shallow entertainment, degrading the disaster into little more than a glorified horror-movie monster.\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a disaster story with a mission. It mostly abandons the spectacle and sensationalism in favor of being a slower-paced story, focusing on human drama and emergency procedures.A noble aspiration, certainly; but as with most things, it's the execution that truly matters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with a teenage girl in the middle of a ravaged city landscape,wishing that the entire world just goes to hell. Then the clock winds back a bit to a few hours ago, to a simpler time.\\n\\n\r\nHer name is Mirai Yonozawa, a middle schooler living with her parents in Tokyo who finds her little brother annoying, thinks her parents are rather dull, struggles with her grades and has no real idea about what she wants to do with her life. In short, a typical teenager. Depending on the situation, she can be to be polite, kind,  brooding, friendly, petulant, perceptive or petty. She also has a cynical streak; or rather, the kind of cynicism employed by people who think they have the entire world figured out.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the start of summer vacation, and  Mirai is taking her younger brother Yuuki to an exhibition on the other side of town. Just as they're planning to go back home, disaster strikes in the form of a  violent earthquake that leaves the entire city in shambles. With the help of a kind stranger who goes by the name of Mari Kusakabe, the two siblings must now make their way through a devastated Tokyo to get home.\\n\\n\r\nAs the three trek through a shattered city, they are confronted by the best and worst in both others and themselves. Mirai finds herself having trouble adapting to a new landscape in which her easy faux-cynicism has no place. Yuuki finds comfort in clinging to Mari, who in turn is truly heroic in the way she cares for 2 children whom she only just met, while worry for the safety of her own loved ones is eating away at her. They're all interesting characters in their own right, but it's in their interaction that the story really shines: be it Mari's insistence to both Yuuki and herself that everything will be alright or Mirai's projecting of her own insecurities on others, and those are just a few examples. Even minor characters are depicted with similar nuance and care, making this a show with an excellent cast of characters across the board. \\n\\n\r\nSo, there's great characters with believable interaction; but what's admirable is that the story is actually willing to focus on them. From beginning to end, the focus is consistent: it's about people and their ability (or inability) to cope with a horrible situation. The makers could have shoehorned in a one-dimensional villain, but they didn't. They could have neglected characterization in favor of making a setpiece-driven story, but they didn't. The emotions Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 feel genuine. When a structure that looks unstable does cave in, there's a deep sense of dread rather than superficial excitement, and when characters who've been trying to keep their chin up are at the end of their rope, the despair feels crushing. The writers wisely choose to focus exclusively on the 3 main characters. We never cut to scenes of Mirai's parents or Mari's family, so we are just as in the dark about the safety of their loved ones as they are. It's a small thing, but it helps immensely in making the characters' worries that much easier to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one major knock that can be made against the series, it's that the climax features a turn that feels very out of place. While it makes sense thematically, it's very at odds with the atmosphere that permeates most of the story, and that's all that can be said about it without too big a risk of spoiling things. And while I praised the series for relying on its characters to carry the show rather than spectacular moments, it does have some contrived moments of heroism, though they are few and far between. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series manages to impress with surprisingly accurate depictions of collapsing structures and a wide array of striking scenes featuring the scarred Tokyo with twisted vistas and broken panoramas where beauty remains in kindness and selflessness shown by the people in it. In regards to character designs and animation, however, the series  tends to be serviceable at best, though there is a decent bit of diversity in the character models. One outright blemish in regards to visuals is the awful use of CGI to render the wide shots of large crowds, which ends up looking robotic and awkward.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was composed by Kou Ootani, who's proven himself a skilled composer with his soundtracks for \u201cHaibane Renmei\u201d and the video game \u201cShadow of the Colossus\u201d. Sadly, his work here isn't quite up to par. The tracks are all too unmemorable, though the sound director deserves props for nonetheless using them to good effect. Though it's telling that some of the series' most haunting scenes either limit the soundtrack's presence, or feature no music at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done though, Tokyo Magnitude uses a great cast of characters to tell a memorable story. One that's about many things: it's about love, it's about uncertainty, it's about strength, it's about the lies we tell ourselves and others to make it through tough times, and it's about the fear that bad things can happen to the people we love while we can do nothing to stop it. A few minor hiccups simply can't stop this from being a wonderful, emotionally resonant tale. It may depict Tokyo in shambles, but very few anime series form such a cohesive, expertly structured whole as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.\\n",

            "content": "========\r\nConstructive Criticism would be appreciated through either PM or Comments\r\n========\r\nShe's Breaking Bit by Bit\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is something special. A human story told through naked eyes, this show did something that a lot of anime hasn't done for me lately, spark an emotional connection. It gently nudged me through the tale of a young girl named Mirai, her little brother Yuuki and a motorcycling delivery woman name Mari, as the world around them shattered into pieces. \r\nTokyo is crumbling; foundations are upheaved, buildings are leveled, and bridges are twisted till the tensions snap, as a magnitude 8.0 earthquake roars. Fires break out like crimson rashes,burning away homes all over the Kanto region. From the wake of the chaos, people stumble and endure, somehow crawling back home.\\n\\n\r\nMirai and Yuuki are tremendously endearing. Mirai is terribly pessimistic, always believing that fate has a bone to pick with her. She snaps at her brother for being her antithesis, a hopeless optimist at heart who believes that everything has to turn out alright. The older lead, Mari, serves as a nice foil to the pair, level headed and calm; she serves as a guide and guardian to the children. It's easy to appreciate how each character grew over the course of the tale; Mirai gaining a drop of her sibling's positivity, Yuuki gaining a touch of his sister's pragmatism and Mari learning she's not so invulnerable, as they hobble over the fractured roadways and splintering scenery.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot focuses on the trio as they trudge their way back to their families. The urgency is palpable as snapshots of destruction litter each episode from radio snippets to television clips. The three are twisted by stress and struggle to best figure out a way to deal with death and disaster. Even Mari, grounded and collected, stumbles from this tightrope. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is fueled by emotion and the most fundamental instinct any human has: to survive. It starts off slow, but it builds like a powerful crescendo into an unforgettable ending.\\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are inconsistent. I love how most of the character models were plain, unadorned figurines on the broken canvas of Tokyo. It lets the viewer focus on the detailed scenery; the cracks veining through the pavement, uprooted trees, shattered windows, twisted steel, and burning buildings. The artists captured the ruination and didn't seem to want ornate models taking away from it. On a more technical aspect, the CGI that is sprinkled throughout is done well, opting for a distinct cell-shaded look. It was irksome to find the animation to be uneven and, at some points, even choppy.  It's a shame, considering how much effort and thought was put into the art direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is nothing amazing, but it works with the show. The score moves with the ebb and flow of the small group's journey, cascading gently with the moments of calm before beginning to tumble with scenes of tragedy. I didn't quite enjoy the OP by the Abingdon School Boy, the upbeat tempo being too much of a contrast to the carefully paced tale. The voice acting is commendable for weaving the powerful tale. Mirai's faltering voice, echoing loneliness, pulled at my heartstrings, while Yuuki's voice brought a smile to my face.\\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe story slowly burns itself, never exactly rushing within the small frame of eleven episodes. I took Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 in tiny doses, an episode here and there. Nothing really pushed me to watch the next episode until I reached the last quarter. Things really pick up in the last three episodes, as the journey winds to an end, for a strong conclusion. It was only then that I felt satisfied with my investment in the series and appreciated the first eight episodes.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nIt's the realism that shook me. Every episode began with a disclaimer stating that the series was based on seas of research and simulations. Sure, the science is well and good; but it was really about the 'human' realism, overcoming the hopelessness. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a great anime, worth a watch by anyone who appreciates a good story.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a breath of fresh air amidst all the crazy ridiculous shows filled with giant mecha, deadly monsters, hot chicks, and moe guitar plucking girls. It takes a seemingly normal life of a bratty teenager and literally shakes up her world as she confronts the very face of humanity.\r\nStory [9]: Mirai is one of those bratty teenagers who is entering that stage of life where they just simply hate everything and anything. Being dragged to a robot exhibition by her younger brother Yuuki, in Odaiba, a catastrophic earthquake hits Tokyo and the city falls into chaos. The story follows Mirai's journey homeas she is accompanied by her brother and their guardian, Mari. It slowly paces itself through 11 episodes as Mirai and co. meet new people, and face the reality of such a life altering event. The pacing does seem slow at times, and there were certain events that could've been handled better, but it comes to a strong end as she reaches her destination.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7]: The animation is definitely not the strong point of this show. The character models were mediocre at best, and there were parts where it was just simply full of QUALITY. The backgrounds however, were designed quite well plus a mixture of CGI models interacting in the background gives it life. The OP and ED were done well consisting of montages of a ruined Tokyo. For a show that's not focused around sexy looking chicks or big bad explosions, the artwork by BONES is acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8]: There wasn't a lot of memorable music in the show but it does the job. The BGM is calm and serene as it is sharp and chaotic, and fits most of the scenes well. It's not like you really need some jarring suspenseful action music when you see buildings falling into pieces and such. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices fit the characters well. Mirai sounds like how a teenager should sound. Yuuki and Mari's voice job was done well too. They should like their own age, unlike some other characters in other shows where 16 year old girls would have deep silent voices, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, done by abingdon boys school, doesn't exactly get you pumped up and excited, but rather brings a sense of melancholic urgency. The ED fits in where it should be. An ending theme of everyday life as Mirai and co. look forward towards their destination.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9]: There wasn't a huge cast nor was it centered on many characters. The show reveals how humanity can react in such a crisis. There will always be the rash unreasonable people but there will always be the shining lights of hope who will assist you when you need it most. \\n\\n\r\nMirai got the brunt of all the development that was there in the show. She started off as a bratty teenager who rejects everything around her, like a prepubescent teenager should be, and slowly changes through the show as she faces the harsh reality that she's in. Yuuki is pretty much the catalyst in all of her development as he's the basic opposite of Mirai's initial personality. Yuuki was your typical happy kid. As the show progresses, we see a more mature face to his chippy exterior as he traverses through the desolate Tokyo city. Mari was their faithful guardian as she led them through the ruined city, in search of her own family. Mari started out as the cool, responsible, and protective character but as she finds out the whereabouts of her family, it is revealed that she is human just like everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall [9/8]: Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is not filled with giant beam shooting mecha. It doesn't have scantily clad magical girls. It has no moe school girl clubs nor giant tentacled monsters. It is a slice of a possible life that faces Tokyo in the modern day. The show may have its setbacks, but it is a show that reveals what realities we take for granted. It takes the everyday lives of regular people and turns their world upside down in the aftermath of an event that can happen to us all.",

            "content": "This anime is really bad.\r\nI watched this anime and suffered through it's entire 11 episodes. \r\nFirst of all I think some explaining is needed. I live in Chile, and I experienced three earthquakes of over 8.0 in the last 5 years. I have a niece 12 years old now, and in 2010 she was frozen solid with the 8.8 earthquake, she didn't move unless told to do so. This anime LIES about how people react to earthquakes.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThis show follows a couple of brothers and their amazing adventure in an all-too-shaky japan. How they UNREALISTICALLY live through all the aftershocks and find out that friendshipand family bonds are stronger than 10.7 megatons of energy.\\n\\n\r\nLittle tsundere-chan happens to have tremor immunity, because after standing in a dancing bridge, she walked head first inside a crumbling building.  \\n\\n\r\nThe land shook too much for a 8.0 earthquake, and Japan being Japan, it's highly unlikely for their buildings to be that poorly built. \\n\\n\r\nThat is NOT how people react to these events. Children like tsundere-chan end up traumatized and the odds of rebellious shit are null. \\n\\n\r\nHEY THE EARTH JUST SHOOK HARD ENOUGH TO DESTROY BUILDINGS AND BRIDGES, LETS JUMP INTO THE WATER. really japan?\\n\\n\r\nI also loved how people were free to walk wherever they wanted, almost as if there were no institution to keep public order. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 \\n\\n\r\nBones did a \"meh\" job, though the CGI sometimes made background people look like zombies. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nAww come one! That is no way near to how an earthquake sounds... SFX's were unnatural and didn't fit whatever was going on. Aside from music, sound sucked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nFrom the hyper annoying little brats to the extremely irresponsible lady, characters gave off a feeling of \"I don't give a fuck about earthquakes\". No, really. I insist, children become a bundle of stress and panic. If aftershocks are too strong, they may develop tremofobia, which happens a lot with kids. But tsundere-chan was fine enough to bitch at her little brother, that, ladies and gentlemen, is not stress nor panic nor fear nor related to earthquakes, that is being whiny.\\n\\n\r\nK KIDS IMMA GO LEAVE U GUYS ALONE AND BRB!!... really lady?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 3\\n",

            "content": "Among the debris of high school comedies and unoriginal harem anime that we find dumped at our feet every season, there is normally one or two series which look salvageable. Perhaps they have a premise that sounds interesting or an unusual art style. It may even just look like something that won't be filled with tsunderes and panty shots. For those who find themselves feeling dissatisfied with the majority of anime on offer every season, these titles provide a sense of hope. They are like a light at the end of a long, dark tunnel.\r\n But there is a downside to these shows that seemto promise so much, and that is that sometimes they fail to deliver. What sounded like an interesting premise has become nothing more than a change in setting; the eccentricities of that peculiar art style have been overlapped by substandard animation. We have escaped the torrent of lingerie, but still have to contend with that annoying tsundere character.\\n\\n\r\n Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 suffers from all of these faults to varying degrees, and it is an almighty shame, because it absolutely was not inevitable. While the emotional tale of two children caught in the middle of a natural disaster of an unprecedented scale will be enough to take in some, those who are not easily swayed by sentimentality will find themselves searching for the substance here, and be left feeling incredibly disappointed when it fails to materialise.\\n\\n\r\n The problem of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is twofold: the first is the nature of earthquakes and disaster relief; the second are the leading characters, the pre-teen girl Mirai and her younger brother Yuki. These two forces alone are largely responsible for the complete collapse of the show.\\n\\n\r\n The idea of a series which has a realistic take on an earthquake is one that would seem enticing to most; so often are stories of natural disasters exaggerated for dramatic effect that the idea of portraying them as they are in reality is quite refreshing. However, the reality of earthquakes is that they involve somewhere between ten seconds and two minutes of sheer panic and terror, after which they subside completely, barring the occasional aftershock or delayed building collapse. After the initial danger has passed and you've made your way to safety, it just becomes a matter of waiting to be rescued. \\n\\n\r\n Spending several episodes on \u2018waiting to be rescued\u2019 would of course be incredibly boring, and the creators recognised this. For this reason the children set out on the highly perilous and ludicrously impractical task of making their way back to their home, inconveniently located on the other side of one of the world's largest cities, which has just been struck by one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded. However as unlikely as this story seems, this is not the least of TM 8.0's worries: because even though it gives the cast a goal to work towards it still doesn't provide them with anything interesting to do on the way.\\n\\n\r\n There are times where we break away from the dullness of the main story, but sadly these are no more satisfying than the main plot. There is the occasional brush with danger, where an unfortunately timed aftershock will strike as the cast are stood underneath a swaying lamp post, are walking around carelessly inside a structurally unsound building, or just happen to be walking underneath a suspended grand piano... oh, what a rotten bit of luck.\\n\\n\r\n Alternatively the distraction will be minor sub plot. This will invariably take the form of a side story involving people the main characters encounter, and is always aimed at making the viewer realise that no matter how big you think your problems are, there is always someone worse off than you are. Some might say that a story about two young children separated from their parents by an earthquake would have already achieved that goal, but for some reason the writers decided that the point really needed to be hammered home; probably because otherwise people might notice just how uneventful this show really is.\\n\\n\r\n The experience of watching Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 feels somewhat similar to a being a passenger on a long car journey, a resemblance made all the more uncanny by the two annoying little children that accompany you throughout its run: the annoyingly self-centred preteen brat called Mirai, and her eternally optimistic young brother Yuki. Let us be grateful that this is one journey we can stop whenever we feel like it, without having to apologise to Grandma.\\n\\n\r\n While the series does not have a 'narrator' as such, Mirai takes the role of the main protagonist, and acts as our eyes and ears as we make our way through what was formerly known as Shibuya. Immediately this presents us with a problem, because unless you're a twelve year old yourself or are amazingly conscious of how you behaved at that age, then you are going to find it incredibly hard to identify with Mirai; and harder still to sympathise with her.\\n\\n\r\n What's so remarkable about her character is that she manages to remain her vain and selfish old self throughout the show. Almost unmoved by the catastrophic event she is stuck squarely in the middle of, not to mention the suffering all around her, she struggles to find the time to worry about anyone else for any longer than two or three consecutive scenes. It is hard to ignore the conscious effort being made to portray her character as human underneath all that self-absorption. That it seems so improbable only amplifies the problem; it's not hard to picture a twelve-year-old acting conceited, but to behave that way during the aftermath of a major earthquake?\\n\r\n Surely there is a point when instinct takes over, when the shallow front crumbles to reveal the scared little girl who is just old enough to recognise how powerless she really is amidst the chaos all around her? It's all just too much.\\n\\n\r\n While Mirai's character is annoying, she does have one redeeming quality and that is that she is not annoying as her younger brother's character. A little boy so filled with naivety and youthful optimism that it reaches out and pokes its finger down your throat. His very presence irritates his sister and she makes no attempts to hide her contempt, but Yuki doesn't bat an eyelid. He continues to talk, laugh and smile through it all, never once letting her nastiness form so much as a crack in his perpetual smile.\\n\\n\r\n While his character is much more believable than Mirai's is, because while it seems unlikely a preteen who is entirely aware of her situation would be able to distract herself enough to be self-conscious, the idea of a post-toddler not appreciating the gravity of the situation seems plausible enough. The problem is that while it is believable, it's still incredibly irritating. It all makes sense, but it's not in the least bit intriguing.\\n\\n\r\n Our two little darlings may be the leading roles but it is the guardian angel figure looking after them who is the true star of the show. While she is perhaps a little too idealistic to be believable, watching her is at least bearable. Her name is Mari and like all strong women she is a single mom who runs her own business. Needless to say these qualities make her not only dependable and quick-thinking, but also give her that caring instinct necessary to make someone go out of their way to help two lost young children. Of course, as the series progresses we become more and more aware of the imminent danger faced not only by Mari's young child, but also by her elderly mother. And of course, this does nothing to weaken her resolve to help our heroes or indeed to attempt to save her own family. It's a lovely thought, but sadly not one that seems terribly realistic.\\n\\n\r\n It's not all a shambles though, because the artwork for Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is of a reasonable standard. As a product of the Bones animation studio, it shares similar qualities to their other work- although the animation takes a noticeable plunge when compared to their cinematic works, which though hardly unsurprising or unique to this studio, since these are their most prominent titles it seems to become more noticeable. The backgrounds are fairly well detailed, although it should be noted that the promotional artwork is misleading in this respect. The animation is solid but alas, it does not attempt anything interesting either.\\n\\n\r\n The soundtrack however fits the show like a glove; the opening and ending theme is precisely the sort of music we would expect a pre-teen like Mirai to listen to, in other words Japan's answer to Linkin Park. The angsty sounding pseudo-metal, aside from being incredibly irritating, utterly fails to capture the seriousness of something as catastrophic as an earthquake. And if anything, this only emphasises the main story's failure to do so.\\n\\n\r\n As for voice acting, well I can tell you that the two main characters from the show are children. I believe no further explanation is necessary.\\n\\n\r\n Reflecting on the points that have been brought up over the course of this review, as well as its overall tone, it should not come as much of a surprise that I did not think much of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, and have gone to great lengths to justify that position. However while that may explain my overall perspective on the show it perhaps does not adequately explain why I dislike it so passionately. This was alluded to at the beginning of the review, but I would like to elaborate on it further before I conclude.\\n\\n\r\n Irrespective of the quality of the finished product, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 remains an example of something interesting; it shows a new direction for anime to take in the future. As it turns out, on this occasion it was a failure, and ultimately it failed to provide anything 'new' at all. This is the fault of the writers, who failed to make the best possible use of the great opportunity before them. Nonetheless, it has proved to be a success and TM 8.0 has managed to win awards and many fans. \\n\\n\r\n Do I think that it is worthy of such praise? No I don't, but I am very happy that it did, because it opens up more opportunities further down the line. If more animation studios recognise they can dare to be different, then they will. And from there it is simply a matter of finding the creativity or the talent to make something truly worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\n At the same time, the fact that TM 8.0 was not something great is the source of frustration, because while further opportunities may exist further down the road, at least one opportunity to make something fresh and exciting has presented itself, only to be squandered to provide some Land Before Time rip-off for twenty first century Japan.\\n\\n\r\n And just like real earthquakes, we can never quite work out when the next one is going to strike.",

            "content": "Score: 7.5 and here's why.\r\nImagine metropolis Tokyo. Full of large display screens, high-rise buildings, lights. People walk at a fast pace, cars honk through traffic, and trains drop off passengers. Now add in two vaguely drawn main characters and allow the seismism to begin. No, actually it's nothing like that. This isn't a Michael Bays' movie with stuff falling all over the place, you know?\r\nLet's get down to business.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWithout spoiling the main points, let's get to the point. Follow siblings, Mirai and Yuki Onosawa, into the world of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. One is in her rebellious teenage stage, the other is a talkative, curiousboy. As the story unfolds from a pre-earthquake state, the two embark on a journey to Odaiba, an artificial island located in Tokyo Bay, Japan (There goes away that mainland Tokyo scenery I just told you about). Little did the two know that what will behold them is a whopping (\"Forced\", I might add; Just watch for yourself) 8.0 on the Richter scale. The story unravels from there, depicting the hardships, the unpredictable, and a bond that seemingly grows stronger (Without being tedious in discord) as the series winds down. Portraying what would happen if an 8.0 actually hit Tokyo, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 actually does the trick in showing the realism of family, trust, and humanity. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 \\n\\n\r\nGood grief. What year are we in? The character designs, done by BONES and Kinema Citrus, could've been way better. It looked as though a first year elementary/grade school student did the work on the characters. In \\n\r\nthat sense, the characters seemed \"flat.\" The buildings and whatnot aren't too bad. But I'd tell you this. The animation quality could've used some more work on cell overlays and whatnot. However straightforward, the anime is still very effective in executing its job. Designs alone aren't judgmental in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nWith the widening chaos (Pictures) in the opening theme and a seemingly happy ending theme, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 did an excellent job in showing surrealism through the themes. The songs are pretty good, and go well \\n\r\nwith the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOpening Theme: \"\u30ad\u30df\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf (Kimi no Uta)\" by abingdon boys school\\n\r\nEnding Theme: \"M/elody\" by Shion Tsuji\\n\\n\r\nThe insert sounds, such as windows cracking and buildings falling, aren't too bad either. Put that in HD Audio and you got yourself something serious. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs stated in the Story review, the main characters undergo through carnage, building upon their indestructible (I don't know if that is the right word) bond along with bike rider, Mari. They undertake tough choices, cower from seemingly powerful aftershocks and other dangers, and most importantly, set an emotional standpoint where the viewer can see and sympathsize with. That, I believe, is the important element in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0's characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nAlbeit the \"forced\" situations and poorly drawn characters, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is still a must-see. In fact, it is a one of a kind anime - truly unique in that sense that it deals with realism. *This* realism that deals with the situation as it is and being prepared to deal with it accordingly. \\n\\n\r\nSide note: You will love life.",

            "content": "In Loving memory of those who died in the 11th March 2011 Tsunami tragedy.\r\n(Note to people, I'm not making a joke out of this review as I do with my other reviews)\r\nSo yeah, it's the latest news everyone is currently talking about. However since I'm not in Japan but I do want to have a feeling of empathy towards them so I decided to continue watching this series after dropping it. And I agree this is the best time to watch it (for those who have not) to get a feel of the situation\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is something unconventional. So you've seen before an animeservice about zombie outbreaks but how about something nearer to the fine line of reality? Sure, the story takes place in Tokyo whereas the current circumstances takes place in the north-eastern area of Japan, and based on this story, it was an 8.0 magnitude, whereas in reality this one is WAY bigger, a scale of 8.9. A natural disaster is always best told through the perspective of the 1st person rather than reported by the news network, which is what this anime is all about.\\n\\n\r\nOf course who would want to see their beloved land of the creation of animes and manga to be destroyed (though a lot of trolls and haters would joke about it) this is no laughing matter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story centers on three individuals as they try to live their best in their state of despair. Kusakabe Mari, Onozawa Mirai, and Onozawa Yuuki, three distinctive characters but with the same goal of returning to their families after enduring the tragedy. What holds before them is nowhere near anyone's guesses. What the anime have given us is a sense of realism. There's no macho superhero here to save them all. All you get is an everyday people, with their everyday life, trying to cope with what is in stored for them. I wont spoil further into the story as this is something you must experience for yourself. The first few episodes may be slow but it picks up fast during the climax of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI have heard criticisms and experience first hand the artwork of this anime. Although I much impress by the production of the CGI, there were other parts that needs serious amendments. The scene where countless of buildings are destroyed in an instant (not to mention the destruction daily routine of an average person) would send chills in your spines.\\n\r\nMusic is mediocre but blends in well with the scenario. The voice actors for each character brings out their true nature in the series. Their passionate voices during emotional scenes would send heart throbs throughout me during the course of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThough I would prefer a shorter or movie version of this anime, eleven episodes may tend to drag the story longer than it is needed. As I've said before, the story only started to get interesting nearing the ending. (But that doesn't mean you should just go skip it till the ending) Still it was enjoyable to watch nevertheless. No matter who's power you believe was responsible for this destruction, (God, mother nature, or even humans themselves) it gives us time to ponder, are we doing anything beneficial with our lives right now? Why are we wasting time reading manga and watching anime when disaster could strike anytime? Now you have a reason! To support back the rebuilding of Japan. Thus, don't only stop at watching free anime on streaming tubes, go buy yourself an original copy of the DVD! \\n",

It is unrelated to the 1-10 grading that a lot of people seem to solely apply, without thinking of what it means.\r\nAnd now, without further ado, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 !\r\nFrom reading the synopsis, we come to understand that there is a 70% chance of a magnitude 7 or above earthquake occurring in Japan (and a 90% chance of one of 8.0or greater in the next 50 years for anyone interested). This is the major theme, if not the only one, due to which Tokyo Magnitude was created. We should keep this in mind when analyzing the strong and weak points of the plot. The fact that this particular anime was created with such a theme playing in the back of the minds has its effects on other parts of the plot, namely that one factor strongly determines how and what the plotline will look like.\\n\\n\r\nBONES chose to follow the life of a brother and sister, helped by a new (somewhat older..) friend, as they travelled across Tokyo following such an earthquake, as they try to find their way back home to their loved ones.

The theme of the earthquake is however, ever-present; not only in the artwork (it's hard to ignore the major upheavals caused by it on the skyline and buildings of Tokyo..), but also in terms of the personal stories told by both the main characters and the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nThis is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it brings a breath of fresh air into an industry heavily influenced by highly unrealistic storylines which seem to break the laws of physics (and logic too, at times..) at every turn and twist. Tokyo Magnitude shies away from this, and tries to accurately represent how life in Tokyo would be like right after it was hit by a massive earthquake. This should be applauded, for obvious reasons; however it also causes one major problem with Tokyo Magnitude as a whole. Firstly, there's the fact that there really isn't much room for originality (story-wise), seeing as everything is already pre-determined. For the first half of Tokyo Magnitude, this makes the anime look more educative than enjoyable, while for the second half, when the creators try to move away from the earthquake \"theme\", new problems arise.\\n\\n\r\nThe major problem with moving away from a theme so ever-present is that it moves away from exactly that which BONES has endorsed, a \"realistic portrayal\" of life in Tokyo after a devastating earthquake. The last few episodes of Tokyo Magnitude, although very emotional, do not go along with the flow which has been set from the start. I see it as nothing more than the creators trying to fit in existing elements of anime, something which shouldn't happen. It has its merits and doubts, but I'd prefer if BONES had stayed true to their formula all along.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did find very enjoyable in this particular anime was how they represented society, the main characters, and how they dealt with such a disaster. We all know Japan to be a somewhat artificial and materialistic society, which sometimes cares too overtly about appearances and such. This is exactly how society is represented in the start of the anime, and also to a certain extent our main protagonist, Mirai. With the advent of the earthquake, these characters wake up to a nightmare. Their carefully created facades no longer hold any value. Although at first self-survival seems to be the norm, as the plot progresses, characters tend to open up and shed their facade. Nothing can so well illustrate this as the transformation that occurs in Mirai. Originally a spoilt girl, who cares more for texting than for her family, and who ridicules her brother's interest in robots, she opens up and sees that there's more to life than complaining and societal judgment. We can see this as a general criticism of Japanese society, although personally I tend to think that the difference between anime and reality in this particular case is somewhat overblown.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is generally simplistic. I won't criticize it extensively because it does after all grow on you, other than the fact that with current technology, especially that which is available to BONES, more effort should have been put into this department. Character faces are generally more realistic than many other anime, but they're not the epitome of realism either. Character designers should have made a more clear-cut decision on this particular aspect. Background artwork is very good though, well drawn and realistic. One could clearly picture oneself in a particular part of Tokyo just by looking at it, if you're familiar with the city that is.\\n\\n\r\nThe music score is nothing spectacular. The opening score by Abingdon Boys School (if the name doesn't hint it, I'll tell you that they're quite influenced by Radiohead) is enjoyable, yet not very original. The insert songs, although nice the first time, get somewhat overplayed, even for a 11 episode short anime such as Tokyo Magnitude. In short, nothing spectacular, but not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nComing back to my earlier argument of educative vs. enjoyment, I\u2019d have to say that you're somewhat more hard-pressed to find examples for the latter than for the former. This has its merits, but trying to counter-balance it with forced in emotional dialogue and events, which does happen, is not the way of doing this.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that this particular anime brings up somewhat mixed feelings in me. Although I\u2019ll readily highly praise the decision to give realism a go, I\u2019m just as likely to criticize this show when it moves away from it. It was moderately enjoyable. I did not like watching the series, nor did dislike it either. I am however quite ready to admit that this show is far from average when comparing to the rest of the anime industry, which is why a rating of 7 (\" Good\") should suffice quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nWho should watch this?\\n\\n\r\nRecommended: For those of you less interested in unimaginative drab and looking for something original, at the cost of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended: To those that like action, romance, fan service and whatnot, and watch anime for this reason, you will not find any of that here.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 deviates from the norm immediately in that it has a premise that's both interesting and factual\u2014researchers predict that within the next thirty years, a major earthquake will strike Tokyo, a city of over forty million people. \r\nThe series takes this science and humanizes it into a modern, disaster-induced coming-of-age story: Bitter, unreceptive teenager Mirai is on a trip with her annoyingly upbeat brother Yuuki. After a day in which just about everything goes wrong for her, she finds herself wishing that the world would be destroyed. Lo and behold, just as the thought enters her head, a colossal earthquake rocks the city.With much of Tokyo in ruins, Mirai, Yuuki, and a single mother named Mari band together in an effort to get back to their homes and loved ones using the only available means; their own feet. The story follows them as they navigate a veritable maze of dilapidated streets and buildings, with only each other to depend on when danger is encountered.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake that it isn't the kind of story that will have you on the edge of your seat, eager to start up the next episode. It's slow, and heavily focused on the interactions between characters, rather than on creating plot momentum. In the early episodes it's somewhat formulaic\u2014suspense is normally generated by either Yuuki or Mirai doing something stupid and becoming separated from the rest of the group, and when they're found, there's a lot of we're-so-happy talk. This quickly gets old, although, to its credit, the series finds a better stride five or six episodes in. There's also a lot of emphasis placed on the realistic reaction of the government to the crisis; various scenes show the army and other public bodies transporting citizens to safety, rescuing those trapped in debris, and handing out supplies to survivors. In a lot of ways that's neat, and it does lend a note of credibility to the series, but on the other hand I question how much of it is really necessary. After all, at its core the show is about the reaction of the three main characters to the crisis, not the crisis itself, so while the emphasis on the government relief effort is proof that the show's creators did their homework, it does end up feeling a a bit excessive at times.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, despite all of these efforts, the series falls a little short of creating the real atmosphere of panic that would have been necessary to make some parts of the show feel genuine. After the initial shock of the earthquake, nobody really seems overly concerned that large portions of their nation's capital have been destroyed; many of the extras just seem a tad irate, as if the wholesale decimation of the city is no bigger a deal than being late to the office. In fairness, Japan is a country that's not exactly a stranger to natural disasters, so a little bit of understatement in the reaction of the populace to the earthquake is expected, but this just felt off, as if some of the characters are third parties viewing the disaster rather than being there themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the high point of the series. The show presents us with Mirai, who is resentful of her parents and has a sour view on the world in general. However, at the same time, it doesn't villainize her or make her unlikable. It's clear even in the first episode that she has a bit of a soft spot for her brother, and we're given the sense that at least part of her bitterness is due to genuine neglect from her parents, and a very real teenage uncertainty about her future. The events of the earthquake show her just how fragile the world really is, and slowly force her to reconsider her thoughts towards her family and her life. The show strikes another excellent note with Mari, the single mother who accompanies Mirai and Yuuki on their walk home. She has her own child, who is at her home, but she opts to help the two siblings out of a sense of duty. As a strong-willed and optimistic woman who tends to make the best out of bad scenarios, she's a great role model for the pessimistic Mirai, and forces the teen to accept help and express herself in ways that she otherwise wouldn't have. At the same time, the attention she gives the children is a stark contrast to the apathetic attitude of their own mother, a career woman who's always just a little too busy for the kids. The cast's weakest link is Yuuki, who, aside from being one cheerful little bugger, doesn't have much going for him. This is forgivable in that he's mostly supposed to be a foil for Mirai, to show that she does, in fact, have a heart. The character relationships are effective enough to carry the show to places where its storyline and atmosphere alone could not have taken it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is notable for reasons both good and bad. In terms of background art and setting design, this is a reasonably high-caliber production. The metropolis of Tokyo is created (and destroyed) with an attention to detail that's definitely worth praising, and there is an impressive use of CGI for some of the more important structures (a huge bridge that's shown several times is a particularly good example). The CGI is sometimes conspicuous, but never to the point of being distracting or subtracting from the artistic quality as a whole. It's abundantly clear that realism was a goal for all facets of the series, and on this particular front, the art succeeds in generating a certain amount of believability. What doesn't work quite as well are the character designs, which are sub-par at best. All of the characters have abnormally broad, flat, oval-shaped faces with very few distinguishing features. They look generic, a little absurd, and rather unappealing in comparison to the distinct realism that characterizes the rest of the artistic effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack comes in at right about average. It's a musical score that's fitting, and not bad by any stretch, but also not memorable or particularly powerful. A lot of it is appropriately subdued and tending towards atmospheric, but in its more dramatic moments it can be overbearing, bordering on cheesy. For the most part it doesn't have a net negative or positive effect on the series; it's simply there.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some awkward stumbles, this series is a pretty solid coming-of-age tale with commendable character building, a strong premise, and a noteworthy emphasis on realistic depictions of a disaster in its art and story. I would recommend it with the caution that if you don't like slower dramas, this one probably won't change your mind. But for those who don't mind a more character focused series, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 has more than enough positive aspects to merit a viewing.",

            "content": "So first of all, hello everyone! This is my very first review on an anime even more so on myanimelist.net so... yeah. yoroshiku~ XD lol. Okay let's start shall we? \r\nStory- 9 (Great)\r\nThe story is great because it was something that I could relate to (even though this anime is not the type that I would watch) and I'm sure most of the people who watched this does too. It also pinpoints really good morals. It makes you feel guilty in a way and it makes you want to renew yourself you know. As you can see, my score is a 9 because although itwas really organized well and well thought of (the research that they gathered and the fact that this story is inspired by The Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923), the \"this would happen next feeling\" really comes true and I really hate it when that happens. But overall, I think the story was clever and well-made of. Didn't really seem that rushed in my own perspective. It will really touch your hearts watching this anime. :) (AND YES, THIS IS AN ANIME WORTH WATCHING) Honestly, I hate the genre but one friend really told me to watch it and I ended up watching the whole thing and it was just great. :D\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10 (Outstanding) \\n\r\nOk. Although the anime was not my type of art, to be honest, they did a really good job on making this as I watched throughout the whole anime. How they drew the different places that were mentioned in the anime was just superb. :D \\n\\n\r\nSound- 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nI am not lying! The opening of Tokyo Magnitude is really good. Why? It's because of the message (the lyrics) related to it word by word and I am really surprised how it turned out to be a good song. The ending too. (WILL DOWNLOAD IT AFTER I WRITE THIS... ^^) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10 (Outstanding) \\n\r\nHAHAHA. You ask another 10 why? Well, let's have Mirai as our explanation as to why. So in reality, I am an older sister and so is Mirai right? She really has the character of what an older sister would be: bossy, lazy, wishing that the world would end because her parents gives her a lot of responsibilities and that they nag at her a lot. I also really loved her character and I could even relate to it because when Yuuki (his brother) was missing at one point, she did her very best to find him, crying and saying \"I hope he didn't die yet. His not dead yet\". Well all sisters are exactly like this. Even if we fight with our siblings a lot of times, we do not hate them. We simply get angry over the littlest details but even we care for them when something bad happens to them exactly like Mirai. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10 (Outstanding) \\n\r\nIt was really fun to watch because it had it's silly moments and the enjoyment was really well-balanced in this anime (its happy moments and sad moments).  \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nOkay I have to be honest, it had its plot holes but this anime does not deserve bad ratings. This was something that the producers really researched on and when it came to the sad parts, this anime killed it because I really cried at the sad parts of the anime. This anime is really one brilliant anime I have to say. You don't really get to watch animes that have natural disasters so often so its really good. I highly recommend that you watch this anime guys!! ^^ \\n\\n\r\nSo this is the end of my review. I AM SO SORRY IF ITS LONG. I tried to keep it as short as possible but ugh. hahahaha! I hope that this was helpful in a way AND I AM BY OPEN TO YOUR REMARKS, SUGGESTIONS AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON MY REVIEW/S because I want to hear what you guys have to say about it and work on the stuff either I missed or lacked or on the way I write my review/s. Thank you so much for reading guys!!!~ ^^",

            "content": "I would like to start this review with a few words that truly express the ending of the first episode. \"Be careful what you wish for\".\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a 2009 anime that presents us with a what if situation and how people will react to said what if situation and it does a pretty good job showing what happens when a earthquake of that magnitude hits Tokyo.\r\nStory: The story is set around 3 characters who all meet up on the island of Odaiba after the initial quake and set of on a journey to make their way back home. The story in Tokyo Magnitude9.0 is great because it shows the journey it takes for our 3 MC's (Mirai, Yuuki and Mari) to get back to their homes but also explores what happens to friends, family and strangers as they traverse a destroyed Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty to look at and shows the world around them being destroyed and ripped apart. even the OP art design is beautiful to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a joy to listen to as the sound mixes in with the environment and changes to reflect the situation. If there was one complaint I had which is a minor one and I can look over is the lip syncing in the dub is sometimes off as in some scenes the characters mouths start moving and there is a slight delay but that shouldn't ruin your experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 was really essential to pull of such an amazing story and they pulled it off. Everybody had their own character development but the one I was interested in was Mirai's as she went from a 7th grader who always thought about the bad things of here family to caring for her younger brother and to getting him home safely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the anime's on my list that is a tearjerker and I will almost guarantee that someone would've have almost cried at some point of the anime as I almost did so it really deserves that nine and once you've watched one episode you will be hooked on it to see it to the end :)",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that this is my first ever review and I am no anime expert.\r\nGetting to the point is why Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a masterpiece to me is because I like series that shows the reality of life, the 'Slice of Life' genre. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 gave a beautiful portrayal of that viewpoint, also to mention that this is the first anime to make me cry, call me heartless and all but upon watching Angel Beats, AnoHana and other tear jerking anime this is by far the one and only anime that made me cry like a little annoying brat.\r\nStory10/10\\n\r\nTo avoid any spoilers I'll be only pointing out the plot.\\n\\n\r\n\"Everything should just be destroyed.\"\\n\r\nSo we have this brother and sister that went to a robot convention far from their home but then a sudden earthquake occurred with a magnitude of 8.0 now Mirai and Yuuki along with Mari (a person they met and help them all throughout) finds their way back home.\\n\\n\r\nThe story pretty much showed that how life can suck badly. Along the way you can see the tragedies that the Earthquake caused and the sufferings of other people. It gives you the other outlook of life and it just speaks to you how people strive hard just to live. Tokyo Magnitude's story at one point makes you question if your outlook in life is wrong. The story is so overwhelming that it makes it a little hard to explain.\\n\\n\r\nArt  7/10\\n\r\nI know the art isn't stunning like your typical moe anime or just the typical anime considering that anime is made at 2009, but you can digest the art and it isn't horrible at all. You'll get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI'll be really honest with this. I don't remember what the sound is like considering that I watched it a year ago but the sounds didn't bother me at all. The voice actors fits their characters so I say all is well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe developments of the characters are amazing, just straight up amazing, they changed in the few 11 episodes in this series.\\n\r\nAgain, not to spoil anything I'll just cover the icing on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up we have Mirai, a rebellious pessimistic girl who just really hates the whole world. Upon watching Tokyo Magnitude I found her development best you really see her change each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSecond we have Yuuki, the younger brother of Mirai, a cheerful optimistic boy that loves everything, the complete opposite of his sister, Mirai. Yuuki is a beautiful character you'll really like him at the start (at least I did) he is like the one that pulls you up in a bad day. Not much of a character development but Yuuki matured in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Mari, the girl they met at both the street and the mall, she's the adult that aided the two kids back home. When the earthquake occurred she helped Mirai find Yuuki when no one else wants to help Mirai, safe to say that Mari is a very good Samaritan. Like Yuuki, there wasn't much of a development for her but in every episode she matured more and more, not physically but mentally ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1000/10\\n\r\nEvery episode just sucks you back in. It makes you want to watch more and see what'll happen. Plus, I didn't feel that the story was rushed.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone just unless they can understand the story, it's just sad that many people overlook this series because of the art. It saddens me a bit that this is a very underrated anime.\\n\r\nWith that being said, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 landed top in my favourites.",

As this anime illustrates and replicates all of the reality here in this world, people will surely love this one, since most of us can relate with the story of Tokyo Magnitude 8.0\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Art for this anime is excellent. It is obvious that too much effort was exerted just to make this one very realistic. When you come up and see, starting from the hometown of Mirai (Female Lead Character) all of the resources and structures are very detailed.  Also you can notice that the implemented art is realistic including the traditional houses, roads, and structure forms of every single location in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: When it comes to SFX elements, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 never failed to deliver the realistic illustration in any events. Plus Intro and Outro music are really nice and they were really fit for each animation. Voices of the characters really matched on how they act and how they speak.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: Mirai contains the most annoying characteristics and traits in real life. But, this one is really good to demonstrate and illustrate both words which are \u201cREALIZATION \u201cand \u201cRELATE\u201d. Also having a personality that replicates a non-fiction individual in real life would be the best asset for this Anime. Since most of us can relate with the characters and to the story as well. \\n\r\nNot to forget that characters in here replicate the real life so they come up with generic and typical personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: If you are into an anime that replicates the real life, then you will probably enjoy this one. So I hardly recommend this one to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 would probably the best series that I\u2019ve already watched under this category, though I am not sure if there are some anime that is relevant with this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNote: This review never intends to please everybody. Also criticisms are always welcome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRegards,\\n\r\nAviJii Anne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Though it certainly reaches a level of quality that would warrant a detailed, gripping review, I don't think I can write one. There are a handful of very well handled reviews already for 8.0, however I don't feel that enough emphasis is placed on two pivotal aspects of this series; the leading trio, and the ending. Tokyo Magnitude is not without it's technical flaws, which I really have to keep reminding myself of. Because the cast completely blows away what you expect in any anime series, even the most artsy of shows. Mirai is a normal, broody, moody, angsty preteen. She has no superpowers, nosecret, she is not a hidden genius and she is not a kind-hearted maiden that treats even her enemies like kings. She's a prepubescent girl who gets bitchy and doesn't know why, which is a kind of realism no one else has yet to take a stab at. This is what teenagers are, and the little brother Yuuki is a great rendition of the classic little brother. While he isn't nearly as groundbreaking as his sister, his character works so well with hers, and it just creates this incredible atmosphere that really gets you rooting for them. Which leads me to probably the most noteworthy thing here: the ending. I really, truly have never cried in any movie besides American History X. And as far as anime, outside of Air, I don't think I've ever even teared up a reasonable amount. That is, of course, until I finished this show. I started to catch on to things around the second or third to last episode, and by the final one I think I cried for 3/4 of it. Maybe more. It is no doubt, more powerful if you have a sibling you are close to like I do, but if you have a soul at all, your going to cry to some extent. I bawwwww'd like I've never bawwwww'd before, and it's the only series that remembering makes me want to bawwww some more. I don't know if there will ever be an ending to rival the pitiful OH GOD WHY ending of this series, ever. When all is said and done, I think my biggest recommendation besides to be prepared for unstoppable sadness, and watch it alone. Unless you are having a crying party.",

            "content": "The ability to survive is something that exists in the core of every human being on this planet and it is always an experience to watch a piece of work try to depict what someone would do in a disaster scenario. Case in point Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.\r\nTokyo Mag 8 follows the experience of Mirai Onozawa, a freshman middle school  student who takes her younger brother, Yuuki, to a robot exhibition on a man-made island when, well read the title, in the course of this they meet Mari Kusakabe and then the three try to get back to the mainland and back home, and basedoff personal experience and from what I know off news reports and stuff, the production team has done a pretty good job for creating a Mag 8 earthquake, aftermath included. On a side note the recent earthquake and tsunami that hit the coast of Japan in 2011 was a Mag 9, just for comparison.\\n\\n\r\nWith the basic premise down, aside from the immediate shock one goes through when experiencing an earthquake, the anime goes a bit further by taking our characters through aftershocks and the general chaos that comes with an earthquake, hell the fucking Tokyo Tower comes down at one point, the only thing that the anime doesn't show really is looting.\\n\\n\r\nWith a cast of only three characters you will come to feel for these characters, even if the anime is a mere 11 episodes, granted it probably does this by somewhat breaking the trope of the protagonists being high school students, with Yuuki only being 8 and Mirai being at least 12 or so, the feeling of vulnerability inevitably creeps in, because these aren't capable  16 year olds, these are kids, granted they have an adult with them but still.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is average I supposed, although in my opinion the ED feelings out of place compared to the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is... difficult for me to describe, but the two things I can say about it is that the people's smiles are triangle and they manage to slip in some CG that you'll miss if you're not focused on the background.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Mag 8 is a great watch, it gives a refreshing break from the dim-a-dozen Shounen, Romance, Fantasy, and Mecha shows. There will be points where you are going to tear up in this anime, hell I teared up in the second episode, and the home stretch is a fitting end to a very good journey.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

            "content": "If you have an animelist similar too my own you're probably used to the typical action packed anime with a hint of drama and romance. You've seen the bit on \"believing in the strength of your friends.\" You've seen the occasional explosion wreck planets and cities and, if you're like me then you're probably looking for a breath of fresh air every now and then. For me, Tokyo Magnitude was more like a strong gale.\r\nStory: \r\nWhen starting this show I kind of figured what to expect considering it's title. It's, what I suppose you could call a \"disaster drama,\" or a series that starts witha natural disaster and plays from that point. While this was an accidental find I took the time to get into it, and in the very first episode I found myself hooked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nA rarity for me is that the art of this series caught my attention before the story. If you're a fan of Higashi no Eden's art style then I think you'll find adjusting to this anime very easy. That said, even if you don't like the art I think you should give it a try, after all, drawings alone makes no story.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs far as music and sound effects go, In my opinion Tokyo Magnitude does a good job at connecting the tone and the mood. Upon hearing it's opening theme I found myself a bit nostalgic and began a search as to where I heard the familiar beat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe characters are as real as any event in this show can be. No exaggerated reactions, no unexplained buffoonary, just typical people you'd find in everyday life. Mirai, a junior high girl troubled by her parents relationship. Yuuki a understandably naiive grade schooler, and Mari, a working single mother are the main focus of the story and it's not imposible to believe that people like them can exist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have to say that this series is highly captivating, although it took me a few days to watch from episode three onward, when I finally got the time I managed to finish it in a few hours. In the end, it was the type of series I was satisfied with the length of. It wasn't so long that it dragged out a story, and it wasn't so short that the story seemed rushed.",

            "content": "I\u2019ll be totally honest, I\u2019ve never been a big fan of disaster movies. The premise looks good on paper, certainly. A catastrophe of immense proportions occurs, usually a force of nature, and we follow a cast of characters as they, and mankind as a whole, brave the elements and fight for survival. It sounds great, but rarely do disaster films live up to that potential. More often than not, what we get is a trite drama with wooden characters set to the backdrop of said catastrophic disaster, and of course, a lot of collateral damage. Even worse, most of the time these disaster movies arehigh budgeted blockbusters that do more to sensationalize these disasters than capture the terror of actually experiencing one. Fortunately, this is not the case with Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, a well-researched and rigorously realistic account of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting Tokyo, and the disaster\u2019s aftermath. It is a simple but powerful story that captures the best and worst of the human species in the midst of an extreme situation.\\n\\n\r\nIn most respects, the plot of Magnitude 8.0 follows the same formula as most stories of this nature. It follows a small group brought together by the disaster, in this case middle-school student Mirai, her younger brother Yuki, and a single mother named Mari, who the siblings meet in the ensuing chaos of the earthquake. The three decide to travel together in order to get home and find their love ones: for Mari, her mother and 4 year old daughter; for Mirai and Yuki, their parents. As they travel through the ruined city, they encounter the great devastation and numerous tragedies caused by the earthquake, the various measurements put in place for such disasters, and individuals doing their best to pick up the pieces of their lives. At the same time, they must survive the earthquake\u2019s multiple aftershocks and the uncertainty of their loved ones\u2019 safety.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Magnitude\u2019s depiction of people during and after a major catastrophe is both harsh and humane. It captures the shock, panic, and sometimes indifference to the plight of others that people exhibit in dire circumstances. Even as Mirai runs around looking for her younger brother, worried sick about his safety, droves of people walk past her too shell-shocked to help. People push and shove and argue in lines for evacuation or supplies, sometimes even taking advantage of their seniority over Mirai and Yuki. These acts don\u2019t come from cruelty as much as desperation, people naturally put themselves over others during times of hardship. And yet, there are people like Mari, who go out of their way to help strangers who are clearly in need, even though they have worries of their own. There are trained professionals working hard to serve the needs of the countless affected by the disaster, and rescue teams searching through the rubble to find survivors. Even in the midst of such devastation, there is hope and admirability, and the show illustrates this just as strongly as its heart-breaking tragedy and harsh realism.    \\n\\n\r\nThe earthquake and its multiple aftershocks are horrifying and unsparing. Buildings crumble, landmarks like Tokyo Tower topple over, causing more devastation in their wake. People die by the dozens, even as they flee for safety. Homes are shattered and abandoned; families are torn apart. The damage is so wide-spread and expansive that the news can do nothing more than briefly summarize it, covering only a fraction of its extent. It\u2019s a horrifyingly realistic depiction of a natural disaster, one that resonates despite the fact it is animated. The research and effort that the staff put into creating as true-to-life a scenario as possible comes through clearly, and it is quite harrowing. Though the tragedy is very heavy here, it is justified by the realism of the situation. This is exactly how metropolitan area would look and feel if it was hit by an earthquake of this magnitude.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really separates Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 from other disaster movies/TV shows is its human story, which centers on the grueling and perilous journey of the three protagonists, particularly the negative-thinking Mirai. As the story progresses, Mirai transforms from a whinny and dissatisfied middle-schooler who is irritated by her life to a young lady who is grateful for all that she has. She does so through all the hardship and tragedies she encounters on her quest to reunite with her family; the things she learns, and the things she loses along the way. It\u2019s a conventional story, but one which is deeply impacting, both heart-breaking and uplifting. It\u2019s especially powerful considering the uncertainty of Mirai and Yuki\u2019s parents, and Mari\u2019s family, as the trio trek across the city. Plus, the last half packs a hard-hitting, if somewhat foreseeable, emotional dozy that very well might have some eyes watering. Enhancing the story is the sheer gravity of the situation, which is relatable in part because it is a terrifying possibility for anyone living near a fault line.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Tokyo Magnitude\u2019s technical merits go, this isn\u2019t one of the best animated shows by Studio Bones. That\u2019s not to say the animation here is bad by any means, in fact it is quite good, but it is not up to par with some of the studio\u2019s previous visual achievements. In particular, there are some character rendering issues and the character designs themselves do not allow for as much expressiveness as some other anime series the studio has done. The backgrounds on the other hand are incredibly well detailed, effectively capturing the cataclysmic devastation of a high magnitude earthquake. The direction is mostly straightforward, usually utilizing well composed medium and long shots to capture the characters traveling through the ruins of Tokyo, and close-ups for character reactions. There are some sequences and flashbacks which also add a bit more artistic flare in places, particularly in the last third of the show. The soundtrack by the great Ko Otani is simply exquisite, though the music is not used as often as in other anime. The music supports the material well when it is used, and frequent use of silence grounds the show a bit more in reality.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a powerful experience that stands as one of the best disaster stories put to screen. It is frequently sad and emotionally devastating, but also has faith in humanity. It is a reminder of the human spirit\u2019s ability to endure, and even find new strength in the face of great tragedy. The show came out in 2009, two years before the Tohoku magnitude 9.0 earthquake, and in that regard it is unsettlingly prophetic. It is not a stretch to think that there are some real-life stories which are similar to the one in this show. \\n",

Now we invent disaster that have never really happen. With Meteor (Armageddon and Deep Impact) a new ice age (The day after tomorrow) to the ultimate disaster film to date (2012). Since none of this has ever happen you rightly don't feel it will happen to you. \r\nNow with Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 we all know that this isn't just some possible science fiction but a real event that will happen. I myself live in Los Angeles andknow its only a matter of time before this actually does. And its that simple disaster of a normal earthquake that makes this piece so real. No super government organization will come to our rescue. It will be real heroes of everyday people that will do all they can for complete strangers. Hollywood has become so enamored with special effects that they have forgotten its actual the people that make the best stories. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 doesn't tell its story from the viewpoint of the military, public office or special services but from a 11 year old girl and her brother as they try to get home.   The characters are well thought out and believable. The music is very subtle and appropriate to the piece. You will quickly come to care from the characters and want to see then make their journey unharmed. Trust me even without all of the magic girls,mecha and vampires that are flooding anime of late this gem is definitely worth your time to watch. I sincerely hope it gets an American license I would love to own the actual dub.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, animated by Studio Bones back in 2009 and is 11 episodes in length. \r\nThis series is what my username is based off of and is also where my profile picture is from. This show is one of the few that has dragged me in from the very beginning until the very end, and I was completely in love with each and every aspect of this show. Partially due to my love of geology which is what I plan to pursue as a major in college, and mostly because of my love of world building. And now, on with the review!\r\n==================================================================\r\n~Story 8/10~\r\nThe storyof this show is just as the title implies, there is an earthquake at the beginning of the series with an magnitude of 8.0 that strike havoc in the city of Tokyo, Japan. Meanwhile the remaining part of the series picks up with two children that go by the names of Mirai and Yuuki that were off on their own when the quake had occurred and as the viewer you watch the two later unite with an older woman in her early 30\u2019s named Mari who ends up helping the two travel back to their home in order to reunite with their parents. But of course there are some obstacles in the way of these three in which they must overcome so that they can meet up with their family once again.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters 10/10~\\n\r\nAs I had previously mentioned above the main cast of characters include the following: Mirai, Yuuki, and Mari. \\n\r\nMirai, this 13 year old girl is a real brat at the beginning of the series but as time passes by she slowly becomes more and more mature for her young age. In the beginning of the show Mirai didn\u2019t care about what her little brother Yuuki had to say when considering what to get for their mother\u2019s birthday, but over time she slowly grew more and more attached with Yuuki to the point where she was worried even when he left her for just one moment in order to go get food or to go to the bathroom alone.\\n\r\nYuuki, the 8 year old boy who always made me want to reach into my monitor and give this kid a giant hug. Having to go through a catastrophic event at such a young age must have been traumatizing. This boy reminded me of my younger self in a way, always being needed to have been looked after and taken care of while also being someone who kept a smile on his face no matter what was going on in the world around him.\\n\r\nMari, the 32 year old mother who was brave and nice enough to take in two children that she just met and treat them as if they were her own children. Someone who always went out of her way to protect Mirai and Yuuki whenever an aftershock was to occur and to help provide food, water, shelter, and a sense of direction no matter where they were in the rubbles of Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\n~Music 6/10~\\n\r\nThe opening theme is a fun rock song but isn\u2019t memorable in the slightest. However the ending theme is calm and relaxing and just brings up a sense of joy in a show that can be quite saddening at times, but over time the song slowly represents a memory of how far the characters have come since the beginning of the show. As for the soundtrack, I don\u2019t remember much of it so there isn\u2019t much to talk about it.\\n\\n\r\n~Art/Animation 7/10~\\n\r\nThe artstyle is extremely realistic and detailed, tho the show doesn\u2019t have an extremely high budget so there are some derp faces here and there but that is not a big concern since it isn\u2019t impacting the series in any way. There is some cgi in the show but it is used in very short and small increments, nothing majorly important that would take you out of the show like for example the Fate/StayNight 2006\u2019s CGI Dragon. The animation is fluid throughout the show but never did anything groundbreaking that is worth pointing out.\\n\\n\r\n~World Building & Character Interactions 10/10~\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the show you can see people going to work or eating in a restaurant and doing other common day to day tasks until the initial quake occurs and then the city is near the verge of collapse within an instant, you can see pipelines bursted, electrical wires dangling, bathrooms flooding, and entire buildings destroyed while having hundreds upon thousands of people running for their lives in seek of shelter. Every street you look down there is a new structure that was just a hollow shell of what it once was, every way and which you look you can see people crying out for help, and every park you visit you will find free food and water distribution stations organized by the Japanese Government and/or from other emergency non-profit services such as The American Red Cross. Inside every church or school building you will find people who are offering blankets, food, and a place to sleep for the night while also having a rooms dedicated for those who are mourning the loss of a loved one.\\n\r\nAs for the character interactions, they are the most realistic and detailed that I have ever seen before in an anime. Complete and total strangers are helping out one another whether if it is to search through the rubble of an aftershock, or volunteer to help distribute supper or help wheel patients to the ER Room, and some who even to help guide other people by simply giving directions on where a certain building is located. There isn\u2019t a single person causing drama in the show because everyone has one goal in mind and that is to stay alive. \\n\\n\r\n~Final Thoughts~\\n\r\nThis show was originally my replacement series to fill the void that was left behind by Zankyou no Terror, however it not only filled it but made it even larger than it initially was. A series with extreme detail and research that was taken into consideration when making an extremely realistic series such as this one needs to be acknowledged and applauded for their hard work and dedication. For being someone who already wanted to study the field of geology, this show did nothing less but strengthen that desire. Long term short this series is nothing short of a masterpiece, but it is a shame at how this show went completely unnoticed to the general anime watching audience.\\n\\n\r\nI am awarding this show with an 9/10 and it has currently maintained its position in my Top 5 Anime List that I have seen up until this point in time. I just wish that I could find a series that is even remotely similar to this one.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. You are going to need a box of tissues because you will be crying like a baby while watching this show, unless if you are someone who has no soul or sympathy for human life.",

            "content": "A natural disaster is a frightening phenomenon. Even with modern society's advanced technology mankind has not yet been able to truly prevent them. When they do strike, cushioning the blow is the best we can hope for, and survival and recovery is a lengthy, arduous process. Such a shame then,, that disaster stories tend to neglect the human element in favor of shallow entertainment, degrading the disaster into little more than a glorified horror-movie monster.\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a disaster story with a mission. It mostly abandons the spectacle and sensationalism in favor of being a slower-paced story, focusing on human drama and emergency procedures.A noble aspiration, certainly; but as with most things, it's the execution that truly matters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with a teenage girl in the middle of a ravaged city landscape,wishing that the entire world just goes to hell. Then the clock winds back a bit to a few hours ago, to a simpler time.\\n\\n\r\nHer name is Mirai Yonozawa, a middle schooler living with her parents in Tokyo who finds her little brother annoying, thinks her parents are rather dull, struggles with her grades and has no real idea about what she wants to do with her life. In short, a typical teenager. Depending on the situation, she can be to be polite, kind,  brooding, friendly, petulant, perceptive or petty. She also has a cynical streak; or rather, the kind of cynicism employed by people who think they have the entire world figured out.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the start of summer vacation, and  Mirai is taking her younger brother Yuuki to an exhibition on the other side of town. Just as they're planning to go back home, disaster strikes in the form of a  violent earthquake that leaves the entire city in shambles. With the help of a kind stranger who goes by the name of Mari Kusakabe, the two siblings must now make their way through a devastated Tokyo to get home.\\n\\n\r\nAs the three trek through a shattered city, they are confronted by the best and worst in both others and themselves. Mirai finds herself having trouble adapting to a new landscape in which her easy faux-cynicism has no place. Yuuki finds comfort in clinging to Mari, who in turn is truly heroic in the way she cares for 2 children whom she only just met, while worry for the safety of her own loved ones is eating away at her. They're all interesting characters in their own right, but it's in their interaction that the story really shines: be it Mari's insistence to both Yuuki and herself that everything will be alright or Mirai's projecting of her own insecurities on others, and those are just a few examples. Even minor characters are depicted with similar nuance and care, making this a show with an excellent cast of characters across the board. \\n\\n\r\nSo, there's great characters with believable interaction; but what's admirable is that the story is actually willing to focus on them. From beginning to end, the focus is consistent: it's about people and their ability (or inability) to cope with a horrible situation. The makers could have shoehorned in a one-dimensional villain, but they didn't. They could have neglected characterization in favor of making a setpiece-driven story, but they didn't. The emotions Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 feel genuine. When a structure that looks unstable does cave in, there's a deep sense of dread rather than superficial excitement, and when characters who've been trying to keep their chin up are at the end of their rope, the despair feels crushing. The writers wisely choose to focus exclusively on the 3 main characters. We never cut to scenes of Mirai's parents or Mari's family, so we are just as in the dark about the safety of their loved ones as they are. It's a small thing, but it helps immensely in making the characters' worries that much easier to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one major knock that can be made against the series, it's that the climax features a turn that feels very out of place. While it makes sense thematically, it's very at odds with the atmosphere that permeates most of the story, and that's all that can be said about it without too big a risk of spoiling things. And while I praised the series for relying on its characters to carry the show rather than spectacular moments, it does have some contrived moments of heroism, though they are few and far between. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series manages to impress with surprisingly accurate depictions of collapsing structures and a wide array of striking scenes featuring the scarred Tokyo with twisted vistas and broken panoramas where beauty remains in kindness and selflessness shown by the people in it. In regards to character designs and animation, however, the series  tends to be serviceable at best, though there is a decent bit of diversity in the character models. One outright blemish in regards to visuals is the awful use of CGI to render the wide shots of large crowds, which ends up looking robotic and awkward.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was composed by Kou Ootani, who's proven himself a skilled composer with his soundtracks for \u201cHaibane Renmei\u201d and the video game \u201cShadow of the Colossus\u201d. Sadly, his work here isn't quite up to par. The tracks are all too unmemorable, though the sound director deserves props for nonetheless using them to good effect. Though it's telling that some of the series' most haunting scenes either limit the soundtrack's presence, or feature no music at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done though, Tokyo Magnitude uses a great cast of characters to tell a memorable story. One that's about many things: it's about love, it's about uncertainty, it's about strength, it's about the lies we tell ourselves and others to make it through tough times, and it's about the fear that bad things can happen to the people we love while we can do nothing to stop it. A few minor hiccups simply can't stop this from being a wonderful, emotionally resonant tale. It may depict Tokyo in shambles, but very few anime series form such a cohesive, expertly structured whole as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.\\n",

            "content": "As beautiful and grand as it may be sometimes, face it, your, my, or anyone's life isn't a novel or a movie. People have always found it hard to face the fact that we are just not that important to the world; living with such uncertainty is an internal struggle each one of us can either deal with or be dealt with.\r\nThough there are those times when it feels like humanity is like a colony of ants in a glass container, looking out into the unknown or living about their simple lives littered with chores - each one of us sentient beings IS important. Sadly,it usually takes a tragedy the size of an earthquake for us to figure that out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story shows the simple life. In its simplicity, it is sometimes grand and other times less so. Still, the first 5 or 6 episodes are pretty darn good to get you going and the last two are exquisite; taking into account that there are eleven total, that's quite solid.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt depicts the earthquake, the shattered buildings and that whole chaos in a very realistic fashion. Lots of details in the surroundings, little in character design, though the latter still is somehow fitting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSubtle, enough to accentuate the atmosphere. Love the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThough this anime focuses more on depicting the potential earthquake and all that follows, the characters feel human and therefore are easy to relate to, so you could say they are one of the best aspects of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is quite enjoyable for the most part. Right before the end there are a few episodes that are...okay really...but ruin the average score in this category. I don't know, those seem to be there simply to increase the episode count, though of course there are moments which are rather important for the plot there too. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n",

            "content": "This show is first of it's kind that i have watched I all I can say is that it was pure awesomeness. Everything from story to characters were all very realistic and believable. There's none or very little of that 'convenient coincidence' that seems to happen all the time in other animes.\r\nStory- The story was very original about 2 siblings, Mirai the older sister and Yuuki the younger brother, making their way home from Odaiba after a huge earthquake struck Tokyo. That's not all there is to it though. The story is pretty deep and gets emotional at parts. The ending had me crying somuch.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The drawings in this anime were very simple. Sometimes they people can seem a bit 'off' but it is a thing that you soon get used to. After a while the art grew on me and I started to think it was pretty good actually.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The music used in this anime was very much to my taste. The OP is Kimi no Uta by abingdon boys school and the ED is M/elody by Shion Tsuji.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- As I said before, the characters in this anime are very real. The older sister is a teenager in that phase where she practically hates everything. The younger brother is a bright energetic little kid who just wants his family to stop fighting so much and just get along like how they used to. Through the anime Mirai's personality grows and she changes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I completely enjoyed this anime and totally recommend it to anybody looking for an anime that's different from the usual.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- The story is very compelling and enjoyable. The art even though it is very simple will soon grow on you and you won't even notice how simple it is. Music for this show was very much to my taste and I couldn't complain about it at all. The characters are all just like real people and their development of personalities was great. I thoroughly enjoyed this and I reckon it is one of my favourite animes.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Konichiwa all! My first written review c:. Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a short anime depicting what would happen if an 8.0 earthquake were to hit Japan. I would love some feedback, or some friends. pls.\r\n*spoiler free!*\r\nThe story follows two siblings and a bike rider making their way through the shattered remains of Japan back home, the people they meet and stories they learn. It is truly about the journey than the end.\r\n+ The show is rather \"unique\". No kawaii brain dead cheer leading cardboard cut-out of a character will be found here. In fact the producers have attempted to make the show as realistic asthey can. The realism does work in delivering the drama and emphasizing how bad the situation is, but many doubt whether an earthquake to that scale would cause such destruction. Especially in Japan where earthquakes are very common and methods are in place to prevent too much damage. \\n\\n\r\n+ The visuals in TM8.0 are quite decent with a lot of attention to detail on destruction. The characters do look a bit bland but that\u2019s just nit-picking. The animation of the earthquake looks fluid and realistic; to be fair I\u2019ve never actually seen an earthquake. Some episodes have a dip in animation however it isn't very noticeable. Some I\u2019m starting to see more and more in anime are awkward CGI people in backgrounds, it feels wrong but those scenes are very short.  Overall good stuff.\\n\\n\r\n+Drama. I honestly did not expect to get so engrossed in this series; more often than not I would shed a few tears. I often found myself getting attached to the characters and worrying about their wellbeing. Many cliff hangers involved the characters in threat, this got me addicted to the show.\\n\\n\r\n+Ending Song: Good stuff, a really sweet song which sounds like it\u2019s being sang by the main character c:. The guitar is appropriate and just adds to the \"feels\".\\n\\n\r\n+Pace. With this series only having 11 episodes there wasn\u2019t much the producers could have really fitted, in my opinion the pace of the show is excellent, there wasn\u2019t any time where I was bored. \\n\\n\r\n- Opening song. I quite simply can\u2019t get into it; it\u2019s not very catchy or memorable. The illustrations shown in the opening are pretty good but I doubt you will be even be watching them. I\u2019m sure the lyrics have some deep provoking message but I skipped the OP to get straight into the episode.\\n\r\n-The ending. Without revealing too much, *something* happens in about episode 8 or 9 and afterwards the show gives us an abundance amount of hints of what has happened to the point where it's so obvious you must be mentally retarded not to get. What's annoying is that these hint scenes go on for quite some time as the main character (\"mentally retarded\") needs some time to figure out what is going on. \\n\\n\r\n-Mirai and Yukki. uhh i mean Yuuki. (YUKKI YUKKI YUKKI YUKKI!!!!) First; Mirai. She gives off a really bad impression at the start. A young ungrateful teenage brat and to be fair that is exactly what she is. I would have ranted about her but then I reminded myself I was a lot worse in my early teenage years when compared to Mirai. That isn't really an excuse but her character develops as the series goes on, we get a completely different person at the end and she becomes more likable as we forget her past and give her our bag full of sympathy. The same almost goes for Yuuki, annoying asf but can be forgiven as the series progresses. The supporting characters range from stupid to remarkably kind.\\n\\n\r\n-Story. Not the most original or interesting story, (I mean earth quakes happen all the time everywhere) but the producers do a great job of telling their story. It doesn\u2019t really go far from the characters\u2019 journey from point A to B but on a positive note the show ends with a solid conclusion which will make you smile.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this show, I watched it in the span of two days and enjoy ever last bit of it. It\u2019s a good show to reflect on afterwards and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve experienced it. What stops this show from getting a higher score is the lack of a stimulating story. As far as I know there isn\u2019t any other anime series about an earthquake and it\u2019s disappointing how they didn\u2019t adventure much outside from the trip home. With that in mind I would still strongly recommend this\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n",

You see I am the oldest of four siblings so this hit a little too close to home. I bawled multiple times and by the 9th episode Iknew how it ended yet I had to complete it. \\n\r\nThis story speaks of destruction and beauty, unkindness and forgiveness, selfishness and selflessness, and overall it shows how when disaster strikes you need to be on watch for you and everyone around you. That last part doesn't make sense but at the end of the anime you will understand.\\n\r\nI finished this anime a little over 3 days ago and I still think about it as I try and sleep, it wasn't overly exciting (with gore, violence or romance) but it kept me hooked until the very end (even after I knew what would happen) and even now without re-watching it (I don't know if I could after that last cry fest) I find myself calculating when things happened and little hints throughout different scenes that pointed to the ending.\\n\r\nThis is a sad anime as I already said but it is worth watching. The story line is good I really like the artwork and how the duller colours made the background stand out more so you noticed the destruction and devastation of the city.",

Destructions with uncontrollable capacities, natural disasters are a wake-up call to humanity, leaving behind ruins that signal a time of healing and strengthening to those who survived through such an ordeal. Rising up from the rubbles, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a story about reality; one that reveals the facets of humanity as it gradually explores the aftermath of a seismic convulsion.\r\nIn the sultry annoyance of summer, an already sour middle-schooler by the name of Mirai is unwillingly dragged to a robot exhibition that her younger brother,the optimistic Yuuki, wants to go to. Because reality appears to hate her and due to some family circumstances, Mirai has a nihilistic outlook on life, and in one random moment outside the exhibition center, these pessimistic thoughts of hers seems to come alive. Amidst a dead silence, the swarm of fluttering birds warns the coming of a colossal beast. As if to break her unhealthy perception of reality, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake has suddenly arrived...\\n\\n\r\n...And just like that, the whole world shook.\\n\\n\r\nWith Tokyo crumbled to a demolished state and casualties spiking up to the thousands, it's clear that this disaster has become a large-scale crisis. After getting saved by a single mother named Mari following the mainshock, these two antithetical siblings along with their motherly guardian head off on a difficult journey to reunite back with their respective families. Through this precarious endurance, they confront a world ripped to the very core of humanity; growing up and changing as the struggles of reality unravel in front of them. The story did take time to build up momentum and there are times when the pacing needlessly drags on with uneventfulness, but the result of their development becomes clear nearing the final leg of the journey.\\n\\n\r\nMirai starts to reconsider her pessimistic attitude towards life, bit by bit gaining a deeper sense of understanding of the whole world upon experiencing its fragility. The happy-go-lucky Yuuki learns more about the reality of the situation outside of his innocently bright interpretations. And Mari serves as a strong role model for these two children, comforting and protecting them with parental devotion. The more they walk, the more their interpersonal relationship strengthens them as people as they encounter what the emotional qualities of family, life, and death mean within the wreckages.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite those clear portrayals of humanity, sometimes the story backtracks with its own realism. The attempt to create tension, more contrived than natural, is definitely the biggest flaw for this show. There's this habit where the children go through a streak of moving towards obvious dangers, only for an ill-timed aftershock to arrive and prove the danger, then always getting saved in the nick of time that really questions if they've forgotten what they've learned from previous life-and-death experiences. Especially when they're close to reaching their home. The suspense just feels artificial and brushes aside their delicate changes all for some goosebump moments.\\n\\n\r\nReturning back to the realism, the art, while plain and basic, fills the world with natural colors perfect for a metropolitan setting. Well, at least one that's changed to a fractured condition with smokes everywhere, wrecked buildings scattered around, and jagged fissures split across the ground. Significant in size, the sceneries drive home the horrific scale of this natural disaster, and it's not hard to realize why it's such a life-changing event for the main characters. Which speaking of them, the animation fluctuates quite a bit in quality, but it's generally solid enough to capture their movements. The CGI crowds, however, might need some time to get used to, though the rescue robots do look great.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the melodramatic music that blares during the forced tension, the sound details are generally well-done, with the quieter audio such as the silence and piano tracks stirring emotions more authentically. The voice acting puts on a convincing expression, particularly for Mari as her soft voice exposes the gentler sides beneath her durable exterior. Then there are also the diegetic sounds such as the media reporting on the state of disaster, making everything feels more worryingly genuine.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's that realness\u2014the recognition that the story told in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 can happen to anyone\u2014that gives the show an emphatic human quality despite some of its setbacks. The time after a catastrophic earthquake is the time of rebuilding, where people gain a better understanding of reality and where the endurance of survivors manifests itself as one of the greater aspects of humanity. This show really is a powerful reminder.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is billed as being a high drama and terrifying look of a strong earthquake hitting the Tokyo area.  And surprisingly the series is incredibly boring and shoddy.\r\nThe first signs of trouble come for a really poorly written opening theme by \tAbingdon Boys School is a strangely written and arranged song.  Set against a bunch of stills of ruined cities fails to set any kind of tone or mood which is something a series does.  The song feels like it would be more at home in a shounen adventure series instead of a serious drama.\r\nThe biggest pitfall with the seriesis the incredibly bland characters.  You have the main character Mirai with a very obviously symbolic name who's going through typical adolescent angst in the start of the series when everything is fine and dandy.  Apparently she's so angsty that she makes a conveniently trimmed wish for the whole world to just be destroyed right as the quake hits.  Wow forced writing much?  And even in the middle of the disaster she still seems to hold onto her teenage angst.  One scene I recall is when she's talking to her brother who makes a comment about their mother with Mirai replying \"It's her fault we're out here.\"  Really? Your parents could be dead and you still want to be a bratty little teen?\\n\\n\r\nNext is Yuki the little brother who frankly was so forgettable I don't even know what to write about him, other I remember him being surprisingly calm and chipper, something I wouldn't expect for a kid his age in a very stressful situation.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the woman who's helping them get through named Mari.  And what I recall of her was she was frankly a little to happy and a little too calm most of the time.  Many times she references to having a little girl at home.  I get she's there to keep calm and help the young children through this but really not a single discretion shot to show that she might even have the slightest bit of concern that her little daughter might be dead.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were any other major characters then they sure weren't memorable in the short span that I watched.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation wise the series looks good and clearly has some good production values.  However I can't help but think their should be far more destruction than is depreciated.  The series claims to have closely researched and worked with those who prepare Japan for earthquakes but seems like it might be sketching on some of said details.  An 8.0 quake is nothing to laugh at they're destructive and deadly.  We've seen what a 9.0 can do in the past year along with a destructive Tsunami which was absent in this.  Of course in fairness, Japan is already a highly vulnerable country to earthquakes so maybe their infrastructure is far more resistant than I'm giving credit for.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Ko Otani is also a bland and forgettable score.  I don't recall a single memorable musical piece in the entire work and the ending theme is nothing special either.\\n\\n\r\nTM8 is boring and overrated with a decent cast of actors but largely laughable and unbelievable characters.",

            "content": "***There will be one mayor spoiler in this review so don't read this if you haven't watched the series yet.***\r\nI have never been this conficted by an anime before, I think 5 Centimeters per Second came pretty close, but I have a part of me which absolutely loves these 2 series and I want to think that they are among the best of anime. But then there is that part of me that just happens to see every small mistake or flaw and judges way to hard for that. I can't help it. It just happens.\r\nWith 5 Centimeters per Second it was probably because Iexpected too much out of it. While watching I thought there was going to be this major event that would crush my feels, but it never came. It was after a couple of days after finishing the series that I understood why it was so great, It left you with an unfinished feeling and you couldn't do anything but feel bad for the MCs.\\n\\n\r\nWith Tokyo Magnitude, however, it was something different. This anime isn't 11 episodes long, it's only 5. Episodes 1 through 6 were so boring and unrealistic at times. I had a horrible time sitting through these. Then it got kinda interesting... but not really. They played the 'character-is-dead-but-she-doesn't-realize-yet' card. I can't recall where but I have definitely seen it before and not just once. Then there was all the other stuff like the general slow pacing, low budget, terrible CGI used in the backgrounds. How everyone reacted/acted during the earthquakes and aftershocks was nothing like how real people would react. People in Japan should know what to do with earthquakes since they have lots of them. But these people seemed to have no clue at all. You can't afford to move around like everyone did and you certainly don't go by boat. Mari was really irresponsible at times just leaving them alone or not paying attention. Other than that it was just your standard earthquake story. I feel like they did nothing special with it. The only moments that really got to me was in episode 1 when she send a text that said: \"The world should just fall apart\", and maybe when the bro died. I have shed tears before for other series like Clannad, Sakurasou, Angel Beats, Ping Pong the Animation, Tengen Toppa, Gintama, but this one didn't get me that far.\\n\\n\r\nI do want to credit TM:8.0 for the mellow atmosphere it builds at times. Mirai as a character is pretty interesting too. She is at that age where the whole world seems like it is against you. I don't dislike that. We all have that age or those moments where we feel like she does. By the end she steps away from that point of view and changes for the better. The series also shows you that people will mostly only think for themselves in times of despair and chaos.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless it's a beautiful story for the whole family, much like a Ghibli/Disney movie but not as great as those. Back when it aired it was one of the best of the season because a lot of the things airing were just generic fantasy light novel adaptations, moeblobs and ecchi-harem oriented stuff. This most likely helped the series to score so high in the rankings on various sites/lists. I will say that this one is still much better than most stuff airing the last couple seasons but I'd only give it a strong 6 to weak 7 outta 10.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nStandard earthquake story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were pretty standard, backgrounds (CGI) and animation were mediocre at times, low budget is probably the cause. It was quite distinct from other art. Felt kind of refreshing but not really.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nNo complaints but no special OST to remember.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMirai was interesting even though a lot of people argue about that. She is just a vulnerable teenage girl which is at that age where you think everything is against you. It is kind of nice to see yourself back when you where that age. Other characters were nothing special. Mari was a good person but acted irresponsible at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 was probably the best setup/best entry for the series but what came after didn't surprise me at all.\\n\r\nEpisodes 2-6 passed me out. Episode 7-11 were ok I guess. I almost dropped the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFine. Nice to watch on a rainy sunday afternoon but wouldn't want to watch it again.",

            "content": "As a teenage girl with a younger brother with about the same age gap as Mirai and Yuuki, I can say that this anime really struck close to home.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story is fantastic. It really makes you appreciate everything you have. Mirai, after wishing everything to be destroyed, realizes throughout the show that she can't wait to see her parents who she claimed she hated so much. There are also many side characters that come in throughout who have interesting stories.\r\nI feel that this show is very realistic to how a real earthquake would be like. This includes the chaos everyone goes through and the realismof death. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nMirai: Mirai goes through great development throughout the show. She went from a bratty teenager to realizing that she should have appreciated her time with her family and everything she has. She becomes very protective of her brother which I absolutely loved because I feel the same way towards mine. \\n\\n\r\nYuuki: Yuuki is the ray of the sunshine of this show. I absolutely adored his character because he was so upbeat and happy throughout the whole show. You can see how much he cares about his sister and parents. \\n\\n\r\nMari: I understand that Mirai and Yuuki needed an adult to get them as far as they got. Mari is the perfect person to do so. She is strong and keeps the kids safe when they are in danger risking her own life. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters interact perfectly, all of them showing their love and concern for one another which really makes you connect with them. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe character design is quite simple but this works so they won't draw attention away from the backgrounds. The earthquakes/aftershocks are pretty detailed considering how much the animators would need to draw for a show like this but not outstanding. For the opening I feel that they could have done more than a black and white slideshow of the aftermath of earthquakes, it was quite boring. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good. I liked the opening song but it was forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nthe realism in this show is a good break to the many action/fantasy animes there are out there. I really enjoyed this show and felt a personal connection with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10",

I came across this through various lists of 'serious' anime that is supposed to be moving or at least not my usual 'cute and silly'. I am damn glad I found this one. Will a new pic go up on the RTLR wall if it stops shaking? Let's duck and cover and find out!\r\nA disclaimer first, I spend 5 years in California,not far from Los Angeles. While there I experienced several earthquakes, most pretty minor but one ranking around a 5.5, so I have a little experience with the topic at hand.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nWhat that experience taught me is that you don't do what the story has our intrepid siblings do: you don't go trekking across a dangerous city, because aftershocks are a nearly guaranteed event which can and usually does weaken damaged structures even more and just increase the likelihood of injury or death. When a good sized one hits, you evacuate to a safe area, and STAY PUT. This was pounded into my head the years I went to school not all that far from the San Andreas fault line. Then rescue workers and first responders will work together to reunite you with your family and loved ones WHEN it's safe. This does not happen in our story. Instead we have a pair of young sibling trekking across a battered city trying to get home. \\n\\n\r\nNow why don't I knock the story more for this gross inaccuracy? Mainly because the journey is the primary plot point. Its them moving to get home that drives the action. If the unrealistic response irritates you, I do NOT suggest you watch this anime. It's very similar to how some combat veterans cannot watch action movies or war films without being bothered by technical details. Just gotta accept they are going to try to go home, even though it is not realistic at all.\\n\\n\r\nOf course in that situation you would WANT to go home to check on your family. Outside of my time in California I am a born and bred Texan, and I know about tornadoes. One hits a place where you have a loved one living, and you want nothing more than to barge in and make sure they are okay or save them. But this is NOT the right thing to do. Yet the desire exists, and I don't know, but personally, if it was my mom possibly in the rubble of a natural disaster, I'd likely disregard the safety regulations myself! So the journey is the point of the story, the trial to be overcome, and we are going to watch (and I recommend doing so) we just have to accept no one bothers to stop these kids (and a young woman) from going where they desire. \\n\\n\r\nIt is in this journey that we learn of the character of the survivors. The little sister and her somewhat pessimistic outlook, the cheerful little brother, and the kind hearted adult that is determined to make it to her own home and help the kids to theirs. The perils of the journey serve as the antagonistic role in the series. They have to face trials and tribulations, walk through danger and seek hope when there seems to be none. Its this long trip that makes the story. \\n\\n\r\nNow for why you should watch even if you know earthquake drill procedure by heart: the ending. We have a situation that reminds me of School Days, or Your Lie in April. I say School Days because in the last two episodes they throw a hard gut punch that just tears your heart out and is a major tonal shift from before, like School Days does in it's final episodes. The gut punch is a lot like Your Lie's, and is almost as saddening when it hits. This makes putting up with the fact no one stops these two kids and young woman from roaming around worth it. It's got the feels, you might have to wait to the end to get them, but they're there for sure.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nI do not care for this style of art. The two children seem to be the most bothersome for me, I just don't care for the cleaner, simpler style used. The young woman isn't so bad. I also felt that a lot of the background characters were overly simplistic. The city buildings and such were fine, but the shuffling groups just didn't grow on me. But it was not a deal breaker by any means, and most of you that are familiar with more anime than me probably won't have a bit of problem with how everything is drawn. I'm just (somewhat) new to anime, having less than 50 series under my belt and aren't quite used to all the differing styles yet. Just don't think this one is for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI have a pair of nice skull candies earphones with big bass in them, the aftershocks nearly rattled my head off, they sound right on with my setup. I imagine any decent to better system would rumble ominously when they hit. The screech of steel and crash of buildings falling down sounded good too. \\n\\n\r\nThe themes are okay as well, the opener I will probably listen to again just for fun, and the closer was nice, but didn't really stick out to me as something I'd listen to outside the context of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fairly solid, the young woman sounds right, and the sister sounds like a moody teen even though I don't think she's quite that old in the series. The little brother, however, was a bit grating. His voice, coupled with his overwhelming positivity just made me shudder on occasion. Again, not a deal breaker, but wish they had gone with a different VA. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nLet's start with the young woman that accompanies them. She is trying to return to her small daughter and mother in a neighborhood not too far from where the siblings are going, and so she decides to look after them on the trip. She's a kind-hearted person, and has no sinister motivations. She's going let's say east, they're going east, and need help, so she helps them even though she has all her own worries and concerns. She knows they will slow her down some, but she can't bring herself to leave two kids on their own with no guidance. She's a very likeable character. \\n\\n\r\nThe older sister is dark and brooding about everything. She didn't want to go with her little brother across town, but her parents forced her to. She's your typical huffy 'everything sucks' kid as it starts. She fights this pessimism throughout the series, and grows as they face new trials and tribulations. She loses her darkness and begins adopting her brother's cheerful outlook. Well maybe not to the point of cheerfulness, but to the point of thinking everything is going to be okay if they just keep going. Her victory over her own dark thoughts is short lived, as the gut punch I mentioned before hits and puts her back into a tailspin. Yet because of the positive aspects her brother had taught her on the journey she is able to slowly bounce back and realize that she's going to make it. Things may never be 'okay' again, but she's not going to break either. She is our growth character, the nobody that rises up and becomes so much more by the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe little brother is so happy and positive and doesn't even seem to see the earthquake itself as much of a downer. He's obsessed with robots, and sees several doing rescue work and is fascinated by them. He even meets another boy who also shares his interests, of which the older sister calls them both 'rotakus'. He sees the best in every situation, and is carefree even in the face of death, danger and tragedy. He not only inspires his big sister to look up, he also helps the young woman spread her own wings of hope and take flight once again. Even at the very end, when everyone else is in tears, he sits happily with a smile on his face. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI did enjoy the show a lot even though I know there's no way rescue workers would let two small children and a 20-something woman in a delivery company jacket wander around a destroyed city with nary a word, I did enjoy the intensity of it all. They would move forward, only to find the route blocked by fire, or debris or some other insurmountable obstacle and I would almost hold my breath and wonder if any of them are going to make it to see their families again. They of course always find a way, but the immense danger they are constantly in had me on the edge of my seat at many moments. Then there is the ending. The whole show is worth those last two episodes. The ending is so sweet, yet so very heartbreaking it's hard to put to words. Even with the foreshadowing they put in at different places, I did not want to believe they would pull the ending they did, yet i was wrong. I applaud the show for having the courage to do the kind of ending we get, so many play it conservatively. \\n\\n\r\nBest girl: Mari, the young woman who for no reason than being a good person, decides to look after the kids on their way home. I will give a minor spoiler on her. She does get a happy ending, but reveals her own emotional trauma that she's suffered through. Not only does she help the kids home, she looks in on them after everything returns to normal. And besides it was either her or the brooding sister, so Mari wins by default. \\n\\n\r\nI say watch this one, it might be a little slow paced for some in places, but it's got that 'feels' ending that I love just so much. It is a serious anime in that there are no comedy tropes, no bug eyes, nothing that would appear outright unrealistic beyond the act of traveling. It feels like real people in real danger, and ends on a painful note brought forth by hope. I know that doesn't make any sense, but I can't find any other way to put it. The trio make the RTLR wall of shakiness, and I give it a solid thumbs up!",

            "content": "Quite simply one of the most touching animes I have scene in a while. In a prologue it is revealed that scientists have predicted that in the next 30 years, tokyo would be struck with an earthquake magnitude 8.0 (sadly the predictions were actually less severe than the real earthquake in real life) and the anime depicts the effects of an 8.0 earth quake and center the plot line around a middle school girl having to adapt to the emergency.\r\nCharacters: 10-\r\nMirai- In all but one of my other 6 reviews, i have virtually panned the main characters as being generic and normal. But that isthe goal in this sotry. It focuses on a middle school student literally being hurled into this disaster with her brother. She literally does undergo all the traits that an older sibling would undergo in this situation, and proved to be a really formidable main character.\\n\\n\r\nYuki- Mirai's younger sibling. This may be one of the first animes in which a little kid was the main character and didnt annoy me. I may even go so far to say that Yuki may be the best eight year olf anime character i have ever seen, but i have honestly only seen a couple of them so... anyways just like his sister he proved to be an interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nMari- Easily one of the top 10 anime characters i have ever seen. Easily, with no doubt, amazing. She is the one person in the group that doesn't act like she has been thrown into a disaster, and if this was real life television, her performance in episode 9 would have won her an emmy.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story is mainly broken up into three parts. Episodes 1-3 covers the prologue and the earthquake. Episodes 4-7 covers the \"adventures\" that the three characters go on, and episodes 8-11 cover the ultimate effects of the earthquake.\\n\r\nThe only problem i had with this anime is for the first 7 episodes, the anime was incredibly predictable. Not to say that predictable is a bad thing, since i have episode 5 slated as one of the top 10 episodes of 2009, but it does make u hesitate sometimes before wanting to watch another episode, as episodes 4-7 tend to deliver what you are expecting, which is the trio going on \"adventures.\"\\n\r\nThe final 4 episodes however blew me away. Episode 8 is the big page turner that really makes you go \"woah\" and episode 9 hitting you hard on a huge suspense point. In retrospect, many viewers will view episode 9 as the best episode of the anime. Episode 10 drives the main point being focused in the two prior episodes home and really sets up for an amazing finally. Episode 11, the finale, is currently one of the only two anime episodes that i have ever seen that has ever made me get emotional and is currently ranked in my top 10 anime episodes of all time.\\n\r\nThis is definitely a story i will always remember.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7 \\n\r\nyou have to remember that this was released in 2009, technically two digital ages ago. So i cant really give the art a great grade.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nthe opening and ending were both great, but the voice acting is some of the best that i have ever seen. Hell, i may even go far enough to call the voice acting the most accurate that i have ever seen. every character sounded their age and their voice actors perfectly covered their personalities. Something i am rarely able to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: My overall rating for Tokyo 8.0 is a 9.6. I can honestly say that this is a once in a lifetime anime and look at how many episodes there are, only 11.This will take you less than 4 hours to watch, and they will be the best 4 hours you have has in a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nI only hope that I get to see another anime that had this much of an emotional impact on me again.",

If you want to think about it as a documentary film, it doesn't have much aspect of it, and neither can I say it's a slice of life, 'cause it's not a common thing going home aftera huge tremor.\\n\r\nIt's unique, but has really nothing special.\\n\r\nIt's similar to most of the anime which have journey as the backbone of the plot. This is where the documentary appeal comes in. It's real! No super robots, no magic etc. It's a pure 'what would happen if' anime\\n\r\nAnd throwing in this \"little\" twist at the 10th episode... It was really unexpected, but the creators might have thought, this will spin up the story a bit. Well it did leave a bitter taste in my mouth though. However it wasn't such a strong shock, that I had to cry my teacup full of tears.\\n\\n\r\nSum-up:\\n\r\n+ Presenting Tokyo after an 8.0 magnitude earthqueke was a good idea\\n\r\n- Cheap explanation for the tragedy",

If anything like natural disasters in a nonfiction setting bores you, and you don't care for the primary genres of this show, then don't expect much else to be happening. It's well done for staying within thegenres it chose to portray, but it is far from original. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot focuses on three people: a middle school girl, a primary school boy, and a working woman they team-up with. While they aren't super realistic - compared to the background and minor characters - they work well for pulling the story along. Some attributes will make more sense as things are revealed, but they weren't intended to be completely realistic; realism is kept to their surroundings -- people, buildings, and robots alike. \\n\\n\r\nOlder buildings will collapse at a disproportionate rate when compared to the newer ones. This is an earthquake-prone nation and, of course, it has a lot of things prepped solely for earthquake relief and recovery. As people leave the immediate Odaiba area, they begin the lessen in density (people go where they need to rather than stay together). The visuals did a great job portraying all of this. \\n\\n\r\nThese things, however, are what I noticed to garner the most complaints about ... which make little sense, given the subject matter and location. This is NOT a comparable scenario were NYC to suffer an 8.0, and so one shouldn't expect Japan of all places to not handle it. For earthquake-prone areas, the most damage is caused by side-effects of earthquakes; mudslides, fires, tsunamis. Maybe building damage for the older or less sturdy structures.",

The major cast of the series are all likable as well.\r\nThe setting of a natural disaster isn't something I have seen before in anime as not many animes focus on a disasters as its normally a backstoryso it was very interesting and intense to follow their story as this happens.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 will definitely buy on dvd.",

The anime caught my attention within the first episode and I didn't get bored through the entire 11 episodes.\r\nThe art was simple and it did its job well. The art didn't need to be amazing or complicated to tell this story. I didn't really notice any particular song I liked in the soundtrack, it just all fit the mood. There was only one song that was really annoying but it barely played for a minute so it doesn't really matter.\r\nThe characters were very well portrayed and no one really felt one-dimensional, somethingeven more popular shows struggle to even accomplish. Mirai, while some may not like her personality, was portrayed very realistically in my opinion. Girls her age would act how she acted. Her brother, Yuuki, was very easy to like and was more complex than you think a third grader could be at first glance.\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the show I was honestly kind of wondering what the point of it was other than to show the horrors of a devastating earthquake. I quite understand how horrible it is now, but other than that I really didn't see the point. The ending kind of cleared that up, but in the end I really can't say what the lesson was that I learned from this anime, but I think that is alright. This anime doesn't really need to be explained, you just watch it and interpret it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a very nice anime to watch and it doesn't take long to get through. I wouldn't watch it again, though, as it was really quite a tear-jerker. If you don't mind being sad, this is a nice, quick and thought-provoking anime to watch.",

            "content": "This anime isn't very good, not good at all. \r\nI found this anime while searching for sad anime, looking for an anime that will actually be sad, but this anime doesn't come even close to it. \r\nBasically, an 8.0 earthquake hits Tokyo, buildings fall down, people panic, normal stuff you would expect. Then we have our main characters, who are:\r\nAnnoying girl: complains about everything, gets mad at everyone for everything for no reason, denies the basic fact that the world around her has changed and wont open up to anyone unless something big happens\r\nYuuuuuuuuuuki: Annoying girls little brother, serves as a source of annoyment forannoying girl, basically is the only one pulling the plot forward. Likes robots, his family, and deals with everything annoying girl throws at him. Is like a walking rubble magnet.\\n\r\nBiker Mom: This random lady the kids run into both before and after the earthquake, wants to get home to her daughter, but travels with the kids because of a promise she made them. \\n\r\nBiker moms daughter: Is she alive, is she dead? Better worry about it but not really do anything to solve the issue\\n\r\nCGI background character 1-1000000: Background characters, whenever the camera zooms out far enough you can see them in all their zombie like movements\\n\r\nI will say i was pretty excited for this show after the first episode, the earthquake was well done, got me excited for what the series had to give me, then it was just downhill from there. Every time the yuuuuuuuuuuki isn't in danger an aftershock happens, some buildings fall down, but nobody dies, which is the problem with this anime, NOBODY IMPORTANT DIES (well unless you can make it to episode 10.....), and what should feel like sadness for the ruined lives of all these CGI background characters just ends up being annoying because you can only put yuuuuuuuuuuuki in so many life/death situations and have him live before it starts to drive you crazy. \\n\r\nAll the characters make stupid choices. My favorite was after the huge earthquake and everybody got out of the mall and crowded under that giant building to get out of the rain, like nooooooooooo that thing wont fall as well, don't worry about that.....\\n\r\nThe artwork was its best feature, and that is saying something for a show that was 60% CGI. I cant even remember a single musical note form this series, and i finished it less then an hour ago, so whatever music was in there is so forgettable it might as well have never be composed.\\n\r\nAll the major plot points in the series are just done wrong, everyone that would have advanced the story forward by dying stays alive, which just makes the whole series drone on without giving anything interesting to watch, when you hit the major plot twist at episode ten you are already so annoyed at the mixed up way they showed what happened in the first place that it is nothing more then annoying.\\n\r\nI guess annoying girl does grow a little as a character, but not by much, by the end the only thing different about her is that she doesn't blame everyone else for her problems anymore. Biker mom jumps to conclusions, resulting in  an aggravating five minutes of grave crying that actually feels emotional until you realize what actually happened.\\n\r\nOverall I learned two things from this anime, 1: birthday cake should be round, and 2: dont run into buildings when your series has a tendency to use a lot of aftershocks, it never works out for you\\n\r\nThis anime isn't even so dramatic that it is funny, it is just bad. Giving credit where credit is due it gets a 3/10, but that's it.",

            "content": "I love how simple the theme of story coming up with a bigger story line. The story simply outlined by the main character got stuck in a natural disaster, away from their parents and how they going back to their home. \r\nThey story get deeper since the earthquake itself only marking the outside problem they had, like an orange skin, where the sweetness and stuff happen on the inside, the character personal feeling, emotions, and how they work with it the entire series from something negative to positive in such a smooth way that the audience can understand why the character act all negative andhow they turn it. \\n\\n\r\nI am honestly anxious all the entire series because almost every episode there is a BIG chance a character will die, and looking at how they together the entire way, expressing their emotions, somehow I got connected with the character emotionally, and I DON'T want anything bad happened to them. But for a bit of hint (ups..bit spoiler) the story doesn't all that happy ending.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you are into slice of life, especially a relation about family, parents and kids, brother and sister. This anime is that kind of series that will set you in a better perspective regarding your relationship with them, and in fact the core point of this anime is that you can LEARN the most important thing of having a family. Which is mean that it is NOT a meaningless animation to watch. The same way I learn about life from Hayao Miyazaki's movies, this one definitely HERE to teach something to audience, something beautiful, and it is rare to get much anime this deep nowadays. IMHO.\\n\\n\r\nAs well we can see (implicitly) how Mirai-chan looking at people overall. When she was actually hate people because most of them was egocentric, impolite and whatsoever...until she met lots of stranger that in the end help her and her brother towards their journey home. It teach her (and us) that although there are lots of badness in this world, we still can catch lots of humanity in the people himself. People that can put their ego aside, their sadness and personal feelings, to help everyone/stranger during though time, understand that we need to help each other during this kinds of crisis....and again I can see that this is how Japanese people are. This anime draws the image of Japanese people, the beauty of the people in a perspective.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I won't forget to mention how the ending is SO SURPRISING and UNEXPECTED in a way I CANNOT IMAGINE. It is like watching Tokyo Love Story when I was a kid.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the art, I can say that the most outstanding part of this anime is how the art team design a wrecked city all over the series. But it still lack in minor details and for the colouring it is a bit plain. Since there is a better anime that suit my preference regarding arts (which is something like Kabaneri and Zankyou no Terror in terms of colouring or even Spirited Away, which is probably most anime lover will turn to in terms of art and animation). But I am happy and feast enough with it to give it a 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk one thing I don't understand is why they put that Ending single. Haha. Not that I don't like it, in fact it was a really nice song M/elody. But tbh imo it is to lively and happy to be paired with an anime with tragic disaster and loss and stuff. It was like watching an anxious episode then at the end it was greet by a happy song at the end. Quite unparalleled feeling imo. It could be fit something with slower beat, that pierce through your chess like an arrow...so to say. Still  a lovely song and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nSimply said, it is a story that worth to watch, worth to spend some time, and I will very recommend it to be watch together with your family, friends, and your loved one. You might ended up crying and hugging each other in the end. Cheers! :)",

            "content": "So.. my first anime review.. here goes..\r\nStory [ Background / Progression ] :\r\nIts an unique concept that I haven't seen before. It deals with a 'what if' scenario. What if an earthquake of a magnitude of 8 occurred? What is the after matter, and what may a person do in this situation, along with the events that follow that person? Despite having it not happened in the real world, as of yet, Bones decided to give it a whirl, and this, in turn, is their product.\r\nMoving onto the anime itself, there's not much that can be said about how it progresses besides how Mirai, Yuuki,and Mari struggle to make it back to their families, and the people who they meet on the way. The pacing of it is pretty much at a good rate. There aren't moving so fast that it seems like Tokyo is squished within a three kilometer radius, but at the same time, it focuses on key points throughout their adventure.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\\n\r\nWell the styling is pretty much, overall, good. Not great, but it gets the job done. There's rarely any \"sharp / dark / deep\" edges on characters, bulidings, etc.. found around as you watch, from what I can tell, which promotes the fact that this is a 'what if' scenario after all. The character design is odd, from my point of view. The fact that Mirai, and Yuuki have, in essence, \"perfectly round\" heads somewhat scares me, but it doesn't cause such a major eye-ache that I have to only rely on my ears to determine what's going on. Beyond that, its pretty much what I expected from Bones. Solid art.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\\n\r\nI really hope this is referring to the OP, and EP.. if not.. oh well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening (Kimi no Uta - Abingdon Boys School) can give a somewhat post-mayhem vibe. This can supported by the slideshow at the start. From what I can tell, its meant to give a sense of insecurity. That life isn't always smooth sailing, and when you do get lost, do you have someone there to help? So basically, it works well with the setting of the anime. The real problem I have with this song is that the first second of the TV size starts out with this sudden guitar string sound that sounds almost corrupted.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending (M/elody - Shion Tsuji) is a song that can give a sense of hope for what's beyond the road. That there's something better down the path. Its quite soothing to just hear the guitar solo at the start. So much so that it works well to make me sleep sometimes. Its also one of the few ending songs that I've come to enjoy a lot.\\n\\n\r\nIts a typical opposite OP / EP style I would guess, but like most of them, it works well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\\n\r\nNo brainer. Most to all characters can related to most people in your life. There's your sister-brother relationship, which always seems to get into fights, pointless arguments, and alike. However, when each other lives are in danger, they cooperate together in order to live another day. Next in line, your wandering good Samaritan (which means a person who does good deeds, in my dictionary). You may dislike him/her at first for interfering with your life, but they eventually grow on you. I could explain more, but that's the gist of it. It gives a connection to your own life, so you can relate more to how they're feeling as the anime goes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I liked it. It gave me a good break from all of the other shows that came in the same season as this. Sure, there wasn't any real fighting scenes, over the top amazing sequences, or some weird situation where laughs ensue. However, it gave a perfect example of what, and how natural occurrences can affect the lives of a person, family, city, and possibly, a country.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, its a watch if you want. Its not a need to watch, but its a good break from all of the other anime types. And that sums up my first review. Hope you read it through, and enjoyed it.",

It was just... truly heartbreaking, and Mari has got to be the most noble anime character I've ever seen. \r\nThe art design wasn't super flashy, but it was fitting. The real detail went into the buildings crumbling down, and their simple design made you realize that the three protagonists are really just three in hundreds of people displacedby the earthquake... And the sound... The music tugged at my emotions as well, particularly in the last episode, but more than anything, this show understood the power of silence. \\n\\n\r\nI wish I could give you more without going into major spoilers.

            "content": "-------------\r\nConstructive criticism would be appreciated through PM or on my profile.\r\n-------------\r\nThere's 70% chance for an earthquake with magnitude 7.0 to happen in Tokyo in the next 30 years. Hinted by the title, Tokyo Mangitude 8.0 tries to show us what would happen if the quake is with magnitude 8.0. Last year Japan suffered 9.0 earthquake which wasn't in Tokyo but managed to shake the whole world.\r\nDespite the settings and the title the best part of this series isn't the quake that occurs at the end of the first episode. Actually if I wrote review about Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 after finishing episode 7 it would coverthe relatively slow pace of the story and the lightweight mood of the anime. Nevertheless, I would feel liable to point that Bones really managed to show realistic public reaction to the quake, which was similar to the real events of last year. I would to say a positive word about the strange characters and the funny robots.\\n\r\nFortunately Bones never let me down and they are showing such a dynamics in the last 3-4 episodes, that changes the whole series. Don't worry, you won't see crazy rescue robots, or huge tsunami. You'll see only something, that I don't want to spoil for your, because it's real pleasure. I'll just say that I was so close to cry at the end. \\n\r\nThanks to the art during the whole series I had some Eden of the East flashbacks, mostly because both animes have really strong story and strange, almost ugly, drawing which strengthens the story. The main difference between the two is in the background which is on extremely high level in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. The details you see in the collapsing buildings, Tokyo set on fire or the collapsing Tokyo Tower are amazing. As the expense of this is the character design which is stunningly strange. Strange proportions and sometimes impossible positions of the characters are present almost always, but after episode or two it stops bothering you.\\n\r\nI'm big fan of abington bys school since the first Darker Than Black, so I'll let the opening, performed by them, without comment. However, the ending is something to prise. Performed by Shion Tsuji, the track M/elody brings positivism and freshness and I'll be glad to play this song, even if it's little too gooey. The background music is doing it's job without standing out with something special while the seyuus leave only positive feelings. The biggest shock for me was Kobayashi Yumiko who gives voice to Yuki and to one of my favourite characters - Black Star of Soul Eater.\\n\r\nThe combination of strong story, off-beat art and perfect directing and voicing makes Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 really good anime, that touches you in a way only Japanese art is capable. Gently, unobtrusive and compelling. The three words that actually describe the impression left by it.",

            "content": "\u2018Everything should just be destroyed\u2026\u2019\r\nAt first, I was intrigued by the fact that Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is catastrophe themed because you won\u2019t find many anime of this type. And I was pleasantly surprised that such anime not only exists, but it can be very enjoyable too.\r\nSTORY\r\nTokyo has been hit by a huge earthquake and a young girl Mirai, her little brother Yuuki and Mari, a woman they happened to accidentally meet, sets off on a journey to reach their home as the whole city crumbles to dust. After first few episodes the plot seems to be a bit dragged out. The main characters simply wanderfrom one refuge to the other, trying not to get squeezed by falling debris. However, the ending takes it all. It even left me crying for a moment.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nI was impressed by the sense of realism that the characters give off. They keep on going without even knowing if their houses are still intact, not even if their families are still alive. This gives off a very human feeling of fear, anxiety and hope which remain throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nART & MUSIC\\n\r\nBoth art and music are satisfactory. Everything is drawn in a simple and a bit plain way. Nothing spectacular, but nothing tawdry either.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is quite interesting, easy to watch and very touching. It\u2019s a nice mix of some action, drama and tragedy.\\n",

Family, friendship and a \"Shit Ton\" of feels are the main focus here.\r\nCharacters (9/10):\r\nThe characters are simple and realistic in a way which was a good thing in this case asthe show was (in a way) about how different kinds of people react to a catastrophic event. So a more down to earth cast of characters was more suitable in this situation.\\n\r\nCharacter development take the cake here, well more like 1 character development \"Mirai\". The way events and interactions with character (mostly Yuuki) helped change and shape here was just too good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7/10):\\n\r\nThe art and animation didn't really offer any wow factor and could have benefited from a little bit of attention. More impressive destruction scenes would have added to the impact of the show better and i don't know about the method the used for far shots (was that some sort of CG) they just looked crappy.\\n\r\nCharacters design was not great but still good enough.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (8/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime didn't stand out much but not in a bad way, how do i put it ...... it suited the show just fine but also didn't offer any note worthy tracks.\\n\r\nI watched the English dub for this show and it was really good. I really recommend anyone who want to watch this anime to pick out the dub. All the character had suitable voices that conveyed emotions in a great way.\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (8/10):\\n\r\nThis anime is not for the faint of heart and if you are not dead inside (like me) you will definitely have tears in your eyes by the end of it.\\n\r\nit will keep you engrossed the whole way with it's great pacing and some of the end of episodes events that would make you start the next one immediately  (I actually watched it in one sitting)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)",

            "content": "It\u2019s summertime in Japan!  No more pencils, no more books, no more senseis dirty looks...  This is especially true for seventh grader Mirai Onozawa, who\u2019s elected not to take any summer classes, and as a result, she gets to have the whole vacation to herself!  Unfortunately, her parents aren\u2019t so lucky, and they still have to spend that time working, meaning that there are no plans for the Onozawa family to take a fun trip this year, like several of Mirai\u2019s classmates are.  Her newfound freedom comes back to bite her in the ass when her mother assigns her to takeher little brother, first grader Yuuki Onozawa, to a robot exhibition in Odaiba, which he\u2019s been looking forward to attending for months up until then.  Poor Mirai trudges her way to Odaiba, carrying her little brother in tow while lamenting just how lame her life is, and while she does manage to have a little bit of fun there, she\u2019s all to happy to get out of there when it\u2019s finally time to leave and go home.  She lets her brother go off unsupervised to use the bathroom and pick up some drinks, and she waits outside for him, tweeting about how much she wants the world to just break apart.\\n\\n\r\nNo sooner does she post this message than the legendary city of Tokyo is hit by a massive magnitude 8.0 earthquake, shaking the convention center to it\u2019s foundation and causing a catastrophic amount of death and destruction to the city.  By hanging onto the guard rail outside of the center, Mirai is able to safely get a clear birds eye view of the damage, but her brother i still inside!  with the help of gold-hearted motorcyclist and struggling single mother Mari, Mirai find Yuuki, and the three of them get out just in time as as the first of many aftershocks hits.  They\u2019re out of the convention center, but they\u2019re not out of the woods yet, as they\u2019re still miles away from home, blocked off by seemingly endless destruction.  Together, the three of them must traverse the ruins of a great city, encountering people who have lost everything as they strive to hold onto what little they have left, but with danger at every corner, aftershocks striking when they least expect it, and no means of contacting home, do they even stand a chance?  \\n\\n\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 was produced by Studio Bones, and it was a pretty solid effort.  I honestly don\u2019t have anything to complain about with the animation here.  There\u2019s a lot of walking and talking which really doesn\u2019t require that much money to keep up in terms of quality, and the extra money clearly got poured into the heavier action scenes and a few very beautiful art pieces, none of which last nearly long enough to truly appreciate their eye candy potential.  There are a few moments that feel a bit undercut, like they had to go cheap to compensate for a more complicated visual down the line, but they\u2019re few and far between, and they never really last long enough to matter.  The bulk of the budget was most likely spent on the earthquake itself, which often looks so viscerally realistic that you could swear you were actually there, trying to survive it alongside our young heroes.  The running animations, along with all of the practical effects like rubble falling, dust flying through the air and people bracing themselves against each impact lend the series a truly harrowing feel.  \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve never been to Tokyo, and I don\u2019t know much about it\u2019s geography or infrastructure, so I can\u2019t really speak as to how accurately it\u2019s portrayed in this series, but the level of detail in the architecture is breathtaking.  It\u2019s almost a shame to see these buildings collapse and crumble, because it feels like they put a ton of time and effort into drawing them as intricately as they did.  They took great strides to make everything look as realistic as possible, so not only are the buildings themselves thoroughly designed, but the destruction as well is truly awe inspiring, creating an appropriately post-apocalyptic mood that I normally only see in video games that actually DO take place in a post apocalyptic setting.  There were parts where characters would be poking around inside of a building, and I was half-expecting a zombie or even a Clicker to pop out.  This makes the sense of devastation and isolation feel real, bringing a heart-pounding level of immersion to the ravaged wasteland that Tokyo\u2019s become.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are about as realistic in proportion as Bones characters can possibly get, with the only real fantasy element being the giant eyes of all the children in the story.  Aside from that, characters are believably proportioned, with heads the appropriate size in comparison to their bodies, uniformly dark colored hair and normal, almost boring looking clothing.  They do look a bit cartoony when juxtaposed against the more realistic backgrounds, but that\u2019s a nitpick.  The lighting changes noticeably to match the time of day, at times hitting a beautiful twilight glow, and there are certain moments where the color mix is just exquisite.  A few of these scenes are strongly tied to some heavy spoilers, but the one example I think I can give you is when Mirai, Mari and Yuuki stop by a shelter, they sit by the edge of a small pool, and the reflection on the surface is a blend of colors that Mirai compares to stained glass windows, and she is not even slightly exaggerating.  It\u2019s very good looking show all around, but you might want to watch this particular scene a few times through.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really have a lot to say for Koh Otani\u2019s musical score.  It blends into the show so well that you barely notice it unless you\u2019re deliberately listening to it, and when I play it out of context, it just comes off as a little generic...  Not bad by any means, just the same kind of score that I\u2019ve heard in a million other anime.  My personal disconnect with the material might be why I have such a hard time feeling any emotional impact from his work on this project, and if so, I guess that\u2019s on me.  It does it\u2019s job.  I had a very similar reaction to the opening theme, Kimi no Uta by Abingdon Boys School...  Weird name for a band, unless it\u2019s actually a music class that\u2019s responsible for this song...  Played over what I\u2019m assuming were production sketches from the developmental stages of the series.  Once again, it\u2019s fine, but doesn\u2019t really stand out in any way.  I actually strongly preferred the ending theme, M/Elody by Shion Tsuji, which had a really Indie feel to it, even though it\u2019s visuals were just photographs of Mirai and Yuuki walking.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is a little on the mediocre side, too.  That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad, I actually think Luci Christian pulled off an exceptionally strong performance as Mirai, all things considered.  The character does very little but complain and act like a sourpuss for the majority of the series, and Luci\u2019s grounded, subtle performance made her sound like a long suffering teen who thinks she\u2019s over the world, even though she clearly cares about her family, and she managed to bring a deep sadness to the character whenever she needed to.   Tiffany Grant played the younger Yuuki, and while she proved she could be just as unrecognizable in a child role as Christine Auten has in the past, she didn\u2019t have much to work with out of unrestrained happy-go-lucky loudness and the occasional crying.  I\u2019ve never found Shelley Callene Black to be the strongest emoter...  Unless she\u2019s playing a really strong or cold role, I\u2019ve always found sort of a wall of insincerity in her way...  So I think I would have enjoyed better casting in her role as Mari.  Greg Ayres and Brittany Karbowski also pop up here and there, playing extras and one-shot characters, but they\u2019re hit and miss.\\n\\n\r\nSo here\u2019s the thing.  There are a lot of things we anime fans have in common in the way we judge anime, and there are a lot of values and standards that most of us share, but if there\u2019s one that I\u2019ve found to stand out in particular, it\u2019s that we all seem to love a good tear jerker.  I always see people giving exuberantly high ratings to any anime that gives them that incurable emotional illness, \u201cThe Feels.\u201d  If an anime makes you cry, it\u2019s an instant masterpiece, regardless of whatever problems it may have had throughout.  I know I\u2019m not the only person who\u2019s noticed this, because there are a lot of anime that have taken advantage of it to compensate for other major issues in their stories, effectively using shameless tragedy porn to grab people by the hearts and string them along for an easy 10/10 score that\u2019s pretty much guaranteed to them, and if you complain about the logical or ethical fallacies that people have missed or just straight up ignored, they criticize you for nitpicking, saying you\u2019ve gotta watch the series with your head and not your heart, or that you\u2019re thinking too much, just turn your brain off and have a good time.\\n\\n\r\nThe backlash for some of these titles can be devastating, like for people who saw through the epic romance of Sword Art Online, but for most shows, emotional manipulation can lead to large and highly defensive fanbases.  Clannad makes them cry, so who cares about the blatant harem aspects, or the fact that it all centers around a reprehensible deadbeat asshole?  Who cares about the fact that the characters whose deaths you\u2019re crying over are written so badly that you feel worse for the person losing them than you do for them in the first place?  Who cares if stories like Angel Beats and Steins Gate don\u2019t make any sense ,and are full of game breaking plot holes?  It\u2019s the feels, damn it, the feeeeeeells!  Which is why, when  get around to watching a show that\u2019s been touted as heart breaking and emotionally powerful, I normally approach with caution, lest I be tempted and eventually let down by another predictable, cliched title that confuses tragedy with drama.  So where does Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 fall in my rankings?  \\n\\n\r\nWell, unfortunately, talking about the lauded \u2018big tragic twist\u2019 at the end of this series is gonna take us to some heavy places, so let\u2019s instead start by talking about something more basic, the story and characters.  This series is about three people trying to survive a natural disaster, and pretty much nothing else.  There\u2019s no real depth, there\u2019s no real message, it\u2019s just a straight journey through the devastated town to get back home.  That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, there\u2019s really nothing wrong with a simple or shallow story, and it does have a strong concept, even if it\u2019s not really trying to say anything with it.  Even the worst concept can be carried by great characters, so let\u2019s see who we\u2019re working with on THAT front.  We only have three major characters, with plenty of other named roles popping in an out of the story before being ultimately forgotten, and since those main roles consist of two children who we presumably wouldn\u2019t want to see die and an adult risking her life and chances to make it back home just to watch over them, we could easily form a serious bond with our survivors.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character is of course the tween-aged Mirai, with her little brother Yuuki serving as costar, and they\u2019re total opposites as far as one being extremely positive and the other one being extremely negative, and the story treats them both like crap because of it.  Mirai is the negative one, and she is constantly getting shit dumped on her as a result.  She\u2019s sour, she\u2019s poutty, she\u2019s ungrateful, and it feels like she\u2019s constantly getting punished for it.  A note to any aspiring writers out there...  If you don\u2019t like your main character either, then either develop them or make them likeable, don\u2019t splatter hot food on them.  You probably think I\u2019m exaggerating, but the most development or nuance she gets is that she occasionally shows concern for people, which, congratulations, you\u2019ve just surpassed the bare minimum of not being a sociopath.  You\u2019ve proven you can stop bitching long enough to cry and worry about people, that doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to be the less interesting version of Grumpy Cat.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have her little brother, the happy go lucky Yuuki, who takes things to the other extreme, being positive and acting upbeat for at least 95 percent of his screen time.  In fact...  Wait, how mean do I want to get with this?  Screw it, no holding back now.  He has all the personality and emotional range of a puppy.  The only thing about him that makes him even remotely relatable beyond the bare idea of childhood is his love of robots, but aside from that, he\u2019s more of a McGuffin than a character.  I can\u2019t really talk about my biggest problems with him without giving away some very heavy spoilers, so instead, you know what I\u2019m going to do?  I\u2019m going to spend the rest of the review just calling him Mirai\u2019s puppy, just to see if it ever becomes a problem.  Mirai has a puppy that she took to Tokyo for some reason, it walks around making unimportant barking noises, feeling way too joyful for the situation, worrying about his other humans that he hasn\u2019t seen in a while, and constantly running off and causing trouble.  He\u2019s a fucking puppy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have Mari, who...  honestly, I really wanted to like her.  She\u2019s saintly, mature, responsible, she takes two children into her care without a thought for her own well being...  But I can\u2019t, mainly because I don\u2019t believe her.  No, I\u2019m not calling her a liar, I just don\u2019t believe in the existence of a person like her.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m stretching things too far when I call her a Mary-Sue, and if you think I am then PLEASE, tell me what her flaws are.  Even if you can believe in her as a person, and that she basically adopted Mirai and Yuuki for their trip home, why stop at them?  Why form this three person group, and then just stop there?  What makes those two kids so special that she doesn\u2019t want to invite anyone else to join?  They meet other people on their journey.  They meet other CHILDREN on their journey, but no, it\u2019s the three quakesketeers, because the idea of a single mother joining forces with two unaccompanied minors in a fight for survival is more marketable, I guess.  And yes, I seriously wish they\u2019d added more people to their group, because obviously their dynamic as it is does not work for me.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was ever an anime that badly needed a larger cast, it was this one.  Rather than just three characters and a bunch of small cameos from other people, I kinda thought we\u2019d get a much stronger exploration of the earthquake and it\u2019s devastation if the series were more of an anthology piece, switching back and forth between different characters whose paths would occasionally converge.  I\u2019ll admit that I cared a little about Mari getting home to her daughter and mother, but when it came to Mirai and her puppy(See?  I told you I\u2019d do it), I honestly found myself wondering what it was that made them so important, than anyone else, while I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the elderly couple who lost their grandkids, or the woman with a stuck stroller, or Mari\u2019s scavenger friend.  Mirai gets depressed over her inability to talk to or console her friend Megu, so how about just letting her do it?  It might have actually been interesting to see.  And of course there\u2019s Kenta, the boy Mirai\u2019s age which obviously means he\u2019ll briefly serve as a love interest.  I could have seen more of his exploits, although like the others, we never see him again after his appearance, meaning he might as well have died offscreen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as far as the story goes, all I can really say is that stuff happens.  The earthquake itself is probably the only thing that\u2019s ever foreshadowed(Aside from the tragic twist, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute), and the rest of the anime is just the three main characters either moving in one direction or resting, all while being shaken by aftershocks so plot-specific that they honestly wound up being predictable more often than not.  Even my first time through, I called about half of them a second or two before they happened.  That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t some scary moments, or that I never felt my pulse race, but even the most terrifying moment, the collapse of a certain monument that\u2019s been featured in a ton of anime before, is ruined in retrospect by the realization that Mirai and her puppy clearly graduated from the Prometheus School of Running Away from Things.  It\u2019s a story about survival at it\u2019s core, and while the characters are weak, it does at least manage to tell a story about survival,  which is just about the least that was required of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story is bland, it doesn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s potential, and the characters we\u2019re supposed to be rooting for are less interesting than the one shot characters we never see again.  If there\u2019s anything that can save this anime, it\u2019s the big tragic twist that everyone and their mothers praise the gospel about, right?  It\u2019s that element to the story that makes it emotionally powerful, heartbreaking, and a true masterpiece of anime tragedy, right?  Well, okay,let\u2019s examine this, and I\u2019ll try to do so with as little spoilers as possible.  I will admit that yes, the tragedy is setup really well.  The catalyst is subtle, most people either won\u2019t notice it or will just forget it over the course of then ext few episodes, and there are just enough clues that I can safely say that someone on the writers team was at least trying to respect the viewer\u2019s intelligence.  As the clues get bigger, that unsettling feeling of dread creeps in, and the big reveal is built up, and when it\u2019s finally time to lift the curtain, the other shoe drops...  or does it?  DUN DUN DUN!!!\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I\u2019ll be honest, I was actually feeling very forgiving of this anime right up until they tried to make a plot twist out of it.  They made so many bad decisions surrounding it, at least from my perspective, that I\u2019m honestly not sure how to start, or how to even broach the subject.  I guess I could start with the fact that they made a twist out of it in the first place, adding a layer of smugness to it that kinda takes away from the sting of it.  I can\u2019t really get emotional over it, because I can\u2019t stop seeing the faces of the writers, saying \u201cHah hah!  you didn\u2019t see that coming, did you?  Look at how smart we are!  We totally got you, didn\u2019t we?  We made you think it didn\u2019t happen, but it totally did!  You fell for it, didn\u2019t you?!\u201d  Honestly, no, I didn\u2019t fall for it.  Even my first time through, I saw through their act right from the start, because I\u2019m not an idiot.  I\u2019ve seen this exact plot twist before, and I\u2019ve seen it done so much better.  Shyamalan did it better with The 6\u2019th Sense, Goosebumps did it better with The Ghost Next Door, Scrubs did it better with Brendan fucking Frasier, and From the New World did it so well that the reveal hit me like a punch to the gut.  \\n\\n\r\nIf burying the tragedy under a plot twist doesn\u2019t telegraph to you just how manufactured this tragedy actually is, well, this part\u2019s going to be REALLY hard to talk about without spoiling anything, so instead of talking about it directly, I\u2019m going to talk about some heavy spoilers from Clannad Afterstory and the Studio Ghibli film Grave of the Fireflies.  In both of these shows, the emotional highlight involves the death of very young children, but while one is considered an enduring masterpiece by audiences and critics alike, the other is considered by at least half the people who view it as shameless tragedy porn.  Keeping this in mind, what separates the emotionally manipulative from the genuinely poignant?  Well, in Clannad, the characters we lose...  Both Nagisa and Ushio...  Aren\u2019t characters we\u2019re supposed to identify with.  We identify with Tomoya, so when he loses these characters, we\u2019re supposed to feel their loss through him, and that\u2019s just about the least dignified reason to kill off a character...  A death where they aren\u2019t even the focal point.  To make matters worse, she just died so she could be brought back to life, like Brian Griffin.  Thanks for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Setsuko\u2019s death in Grave of the Fireflies is also in service of another character, her older brother, but the point isn\u2019t to make you sympathize with him, nor is it to draw cheap tears just because it wants to.  They\u2019re not trying to make us feel bad for him, so we\u2019ll ignore all of his flaws...  We know her death is his fault, we know HIS death is his fault, and it carried a powerful message that Japanese youths at the time needed to hear.  This isn\u2019t a fireflies review, and I\u2019ll let you do your own research about the Japanese crime wave of the late eighties and the bubble economy that wound up popping, but suffice to say, Setsuko and Seita didn\u2019t just die because people remember tear jerkers...  There was an actual point to it.  There was no point to the tragedy in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.  There was nothing in that story that warranted a sad ending.  A story has to earn a tragic ending when it\u2019s characters are struggling against fate, but they ultimately fail due to their own flaws and the harshness of reality.  \\n\\n\r\nThe tragic ending in 8.0 ultimately comes across as false because the characters, and by extension the story, never earn it.  They don\u2019t struggle, they don\u2019t grow, they don\u2019t have arcs, and the constant bad luck getting thrown their way often just feels like pointless cruelty from the writers, who have nobody but themselves to blame for writing a story that features little more thought than moving game pieces from point A to point B.  It feels like a drama or action series, right up until it swings into Tragedy territory because it damn well wants to, and the fact that it has to hide under a hallucination gimmick so ridiculous that the hallucination has to tell the person having it that they\u2019re a hallucination, we\u2019ve officially entered territory so pathetic that I honestly would have taken a \u2018ghost\u2019 reveal more seriously.  So did this big, tragic twist tug at my heart strings?  No, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I felt nothing throughout the series.  It had it\u2019s moments, and while I found that oh-so-celebrated twist to be pointlessly cruel, I did get a little choked up at certain scenes that took place AFTER the reveal was over.  Like I said, it at least did the basics of a survival story competently enough.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 is available from Maiden Japan, a child company of Sentai Filmworks.  It can also be viewed on Hulu.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my griping earlier, I don\u2019t hate this show.  It\u2019s tolerable enough, even if I take some serious issues with it\u2019s writing and it\u2019s pathetic attempt at an undeserved sad ending.  Do I think it should have had a happy ending?  Well, it might not be as popular if it had gone that route, but it would have at least felt more true to itself.  Of course it would have had to consist of much greater character writing to support this change, and for those of you who think I\u2019m asking too much of a show whose cast is mostly comprised of children, I could point you towards plenty of titles that featured well written and interesting child characters...  There\u2019s Lilo and Stitch, pretty much every incarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist, the aforementioned Grave of the Fireflies...  Actually, you know what\u2019s the perfect example of this?  If you want to watch a series about two young siblings, one positive and one negative, facing danger and uncertainty as they try to make their way home, but both of them are fleshed out and have definitive personalities, check out Over the Garden Wall.  For now, though, I give Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 a 5.0/10.",

            "content": "I watched this work a few months after the Japanese Quake of 2011 and Fukushima Nuclear Incident. The images presented by major news stations are shocking and gritty; reactions are mixed towards the plight of the Japanese. Today, the Japanese are recovering and I wish them luck in moving forward.These strong emotions made me consider watching this josei work.\r\nThis is a noitaminA show, which is always 1 cour, and it has to be very tight and focused to make the show work. Disaster movies are usually short (90 minutes) and most of the padding comes from fanservice in the beginning before the disaster happens; TokyoMagnitude 8.0 starts off with an earthquake at the end of episode 1. This is when I begin to ask, \"Is there enough material for 11 episodes?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe answer for that is kinda and it has to be split into two parts: a tourist guide to an apocalyptic Tokyo and a coming-of-age story.\\n\\n\r\nIn 11 episodes, the show features famous and fallen Tokyo districts and monuments; an episode is entirely directed to the Tokyo Tower. The intent of the project is there: to show a realistic depiction of an actual earthquake. The backgrounds look spectacular and it immerses viewers into a panicked Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it really does feel like those travel shows you see on Discovery Channel. The bizarre pacing creates a jumpy feeling; let's focus on this district and then, another district! I find this obtrusive to the story and immersion; isn't this work a realistic depiction and not a travel show?\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, this show can be seen as a coming-of-age story for Onozawa Mirai. However, I had problems liking or relating to Mirai; she comes off as too bratty and uncaring in some events. There are some events that are clearly her fault and I gaped at her stupidity. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship dynamic between Mirai and Yuuki is almost mindboggling and the show really depended on the dynamics to convey its themes. I had trouble understanding what's the problem with Mirai's character nor was I interested in Yuuki's character. I admit that Mirai is intentionally set up as a bratty character, but it went too far.\\n\\n\r\nMari, on the other hand, actually has development. As expected from josei works, Mari's problems are mature and I invested more emotions towards her character than the others. Her struggle as a working single mother made me consider why she isn't the main character; she had better problems well suited for drama.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending. Good god. While people may like its sappy ending, I did not and felt cheated; it is such a cheap and cliched way to end. Again, it depended on the relationship dynamics of the main characters and the ending, to me, felt too sloppy and slipshod.\\n\\n\r\nDid I think it is a good show though? Maybe. I didn't hate it; that's for sure. However, the show's natural strength of beautiful art succumbed to its characterization and pacing flaws. It just comes off to me as one of those works that has wasted a good premise.",

The girl in the story shows you about how much she dislike her life, and the world, especially her little brother and her parents, until one day a huge earthquake struck the place where she lives. She realized about how much sheloves her whole entire family, and the anime shows how slowly the siblings connect to each other.\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably what most peoples had faced on March 11, 2011, the day when Tokyo, Japan had fell.

            "content": "Sorry in advance for my bad english.\r\nStory : 6/10\r\nThe story is pretty original, it gives us the chance to follow a girl that did not like this world anymore and hated almost everything, during the sad experience that is earthquake. I do not think that an anime have been made about that before, but the fact is that the story was really boring. I was waiting something full of emotions and sad moments, but until the end, there was nothing like this, just people that walk, eat and sleep, and do not really care about the others. You see people be saved, you see thatpeople died, but you do not follow their death. I mean, clearly not enough. The start was interesting, the way that you are put in the situation is cool, but the middle is pretty boring, nothing is happening, and then the end is really not what I excepted from this anime. The story himself is good, but it did not focus enough on a lot of things that had a big importance.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nMeh. The art was good in a lot of moments, the 3D moments were good as well, but in some moments, it was designed in a very bad way. When I say very bad way, I mean that I could almost have done better, and god know how bad am I in drawing. The environment was well drawn during all the anime, but in few moments the design of characters was horrible, and it hurts, really. And the art of the opening and the endings were disappointing. Only few images in black and white (not even more than 10) as opening, and some useless pics about useless characters on a black and white background as ending.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nYou will sincerely get no good memories about this. The opening and the ending are very simple, it does not fit at all with the anime. Just a simple music, I really did not find the anime there, but more than that, the soundtrack was clearly average as well, it gave me no real emotions. Cool, there is a soundtrack, but it clearly gave me no feelings. And on this kind of anime, you wait feelings from the soundtrack, but at least, the voice of the characters was good, especially the one of the kid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nOk, it wanted to have normal characters that could have been real. Put a little girl that is angry for no reasons, a kind little boy, some people that have no heart and could almost walk on little kids, some old person that help other people, and a simple woman that will help the characters that are too young to fend for themselves, and maybe you will get an anime with realistic characters, but no, it's not that easy. When you make kids face people that die, you can't let them be \" meh, glad it's not me \", you just can't. And when you put a woman that supposed to protect the kids, you can't let them do what they fucking want. They are supposed stick together, but those kids always runaway to do useless things and the woman is like \" ok cya dw it's not like there is earthquakes \".. No, you just can't. The characters were realistic, this is what was searched, but their reaction to the sadness of the earthquake is clearly not realistic, and what a shame for an anime about earthquakes to not be able to give real reactions of the characters about the situation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nI was really excited at the start of the anime, I was sure that I would have good moments watching this, but then, I was bored that the situation weas not moving forward, and that finally the main characters do not care about the earthquakes, they just want important people for them to be alive, that's all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nMeh. Maybe I excepted to much from this anime, it was not bad, but not what I wanted. The start is good, the end will give feelings as well, but I did not want this anime to give me feelings by that way. To the end, you will just see the main character evolve through the situation. Yeah, there is earthquake, but to the end, I do not feel like it was the main subject.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my own opinion, but if you really do not agree with me, I will be happy if you share with me your felt about my review. And for the one who did not watch the anime still, there is for sure better animes, but the subject of the one is pretty original and you will not see it somewhere else, so give it a try, it's short, you will not waste your time.",

Had a little grave of the fireflies vibe from it through the fact that bro and sis keep it real and yall siblings for life no matter what, it beautifully pulled it off, brought some cut onions near my eyes ya know. Overall thoughI feel like I coulda seen this shit on a movie screen shortened to 2 hours or so and still woulda felt da same way. The only thing missing would've been the tribulations part but I feel ya can easily show good character development for two characters in a couple  hours instead of 13 episodes. Overall though really enjoyed it and I would give this emotional wreck of an anime 8 out of 10 stars.",

            "content": "/!\\ SPOILERS /!\\\r\nTokyo Magnitude starts very well, but ends bad enough. It is assumed that this anime is a recreation studied after \"extensive research\" (put it at the beginning of each chapter). So far so good, the first 4-5 chapters shows you the consequences of an earthquake and situations that could happen and it's like it warns you of what can happen to you and tells you what to do if you happen to be in such a situation, but starting of half-series all this begins to become a personal drama and deepens in the life of the protagonists. For example, when they go hometo one who knows Mari and tell a little about his life (when Mari meets her husband and the story of Yuuki and the robot geek). Or the very stupid \"drama\" of when they find the bodies of an old woman and a girl in a shelter and it is already assumed that it is Mari's family, without removing the blanket from her face in order to identify them, so that three minutes later, Mirai and Yuuki find the true relatives who were alive. That is, you get a absurd drama that three minutes is solved. Hello? And also when Yuuki dies and Mirai sees his ghost (or whatever). I thought at first that it was a product of his imagination because he ended up in shock but he is put back into another drama that could have been saved because it is a RECREATION, not a drama of \"h my otouto dies\". It seems that in the end Yuuki is a ghost and not a product of Mirai's imagination, since when she leaves not to return, she is fading and saying things that Mirai does not understand. I mean, ghosts in an anime about earthquakes? Then they put some scenes of moments of the life of Yuuki trying to make you cry, making a cheap drama, more than anything because at no time it is said why it dies. Does he die from sunstroke (this was mentioned but not confirmed) and the child does not complain? Any child would complain and if it is so heated he could have said to stand in a shade and drink water (which they do). Come on, that his death does not make sense, they get to dramatize and sympathize with the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, that of an anime that in theory is a studied recreation of the consequences of an earthquake (I repeat that they put a text at the beginning of each episode remembering it), starts very well but half goes completely by the branches and becomes An absurd drama. And that not to mention the lousy animation, that had been \"pardoned\" for being an anime that had instructive principles.",

            "content": "It's all going down. The whole of Tokyo is crumbling due to an 8.0 magnitude earthquake, and with it is crumbling the life of a 7th-grade teenage girl Mirai. Stranded away from her home and parents with her younger brother and another woman named Mari, will she be able to complete her journey home?\r\nI cannot really categorize Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 in a good or bad category. Part of it makes you think that you should probably watch something else while part of it doesn't let you stop seeing it even for a second.\r\nThe overall premise of the story is good and it is what compelledme to start watching it. After the 1st three quarters, I felt that it was a really good story gone waste but the last quarter does the work of binding together everything and providing a sense of completeness at the end. This anime is much more than just about an earthquake and how lives are destroyed by it. It is about a girl, rowdy and pessimistic at the beginning and her journey as she comes round to realize what truly matters and how certain events change the way she thinks about things and people.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is breathtaking. There are some amazing shots of building and the surroundings which are a treat to watch. Especially the shots of bridge and Tokyo tower in the initial episodes and the details in which they are shown is amazing. The character sketches are not that great and mainly kept simple, but that also draws your attention to the minute details in the background. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe background is probably the biggest let down of the anime. The score at the time of earthquake isn't really that great and it also doesn't complement emotions in those tender scenes. But again, the last 3 episodes are the highlight of the anime and the background score fits perfectly here. The op is not that great the ed is pretty good and works well after you have completed the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters lack depth, except perhaps Mirai. There's not much work done in this front. But then it can also be because it was to be primarily her show. Yuki as the younger brother is perhaps the most likable character you will come across in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't really enjoy much, except the last 3 episodes. It was something which I was not really hooked to. Yes, the episodes ended well and prepared the base for the next one, but there was nothing much going on in terms of character development in the initial stages.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a good anime, if not an average one. It can get kind of depressing at times, and will surely make you cry a lot towards the end as the journey comes to an end. But it also has those sunny, happy moments provided by Yuki which provide a respite from the otherwise gloomy surroundings. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not a tale of survival, it's a tale of a journey back home. \\n\\n",

An anime about the realistic depiction of an earthquake may be the reason why it got such high praise, the character interactions had flaws and the story was just OK. So, I wasn't extremely sad when Yuuki died. Mari is about the only character who stuck with me and got me through this long torturous journey. \r\nMirai is a despicable teenager who acts like a child, hence may be the reason why she is treated like one. Also, she has this relationship with Mari that I felt was excessively motherly. Her brothercould also be a little too childish, but he's just a young kid so I don't have that much of a problem with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe twist with Yuuki was quite predictable, I did think something was wrong with him keep disappearing and reappearing and how was he able to survive that surgery, by the way?\\n\\n\r\nI think that the anime should've been shortened to about 9-10 episodes long, it was a bit boring but it may have been because I was sleepy at the time. There's not really anything inappropriate in it aside from one bad word but it's too scary and Yuuki's death would be too distressing for young teens to handle.\\n\\n\r\nYou may try it but don't expect anything too special. It's mainly something you can watch to pass the time. But you may just forget about what happened in the next couple of days.",

Satomi Hanamura portrays mirai's personality perfectly and realy sells it in the last ep, same going with Yumiko Kobayashi as yuki who actually sounds like a kid, everyone is really good at acting in the show and Y\u016bko Kaida really sounds like a mom in her 20 to 30's, the music is outstanding, its rare to find a show where the music is extremely memorable but tokyo magnitude pulls it off, some track fit scenes perfectly and while its no clannad ost its still very well done\\n\\n\r\ncharacters(10/10) wether its our 3 mains yuki, mirai, and mari or one of the 1 shot characters that only appear for a episode everyone is extremely likable. some of the one shot characters may come off insane but still likable like the robotku who is obsessed with robots, the main 3 are easily the most likable and are all realistic and develop, our MC mirai acts her age, shes a 11 year old so naturally shes bratty and full of herself like we all were back then, yuki is a little less realistic but is believable enough to the point where you could imagine a kid with his personality existing in real life, and finally mari who acts like a real mother, she hides her fear and worries so she doesn't frighten the children(mirai and yuki) but as a human she has her breaking points and as the serise progresses she grows more and more worried about things and a certain plot point i wont spoiled introduced very early, the characters are great and develop well,\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment(10/10) if the premise doesn't give it away this show is downright depressing,  its not for those easily upset especially with the horrible events that happened in real life recently, now actual enjoyment it will keep you interested even in the calmer episodes halfway through, its very enjoyable and will leave you in denial till it happens for the last 4 episodes,\\n\\n\r\noverall(10/10) yah the near non existent story and animation dip halfway through doesn't stop this form being what it is, and thats a realistic prediction of what would happen to tokyo in a few years, the show is depressing and while there is one significantly obvious twist it will still leave you shocked from it and may leave you in tears like it did me, this is one of a kinda and well worth watching. and make sure to sit through the credits, how they do the epilogue is very well done even though i didn't get to see much of it since my vision was blurred from crying so much in the previous 5 min prior\\n",

            "content": "Boy, did Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 (TM8) come out of nowhere and completely surprise me.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story is fascinating and fresh. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of each episode that states a large amount of research concerning earthquakes and such were done as the show is striving for realism. The show is fiction, but this sense of realism adds to the emotional story. Further, the flow of the story, for the most part, is excellent and will make viewers want to watch the episodes consecutively.\r\nAnimation: 8/10\r\nThe character drawings range from \u201caverage\u201d at worst to \u201cvery good\u201d at best. In some scenes, the characters looklazily drawn, but it gets the point across and is not annoying to look at. The backdrop has much more detail and is often times excellent in quality. The CG scenes are well done too. The difference in quality between the character and setting animations is to increase the overall realism and devastation caused by the earthquake.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are exceptional. Everyone is believable and very likeable. The protagonists grow with the unfolding events and are a main reason why the story is so moving. Further, the supporting cast is also well done. One can connect with any of the side characters and sympathize with their situation. In addition, the voice actors did an excellent job of conveying the tone and emotion to put an genuine spin on their characters (especially Mari and Yuuki\u2019s seiyuus).\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKimi No Uta\u2019s (opening) music and lyrics are fitting for the chaotic events and describe the protagonists\u2019 situation well. The ending song, Melody, is very catchy and uplifting. Its \u201cmelody\u201d is light and happy which clashes (in a good way) with some of the more serious scenes. The background score, while not exactly memorable by itself, is purposeful and moving.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy is my gut feeling about this show just slightly above average when all the other qualities are higher? It is because I literally felt like I was punched in my emotional and proverbial gut towards the end of the show. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the ending is far from horrible. It is hard to explain what I\u2019m talking about without spoiling it so let me just simply say that it did its job of evoking my emotions, however I feel that it did too good of a job. We all know too much of a good thing can be bad.  The ending is extremely bittersweet, making me have a love-hate relationship for this series. I am sure other viewers will disagree with my gut feeling. I can see where they are coming from and completely respect that (see my perfect 10/10 score for the story).\\n\\n\r\nAverage Series Rating: 8/10 \u2013 Very Good\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: TM8 is a gripping, refreshing, depressing, but extremely entertaining drama. The viewer may want to watch something happier and lighter at the end because it is a real tear jerker. Not exactly my cup of tea (too sad), however I know a special series when I see it.",

The story is very good, because it brings up a story that most of the people didn't live, but the japanese people did. There was an earthquakes, a tough one, as the story explains. I did enjoy it a little, before I added it to my \"dropped\" tab in my list. Why? Well, because of the art. The drawing art is good... but they use too much the process of adding 3 Dimensional elements. When you're in those parts that you can see them as 1 meter away, yousee the characters are typical anime character (with the author's original art) and if they are 2 meters away (or more) you see them as this strange type of 3D elements. This got me pissed off. \"Why add those horrible very well noticable elements when the story is amazing? This screws the whole anime!\".\\n\r\nFor me, 3D elements look horrible in animes if they aren't very worked on.\\n\r\nHowever, it's on opinion.",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is an unique anime. You rarely see a title showing a catastrophy in here. And not only it is catastrophical, but in fact there is more slice of life theme going on in here. Did this attempt turn out well? Partially.\r\nThe story focuses around young middle-school girl called Mirai (which is an interesting name in the contex of the story, since it translates into \"future\") and her younger brother. Due to her overworking parents, she has the one to take her brother for a visit in some kind of gallery away from her home, where the fatal accident in the title takesplace. Briefly after the earthquake adult woman named Mari decides to help them return to their parents and so the trio starts on their way back, which is pretty much the theme of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this anime has only 11 episodes, though looking on what there is in the plot, and there is pretty much nothing but just going back home, it seems that the number is too big. The series has some side stories, but they are rather short and depth-lacking, like the one about guy who liked robots, cause they helped saving people.. Yes, he liked robots and it was just about him liking the robots. The entire episode of just him liking the robots. I'm not even kidding. The more you watch, the more you begin to wonder \"what the hell did they fill the next x episodes with?\". There is a little turn at the end of episode 8. It would be hard for me to explain the circumstances and what made me not like it without giving out much spoilers, so I will touch as generally as it is possible. The series ends with some kind of inception-like theme going on and the inception itself is a little bit confusing at the end, in a way that you're not completely sure if the plot won't take another twist or there would be a sudden moment of realisation that the girl was just having a bad dream all the time at the very end. This makes is hard for you to go along with the actual action and empathize with the characters. I realize that this story is made to be emotional and tear-jerking, yet I couldn't get the feeling that it was dragged on with a forced ending to it off my head.\\n\\n\r\nFor the visuals, there are just mediocre. I don't have much against the background, but I certainly didn't like the way characters were drawn. While Mirai is generally ok, but the boy with her looks plain bad, and the moments when he's supposed to smile resembles me of a parody rather then anything else. The voice isn't that bad, but it doesn't show off too much either. Opening is a bit anti-climatic, it makes you a bit excited and waiting to get in action, while the anime is extremely slow-paced. The ending on the other hand is just brilliant. I loved it and the way it fit with the show unlike the op so much, that I gave +1 score just for the ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nIn case of characters it is hard to say much, since there are only 3 of them and each is pretty much one-coloured. There is a handful of side characters, but most of them are as deep as the aforementioned robot guy, so let's just just ignire them for time-being. For the main trio, the one that I certainly didn't enjoy watching is once again the younger brother. He's just over-optimistic, family-loving, everyone-around-concerned-for etc etc child. Everyone he speaks, he merely says anything new or unexpected, and his voice is a bit annoying, when he says everything in a shouting manner. The only character I enjoyed looking at was Mirai, since she was kinda dynamic, turning from depressed, a bit rebellious teen into warm and sympathizing girl. I could sort of identify with her and experience her drama and that was the part of the show I greatly enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, this anime could be way more entertaining if they decided to give up on the inception theme. This would also make it shorter, cutting it possibly to 9-10 episodes, but it would also make the ending less confusing, so the viewer could actually enjoy the feeling of katharsis which comes with it. If it would be true, I would be actually willing to give this anime an 8 from the title, however it's not that simple and I'm a bit in two minds when it comes to judging it. On one side I like the overall theme of it and the character development of the main heroine, despite the fact that the anime feels over-extended and even boring, not to mention the confusion around the inception-like end theme. So to say: I liked it and I was bored with it at the same time. If you are looking for a catastrophical anime with high value of realism, as well as some personal drama going on, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a solid recommendation for you. Too bad I can't forget about it flaws, and thus it makes \"only\" 7.0 earthquake on my scale.",

Title: Tokyo Magnitude 8\r\nGenre: Drama, Disaster, Tragedy, Contemporary, Suspense || Writer: Takahashi Natsuko\r\nDirector: Masaki Tachibana || Producer: Ozaki Noriko, Matsuka Yuichiro\r\nOriginal Run: July 9, 2009 \u2013 September 17, 2009 || Episode Count: 11 Episodes\r\nPlot \u2013\r\nAfter a massive earthquake in Tokyo 25 km under the sea at a magnitude of 8.0, siblings Mirai and Yuuki, who were visiting a robot exhibition at Odaiba at the beginning of their summer vacation, struggle to reach their parents in their house in Setagaya, assisted by a female motorcycle courier named Mari, who is striving to reach her own daughter and motherin Sangenjaya. Together, the three brave the ruined city and try their best to make it home safely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization and Voice Acting \u2013\\n\r\nThe series has a young girl named Mirai Onozawa as the leading character whose life and struggles have been pictured in the whole story, to be precise. The other two main characters apart from the lead protagonist are Kusakabe Mari \u2013 the lady who helps her and her younger brother \u2013 Yuuki Onozawa \u2013 to get back to their home safely. The character development in the whole series is praiseworthy. The transitions brought about by the circumstances in the human behavior as a whole has been pictured in a very authentic manner. The voice acting undoubtedly is one of the best. To be more specific, the voice casting of Yuuki is something you should emphasize more on. It is done in a very distinct manner. The innocence and the mental maturity have been reflected very proficiently through the voice casting itself.\\n\r\nThe side characters \u2013 Parents of the Protagonist and others \u2013 have been presented in a fair and noteworthy manner as well, although their roles in the series may have been comparatively shorter but still the director managed to give a crystal clear image of the whole case scenario with efficiency.\\n\r\nOnozawa, Mirai \u2013 Voiced by Hanamura, Satomi (Jap.) and Christian, Luci (Eng.)\\n\r\nOnozawa, Yuuki \u2013 Voiced by Kobayashi, Yumiko (Jap.) and Grant, Tiffany (Eng.)\\n\r\nKusakabe, Mari \u2013 Voiced by Kaida, Yuko (Jap.) and Calene-Black, Shelly (Eng.)\\n\r\nParents of the Protagonist:\\n\r\nOnozawa, Senji \u2013 Voiced by Naka, Hiroshi (Jap.) and Matranga, David (Eng.)\\n\r\nOnozawa, Masami \u2013 Voiced by Inoue, Kikuko (Jap.) and Flecknoe, Maggie (Eng.)\\n\\n\r\nArtwork \u2013\\n\r\nThe artwork as a whole resembles that of Ghibli\u2019s Spirited Away. It is done in the simplest way possible and hence is able to grab the attention of the watcher. The expressions of the characters under different circumstances are very vividly reflected, apart from the dialogues, mainly through the artwork. Not much detailing, yet very well managed.\\n\r\nThe importance shall be laid more on the designs and artwork of the buildings and architecture of the towns/cities as a whole. It is very common to present normal townscape scenario anywhere but what is most challenging is to make it look as real as possible after the disaster effect. The damage and the property loss as a whole have been presented in a very efficient manner, too undoubtedly.\\n\\n\r\nRatings \u2013\\n\r\nPlot: Gets a rating of 7.5/10 from me as it is nothing extraordinary in nature. It is a work of fiction based on a random character\u2019s life during the time of a disaster which really took place in Tokyo in recent times. Still, it deserves a rating of 7.5+.\\n\r\nCharacter Design and Voice Acting: On this ground in particular, I rate the series as 8/10 \u2013 wrt to the Character Design, Animation and Voice Casting\\n\r\nArtwork: For artwork, the series gets an 8.5/10\\n\r\nAverage Rating: 8/10\\n\r\nMyAnimeList Rating: 8.2/10 || IMDB Rating: 8.1/10",

Just watch it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nSome of the main characters may come off as annoying at first, but their development causes you to care for and sympathize with them later on.\\n\r\nPeople generally act like you'd expect them too in an emergency. All in all, they are very human.\\n\r\nSome dialogue seems kinda tacked on.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nHonestly, the worst part of the show. While Studio Bones handled the animation, the quality thereof is nothing to marvel at. Some might even say it was bad in some spots.\\n\r\nHowever, the show doesn't have a plot that lends itself to sakuga covered action scenes. Therefor, the art is good for what needs to be done.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe OP is by Abingdon Boys School and therefor, awesome. However, a J-rock song doesn't really feel like it fits with this kind of story.\\n\r\nThe ED is a pleasure to listen to. It reminds you of the feeeeeels. It's great.\\n\r\nOST fits fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nThis show didn't take long to watch and rewatch at only 11 episodes. I can say it was well worth the time spent.\\n\r\nThe story really helps you sympathize with the things people in earthquake-prone countries have to go through when the inevitable happens.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nA wonderfully touching story with a serious and realistic setting that managed to make me cry multiple times.\\n\r\nIf you like disaster films and heart-wrenching twists, you will enjoy Tokyo Magnitude 8.0.\\n\r\nThere really isn't a lot to contraindicate your enjoyment of this show, unless you're significantly picky about animation quality and plot pace.",

And that's what I think you'd want if you're even considering watching this in the first place. The story focuses on three earthquake survivors on their journey to their homes, and it deals with the repercussions of the disaster.\r\nArt: Art is pretty gently, honestly. It's nothing too amazing, but definitely nothing bad about it either.\r\nSound: Never really know what to say about the sound when I'm writing reviews. The explosive noises of earthquakes really added tothe horrific nature you'd expect in this type of series, I suppose?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It's very easy to start caring about the characters, since it pretty much focuses solely on Mirai, Yuuki, and Mari... \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. It felt pretty realistic, though once again I've never experienced an earthquake myself. Watch it and judge for yourselves, I suppose.",

It's a hit or miss as there is nothing much happening. We follow Yuuki, his older sister Mirai and Mari who are trying to get back home after a seism happened in Tokyo.\r\nThe anime is terribly touching and made me shed a couple of tears by the end... I'd probably would have avoided it had I known what it was about before starting it.\r\nStory: 7\r\nArt: 7\r\nSound: 8\r\nCharacter: 9\r\nEnjoyment: 9\r\nOverall: 8\r\nStory: 7\r\nAs I said not much... The story's mostly character-driven... But itreally shines when it wants to. It never falls into too much sentimentality and lets the situations speak for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nI'm hesitating between a 6 and a 7... but well let's go for a 7. The 3D is sub-par. Sometimes it blends well for instance when we see robots... and other times, especially with 3D characters, it's just ugly...\\n\r\nI can't help but compare it to Oban Star Racers aired 4 years earlier which featured a heavy use of 3D for characters and vessels alike and which was way above visually speaking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nHate the opening and ending. I really didn't notice the music until the end when the tracks completed perfectly the story to make me bawl my eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nMirai: is not the most likable character in the beginning... In fact as an older sister myself, I'd say she's the Worst Sister EVER. But I'll let it slide because she's just terribly immature and does learn from her mistakes. \\n\\n\r\nYuuki: Adorable and really really sweet which is a not so nice contrast with his cranky older sister at the beginning.Sigh... Should have seen this coming...\\n\\n\r\nMari: Protective and kind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is not an anime that is will make you lose faith in humanity ( I'm looking at you Liar Game), although... I had my doubts at a certain moment when I feared they would introduce us to a pedophile grandpa but thankfully NOPE. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nFast watch though I think it's better not to binge it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nCompletely forgettable but touching enough to make you shed some tears.

            "content": "Ever wanted to kill hundreds of people with just one email? Well, that isn't what the show is about, but this show does feature the deaths of many as Japan suffers a severe earthquake. This show was a joy ride from the beginning all the way to the end, and though it may be a slow ride it was a joyous one to watch. The show as stated before is about a severe earthquake that hits Japan, and follows a teenage girl and her little brother through the tough aftermath as they travel back home. As aftershocks hit, they run into a friendly woman whohas agreed to see them home and travel as a group of three to help one another out through physical and mental struggles. Each episode shows a new moment in the in catastrophe, and the adventure that one shouldn't have to experience.\\n\\n\r\nSidenote: A good show to watch if you have no idea what to watch, I will say though the show is kinda slow paced. I don't mind slow paced shows if the story is good, which this show did have an interesting story.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story was pretty nice, an interesting turn from other shows out there. It was slow paced, but at the same time it seemed just interesting enough to keep my attention and seemed to fly by. The idea of it all was really good, it takes place in a demolished Japan after a serious earthquake, and shows the after math and struggles one and many would have if it were to occur today.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were alright, they weren't the most creative, but they were fun. The only reason why they aren't labeled generic would be the situations they were placed in and how realistically they deal with them. The characters do also develop in the show which is spectacular, the way they acted towards one other from beginning to end was real and human like. Although as I do praise the characters, I would like to point out minor flaws. The characters might do or say some generic things, as in they act in a way that seems too anime to be real (if that makes sense). That would be my only problem with them, and it doesn't happen that often, but when it does it's a minor issue.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: This show did have some really great scenes with some nice design and nice detail to destroyed landscapes. Sets in the show were real for the situation, and the design for them were nicely drawn and colored. Nothing looked too dull nor too flashy, which is fantastic. My only issues though would be the use of cheap 3D models for characters in the background. Although I list that as an issue, it wasn't too noticeable and for the most part it wasn't overused and obvious. I also had some issues with the subtitles, for some of the important text would be colored differently from the not so important text. What I mean by that is usually if other characters are talking their dialogue would be colored, usually yellow. This show had yellow text but would make main dialogue yellow and the other text white, and it's easy to adjust to but it was weird seeing it for the first time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show was good, but with a few cliche scenes. Although everything was great and unique, the show did use some elements that seemed maybe a little out of place. Also some things were predictable, and it is practically unavoidable for the lead up to some of the reveals made them obvious before they could reveal them.\\n\\n\r\nGood show to watch, if your interested definitely put it in your plan to watch.",

Do you value the company of your parents, siblings and friends? only when you are depending on yourself is that the answer to this question appears.\\n\\n\r\nIn this climate the anime proves to be very good, many people show their egocentric way, angry with the situation as it was expected, on the other hand there are also people who tend to help those who are most disadvantaged.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I really liked the way the anime shows the feel of the characters, you not only sympathizes, but feel empathy for them, my final thought was that any tragedy we face in life, we can divide us and face it alone or unite ourselfs as humans and overcome the problems toghether, it's all a matter of choice.",

In a catastrophic disaster family is a very important thing to have. Mirai starts off as your usual teenage girl who hates her parents and her life. As the story progresses, Mirai's attitude toward her family changes. When I saw that Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 would have 11 episodes, I thought that there could not be much of a story about an earthquake. I thought wrong, I was glued to the screen and finished the show in a day. With every episode the story was veryin-depth and had many emotions. I had to hold back some man tears when I watching Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 very much and would recommend it too anyone who would like an entertaining anime to past the time. This is my first review and I like to keep things short. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking a little bit of your time to read my review.\\n\\n\r\n-Babyant44",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is a moving tale about two siblings caught in a inevitable situation of a 8.0 earthquake and is based on a hypothetical situation of a earthquake occurring along with being produced after research and inspection of facts. The story overall is very moving and it conveys very well the effects and devastation an earthquake of that or any magnitude could cause on not just the environment but the effects on the people's mentality and health. It is a very moving tale about two siblings called Mirai Onozawa and Yukki Onozawa who, along with meeting a woman along the way called Mari Kusakabi,focus on getting home to their families whilst on their journey coming across the struggles that the earthquake has brought upon them and those around them. \\n\\n\r\nI found the story very moving and at times uplifting, Mirai Onozawa seems rather negative and pessimistic whilst her brother Yukki is very uplifting, energetic and positive. The woman Mari Kusakabi is rather the 'mother' of the group who offers guidance and makes sure that all of them make it home safely. It is good that you can see along the journey how much they grow, particularly Mirai, and how each take from each other their strong points to make it through. The story seems to flow rather well, I think sometimes there were a couple of knocks where I felt they were trying to stretch it a bit and it seemed to drag a tad but overall I think the last few episodes make up for that. \\n\\n\r\nI think the animation was very good, particularly the environment as it did good portrayal of the devastation and ruins, the rubble and broken houses, the uneven slabs of pavement, I think it captured the whole feel of the earthquake. I think the animations of the characters were good, I would say they weren't very bright but it could be to make the environment stand out. I did feel that the characters expressions looked rather gone out and paper thin at times but it didn't really distract from the whole experience. \\n\\n\r\nI would say the music was so-so, I wouldn't say it was bad but not very memorable but it did well to convey the emotions in certain scenes. I must say  that the ED/Ending song was quite memorable to me, it did leave a good impression on me, quite moving and enthusiastic, it certainly got me pumped for the next episode. The voice acting was quite good, I think they matched their characters very well, particularly Yukki as it certainly matched his sparky positive personality, I could have no qualms about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime, it made me smile at times and it made me tear up too, it certainly did well at pulling at my heartstrings and it gave that whole impression and feeling of loving what you have, not taking things for granted.",

            "content": "Non spoiler review\r\nThis movie has been an emotional ride for me and I greatly enjoyed it. The art and sound are good but where it really shines is in the story telling and character development. \r\nThe characters look believable when faced with the different situations. Plot is good and tragic, also who would believe that roughly 3 years later after the movie was screened, tragedy would strike Japan for real. \r\nThe portrayal of the earthquake, its aftermath and the subsequent aftershocks is very well done. You kind of feel the terror of the aftershocks, never knowing when they will strike, if the building you arein will collapse.  Earthquakes really shake your life, one of the most despicable forces of nature and in this movie it really shakes the lives of the main characters to the core. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a movie that will make you tear up and change your views about family and brothers/sisters. There is a lot of realism presented from the search and recovery units of the JDF to the places portrayed in Tokyo. \\n\r\nMy biggest complaint about this movie is the length of time it takes the main characters to journey from Odaiba to Setagaya (approx. 15km walk on google maps \u2013 let\u2019s say 20km with detours). This distance can be covered in a day once you\u2019ve crossed Tokyo Bay. The other complaint is Mari as a character, although nicely developed, she seems forced, I don\u2019t think there are people that would actually take on helping 2 kids when faced in a crisis situation of their own.  If there really are such people, it\u2019s great, the world needs more like that. If put in such a situation, I don\u2019t know what I would do actually. This movie is good at making you question yourself and also in showing how fragile our society is (lack of phone coverage for example in a crisis, how you lose contact with your loved ones, lack of food, shelter, medicines, etc).\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts, movie is great and underrated in my opinion. Have your paper towels handy for the last episodes, you might need them, ending is quite powerful. Let\u2019s hope that tragedies like in this anime stay in the anime and do not happen in Japan or anywhere else in the world. Japan, more than any other country in the world, knows how to pick-up after a natural tragedy (they had so many so far), life is never the same after that however, the Japanese are good in understanding and showing this through this anime. \\n",

Its just trying to get 'the feels' by using little kids, few cenes of dead relatives and fear of losing those close to you, which can be a tear jerker and can provoke people to think unless you make characters two dimensional and they remain just like storm troopers in Star Wars- faceless and put there just to die in the background. \\n\r\nI do have to admit first two eisodes did get me hyped up, but thats probably because ive never seen an earthquake. \\n\\n\r\n(Sorry about any grammar mistakes i might have made.)",

I loved this anime because not only did it make me laugh and cry, it also allowed me to see how much of an effect an earthquake like this could impact the environment and people!\r\n   The plot for Tokyo Magnitude was fantastic. It could be very relate able at times especially when the two siblings got mad at each other. Usually, it would be Mirai scolding her younger brother and him being hurt, but he didn't say anything aboutthat much. They meet Mari and hit it off and they seemed like a family. The story definitely kept you in suspense.\\n\\n\r\n    The art was very realistic when it came to the destruction that the earthquake brought. The characters were nicely drawn and fit somewhere in the middle of cartoon-y and anime-y, but in my opinion, that's the best place.\\n\\n\r\n     Even if you closed your eyes and kept on listening, I think you could definitely tell that an earthquake was occurring. All the other sounds were great too, when the characters were talking, when machines or robots were moving, anything to be honest.  \\n\\n\r\n      Okay. The characters. Don't even get me started! They seemed so real and it felt as if I was best friends with them and knew every little detail about them. It was obvious that the creators thought about their personality really hard, and it showed. \\n\\n\r\n     The only, and I mean ONLY reason I gave enjoyment a 9 was because it made me so sad. This is definitely not a bad thing. I love sad anime (I don't know, I'm just weird like that okay?) and honestly, I feel like this is a great anime that plays with your feelings. Of course I enjoyed this anime, I mean, who couldn't?\\n\\n\r\n     Overall, I loved this anime. Of course, it made me sob as well as die inside a little, but I love it none the less. You should definitely give it a try and plus, if you don't like it, it's not very long anyways (which is a bummer).\\n\\n",

            "content": "Anime Review\r\nTokyo Magnitude 8.0 (11 Episodes)\r\nRating: 6/10 (Fine)\r\nRecommendation Level: Stream It\r\nYes, a lot of reviews are hitting my Facebook today. That's what happens when you finally had some free time to catch up on your collection. There will be a few more before the day's end, so I apologize ahead of time if this is a nuisance.\r\nStory:\r\nMirai and Yuuki are siblings. Mari is at the age where she, well do you remember middle school? Yeah it's that. And Yuuki is a in elementary school. Wth their parents always working, Mari is asked to take Yuuki to robot exhibit on the other side of town. Whilethey're there, an earthquake hits Tokyo. The two meet up with Mari, lady in her mid to late 20's. And the three of them try to find their way back home amidst the devastating earthquake.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you think of natural disaster movies, shows, et cetera. What do you generally think of? I bet you're thinking about constant destruction. Well, you're going to be surprised about this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Tokyo Magnitude is very slow. The main idea of the anime is to grow the characters, in a span of about a week. Maybe less. There isn't constant destruction or huge obstacles that get in the way at every turn. It's more of a peaceful setting. The \"good\" side of a disaster. The kindness and thoughtfulness of others is what shines through most in this show. Which is a slight downfall.\\n\\n\r\nDuring a time in need, we want to have people to help us. We want to come together as a community and grow stronger from these events. The only problem is that Tokyo Magnitude doesn't really hit home with the viewer. The light hearted tone doesn't give this natural disaster a lot of weight, so in return, we can't feel the full affects of just occurred. Until the end. That was something I didn't really see coming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nMirai: Moody, doesn't like to be bothered with much, finds everything annoying or uncool.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki: Optimistic, friendly, cheerful, never complains, wants what's best for others.\\n\\n\r\nMari: Older, wiser, very calm, handles situations really well, doesn't jump to conclusions, a lot of compassion and determination.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, Tokyo Magnitude is about the characters and their journey. The overall plot takes a back seat as you watch Mirai grow up, in a matter of days, and see how the characters appreciate life with every step they take forward towards home. It's one of the better character anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is serviceable. With the exception of a few destruction scenes, there isn't a lot to exactly showcase. On another note, the destroyed buildings don't give off a lot of despair because of the light hearted tone. Which is fine if you're looking for something with more happiness than sadness.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, meh. Nothing really note worthy here. The opening is okay but it's instantly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is where it's at. Other than Greg Ayres and Brittney Karbowski voicing every single side character, the main cast is excellent. They picked up the best for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nIf you were expecting a grand anime, with a lot of destruction and survival elements thrown in, you're going to be severely disappointed. This anime tears me up because on one hand, the characters are tremendous. On the other, the story is really, really slow. Almost too the point where it's hard to finish because nothing really happens, up until the last three episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is more on the good side than bad. But I honestly believe that's because of the last two episodes that leave a, possible cheap ending. One that you don't see coming, unless you're really paying attention, or guessed it from a certain point on. It'll either strike the right chord with you, or piss you off.\\n\\n\r\nFinal advice, if you do choose to view it, take your time with it. It's not something that's popcorn made. It's meant to be slow and developing. Whether you like it or not, that'll be totally up to your taste.",

The story is good but it can be quite boring to watch at times since most of the episodes were them waiting to be rescued or heading into something without knowing the danger from doing it.\r\nI find it difficult to cope with the complains and cries from the main cast, this series could have turned into a better and more enjoyable one if only the 'Children' are older or perhaps a couple instead.\r\ni understand children are going through puberty but the main casts really like to be thecenter of attention within the anime and it can be very \"annoying\" at times. it made think they like to mess around to get themselves killed, though not every single child can be as annoying as them but they really show everything and i am sure there are other people who is also annoyed by this. \\n\\n\r\nanime was good, i cried at the very end and it can be quite emotional at times. If only they increase the amount of blood and gore level it could really spice things up and level up the intensity within the show so people could not get bored easily instead of waiting something to happen.\\n\\n\r\nwatching this anime will make you thick twice about hurting your family and it might strengths the bond between you and your relatives.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Okay, so there really is not much to say about this anime from my point of view. I'm not much for writing reviews but I for whatever reason felt a need to do so this time.\r\nAs stated above, not really much to say. It's a disaster movie. An earthquake takes place and people are displaced, many die, get wounded, ect ect. This young girl and her brother are at a robot exhibit when the earthquake takes place. They meet a woman who decides to help them get home since they live in the same direction. Really, because of how simple it is, it's just likeany disaster movie out there. The thing is, the characters fit perfectly, voice acting was great. The art work was low quality compared to some of the better anime out there, but it's not terrible.\\n\\n\r\nTo do a full review though, I personally consider a disaster movie/anime to be typical... so I generally would not think they would be rated all that high. This i'd put at 8 for story simply because it's typical. The delivery of this story though was very well laid out. This is why it's rated as high as it was.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned it's not great but it works.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nSound was not crisp, but i enjoyed the op/ed themes, and the sound during the anime itself fit the scenario very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the way the characters played out. The development, the side characters. They fit the scenario, completed the story, and the young girl for example developed her personality and attitude about things throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment level really caught me off guard on this. When I started watching it, I had low expectations. I believed it would just be an average anime. The story line played out well and I grew to really like how things took place. Going back to the story, it was very realistic on how things could happen, and even gave you some shocks and emotional play during this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.0\\n\\n\r\nIronically overall i'd rate this as 8.0. It's not TOP of the line, but it was very enjoyable which is obviously the most important part. I hope everyone else enjoys it as much as I did.",

There is no over complication or simplification. It is realistic, and clearly aims to be. It is absolutely character driven. Even if they're annoying at first you will want to see the Mirai, Yuuki and Mari get to their homes safely.\r\nArt - in the first episode or two, I didn't like it, but somehow it grew on me, much like every aspect of this anime. The art doesn't distract negatively or positively fromthe plot and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound - in terms of soundtrack and the general fx relating to the whole earthquake situation we have going on here, again the soundtrack feels right. Your not distracted by it, and emotional moments are enhanced. I'm a working musician, so I do easily get turned off by some anime's if the music is hopelessly unrelated, or too loud so that I listen to the music instead! I didn't like the opening theme, but I find it hard to consider that as related, and I don't think I listened to the ending theme ever, because I had to continue to the next episode as quickly as possible! The voice acting is great. The characters are really brought to life , specifically their vulnerability and their humanity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - this is where its at. The characters themselves are interesting and develop well. You get to see perspectives change in desperate situations and its all done very well. I know this is going to be one of the few series I will remember forever. Apart from the character ... its character!\\n\\n\r\nObviously I enjoyed it. You'd be making a grave error to pass this one over, though I'm sure I had done in the past!",

It is the second anime, which made me want to cry at some moments, that's why i'm reviewing.\r\nIf you like watching about people's life, feelings and so on, you will like this anime. There's nothing artificial or superhuman, everything's made, how it should be.\r\nWhen i see some anime, i usually watch it very fast, rewinding all theway through, but this was on the very little, that i watch from beginning 'till end.\\n\r\nYou just don't want to lose any bit of information, because it's made so outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nWhen i was near 8-10 episode, i just thought, why wouldn't anyone from main heroes die, or from their families. When there was a moment, that Mari thought her family was dead, it was very sad, but in the end everything was alright and i just didn't like it. I had a feeling, that for them, it was just some HARD-MODE trip until the very end, which i found the most thrilling in whole series( and i wouldn't spoil )) )\\n\\n",

            "content": "First of all: only giving 8s to Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is not a prank or joke.\r\nTokyo M8 has a number of strong points, and a number of weaker ones, so this review will actually be component-developed (e.g. \"let's discuss the art!\") rather than pro-con comparing, in order to keep complexity to a minimum and meaningfulness to a maximum.\r\nSo, let's discuss the art! It is widely resonating with the anime: while showing the harshness of the context, it does let a few rays of hope through. You can see actual people with dreams, fears and hopes walk on the gritty textures of concrete blocks and theasphalt. However, this sometimes works against certain climaxes (which I won't mention as not to spoiler anything). The colour palette however does let me a bit down: considering the drawing style, I'd have adapted a more vivid could range, maybe thus further emphasizing the greys. All in all, the art isn't bad at all, but I'd work on the colours. Nothing that a good post-processing can't fix.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is widely enjoyable: the voice actors do get in the part, and perform extremely well. Ambiental sounds are very accurate too, which isn't banale when working with huge events or big machines.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the supposedly strong point of Tokyo M8: Characterization. It should be noted that the authors took a clear stance on this, as they follow the story from the eyes of a 12 years old girl, certainly one of the most psychologically turbulent ages of one's life (usually).\\n\r\nTaken the authors wish in consideration, one surely appreciates the emotional journey of young Mirai and her sidekicks, her little brother Yuuki and delivery-woman Mari. The dialogues are meaningful, well tought of, and carefully phrased. Not once a character is estranged from his role. However, this inherently implies a rather linear developing of the plot, if one can read through the characters.\\n\r\nA funny note: maybe the authors didn't realize, but they quoted a play from ancient rome, the Heautontimor\u00f9menos (big bad ass greek compound for \"The self-punishing\"), where a character says \"Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto\", through the answer Mari gives to the question \"Why are you helping us?\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is widely enjoyable, and may teach us something we didn't know about Japanese disaster handling (which I regard as state of the art in its sector). Look at it, it won't be time wasted!",

            "content": "Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 is enjoyable if you're looking for a very broad representation of what surviving an earthquake is like. It touched on a few aspects like the sometimes-necessity of grouping with strangers, dealing with being a survivor in a situation where others did not survive, and the nagging fear/question of if those you have been separated from have perished. \r\nMy biggest issues were the obvious attempt to dodge a mature audiences rating. To be in the action of an earthquake, deal with death, fear, and pain - you can't hold back on the storytelling aspects. The scenes that were supposed to contain the mostintensity made you cover your eyes and turn away at the last second, just before you started to feel what you needed to. I didn't need to see gore, but there was no sight of blood or realistic wounds on the survivors. You need to feel the intensity to understand the pain, and this story pulled all of it's readied punches. So be prepared to try and experience suffering while in a room of pillows.\\n\\n\r\nThis story had great potential that was scarified for the sake of keeping a low audience rating. If you want to show your kid what an earthquake might be like without absolutely terrifying them, this is a great anime. But for us that wanted the truest experience possible, this anime just isn't it.",

            "content": "I've just completed the series in about 2 days and in all honesty I'm shocked it has received the ratings it has. Anyways, I'll be straight to the point, the anime was just lackluster. On paper, the events that occur during and after a massive 8.0 earthquake in the huge city of Tokyo should be entertaining, correct? Wrong. After the massive earthquake and a number of \"aftershocks\" which I expected to be entertaining, I instead found myself easily  bored and straying away from the anime. I found myself in a continuous cycle of \"dramatic\" events that were predictable and a main character who asrealistic as she is, was just hard to watch. The only saving grace would be the girl's little brother, whose innocence made up for the girl's insolence. Anyways, I somehow made it past 5 episodes and at this point I seriously considered dropping this anime. I was almost halfway done, and even at this point I still felt nothing for the characters and there wasn't a single thread of emotion that kept me to continue the show. I mean, this is supposed to be in the drama genre isn't it? Anyways, I came back on MAL, read a couple of more reviews and decided it would be worth my time to skim past a few more episodes and see if it would regain my attention. By now, the story FINALLY begins to pick up and a series of events begin to occur that I finally start to register. The story continues to pick up and starts to get somewhat interesting and by the end I suppose I can feel somewhat satisfied with the end result. I'm not a huge anime person and I kind of skipped an important scene so I was quite surprised with the ending. I didn't see it coming and after reflecting back, it was quite alluded to. Maybe it was my incoherence during the latter episodes that led to me so surprised, but albeit, I'll give an obligatory 7/10 just for the ending. I'm still overall disappointed with the show, as I was expecting more but I suppose it is the end result that really matters. For me, it was one of those animes which you end up finishing for the sake of it and end up forgetting in a few weeks/months time.",
