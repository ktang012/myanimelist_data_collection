            "content": "Accel World certainly has good quality visuals, dynamic battles and an interesting setting, however past that I cannot think of anything that the show does well. You may disagree with this and my scoring, but please, allow me to justify myself because I intend to do so in full.\r\nLet's cover a good point first though, the art and animation. The art is very consistent, and it does a great job of displaying the interactive world in its diverse and grand state. The animation for the battles is well done, I certainly didn't have any complaints,  there is plenty of movement and excitement, and thebattles enough time to satisfy fans of action. The character designs are on the whole attractive albeit generic, but here we come to our first problem, the protagonist Haruyuki.\\n\\n\r\nI get it, Haru is supposed to be a character with low self esteem, otherwise they wouldn't have brought in Yuki Kaiji to voice him, but the character design they chose to demonstrate this was insulting to the viewers. Looking at him, it shows the designers attempt to force down our throats the fact that this guy is vulnerable and a \"loser\", but at the same time still not be ugly enough to put us off, which is why he is chibi, rendering him completely different from every other character in the show. Why did they feel the need to do this? I get the feeling they think the audience is stupid, and need constant reminders of why this guys has no confidence, they even made his avatar a small pig, just to reiterate this further, because you are that stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me onto Haru himself and the rest of the characters. His best friend Taku is generic, seems to have no romantic chemistry with his girlfriend Chiyu (indeed Haru has more), doesn't add much to the series, but is at least likable. Although her relationship with Haru was odd (i.e. romantic), Chiyu was alright initially, but later in the series she becomes incredibly obnoxious. Kuroyukihime is the most likable character, partly because of her pleasant disposition and good design, but mostly because she got a pass on the second half of the series on account of being on holiday. The side characters lack depth and are completely non descript, the enemies are infuriating (and not for the reasons they should be), and then there is Haru. I'd be amazed if anyone could manage to actually like this guy, unless he is so similar to them disliking him is an act of self loathing. The amount of hatred I built up watching him was one thing, but then the second half of the series happened.\\n\\n\r\nNow obviously I won't spoil anything, but let me just say, the second half of Accel World has some of the most rage inducing episodes you'll come across. Why? The characters start acting in completely illogical and infuriating ways, I had just forgiven Haru for the first half of the series when he just goes downhill in a spectacular fashion, the show starts introducing plot devices that either make little sense or break the setting Accel World itself, and the plot degrades terribly. Indeed, this half was so poor they had to introduce a few episodes of filler in the middle to give you time to calm down. The antagonist has at his disposal seemingly every plot contrivance possibly, and an ability that would never be allowed in any game of that sort.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, a major factor in why I ended up being so angry is due to the blatantly poor plot devices and elements that were poorly thought out and look like ass pulls. It shows laziness in the writing, or a simple lack of ability. I was shocked often throughout the second half at how stupid these things were, and this did not help the infuriating exchanges at all.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in all, the second half was terrible, indeed I'd give it a 1 overall. It did have some nice battles, some fan service and some really spectacular background settings, but when you have to watch this in tandem with the genuinely upsetting nature of the show (where whenever the antagonist is on screen your head will find itself drawn to the oven) the experience is irredeemable. The first half was better, and many will have or will enjoy the first half, but I didn't really like it either. For someone who is the protagonist because they are good at games, Haru really sucks at games, he makes rookie errors and shows a lack of judgement that makes you wonder about his ability. To be fair to him this is simply more usage of plot devices, and I would forgive him for that, but he's an irritating waste of space who only serves to pander to the viewers inadequacies and insecurities. He is not a decent character, he is only there to make people who identify with him feel better for themselves. That is the only reason I can imagine someone liking this show at all to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World is certainly not all bad, it has some decent episodes which always include exciting fighting, some of the side characters are likable, and the world setting was fantastic in terms of aesthetics, however these happy instances were always in between long durations of anger, misery and frustration. Many may enjoy it, I certainly don't speak for all opinions, but for me watching Accel World was an experience devoid of enjoyment or fun, the way this anime is set up makes it inherently dubious, but it is the execution that really cause such grief that I wanted to cause harm to myself. I hope this never gets a sequel.",

            "content": "Hey you! Yeah you, the humongous loser. Are you a humongous loser? Are you convinced your lack of physical attractiveness is the sole factor preventing you from attracting members of the opposite sex? Is your only skill in life that you're really good at a computer game? Well now there's an anime just for you!\r\nOur male lead is a chubby little kid who gets bullied by spikey haired shounen protagonists. He spends the vast majority of the episode whining about his condition, wishing he could just disappear into this video game world. We're clearly supposed to feel sorry for him, so forgive me if thatcomes off as false when he already has two friends, one of whom is a cute girl who makes him lunch. Oh dear nobody loves me, except for my two friends who are trying to care for me, aren't I just the most sympathetic character ever. Also sorry for not feeling particularly sympathetic for fat people when they spend their time running around a virtual sporting environment and then lament the state of the body.\\n\\n\r\nI called Accel World a Shana Clone pre-season, but that isn't strictly true. For my personal definition of the Shana Clone, the main character needs to be a personality-less everylead who has no defining features beyond the fact that they're kind of nice. Being a humongous loser is an improvement on that, albeit only if played correctly. A wimpy character has to develop so nice things can happen to them. The alternative is something like Future Diary or Evangelion, where the main character has something great fall into their lap, but their inability to mature means it actively worsens their lives. There has to be a pull/push to this. Something falling into a characters lap and instantly improving their life at no cost is not good storytelling. It's just wish-fulfillment of the laziest order.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that in mind, let's take a look at what Accel World does. Main character's ability at this obscure computer game results in the prettiest girl in the school dragging him over, caressing the inside of his leg and giving him magical powers. He now has to compete in games where the if he wins, he gains extra points in tests and a whole bunch of other stuff. But ooh, does it come at a cost? Why yes, if he loses, he's no longer part of the game! So, does he get disconnected from the entire network? Err, no. Does he get damaged in the real world, .Hack style? Err, no. Absolutely nothing happens to him whatsoever. The extent of what happens to him is he no longer has bullies after him, he keeps his old friends, and he had a short romantic skirmish with the prettiest girl in school. Oh dear. I feel so sorry for your predicament. Let me play you the worlds smallest violin.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing Accel World appears to struggle with is that it's a story, not a video game. Yes, I'm aware they are playing a video game inside the world. Thanks, the health bars and attack sheets gave that away. You don't need to give me a fucking tutorial for every single part of the fucking match. I'm not playing the game, I don't need to see that sort of stuff. Yet still, for large portions of the episode, our token pretty lady cycled through the rules and regulations on how to attack. Not important stuff that would affect the story. Basic video game rules that we could have figured out for ourselves based on the simplest of visual cues that it gave us anyway. You don't need to adapt a light novel verse by verse. Use the animated medium to show that stuff a book needs to spell out for you to understand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are the same generic noseless shiny people you see all over the place, with the exception of chubby-san. The animation, apart from some neat CG effects in the fight scenes, is bland and forgettable. Heck, if you're going to be this shockingly blatant about wish-fulfillment, you might as well drop in some service, but there's not even any of that. It's an imaginary world for loser males in the real world to drop themselves into, wishing they too had a cute girl come caress their leg because they're really good at a video game. Blergh.",

            "content": "So... the chubby main character is bullied in school and was soon introduced to a new world(video game) and will aim to become the best! How exciting? \r\nAlthough we could summarize this anime this way, but its like saying Code Geass is about a high school kid trying to kill his dad after he got superpowers. There's simply more to it.\r\n\tThe first thing about this anime that really appealed to me was the atmospheric building. Eyes were everywhere, no matter where the main character went, somebody is around him. Since Haruyuki is quite a loser himself, he really hated to be around people, although mostpeople weren't really noticing him. This could be the one of the best way to tell us that our main character is a complete loser in the real world but he is great at video games.\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nMy rating for this anime looks REALLY subtle, there are really no huge up and downs and it's mainly because almost every aspect of this anime has something special about it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is actually quite creative. Although the concept of characters being able to go into different worlds isn't something completely new, the idea of turning this amazing but over-used concept into a basic setting where everyone is capable of doing so due to technology is actually more amusing than I expected. \\n\r\nThe main character has something and someone that he wants to protect and will probably want to become the strongest because of that which is really nothing new, but this overly simple motif actually adds a very inviting feeling to this anime.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAnimetography(cinematography for anime)10/10\\n\r\nThis is one special thing I really want to add to this review! Usually this component simply blends in with the art and sound part of an anime; however, this component of Accel World really appealed to me. \\n\\n\r\nI was really worried about the third episode of this anime. Since I read the manga of Accel World, I knew that there will be really large conversations and almost no fancy special effects involved at all, but the third episode did not disappoint me at all. The first half of the third episode is basically a conversation between Haruyuki-kun and Kuroyukihime sempai. They used \"direct link\" to talk to each other meaning that they do not need to actually speak. This is something only anime could produce the most effectively because a 10 minute conversation will show tons of expressions and the characters and show their expressions in a better way if they did not need to open their mouths all the time. The quick cuts was also an important component that really made this part interesting. The \"camera\"(not that anime really have cameras) is constantly moving and only stops when an important expression is needed to be made, which mean tension also keeps building up. The shadow decreases once the two agrees on their commonality and goes on to discuss about another topic. This conversation ended up being very interesting due to the tension building and the sudden but subtle release of tension. Of course, thanks to the original creator of the light novel, the contents of this conversation was the core of keeping this part interesting. \\n\r\nAnd HAHA! now we know that Accel World is not just another fancy battle + special effect anime that people will skip the boring episodes and just watch the cool fights.\\n\\n\r\nSince the main character of this anime does lots of reasoning throughout the anime, the varieties of positions that the main character is composed in also helped make the story a lot more interesting.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the real world(especially school) seems very bright, even to an uncomfortable extent since school is a very uncomfortable place for Haruyuki. The real world is also drawn with a really subtle feel which contrasts with the world in the Brain Burst program. The Brain Burst program consists of more shadowy places and feels very surreal since all the colors of the real world is altered and everyone in there has a specific color to them. Yet, the Haruyuki finds the accelerated world a more inviting place for him.\\n\r\n( I can BS about this stuff for years but the best thing about the art is still the character arts!)\\n\\n\r\nThe character art for this anime is very nice. Every important character in this anime is drawn in a very detailed fashion, but not detailed enough that characters start to look annoying. The illustration for the two main female characters that have appeared so far is astonishingly good. The cute illustrations of Chiyuri fits her character really well, her avatar in the school network is also very appealing. And Kuroyukihime sempai is just AMAZING! Her illustration, especially her hair and her school network avatar fits her prominent position really well. She is definitely my favorite heroine of spring 2012! \\n\\n\r\nJust the illustration itself for the main character, Haruyuki, looks promisingly negative and I really hope they could make a better illustration for the main character. But let us all ask ourselves one question :\"Is there a better way to illustrate someone who is only good at video games and is a complete loser in reality who also feels really bad about himself than a short and fat kid with stupid-looking eyes?\" My answer is definitely NO\"\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nOP is ok~ it feels quite unique but to me, it does not sound quite great. I loved the ED, it sounds pleasant to the ear and it fits the feeling of the anime really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe background noise+music for this anime is great. The background music changes many times throughout the long conversations between Haruyuki and Kurohime. The background music is definitely what makes the long conversations interesting and even, at times, make simply talking feel very cool and exciting. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are very professional and dedicated. The voice actor for Haruyuki is Kaji Yuki, who is a great voice actor for those \"I dunno what to do next but I need to protect ___\" characters. (Example: Ouma, Shu from Guilty crown, Amata Sora from Aquarion Evol and Issei from High school DXD). Chuyuri's voice actress also fits her cheerful and cute tone very well. What amazes me the most is the voice actress of Kuroyukihime. This is the first anime that this voice actress got a major role in, yet, she fits the character really well and her skills are very dedicated and developed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9.5/10 (lots of this section is already explained in the art and the sound section)\\n\r\nThe motif for the actions of the major characters in Accel World is very simple, they simply hang on to one thing and all they do is for completing that task and usually, this becomes a downside of an anime because it's overly simple. However, in this case, I think this feeling is exactly what this anime needs.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, the character development speed for most of the characters have been very slow since we are still being introduced to some of the important backgrounds of the characters, but the characteristics of all the major characters is already very clear.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nOne episode of Accel World goes by extremely fast, leaving me craving for more. \\n\r\nIn general dedicated humor + romance with beautiful heroines + Great action is just great! But more importantly, I don't think we really need a reason to enjoy an anime. Accel world is one of the most enjoyable anime I've ever watched and that is all the reason I need to give this section a big 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really want to give this anime a 10/10 because I simply love it, but generally speaking, 9/10 is where this anime is at since there are a few things that could be done better.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime mainly to battle or sci-fi lovers, especially the type that loves mental battles. But I also want to recommend Everyone to watch this amazing anime! Believe me, this anime will be enjoyable. I cannot guarantee that everyone will love this anime, but this Accel World will definitely be a waste of 25 minutes.\\n",

            "content": "From the uncreative mind that dumped Sword Art Online into your face comes his other famous light novel series, Accel World. I really don't see how people actually think Reki Kawahara's works are good. They're not. They're merely otaku-pandering wish fulfillment that's all style and no real effort put into them. Although Accel World is better than Sword Art Online, only by a little.\r\nThis 24-episode adaptation by Sunrise is set in the year 2046, where people have wireless access to the internet using NeuroLink, which is basically a computer built into your body. The story follows a junior high school student named Haruyuki Arita, whohas very low self-esteem due to being bullied for his short, chubby, unnatural appearance. He spends his time in playing online games, but one day, he finds that someone beat his high score in a game that only he plays because no one else does.\\n\\n\r\nThat someone is the student council vice-president named Kuroyuki-hime, and she offers Haruyuki an opportunity to \"break his own reality\" and enter a fighting video game where the winner rules the online world and losers get kicked out. It also give him the power to move at a thousand times normal speed.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting premise, I'd say, but there's a problem here: If you've read my Sword Art Online review, then most of the problems there apply here: Good ideas, bad execution. Every single episode left me utterly bored because the characters would rather explain how stuff in the show works rather than actually show it. The only time where I'm paying attention is during the fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the presentation is good. If the art and sound is passable, then there's nothing much I can say. The fighting scenes are pretty cool, despite them feeling a bit too similar to Pokemon battles. The avatar design accompanying the fighting are also well-designed, too. Aside from Haruyuki's, the character designs are fine, nothing special about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are just as flat and boring as the execution itself. I'm beginning to think Kawahara has a knack for writing awful characters...\\n\\n\r\nAnd holy crap, these are bad characters. Haruyuki is damn annoying. First of all, he's a big, fat crybaby who whines about everything and stuffs his face with food. It doesn't help that he's voiced by Yuuki Kaji. If you've entered this after watching Guilty Crown like I have, Haruyuki comes off as a whinier, chubby, buttugly Shu Ouma, right down to sharing the same seiyuu. Nothing againt him; I like him but there are very few roles I can think of where he doesn't voice a character that whines alot. At least Shu gets it together even though it took him longer than it should. At the end of Accel World, I don't think he ever got it together. None of his character improved, if there was any to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNow Kuroyuki-hime I have more to type about because I hate her the most. She's supposedly one of the strongest players, but she makes Haruyuki do her dirty work because she's too lazy to do it herself, which she can. In one scenario, a player whose levels are less than half of her's attempts to blackmail her and even try to kill her in the real world. She does nothing but make Haruyuki deal with him instead of crusing the guy herself. What's really odd is that none of her motivations are really explained. She chose Haruyuki of all peoplem, falls in love with him. Why? ...He's good at video games, I guess. That's pretty much it. She started out interesting but later just became a boring character whose main purpose is to be the series' sex object. Honestly, try to find one piece of Accel World merchandise where she isn't at least half-naked. Speaking of which, in the second half, she's away on a class vacation. We get two episodes of what she's up to, which consists of mostly her in a skimpy black bikini, probably to cater to the horny fanboys.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have Haruyuki's childhood friend Chiyuri. She's the nice, sweet, innocent girl who is in love with Haru that she's dating his best friend. Likely out of jealousy, but never really elaborated, like most things in this series. She was okay at first, but then her feelings tend to contradict each other alot. She's furious at Haru because Kuroyuki-hime's interested in him. If she's so upset about it, then why did she choose to date his friend instead of him. And for some reason, whenever she and Haruyuki have an argument, it usually ends with her getting undressed. Whatever drama that was building up is killed due to unneccesary fanservice and the chick's inability to keep her clothes on. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned, in the second half, Kuroyuki-hime is away, leaving Haruyuki to deal with a schoolmate named Seiji Noumi. Ugh, this little asshole made me drop the series at one point. He is a carbon copy of Sword Art Online's Nobuyuki Sugou in that he has no motivation to his actions and the stuff he does is so stupid, he might as well be wearing a sign saying \"I am the villain.\" He talks big, but doesn't do anything to make him look like a serious threat. He just makes Haruyuki and anyone close to him his own whipping boy. \\n\\n\r\nThose are just the worst characters. I don't mention the rest of the main cast because they're decent for the most part, like Takumu (Haruyuki's friend and Chiyuri's boyfriend). It's just that when you have bad main characters, the rest of the story falls with them.\\n\\n\r\nThere really is nothing good, let alone special about Accel World. It's just a big ball of unused ideas, cliches, poor execution, and bad characters, which leads to a bad series with wasted potential. I don't know what message Kawahara is trying to portray here... \"You'll succeed at life if you're good at video games?\" Uh... no! Video games can be a means to escape reality, but that doesn't eliminate whatever issues in reality that are present. That's not how life works, and anyone who thinks so definitely needs a reality check.",

Clearly, this show can't be worth watching... Yet, despite all these and its other horrendous flaws, it is.\r\nUnlike other shows without redeeming qualities, Accel World does do some things right.\r\nFor one, it's hard not to get absorbed in its well imagined and detailed world. From the basic yet intriguing neuro linkers to the augmented reality they can bring forth, there is a ton of cool ideas in Accel World. Whether you enjoy the romantic idea of directly linking to yourpartner or the concept of speeding up your brains neural activity, the show will leave with lots to think about. It is something Reki Kawahara seems especially good at adding to his stories.\\n\\n\r\nWhat will absolutely destroy the show for you however, is the second half of the show (which is also a common trend with Reki Kawahara's works). It's not per say that its so brutal, more that it is a huge letdown and mostly irrelevant to the overall plot. It also goes on for way too long and feels very segmented.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the poor final half, don't let it turn you off. Accel World is a good show. By no means is it great but it is still imaginatively inspiring. It's also nice to see a digital world portrayed in different way than your typical VR anime and to have real life consequences too. Overall, Accel World is worth watching but be prepared to be disappointed when it fails to maintain the high it does so well to build.",

            "content": "I'm not going to play the game of \u201cis this a good series??\u201d here folks. Accel World is one of those series that will invoke nerdgasm towards those who have a strange taste of the cyber world. This piece of work that Sunrise is presenting here can be described as a wildly entertaining phenomenon that blurs between the lines of fiction and reality.\r\nAccel World (sometimes also known as the Accelerated World) is an anime adapted series written by Reki Kawahara. The author is also involved with the immensely popular ongoing series, Sword Art Online. Both series focuses on futuristic technology beyond our times that involvesplayers fighting in the other world for survival and bragging rights with that sense of technical nerdgasm.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series takes place in 2046 where \u201cneuro-synchronization\u201d, a powerful piece of advanced technology that allows manipulation of different senses. Now, imagine that. In about 34 years, God knows what will happen of our world or even the Accelerated World. Nonetheless, the series stars Haruyuki Arita who has a low social esteem of himself as result of his physical appearance and views of the world. The kid spends his time playing virtual games mindlessly to void of the reality that he wants to rid of. That of course, changes one day when he meets the popular girl of the series, Kuroyukihime. With the beauty style of a butterfly, she forms a bond with Haruyuki-kun and together, they become close friends, partners, and even a couple at times.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the theme of the virtual world as well as some of its key elements are not new to the anime industry. Series such as the .hack franchise, the old school Digimon series, and even movies such as Summer Wars also have some of these elements. Sword Art Online also incorporates some of these themes such as the avatar and duel ideas. Given the fact that Reki Kawahara wrote both stories, it is no surprise at all. He presents to the viewers the line that separates fiction and reality by showing rather than telling. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are many characters involved in the series in several intertwined arcs, the series has four main characters who all become friends for the bonds they share whether be friendship, trust, or romance. As mentioned before, Haruyuki Arita begins the series as a kid with low esteem. He's one of those guys that have little trust in others or even himself. Yet, as the series progresses, so does his character and development. This is especially shown in later episodes where everything he does seems to be for the sake of others. That of course is thanks to the school idol of the series, Kuroyukihime. She is what represents the series as the goddess of paradise, the supreme beauty, and at times, a jealous butterfly wanting more nectar. But what she most desires is the position of level 10 as the strongest king and finding out the truth of the Accelerated World. That and of course, she also becomes the voice of a haughty girl and reason for Haruyuki-kun at times when he needs it the most. Speaking of what Haruyuki-kun needs the most beyond his virtual games that he plays are his friends. Chiyuri (also known as Chiyu) in the series is the cheerful childhood friend of Haruyuki-kun. She represents the light that Haruyuki-kun often looks forward at school and at home when he feels lonely. She is dating Takumu/Taku and both of them shares a bond with Haruyuki that far outreaches the virtual deception.\\n\\n\r\nBeing tagged as a shounen, a viewer can expect a lot of action. In fact, the first episode immediately presents this as Haruyuki-kun is thrown into conflict with adversaries that far outreaches his troubles in the real world. Sunrise mixes in the action well but at times seems to be a bit forced in and predictable. In fact, there are a few times when you watch the series and might think \u201coh, I've seen this stuff before\u201d. In a nutshell, it's Accel World and the action is accelerated so expect those fast paced combat scenes. Additionally, the author makes usage of many technical terms (Brain Burst, Incarnate System, Direct Link) that all fits within the theme of cybernetic technology. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself however has a relative pace. It follows the light novels in the beginning but with some cut out parts as well as some intertwined pacing. In addition, each title represents a technical term with the letters \u201ction\u201d  added on that turns a verb into a noun. It can be served as a symbolism as the action (what might happen in the episode) into an execution (what actually happens). It is also interesting to see not only Haruyuki-kun's development but some of the other characters as well such as Taku. At first, he holds some antagonism towards him but later on treasures him as a dear friend. To take things into different perspective, Kuroyukihime also becomes one of Haruyuki-kun's most treasured friend, partner, mentor, and lover. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall coordination of the story seems to be alright but sometimes seems to be out of pace. For in stance in the latter half of the series, there are some episodes that seems to drag on and on focusing on a single antagonist. That and with an addition of a side story in between seems to throw the viewers off balance a bit and shifting focus. Sunrise and the director of the series (Masakazu Obara) wants to presents this series adapted from the LN but also wants to mix in some additional arcs to spice things up. Although it does work at times, some of the more episodes seems to decelerate with the pacing. In fact, the main story is never technically resolved.  Kuroyukihime didn't reach level 10 and her dream still remains in shadow for now. Furthermore, the finale of Accel World is almost like saying \u201cseries is now over so log off now. Season 2 in the future? Who knows\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual artwork of the series is decent to say the least. The artwork of the avatars as well as the different settings of the Accelerated World ranging from ocean, city, wasteland, to forest are all presented well to portray the fantasy like themes. On the outside world, the school's background is those of a typical school with far superior technology than our own of course. It's not too special though and for this season, it's just decent and fits within the theme of the overall series well.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack on the other hand is coordinated and delivered very well in my estimation. The sound director Yota Tsuruoka (Bakemonogatari, Full Metal Panic, Rozen Maiden, Shigofumi) is known to be a talented individual who has shown many of his skills. His variety of soundtrack whether it's mysterious, comedic, action packed, or eerie, are all incorporated within Accel World. It is no surprise that he was hired for the job with a man of such talent. Accel World has an excellent soundtrack and is like eargasm pleasure to hear the style of its delivery. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP songs of course are also pleasant to hear. The first opening song, \u201cChase the world\" by May'n, has a good rhythm and beat to it. It even coordinates the loner Haruyuki-kun in the beginning and his development over time in the series. That and the montage of some of the potential adversaries in the series also shows the upcoming action. The second opening song \u201cBurst The Gravity\" by ALTIMA  follows a similar style and delivers the music at an accelerated rate, just like it should be. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Accel World is a strange, exciting, accelerated, and engaging experience. The usage and execution of the virtual world theme is nothing new but somehow, it manages to get its point across to the viewers. The characters' development and seeing how they deal with both reality and virtual reception is entertaining to watch. The soundtrack and artwork are something to think about especially the former with the talented Yota Tsuruoka in charge. The series does suffer setbacks such as the resolution of the finale as well as some of the intertwined fillers that seems to throw viewers off focus. Additionally, the series is quite predictable and some of the episodes seems to drag in the later episodes. In the end, Accel World is one of those series that blends fiction and reality. Perhaps in about 30 or so years, we can see what's like when our world is accelerated.",

            "content": "So I heard you hate life. Here's a video game that you can play IN real life! Now do you like life more? Even though you can only stay in the game for 1200 seconds which only amounts to about a second in the real world. Don't worry. McDonalds will be served.\r\nPutting an obese protagonist in a show isn't done much. And I didn't expect shounen shows to have a fat ass, who hates his life, as a main character. Don't get me wrong though, I don't mind how the main character usually looks, but if the personality is this annoying, I'd rather have someonepunch him out and end the show in one episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo our main character hates his life a lot, the reason is unknown because his life is not suicidal bad. He acts alone, unloved, he complains and he cries, he just hopes that he dies. Yet he has two friends, one who makes lunch for him and an \"obviously-soon-to-be-enemy-for-one-battle\" friend. But of course the male friend also cares for this fat ass, emo, main character. His name is \"Haruyuki\" and we're supposed to feel sad for him. Really now. His bitchy complaining and bitching about his life pisses me off. He doesn't have to keep repeating pathetic shit because I got it the first time. He's depressed. I don't feel sorry for him, I want him to die (Just drawings, I'm not like this to real people).\\n\\n\r\nAlright then. So we have a Teenage boy who goes to high school. He has one friend who will obviously go against him for a while and a female friend who he obviously likes. Just your average emo kid who gets bullied here. But then a girl comes along.....\\n\r\nWhat the hell is fuckin wrong with these people? In anime, whenever there's a high school boy with a pathetic personality, a GIRL COMES ALONG AND GIVES HIM POWERS! Yes again. But why? Why must there always be a girl that grants him magical powers? I'm getting pissed off with the amount of \"Magic girl gives boy powa\" shitty anime going around. An example would be Guilty Crown or Sacred Seven.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World takes place in a world where everything's high-tech. So you can log in to some virtual world in your school area and virtually \"chill\". Or you can virtually exercise like our fatty does. Pretty smart ain't he? It's like Wii Fit without the movement, amazing technology. There's also a new way of communicating with someone. So there's this cord. You connect one side of it on your neck, and the other side with the person you want to talk with. Then you send thought-like messages to each other. You can also check their data. Are these people humanoids? Honestly what the fudge. I'm quite sure no one wants robotic parts installed in them, especially ones that others can easily install a virus or a tracking device in. Hell if they can check your memories, then WHAT THE FK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHY WOULD YOU NOT CARE ABOUT THIS STUFF? What if they look at what you do in the bathroom broski.... And also by \"wiring\" with someone, I'll call it \"wiring\" because I forgot what it is, people see you as a couple. It's like kissing but with cords that attach to your neck.\\n\\n\r\nLet's cut this short. Haruyuki met a girl in his virtual tennis game who liked him for beating her score. She then invites him to lunch with her and gives him a magical power. With this magical power he can go into the virtual world of the real world and fight against others. It's like Street Fighter, you just fight someone and win. If you lose, you get kicked from the game and you can't go back because you only had one coin. But if you win, you get experience! YAY! And your main goal is to be the best in the game, even though you will win nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere's too much moe. Moe is fucking disgusting. Character designs are the same as those other ones that reflect light like a mirror does, with their skin. Everyone looks the same, there's nothing new and unique here at all. Expect the big guy. Fight scenes are extremely lame. For some anime with no story at all, and only focused on a virtual game based on fighting, I EXPECT GOOD PEWPEW MATCHES YOU PATHETIC WRITERS!\\n\\n\r\nAccel World is about shiny people playing an Action MMORPG. They will go into detail to explain it to you, even though you're just watching the crappy show, and not playing the game.",

            "content": "Although Accel World is technically outstanding, and the plot devices and story attracted my interest, I couldn't help but find the execution lacking.\r\nThe main character, Haruyuki Arita is like many other shonen protaginists - persistent, strong-willed, and willing to protect the things he cares about. However, that is only a small part of his personality. He is also, bluntly put, a big loser; this is due in large part to him being short, fat, unattractive, and constantly bullied. He even has attractive friends that he constantly compares himself to in order to make himself feel bad. He's pathetic enough to make you cringe at times.Personally, I never really connected to him even though I wouldn't exactly call myself popular and have gone through periods of bullying. This of course is my personal opinion. who knows, maybe you'll connect with him yourself.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the conflicts experienced in the anime thus far have also been extremely shallow; there is always a GOOD side and an EVIL side, black and white, no grey. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT!!!! SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED EPISODE 5\\n\\n\r\nAn example of the aforementioned shallowness occurred in ep 05; the protagonist's best friend turns out to be bad. Yeah, he was evil. After a small fight and some dramatic yelling, he saw the error of his ways and returned to the good side. Very simplistic although I guess it can't be faulted in a shonen.\\n\\n\r\nEND OF SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nThe final issue is the over-dramatization. Although the anime makes a fair attempt at creating serious, somber relationships, situations, and scenes, it goes over the top and it ends up taking itself too seriously which makes things seem cheesy - so much so that I rolled my eyes at many of the more awkward scenes. They're not horrible, just too overpowering.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, This technically proficient shonen series with a decent setting and premise is marred by its awkward cheesiness, and superficial conflicts. I recommend you read the synopsis and watch a few episodes before placing judgement since I understand that it does appeal with many people. If you're reading this and I didn't completely scare you off, give it a shot, you never know.",

            "content": "Accel World was one anime that I honestly did not have many expectations for. The main reason being: before watching the show, I have constantly been hearing about how bad the main character looks, and that his personality is horrible. As such, when I was watching the anime, I made it a point to ignore these comments, and to go in with an open mind, then judge the anime from there. Honestly, I was really surprised by just how good it turned out to be.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nA short summary of Accel World is that this is set in the future, where humans have a device knownas the Neuro Linker which makes a person somewhat like a walking computer. Think of it like the Google Glass being produced. With this device, virtual reality games are made possible, just like in Sword Art Online (same creator). The story revolves around the protagonist, Haruyuki, who is given a game known as Brain Burst, which gives him the power to accelerate. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of Accel World basically introduces us and Haruyuki to the Accelerated World, allowing to understand how this game world works, the consequences surrounding it as well as the conflicts that exists in the game world. This was done well as everything about the game is not given in one sitting, blasting you repeatedly with confusing explanations, but rather, more of a show and tell, explaining the necessary details as they come by.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half, I felt was done masterfully well. The antagonist (whose name I will not reveal) is truly a detestable person of extreme levels, throwing the characters into pits of darkness with almost no way out. This heavily puts the bonds of friendship among our main characters to the test. Will the bonds of friendship prevail, or will it fail? Sometimes when watching such incidents in anime, I like to think, if I were to put myself into their shoes, just what can I do to solve the problem? Is it even possible to solve this problem? The best part of Accel World is that I do not see any possible way out of the problem presented. I was legitimately feeling afraid for the characters, understanding their predicament. This is were I have to give props to the writers, for creating such a well thought out arc for allowing viewers to relate to the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story of Accel World however, is more than just people playing a game. It is more like the story of the human will. How a person\u2019s will to break out of the status quo to change him, grow wings and soar to greater heights that he wants to achieve. Do you want to constantly stay un-contented with life, or do you want to do something about it? The power of the mind is limitless, as long as you believe you can.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite popular belief, the characters in Accel World are actually really good. The most controversial character being Haruyuki, just because he\u2019s chubby and fat. However, I think that it\u2019s his looks that allow people to relate more to him. Because he\u2019s fat and chubby, we can understand him even more. In real life, there\u2019s always that one fat kid that\u2019s being bullied. Obviously he\u2019ll hate life and be sad about not being able to do anything. Basically, negative thoughts, thoughts about despair and weakness flowing through their minds. That\u2019s why throughout Accel World, we can more noticeably see the change in Haruyuki\u2019s character. From that weakling that cannot defend himself, to one that is full of confidence and positive thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nKuroyukihime is portrayed as Haruyuki\u2019s Senpai who can solve any problem, is knowledgeable and strong; basically she\u2019s Haruyuki\u2019s foil, the exact opposite of him. However, despite all of these positive traits mentioned, she\u2019s made human, being given fear, regret and guilt. What makes this great is that as such, both Haruyuki and Kuroyukihime rely on each other, supplementing each other flaws and helping one another to reach greater heights.\\n\\n\r\nTakumu is also yet another well developed character since he\u2019s totally different at the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nChiyu however, is kind of irritating throughout. She\u2019s the kind of character that gets angry over everything, is fussy throughout. Moreover, her role in the second half gets more important which makes her all the more detestable. Of course, it was resolved in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, they are all pretty well developed as well, such as Sky Raker and Scarlet Rain. I\u2019d rather not spoil so that you can enjoy the series to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of the art can really be noticed in the accelerated world maps where everything is super detailed. The Unlimited Acceleration Field is where the art truly shines. They are well designed with plenty of detail.\\n\\n\r\nNot forgetting of course the fighting scenes, which are a joy to watch, especially the sparks when two blades clash with each other.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI started watching Accel World because I heard Altima\u2019s song, Burst the Gravity. When I listened to the other openings and endings, being Chase the World, unfinished and Unite, I just can\u2019t help but listen to them every episode, as much as I want to skip them to get to the episode. They are just so catchy.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World also uses plenty of soundtracks especially during the fight scenes. Each stage has a different soundtrack, and all matches really well. Somehow, the soundtrack reminds me of the soundtracks from the Pokemon games.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Accel World. After every episode I would find myself wanting for more. Each and every episode is entertaining and is important in driving the story yet another step further.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAccel World on the whole is an anime that provides an interesting story that focuses on games, human beliefs and the will to surpass them and friendship bonds. The characters are well fleshed out and developed. Both the art and soundtrack are beautiful to watch and listen to. \\n\\n\r\nPlease note: If you\u2019re planning on passing up on Accel World just because of how fat the main character looks, please, do yourself a favour and just watch it with an open mind. You might just find the hidden gem inside this awesome anime.\\n",

            "content": "Accel World. Wow. \r\nLet me be honest here. I went into this Anime expecting it to be just the usual Shounen, Sci-Fi, Action, Garbage that's marketed toward teenage boys these days. And in a sense; it is. But it does so perfectly.\r\nIn the sense of Story (so far that is) Accel World takes a basic plot premise and massively expands on it. I see no holes, I see no deus ex machina, I see no excuse for the writers to shove in an extra battle or character death or fanservice shot. Everything looks planned out, everything looks structured; it looks like Accel world is headingin the exact direction it needs to go. \\n\\n\r\nIn the terms of it's Genre and it's Target Audience; Accel World succeeds. It plays to it's strengths; it doesn't try to be original; and in the act, it ends up being so. I see Accel World as an example of what we could have got if Guilty Crown or Mirai Nikki weren't train-wrecks. \\n\\n\r\nWon't comment much more now; will leave room for the next few episodes.",

I could say it is similar but different.  \r\nAccel World follows \tArita, Haruyuki, a short fat boy who attends  a prestigious school. But his entire life he is bullied and so he despises his life(reality). He wished the world to be like a video game( Accel World). Accel World is some sort of MMO where your avatar can interact others and play all sort of mini games. Fate changes Haruyuki life as he meets the most popular girl in his school - Kuroyukihime who saves him from histurmoil. She  introduces Burst Limit where he can change his situations in reality but he has to play a variety of games for it to change. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Please keep in mind that I have been viewing only two episodes upon writing this review. As this is still my second written review, I will chose the simplest words and try to keep it short.\r\nAccel World, or Accelerated World. It's an imaginary world of accelerated thought process. In this imaginary world, the time moves 1/1000 faster than the real world. In other word, one second in the real world is 16 minutes 40 seconds in Accelerated World. Cool, huh?\r\nIt has a great and modern concept, and aside from Accelerated World which is only accessible for some 'chosen' persons, every area has a Global Linkor a server where everyone can access using a device. Just imagine your school turning into a big server, and each student will have an avatar representing themselves in that server.\\n\\n\r\nStill a little bit confused? Well I encourage you to try watching it, but allow me to finish my review beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 7\\n\r\nWhy seven? Because it has been only two episodes. It has great concept and great potential, but sadly it's not fully developed (yet). Many unanswered questions and many small details that yet have to be revealed (yet). In the future, I believe the story rating will go up as the story moves on.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nI really liked the art, especially the character designs. Main protagonist are a little bit crappy, but that makes Accel World unique and different from another animes, as main protagonist doesn't need to always have an ideal posture. Kuroyukihime is one of my favorite main heroine in this Spring 2012, aside from Sanka Rea from Sankarea.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nI really liked May'n - Chase the World, and the soundtracks blend pretty well into the atmosphere. Not much to say on this one, but I don't found this section troublesome at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nAs long as I watched animes, there are only a very little few animes that chose the protagonist to be a bullied student. Most of the protagonist is not also chubby, and Accel World offers a good pace of change. The protagonist is introvert, shy, childish, and unreliable. But slowly, good character development appears. Aside from that, the main heroine trait is a classic ojou-sama type and there's nothing too special about her (aside from her character design).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8\\n\r\nI watched this anime for the first two minutes and I'm already HOOKED in it. This show is very enjoyable because it has a great concept and unique character backed up by good art and sound. I really can't wait the third episode, and I guarantee you this is one of the most enjoyable anime on Spring 2012 (second to Fate/Zero S2 in my ranking).\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\nOverall, this show is worth watching. And believe me, you won't be disappointed. Maybe you're a little bit confused about the anime concept upon watching it, but fear not as it would become clear as the show continues.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found my review helpful.",

Rather, there are more things that irked me than things I liked.\r\nLike SAO, the series started off opening a gate of opportunities. A secret world exists where points you earn can be used in real life. But what the heck, let's just turn this to a harem anime instead.\r\nWhere da hell did they come from?\r\nThe one thing that really ticked me off was the main character, the fat guy. I see that they're trying to pull off a uniquecharacter and make one that can't be judged by appearance, but he's just like any other harem lead that's as dense as hell, only ten times as ugly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't very well thought out either. I mean c'mon, 2nd season is ditto to the 2nd arc of sao. The same author used the same plot twice...\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork had its nice touches. It was the only part you COULD enjoy about the anime, but all the battles start to get boring after overusing it. One Michael Bay is enough.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, I think Accel World is a waste of potential. If you haven't watched it yet or you're looking for something to kill time with, then go to YouTube and search up puppies or something, it's more worth it.",

It's clich\u00e9d, it's overdone, it feels like every other battle anime/manga out there.\r\nBut for some reason I can't stop watching it.\r\nOkay, it's not as bad as all that, at least it's a little original, and the superpowers are actually all within a computer game, and it does actually matter in real life for once, which is one of the greatest failings of this type of show. It manages to make itself at least credible, if we make allowances for virtually impossible feats of sci-fi. But thatall seems to be part of the fun.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I find intensely annoying about the show is the fact that all the main characters are pretty standard templates, from the wuss of a main character who actually acquires some courage to the girlfriend with a dark past and the latest story arc's 'for teh evilz' villain. It drags the show down, given that it's main attraction is the awesome fight scenes (which are nicely done most of the time), and having people shout heartfelt but clich\u00e9 nonsense over the top gets irritating quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is not a terrible way to waste 25 minutes every week, but it still leaves me wondering why I watch it. I do enjoy it a fair bit, but I still can't say why, and I doubt it will leave a great lasting impression on me, unless the last few episodes are beyond awesome.",

            "content": "I had the pleasure of wasting my time on such a crap anime; Yipee!! So let me tell you why you should definitely waste your time watching this anime! \r\nThe setting takes place in the future, 2046 where nothing is different from our current time except that there's a real life virtual game called Accel World, which slows down the speed in real life and the person's brain goes into an sped up imagination world. What's the point of the game? Level up and become the strongest.. I think. I honestly have no idea. Anyways, in this game it's sort of like Sword Art Onlineexcept instead of the characters looking like their real life faces, they look like avatars (pig, fairies) and when they fight they become a robot (Dumb shit right here). \\n\\n\r\nFirst, the anime starts off with our fat, dumb, pathetic, cowardly, whiny, and virgin main character whose computer avatar is a fat pig. He gets bullied at school, and nobody likes him except conveniently the most popular girl at the school and the only reason why I even gave this show a 3: Kuroyukihime. Kuroyukihime loves our piggy main character and teaches him about Accel World, leading our heroic pig to join the game. There he gets beat up, loses to everyone, and vows to get strong enough to protect the ones he cares for. Unfortunately for him, he can't do crap and always has to hide behind Kuroyukihime. Sure there are plot twists here and there about who the \"villain\" in the anime is... But it always leads to absolutely nothing. But you know, good ol ecchi is included so for those of you perverted fans, give this robotic no plot version of Sword Art Online a shot!\\n\\n\r\nAccel goes into very deep concepts about the universe. Allow me to list all these genius stuff:\\n\\n\r\n- If you get bullied in real life, run into a game and TRY to level up! That fixes everything!\\n\\n\r\n- If there's a love triangle going on with your best friends, try to keep it going for as long as possible, it will fix everything in life. \\n\\n\r\n- There is only one solution to isolation in real life: make friends online!\\n\\n\r\n- If a popular girl loves you, then try to protect her and lose consistently! According to Accel World, that makes you more charming. Also to make a beautiful girl love you, just get fatter and fatter and whine to her about the 10000 problems you have.\\n\\n\r\n- Most importantly, remember that in the sense of the deep universe that we live in, virtual games decide our fate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTruly a masterpiece, I recommend it to all the people out there that want to waste their time!",

            "content": "I have never been a huge fan of Virtual reality games.. Really, the concept of \"levelling up\" or just numbers on a server never appealed to me. This concept is oddly baffling since thousands and even millions of people spend every second of their life stuck to their computer screens  and never adding anything to their personality or Real life. VR are currently limited to MMORG which has potential to grow into a world to rival the real world raising psychological and societal concerns. Though I steered clear of VR anime until now, but after watching accel world I realised something important,  Whatif some people are only good in VR worlds??...\\n\r\nAccel World is just another VR world where people who have a program called \u201cBurst Link\u201d installed can join and battle it out with their Avatars. The protagonist  Haruyuki is your average student but with the fact that hes short , fat and unpopular, hes bullied and picked on by his seniors . He also gets the distant impression that his only 2 friends pity him in his condition.  So, he closes himself in his VR world and plays the only thing he\u2019s good at which is VR tennis. Enter  kuryokihime , the hottest chick in the school and the one who possesses brain burst, she is unable to beat haruyuki\u2019s  tennis score and had to resort to \u201ccheating\u201d to beat his score. She realises that haru is the only one who can help accomplish her dream in the Accel and subsequently starts liking him\u2026.\\n\r\nSupporting Characters:\\n\r\nThe one thing good about this anime was that the role of the supporting characters was just as good as the main character. These include Haru\u2019s childhood friend\u2019s Chiyuri  and takumu both of whom help him in the accel world. Be it ash roller or \u201csky raker\u201d kurasaki , everyone was responisible for Haayuki\u2019s character development both inside and outside Accelerated world.\\n\\n\r\nMain Character:\\n\r\nThe main character Harayuki-kun is a badass  in the VR world while his alter ego in the real world is completely the opposite. The one thing I liked about Haru and its something even other viewers will also like is his tenacity and the will to never give up. It doesn\u2019t matter whether he facing a Fortified tank which can fire 100 missiles per second topped with 2 cannons or a guy who has a large number of abilities to choose from, etc, Haru never gives up. He tries till the very end even \u201cbursting\u201d through his own limits  to emerge the victor of the day.  Another thing  was that most of the time Haru won was because he used his brain and thought of a plan instead of the usual story where the protagonist gains some new power or so.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and animation:\\n\r\nAnimation is really top-notch and way superior than many anime already out there. The soundtrack is quite amazing as well which includes Accel world\u2019s battle theme, \u201cburst the gravity\u201d,  \u201c-unfinished->\u201d  . Some of the battle scenes are spectacular  and really done well. The art is also of a high calibre.\\n\r\nThing Lacking:\\n\r\nThe only thing I thought that was lacking about Accel world was the absence of a main antagonist.  I do know that kuryokihime wanted to accomplish her dream (no spoilers revealed) but the \u201catagonists\u201d in season 1 were somewhat lacking. Don\u2019t get me wrong,  one of the antagonist Seije Nomi is a complete douchebag and guy you would like to kill over and over again XD but I felt as if season one was more about Haru and his pals disciplined some school kids who were misusing accel world including takumu. So it was more about what Accel world,  how to use it and what to use it for\u2026\\n\r\nThat\u2019s it for my review, I HOPE you guys enjoyed, This was my FIRST EVER , so plz drop me comment on my profile if you liked or even if you didn\u2019t like it, just let me know ^_^\u2026 Also, I don\u2019t rate my anime (plz read my profile)..\\n\r\n But I would like to say that Accel World is a must watch Anime.\\n\\n\r\n(MINOR SPOILER: \\n\\n\r\nThere is small \u201csomething\u201d (try and spot in the anime) that connects Sword Art Online and Accel world. Also there are rumours that the daughter of kirito and Asuna is actually kuryokihime. Although the Author has denied any connection between SAO and Accel world but they were hinting on a joint season between the two in the near episode\u2026 )\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so the 24 episode anime has ended, so how do I find it? Well, I say that the anime's genre, sci-fi, school, action, romance and cyberpunk are all well balanced of the make of this anime. However more emphasis is on the sci-fi, action and cyberpunk genre, since everything revolves around it, the romance and school were merely additives for the anime's entertainment. I can't say that I totally enjoy this anime, but I also can't say that I find this anime boring, co'z to me it is something interesting but not in a level where I would like it totally, so how doI rate this anime???????Here's how:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is more on the plot which is too simple. It is a loser dude meeting a mysterious cool chick and mysterious cool chick feels pity for the loser dude and helps him out by introducing him into a different world and as always  loser dude did good in that world, and there is this mysterious hot chick developing feelings for the loser dude. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt is pretty obvious that studio Sunrise has put a lot of effort into the art, the way the main protagonist the chiquito pureco (it means little piggy boy in Spanish) Haruyuk was drawn really epitomizes your typical loser boy and the way Hime was drawn, her avatar really gives that impression of an elegant mysterious cool chick with something to hide.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that both opening and ending themes are ok. No need for me to say anything else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about them characters is most of them started with the usual enemy turned allies as in the case of Takumu and Yuniko, but there is this very unique thing where Chiyu turned enemy when she sided with Noumi in ep. 19 and then returns to her usual side co'z she only use Noumi to gain points in order to activate her avatar's special ability to help the Chiquito Pureco (Haruyuki). I would have given this part a higher point, but then again the main protagonist - I'm referring to the Chiquito Pureco, Haruyuki pisses me off because of his stupidity and his incisiveness where it looks like that his charcter can't hold it's own without Hime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell, have you ever watch someone who is playing games be it console or on- line, where you enjoy most by watching them players than you  playing the game yourself? Well, it is like that, in fact watching this anime is just like a being a backseat player, in fact the cyberpunk genre is the enjoyment of this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about this anime is that it focuses on a person's escape from reality,  where a person cannot accept the way reality is so he goes to some fantasy land knowing that there he/she is somebody, in this anime's case that fantasy is the augmented reality of \"Accel World\" where people who can't stand the reality of the real world go to in order to become someone else. As much as I hate to say it, this anime conveys that kind  of suggestion. Though, this anime for me is interesting enough for me to follow through, I really don't like the idea of people confining themselves in such alternate reality, so overall my thoughts about this anime is split between liking it and being disgusted by it. So  such rating would be enough for the overall of this anime, BURST LINK!!!!       \\n\\n",

            "content": "-Welcome to my Accelerated Accel World review! I hope you enjoy reading it.-\r\nStory-10\r\nThe story of Accel World revolves around Cartman from South Park, who used JohnTitor2036's time machine (Refer to the first Steins;Gate review) to get to Japan in 2046. In the process, Cartman lost his memories and is accustomed to his new life in future Japan. As expected from his quick learning with foreign languages, he has mastered Japanese. Also, as expected from the Pimpmaster Cartman, In Japan, he managed to score himself 2 hot babes named Kuroyukihime and Chiyuri (who even already has a boyfriend named Taku), who are madly in love withhim and hunger for his Burrito.\\n\\n\r\nIn future Japan, he was bullied by his Senpai upperclassmen, so he found himself often escaping to the world of futuristic virtual reality video games which he is a Pro in them (Again, as expected from Cartman).\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I'm describing here you can already tell that Accel World is the anime masterpiece of the decade. It has Cartman in a futuristic setting, it has hot babes and virtual reality video games. What more can you ask for? Yeah... boobs, I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance in Accel World is extremely well developed. Cartman has fan catering harems who make the viewer envy his position. He's damn lucky. I want to be Cartman.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World's story is a clash of Pros in futuristic virtual reality video games that are aiming to be the best of the best. It's an epic that rivals to none in the Sci-Fi genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation-10\\n\\n\r\nCartman is drawn even better than in South Park. The Art is simply stunning and the animation doesn't have a tiny bit of Quality which we witness alot in anime these days. The team behind the animation is Sunrise who is known for producing eye candy animated shows who make the viewer drool from the hot drawn babes in it. If you want to get a boner, this is the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\\n\r\nIn the Japanese dub, Cartman is voiced by that guy from Guilty Crown and the voice fits him perfectly.\\n\r\nBabe number 1 Kuroyukihime is voiced by a new talent named Misawa Sachika and her voice is so erotic I can't help but to imagine her saying nasty stuff to me.\\n\r\nBabe number 2 Chiyuri is voiced by that girl from K-ON and her voice fits her extremely well.\\n\r\nBabe number 2's boyfriend is voiced by that guy from Tatami Galaxy and his voice is described well in one word: 'COOLU'.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\\n\r\nCartman. Hot babes. A guy with a 'COOLU' voice. The characters are the best ever indeed in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed South Park you would love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Accel World to anyone that wants to enjoy the best story ever, and to devoted fans of South Park. Enjoy!\\n\\n\r\n-Accelerated Accel World review - END.-",

            "content": "A spectacular anime first time Made by Sunrise single handedly(Helped produce Code Geass).Everything was pretty good although I was actually quite shocked that they lack in their creativity of art. Apparently I just didn't like the fact that the main protagonist is so chubby & small which makes me want to mock him. Maybe that was added as a joke? The funniest part was that his avatar is a pig which just happened to knock me out cold. The story starts out pretty average(cliche). Its like this person has special powers & he's an utter dork but the hottest girl in the entire school wantsto talk to you. You join up with that girl & battle evil. That's not exactly what happens but it runs somewhere along the same lines(No creativity there). Although I think the characters are developed pretty well & they tend to have there own unique personality which is considerably notable. I happen to be a lover of games & anime. What makes this anime particularly attractive is the very fact that it revolves around the so called \"Virtual World\" where there are NPC's & humans(MMORPG). I don't really have much to say since I only saw the first 2 episodes & that really isn't enough to analyse the anime & give a good review. But I'd saw the art is really cliche & the idea of a really fat & chubby protagonist isn't really a funny joke & also the fact that his transformation (Dual Avatar) is a copy of iron-man in silver. This anime is a must try from my perspective. The First 2 episodes came out on the same & there really interesting. What attracts me to this anime is how the story is elegantly made. Disregarding the chubby protagonist who thinks he's a knight in shining armor which he is. \\n\r\nGood Points:\\n\r\n-Great Anime\\n\r\n-Quite Amusing to watch & ponder\\n\r\n-The Queen is rather appealing\\n\r\n-Not many animes with this type of genres\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The Main Protagonist is just to Fat\\n\r\n-The Anime story is very common but kind of varies in some ways\\n\r\n-Allot of copies like bike from (ghost rider), Dual Avatar from (Iron Man)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Disregarding all the cons I've said I personally think this anime has allot of potential & I'm most likely sure that you shall be appeased",

            "content": "Accel World certainly has good quality visuals, dynamic battles and an interesting setting, however past that I cannot think of anything that the show does well. You may disagree with this and my scoring, but please, allow me to justify myself because I intend to do so in full.\r\nLet's cover a good point first though, the art and animation. The art is very consistent, and it does a great job of displaying the interactive world in its diverse and grand state. The animation for the battles is well done, I certainly didn't have any complaints,  there is plenty of movement and excitement, and thebattles enough time to satisfy fans of action. The character designs are on the whole attractive albeit generic, but here we come to our first problem, the protagonist Haruyuki.\\n\\n\r\nI get it, Haru is supposed to be a character with low self esteem, otherwise they wouldn't have brought in Yuki Kaiji to voice him, but the character design they chose to demonstrate this was insulting to the viewers. Looking at him, it shows the designers attempt to force down our throats the fact that this guy is vulnerable and a \"loser\", but at the same time still not be ugly enough to put us off, which is why he is chibi, rendering him completely different from every other character in the show. Why did they feel the need to do this? I get the feeling they think the audience is stupid, and need constant reminders of why this guys has no confidence, they even made his avatar a small pig, just to reiterate this further, because you are that stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me onto Haru himself and the rest of the characters. His best friend Taku is generic, seems to have no romantic chemistry with his girlfriend Chiyu (indeed Haru has more), doesn't add much to the series, but is at least likable. Although her relationship with Haru was odd (i.e. romantic), Chiyu was alright initially, but later in the series she becomes incredibly obnoxious. Kuroyukihime is the most likable character, partly because of her pleasant disposition and good design, but mostly because she got a pass on the second half of the series on account of being on holiday. The side characters lack depth and are completely non descript, the enemies are infuriating (and not for the reasons they should be), and then there is Haru. I'd be amazed if anyone could manage to actually like this guy, unless he is so similar to them disliking him is an act of self loathing. The amount of hatred I built up watching him was one thing, but then the second half of the series happened.\\n\\n\r\nNow obviously I won't spoil anything, but let me just say, the second half of Accel World has some of the most rage inducing episodes you'll come across. Why? The characters start acting in completely illogical and infuriating ways, I had just forgiven Haru for the first half of the series when he just goes downhill in a spectacular fashion, the show starts introducing plot devices that either make little sense or break the setting Accel World itself, and the plot degrades terribly. Indeed, this half was so poor they had to introduce a few episodes of filler in the middle to give you time to calm down. The antagonist has at his disposal seemingly every plot contrivance possibly, and an ability that would never be allowed in any game of that sort.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, a major factor in why I ended up being so angry is due to the blatantly poor plot devices and elements that were poorly thought out and look like ass pulls. It shows laziness in the writing, or a simple lack of ability. I was shocked often throughout the second half at how stupid these things were, and this did not help the infuriating exchanges at all.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in all, the second half was terrible, indeed I'd give it a 1 overall. It did have some nice battles, some fan service and some really spectacular background settings, but when you have to watch this in tandem with the genuinely upsetting nature of the show (where whenever the antagonist is on screen your head will find itself drawn to the oven) the experience is irredeemable. The first half was better, and many will have or will enjoy the first half, but I didn't really like it either. For someone who is the protagonist because they are good at games, Haru really sucks at games, he makes rookie errors and shows a lack of judgement that makes you wonder about his ability. To be fair to him this is simply more usage of plot devices, and I would forgive him for that, but he's an irritating waste of space who only serves to pander to the viewers inadequacies and insecurities. He is not a decent character, he is only there to make people who identify with him feel better for themselves. That is the only reason I can imagine someone liking this show at all to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World is certainly not all bad, it has some decent episodes which always include exciting fighting, some of the side characters are likable, and the world setting was fantastic in terms of aesthetics, however these happy instances were always in between long durations of anger, misery and frustration. Many may enjoy it, I certainly don't speak for all opinions, but for me watching Accel World was an experience devoid of enjoyment or fun, the way this anime is set up makes it inherently dubious, but it is the execution that really cause such grief that I wanted to cause harm to myself. I hope this never gets a sequel.",

            "content": "Hey you! Yeah you, the humongous loser. Are you a humongous loser? Are you convinced your lack of physical attractiveness is the sole factor preventing you from attracting members of the opposite sex? Is your only skill in life that you're really good at a computer game? Well now there's an anime just for you!\r\nOur male lead is a chubby little kid who gets bullied by spikey haired shounen protagonists. He spends the vast majority of the episode whining about his condition, wishing he could just disappear into this video game world. We're clearly supposed to feel sorry for him, so forgive me if thatcomes off as false when he already has two friends, one of whom is a cute girl who makes him lunch. Oh dear nobody loves me, except for my two friends who are trying to care for me, aren't I just the most sympathetic character ever. Also sorry for not feeling particularly sympathetic for fat people when they spend their time running around a virtual sporting environment and then lament the state of the body.\\n\\n\r\nI called Accel World a Shana Clone pre-season, but that isn't strictly true. For my personal definition of the Shana Clone, the main character needs to be a personality-less everylead who has no defining features beyond the fact that they're kind of nice. Being a humongous loser is an improvement on that, albeit only if played correctly. A wimpy character has to develop so nice things can happen to them. The alternative is something like Future Diary or Evangelion, where the main character has something great fall into their lap, but their inability to mature means it actively worsens their lives. There has to be a pull/push to this. Something falling into a characters lap and instantly improving their life at no cost is not good storytelling. It's just wish-fulfillment of the laziest order.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that in mind, let's take a look at what Accel World does. Main character's ability at this obscure computer game results in the prettiest girl in the school dragging him over, caressing the inside of his leg and giving him magical powers. He now has to compete in games where the if he wins, he gains extra points in tests and a whole bunch of other stuff. But ooh, does it come at a cost? Why yes, if he loses, he's no longer part of the game! So, does he get disconnected from the entire network? Err, no. Does he get damaged in the real world, .Hack style? Err, no. Absolutely nothing happens to him whatsoever. The extent of what happens to him is he no longer has bullies after him, he keeps his old friends, and he had a short romantic skirmish with the prettiest girl in school. Oh dear. I feel so sorry for your predicament. Let me play you the worlds smallest violin.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing Accel World appears to struggle with is that it's a story, not a video game. Yes, I'm aware they are playing a video game inside the world. Thanks, the health bars and attack sheets gave that away. You don't need to give me a fucking tutorial for every single part of the fucking match. I'm not playing the game, I don't need to see that sort of stuff. Yet still, for large portions of the episode, our token pretty lady cycled through the rules and regulations on how to attack. Not important stuff that would affect the story. Basic video game rules that we could have figured out for ourselves based on the simplest of visual cues that it gave us anyway. You don't need to adapt a light novel verse by verse. Use the animated medium to show that stuff a book needs to spell out for you to understand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are the same generic noseless shiny people you see all over the place, with the exception of chubby-san. The animation, apart from some neat CG effects in the fight scenes, is bland and forgettable. Heck, if you're going to be this shockingly blatant about wish-fulfillment, you might as well drop in some service, but there's not even any of that. It's an imaginary world for loser males in the real world to drop themselves into, wishing they too had a cute girl come caress their leg because they're really good at a video game. Blergh.",

            "content": "So... the chubby main character is bullied in school and was soon introduced to a new world(video game) and will aim to become the best! How exciting? \r\nAlthough we could summarize this anime this way, but its like saying Code Geass is about a high school kid trying to kill his dad after he got superpowers. There's simply more to it.\r\n\tThe first thing about this anime that really appealed to me was the atmospheric building. Eyes were everywhere, no matter where the main character went, somebody is around him. Since Haruyuki is quite a loser himself, he really hated to be around people, although mostpeople weren't really noticing him. This could be the one of the best way to tell us that our main character is a complete loser in the real world but he is great at video games.\\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nMy rating for this anime looks REALLY subtle, there are really no huge up and downs and it's mainly because almost every aspect of this anime has something special about it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is actually quite creative. Although the concept of characters being able to go into different worlds isn't something completely new, the idea of turning this amazing but over-used concept into a basic setting where everyone is capable of doing so due to technology is actually more amusing than I expected. \\n\r\nThe main character has something and someone that he wants to protect and will probably want to become the strongest because of that which is really nothing new, but this overly simple motif actually adds a very inviting feeling to this anime.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAnimetography(cinematography for anime)10/10\\n\r\nThis is one special thing I really want to add to this review! Usually this component simply blends in with the art and sound part of an anime; however, this component of Accel World really appealed to me. \\n\\n\r\nI was really worried about the third episode of this anime. Since I read the manga of Accel World, I knew that there will be really large conversations and almost no fancy special effects involved at all, but the third episode did not disappoint me at all. The first half of the third episode is basically a conversation between Haruyuki-kun and Kuroyukihime sempai. They used \"direct link\" to talk to each other meaning that they do not need to actually speak. This is something only anime could produce the most effectively because a 10 minute conversation will show tons of expressions and the characters and show their expressions in a better way if they did not need to open their mouths all the time. The quick cuts was also an important component that really made this part interesting. The \"camera\"(not that anime really have cameras) is constantly moving and only stops when an important expression is needed to be made, which mean tension also keeps building up. The shadow decreases once the two agrees on their commonality and goes on to discuss about another topic. This conversation ended up being very interesting due to the tension building and the sudden but subtle release of tension. Of course, thanks to the original creator of the light novel, the contents of this conversation was the core of keeping this part interesting. \\n\r\nAnd HAHA! now we know that Accel World is not just another fancy battle + special effect anime that people will skip the boring episodes and just watch the cool fights.\\n\\n\r\nSince the main character of this anime does lots of reasoning throughout the anime, the varieties of positions that the main character is composed in also helped make the story a lot more interesting.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the real world(especially school) seems very bright, even to an uncomfortable extent since school is a very uncomfortable place for Haruyuki. The real world is also drawn with a really subtle feel which contrasts with the world in the Brain Burst program. The Brain Burst program consists of more shadowy places and feels very surreal since all the colors of the real world is altered and everyone in there has a specific color to them. Yet, the Haruyuki finds the accelerated world a more inviting place for him.\\n\r\n( I can BS about this stuff for years but the best thing about the art is still the character arts!)\\n\\n\r\nThe character art for this anime is very nice. Every important character in this anime is drawn in a very detailed fashion, but not detailed enough that characters start to look annoying. The illustration for the two main female characters that have appeared so far is astonishingly good. The cute illustrations of Chiyuri fits her character really well, her avatar in the school network is also very appealing. And Kuroyukihime sempai is just AMAZING! Her illustration, especially her hair and her school network avatar fits her prominent position really well. She is definitely my favorite heroine of spring 2012! \\n\\n\r\nJust the illustration itself for the main character, Haruyuki, looks promisingly negative and I really hope they could make a better illustration for the main character. But let us all ask ourselves one question :\"Is there a better way to illustrate someone who is only good at video games and is a complete loser in reality who also feels really bad about himself than a short and fat kid with stupid-looking eyes?\" My answer is definitely NO\"\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nOP is ok~ it feels quite unique but to me, it does not sound quite great. I loved the ED, it sounds pleasant to the ear and it fits the feeling of the anime really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe background noise+music for this anime is great. The background music changes many times throughout the long conversations between Haruyuki and Kurohime. The background music is definitely what makes the long conversations interesting and even, at times, make simply talking feel very cool and exciting. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are very professional and dedicated. The voice actor for Haruyuki is Kaji Yuki, who is a great voice actor for those \"I dunno what to do next but I need to protect ___\" characters. (Example: Ouma, Shu from Guilty crown, Amata Sora from Aquarion Evol and Issei from High school DXD). Chuyuri's voice actress also fits her cheerful and cute tone very well. What amazes me the most is the voice actress of Kuroyukihime. This is the first anime that this voice actress got a major role in, yet, she fits the character really well and her skills are very dedicated and developed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9.5/10 (lots of this section is already explained in the art and the sound section)\\n\r\nThe motif for the actions of the major characters in Accel World is very simple, they simply hang on to one thing and all they do is for completing that task and usually, this becomes a downside of an anime because it's overly simple. However, in this case, I think this feeling is exactly what this anime needs.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, the character development speed for most of the characters have been very slow since we are still being introduced to some of the important backgrounds of the characters, but the characteristics of all the major characters is already very clear.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nOne episode of Accel World goes by extremely fast, leaving me craving for more. \\n\r\nIn general dedicated humor + romance with beautiful heroines + Great action is just great! But more importantly, I don't think we really need a reason to enjoy an anime. Accel world is one of the most enjoyable anime I've ever watched and that is all the reason I need to give this section a big 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really want to give this anime a 10/10 because I simply love it, but generally speaking, 9/10 is where this anime is at since there are a few things that could be done better.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime mainly to battle or sci-fi lovers, especially the type that loves mental battles. But I also want to recommend Everyone to watch this amazing anime! Believe me, this anime will be enjoyable. I cannot guarantee that everyone will love this anime, but this Accel World will definitely be a waste of 25 minutes.\\n",

            "content": "From the uncreative mind that dumped Sword Art Online into your face comes his other famous light novel series, Accel World. I really don't see how people actually think Reki Kawahara's works are good. They're not. They're merely otaku-pandering wish fulfillment that's all style and no real effort put into them. Although Accel World is better than Sword Art Online, only by a little.\r\nThis 24-episode adaptation by Sunrise is set in the year 2046, where people have wireless access to the internet using NeuroLink, which is basically a computer built into your body. The story follows a junior high school student named Haruyuki Arita, whohas very low self-esteem due to being bullied for his short, chubby, unnatural appearance. He spends his time in playing online games, but one day, he finds that someone beat his high score in a game that only he plays because no one else does.\\n\\n\r\nThat someone is the student council vice-president named Kuroyuki-hime, and she offers Haruyuki an opportunity to \"break his own reality\" and enter a fighting video game where the winner rules the online world and losers get kicked out. It also give him the power to move at a thousand times normal speed.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting premise, I'd say, but there's a problem here: If you've read my Sword Art Online review, then most of the problems there apply here: Good ideas, bad execution. Every single episode left me utterly bored because the characters would rather explain how stuff in the show works rather than actually show it. The only time where I'm paying attention is during the fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the presentation is good. If the art and sound is passable, then there's nothing much I can say. The fighting scenes are pretty cool, despite them feeling a bit too similar to Pokemon battles. The avatar design accompanying the fighting are also well-designed, too. Aside from Haruyuki's, the character designs are fine, nothing special about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are just as flat and boring as the execution itself. I'm beginning to think Kawahara has a knack for writing awful characters...\\n\\n\r\nAnd holy crap, these are bad characters. Haruyuki is damn annoying. First of all, he's a big, fat crybaby who whines about everything and stuffs his face with food. It doesn't help that he's voiced by Yuuki Kaji. If you've entered this after watching Guilty Crown like I have, Haruyuki comes off as a whinier, chubby, buttugly Shu Ouma, right down to sharing the same seiyuu. Nothing againt him; I like him but there are very few roles I can think of where he doesn't voice a character that whines alot. At least Shu gets it together even though it took him longer than it should. At the end of Accel World, I don't think he ever got it together. None of his character improved, if there was any to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNow Kuroyuki-hime I have more to type about because I hate her the most. She's supposedly one of the strongest players, but she makes Haruyuki do her dirty work because she's too lazy to do it herself, which she can. In one scenario, a player whose levels are less than half of her's attempts to blackmail her and even try to kill her in the real world. She does nothing but make Haruyuki deal with him instead of crusing the guy herself. What's really odd is that none of her motivations are really explained. She chose Haruyuki of all peoplem, falls in love with him. Why? ...He's good at video games, I guess. That's pretty much it. She started out interesting but later just became a boring character whose main purpose is to be the series' sex object. Honestly, try to find one piece of Accel World merchandise where she isn't at least half-naked. Speaking of which, in the second half, she's away on a class vacation. We get two episodes of what she's up to, which consists of mostly her in a skimpy black bikini, probably to cater to the horny fanboys.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have Haruyuki's childhood friend Chiyuri. She's the nice, sweet, innocent girl who is in love with Haru that she's dating his best friend. Likely out of jealousy, but never really elaborated, like most things in this series. She was okay at first, but then her feelings tend to contradict each other alot. She's furious at Haru because Kuroyuki-hime's interested in him. If she's so upset about it, then why did she choose to date his friend instead of him. And for some reason, whenever she and Haruyuki have an argument, it usually ends with her getting undressed. Whatever drama that was building up is killed due to unneccesary fanservice and the chick's inability to keep her clothes on. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned, in the second half, Kuroyuki-hime is away, leaving Haruyuki to deal with a schoolmate named Seiji Noumi. Ugh, this little asshole made me drop the series at one point. He is a carbon copy of Sword Art Online's Nobuyuki Sugou in that he has no motivation to his actions and the stuff he does is so stupid, he might as well be wearing a sign saying \"I am the villain.\" He talks big, but doesn't do anything to make him look like a serious threat. He just makes Haruyuki and anyone close to him his own whipping boy. \\n\\n\r\nThose are just the worst characters. I don't mention the rest of the main cast because they're decent for the most part, like Takumu (Haruyuki's friend and Chiyuri's boyfriend). It's just that when you have bad main characters, the rest of the story falls with them.\\n\\n\r\nThere really is nothing good, let alone special about Accel World. It's just a big ball of unused ideas, cliches, poor execution, and bad characters, which leads to a bad series with wasted potential. I don't know what message Kawahara is trying to portray here... \"You'll succeed at life if you're good at video games?\" Uh... no! Video games can be a means to escape reality, but that doesn't eliminate whatever issues in reality that are present. That's not how life works, and anyone who thinks so definitely needs a reality check.",

            "content": "Accel World: The show where the only ridiculously fat-short boy ever(!) finds himself in a harem filled with your typical cliches, fan service and plot. Clearly, this show can't be worth watching... Yet, despite all these and its other horrendous flaws, it is.\r\nUnlike other shows without redeeming qualities, Accel World does do some things right.\r\nFor one, it's hard not to get absorbed in its well imagined and detailed world. From the basic yet intriguing neuro linkers to the augmented reality they can bring forth, there is a ton of cool ideas in Accel World. Whether you enjoy the romantic idea of directly linking to yourpartner or the concept of speeding up your brains neural activity, the show will leave with lots to think about. It is something Reki Kawahara seems especially good at adding to his stories.\\n\\n\r\nWhat will absolutely destroy the show for you however, is the second half of the show (which is also a common trend with Reki Kawahara's works). It's not per say that its so brutal, more that it is a huge letdown and mostly irrelevant to the overall plot. It also goes on for way too long and feels very segmented.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the poor final half, don't let it turn you off. Accel World is a good show. By no means is it great but it is still imaginatively inspiring. It's also nice to see a digital world portrayed in different way than your typical VR anime and to have real life consequences too. Overall, Accel World is worth watching but be prepared to be disappointed when it fails to maintain the high it does so well to build.",

            "content": "I'm not going to play the game of \u201cis this a good series??\u201d here folks. Accel World is one of those series that will invoke nerdgasm towards those who have a strange taste of the cyber world. This piece of work that Sunrise is presenting here can be described as a wildly entertaining phenomenon that blurs between the lines of fiction and reality.\r\nAccel World (sometimes also known as the Accelerated World) is an anime adapted series written by Reki Kawahara. The author is also involved with the immensely popular ongoing series, Sword Art Online. Both series focuses on futuristic technology beyond our times that involvesplayers fighting in the other world for survival and bragging rights with that sense of technical nerdgasm.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series takes place in 2046 where \u201cneuro-synchronization\u201d, a powerful piece of advanced technology that allows manipulation of different senses. Now, imagine that. In about 34 years, God knows what will happen of our world or even the Accelerated World. Nonetheless, the series stars Haruyuki Arita who has a low social esteem of himself as result of his physical appearance and views of the world. The kid spends his time playing virtual games mindlessly to void of the reality that he wants to rid of. That of course, changes one day when he meets the popular girl of the series, Kuroyukihime. With the beauty style of a butterfly, she forms a bond with Haruyuki-kun and together, they become close friends, partners, and even a couple at times.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the theme of the virtual world as well as some of its key elements are not new to the anime industry. Series such as the .hack franchise, the old school Digimon series, and even movies such as Summer Wars also have some of these elements. Sword Art Online also incorporates some of these themes such as the avatar and duel ideas. Given the fact that Reki Kawahara wrote both stories, it is no surprise at all. He presents to the viewers the line that separates fiction and reality by showing rather than telling. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are many characters involved in the series in several intertwined arcs, the series has four main characters who all become friends for the bonds they share whether be friendship, trust, or romance. As mentioned before, Haruyuki Arita begins the series as a kid with low esteem. He's one of those guys that have little trust in others or even himself. Yet, as the series progresses, so does his character and development. This is especially shown in later episodes where everything he does seems to be for the sake of others. That of course is thanks to the school idol of the series, Kuroyukihime. She is what represents the series as the goddess of paradise, the supreme beauty, and at times, a jealous butterfly wanting more nectar. But what she most desires is the position of level 10 as the strongest king and finding out the truth of the Accelerated World. That and of course, she also becomes the voice of a haughty girl and reason for Haruyuki-kun at times when he needs it the most. Speaking of what Haruyuki-kun needs the most beyond his virtual games that he plays are his friends. Chiyuri (also known as Chiyu) in the series is the cheerful childhood friend of Haruyuki-kun. She represents the light that Haruyuki-kun often looks forward at school and at home when he feels lonely. She is dating Takumu/Taku and both of them shares a bond with Haruyuki that far outreaches the virtual deception.\\n\\n\r\nBeing tagged as a shounen, a viewer can expect a lot of action. In fact, the first episode immediately presents this as Haruyuki-kun is thrown into conflict with adversaries that far outreaches his troubles in the real world. Sunrise mixes in the action well but at times seems to be a bit forced in and predictable. In fact, there are a few times when you watch the series and might think \u201coh, I've seen this stuff before\u201d. In a nutshell, it's Accel World and the action is accelerated so expect those fast paced combat scenes. Additionally, the author makes usage of many technical terms (Brain Burst, Incarnate System, Direct Link) that all fits within the theme of cybernetic technology. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself however has a relative pace. It follows the light novels in the beginning but with some cut out parts as well as some intertwined pacing. In addition, each title represents a technical term with the letters \u201ction\u201d  added on that turns a verb into a noun. It can be served as a symbolism as the action (what might happen in the episode) into an execution (what actually happens). It is also interesting to see not only Haruyuki-kun's development but some of the other characters as well such as Taku. At first, he holds some antagonism towards him but later on treasures him as a dear friend. To take things into different perspective, Kuroyukihime also becomes one of Haruyuki-kun's most treasured friend, partner, mentor, and lover. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall coordination of the story seems to be alright but sometimes seems to be out of pace. For in stance in the latter half of the series, there are some episodes that seems to drag on and on focusing on a single antagonist. That and with an addition of a side story in between seems to throw the viewers off balance a bit and shifting focus. Sunrise and the director of the series (Masakazu Obara) wants to presents this series adapted from the LN but also wants to mix in some additional arcs to spice things up. Although it does work at times, some of the more episodes seems to decelerate with the pacing. In fact, the main story is never technically resolved.  Kuroyukihime didn't reach level 10 and her dream still remains in shadow for now. Furthermore, the finale of Accel World is almost like saying \u201cseries is now over so log off now. Season 2 in the future? Who knows\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual artwork of the series is decent to say the least. The artwork of the avatars as well as the different settings of the Accelerated World ranging from ocean, city, wasteland, to forest are all presented well to portray the fantasy like themes. On the outside world, the school's background is those of a typical school with far superior technology than our own of course. It's not too special though and for this season, it's just decent and fits within the theme of the overall series well.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack on the other hand is coordinated and delivered very well in my estimation. The sound director Yota Tsuruoka (Bakemonogatari, Full Metal Panic, Rozen Maiden, Shigofumi) is known to be a talented individual who has shown many of his skills. His variety of soundtrack whether it's mysterious, comedic, action packed, or eerie, are all incorporated within Accel World. It is no surprise that he was hired for the job with a man of such talent. Accel World has an excellent soundtrack and is like eargasm pleasure to hear the style of its delivery. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP songs of course are also pleasant to hear. The first opening song, \u201cChase the world\" by May'n, has a good rhythm and beat to it. It even coordinates the loner Haruyuki-kun in the beginning and his development over time in the series. That and the montage of some of the potential adversaries in the series also shows the upcoming action. The second opening song \u201cBurst The Gravity\" by ALTIMA  follows a similar style and delivers the music at an accelerated rate, just like it should be. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Accel World is a strange, exciting, accelerated, and engaging experience. The usage and execution of the virtual world theme is nothing new but somehow, it manages to get its point across to the viewers. The characters' development and seeing how they deal with both reality and virtual reception is entertaining to watch. The soundtrack and artwork are something to think about especially the former with the talented Yota Tsuruoka in charge. The series does suffer setbacks such as the resolution of the finale as well as some of the intertwined fillers that seems to throw viewers off focus. Additionally, the series is quite predictable and some of the episodes seems to drag in the later episodes. In the end, Accel World is one of those series that blends fiction and reality. Perhaps in about 30 or so years, we can see what's like when our world is accelerated.",

            "content": "So I heard you hate life. Here's a video game that you can play IN real life! Now do you like life more? Even though you can only stay in the game for 1200 seconds which only amounts to about a second in the real world. Don't worry. McDonalds will be served.\r\nPutting an obese protagonist in a show isn't done much. And I didn't expect shounen shows to have a fat ass, who hates his life, as a main character. Don't get me wrong though, I don't mind how the main character usually looks, but if the personality is this annoying, I'd rather have someonepunch him out and end the show in one episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo our main character hates his life a lot, the reason is unknown because his life is not suicidal bad. He acts alone, unloved, he complains and he cries, he just hopes that he dies. Yet he has two friends, one who makes lunch for him and an \"obviously-soon-to-be-enemy-for-one-battle\" friend. But of course the male friend also cares for this fat ass, emo, main character. His name is \"Haruyuki\" and we're supposed to feel sad for him. Really now. His bitchy complaining and bitching about his life pisses me off. He doesn't have to keep repeating pathetic shit because I got it the first time. He's depressed. I don't feel sorry for him, I want him to die (Just drawings, I'm not like this to real people).\\n\\n\r\nAlright then. So we have a Teenage boy who goes to high school. He has one friend who will obviously go against him for a while and a female friend who he obviously likes. Just your average emo kid who gets bullied here. But then a girl comes along.....\\n\r\nWhat the hell is fuckin wrong with these people? In anime, whenever there's a high school boy with a pathetic personality, a GIRL COMES ALONG AND GIVES HIM POWERS! Yes again. But why? Why must there always be a girl that grants him magical powers? I'm getting pissed off with the amount of \"Magic girl gives boy powa\" shitty anime going around. An example would be Guilty Crown or Sacred Seven.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World takes place in a world where everything's high-tech. So you can log in to some virtual world in your school area and virtually \"chill\". Or you can virtually exercise like our fatty does. Pretty smart ain't he? It's like Wii Fit without the movement, amazing technology. There's also a new way of communicating with someone. So there's this cord. You connect one side of it on your neck, and the other side with the person you want to talk with. Then you send thought-like messages to each other. You can also check their data. Are these people humanoids? Honestly what the fudge. I'm quite sure no one wants robotic parts installed in them, especially ones that others can easily install a virus or a tracking device in. Hell if they can check your memories, then WHAT THE FK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHY WOULD YOU NOT CARE ABOUT THIS STUFF? What if they look at what you do in the bathroom broski.... And also by \"wiring\" with someone, I'll call it \"wiring\" because I forgot what it is, people see you as a couple. It's like kissing but with cords that attach to your neck.\\n\\n\r\nLet's cut this short. Haruyuki met a girl in his virtual tennis game who liked him for beating her score. She then invites him to lunch with her and gives him a magical power. With this magical power he can go into the virtual world of the real world and fight against others. It's like Street Fighter, you just fight someone and win. If you lose, you get kicked from the game and you can't go back because you only had one coin. But if you win, you get experience! YAY! And your main goal is to be the best in the game, even though you will win nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere's too much moe. Moe is fucking disgusting. Character designs are the same as those other ones that reflect light like a mirror does, with their skin. Everyone looks the same, there's nothing new and unique here at all. Expect the big guy. Fight scenes are extremely lame. For some anime with no story at all, and only focused on a virtual game based on fighting, I EXPECT GOOD PEWPEW MATCHES YOU PATHETIC WRITERS!\\n\\n\r\nAccel World is about shiny people playing an Action MMORPG. They will go into detail to explain it to you, even though you're just watching the crappy show, and not playing the game.",

            "content": "Although Accel World is technically outstanding, and the plot devices and story attracted my interest, I couldn't help but find the execution lacking.\r\nThe main character, Haruyuki Arita is like many other shonen protaginists - persistent, strong-willed, and willing to protect the things he cares about. However, that is only a small part of his personality. He is also, bluntly put, a big loser; this is due in large part to him being short, fat, unattractive, and constantly bullied. He even has attractive friends that he constantly compares himself to in order to make himself feel bad. He's pathetic enough to make you cringe at times.Personally, I never really connected to him even though I wouldn't exactly call myself popular and have gone through periods of bullying. This of course is my personal opinion. who knows, maybe you'll connect with him yourself.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the conflicts experienced in the anime thus far have also been extremely shallow; there is always a GOOD side and an EVIL side, black and white, no grey. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT!!!! SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED EPISODE 5\\n\\n\r\nAn example of the aforementioned shallowness occurred in ep 05; the protagonist's best friend turns out to be bad. Yeah, he was evil. After a small fight and some dramatic yelling, he saw the error of his ways and returned to the good side. Very simplistic although I guess it can't be faulted in a shonen.\\n\\n\r\nEND OF SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nThe final issue is the over-dramatization. Although the anime makes a fair attempt at creating serious, somber relationships, situations, and scenes, it goes over the top and it ends up taking itself too seriously which makes things seem cheesy - so much so that I rolled my eyes at many of the more awkward scenes. They're not horrible, just too overpowering.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, This technically proficient shonen series with a decent setting and premise is marred by its awkward cheesiness, and superficial conflicts. I recommend you read the synopsis and watch a few episodes before placing judgement since I understand that it does appeal with many people. If you're reading this and I didn't completely scare you off, give it a shot, you never know.",

            "content": "Accel World was one anime that I honestly did not have many expectations for. The main reason being: before watching the show, I have constantly been hearing about how bad the main character looks, and that his personality is horrible. As such, when I was watching the anime, I made it a point to ignore these comments, and to go in with an open mind, then judge the anime from there. Honestly, I was really surprised by just how good it turned out to be.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nA short summary of Accel World is that this is set in the future, where humans have a device knownas the Neuro Linker which makes a person somewhat like a walking computer. Think of it like the Google Glass being produced. With this device, virtual reality games are made possible, just like in Sword Art Online (same creator). The story revolves around the protagonist, Haruyuki, who is given a game known as Brain Burst, which gives him the power to accelerate. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of Accel World basically introduces us and Haruyuki to the Accelerated World, allowing to understand how this game world works, the consequences surrounding it as well as the conflicts that exists in the game world. This was done well as everything about the game is not given in one sitting, blasting you repeatedly with confusing explanations, but rather, more of a show and tell, explaining the necessary details as they come by.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half, I felt was done masterfully well. The antagonist (whose name I will not reveal) is truly a detestable person of extreme levels, throwing the characters into pits of darkness with almost no way out. This heavily puts the bonds of friendship among our main characters to the test. Will the bonds of friendship prevail, or will it fail? Sometimes when watching such incidents in anime, I like to think, if I were to put myself into their shoes, just what can I do to solve the problem? Is it even possible to solve this problem? The best part of Accel World is that I do not see any possible way out of the problem presented. I was legitimately feeling afraid for the characters, understanding their predicament. This is were I have to give props to the writers, for creating such a well thought out arc for allowing viewers to relate to the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story of Accel World however, is more than just people playing a game. It is more like the story of the human will. How a person\u2019s will to break out of the status quo to change him, grow wings and soar to greater heights that he wants to achieve. Do you want to constantly stay un-contented with life, or do you want to do something about it? The power of the mind is limitless, as long as you believe you can.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite popular belief, the characters in Accel World are actually really good. The most controversial character being Haruyuki, just because he\u2019s chubby and fat. However, I think that it\u2019s his looks that allow people to relate more to him. Because he\u2019s fat and chubby, we can understand him even more. In real life, there\u2019s always that one fat kid that\u2019s being bullied. Obviously he\u2019ll hate life and be sad about not being able to do anything. Basically, negative thoughts, thoughts about despair and weakness flowing through their minds. That\u2019s why throughout Accel World, we can more noticeably see the change in Haruyuki\u2019s character. From that weakling that cannot defend himself, to one that is full of confidence and positive thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nKuroyukihime is portrayed as Haruyuki\u2019s Senpai who can solve any problem, is knowledgeable and strong; basically she\u2019s Haruyuki\u2019s foil, the exact opposite of him. However, despite all of these positive traits mentioned, she\u2019s made human, being given fear, regret and guilt. What makes this great is that as such, both Haruyuki and Kuroyukihime rely on each other, supplementing each other flaws and helping one another to reach greater heights.\\n\\n\r\nTakumu is also yet another well developed character since he\u2019s totally different at the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nChiyu however, is kind of irritating throughout. She\u2019s the kind of character that gets angry over everything, is fussy throughout. Moreover, her role in the second half gets more important which makes her all the more detestable. Of course, it was resolved in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, they are all pretty well developed as well, such as Sky Raker and Scarlet Rain. I\u2019d rather not spoil so that you can enjoy the series to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of the art can really be noticed in the accelerated world maps where everything is super detailed. The Unlimited Acceleration Field is where the art truly shines. They are well designed with plenty of detail.\\n\\n\r\nNot forgetting of course the fighting scenes, which are a joy to watch, especially the sparks when two blades clash with each other.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI started watching Accel World because I heard Altima\u2019s song, Burst the Gravity. When I listened to the other openings and endings, being Chase the World, unfinished and Unite, I just can\u2019t help but listen to them every episode, as much as I want to skip them to get to the episode. They are just so catchy.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World also uses plenty of soundtracks especially during the fight scenes. Each stage has a different soundtrack, and all matches really well. Somehow, the soundtrack reminds me of the soundtracks from the Pokemon games.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Accel World. After every episode I would find myself wanting for more. Each and every episode is entertaining and is important in driving the story yet another step further.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAccel World on the whole is an anime that provides an interesting story that focuses on games, human beliefs and the will to surpass them and friendship bonds. The characters are well fleshed out and developed. Both the art and soundtrack are beautiful to watch and listen to. \\n\\n\r\nPlease note: If you\u2019re planning on passing up on Accel World just because of how fat the main character looks, please, do yourself a favour and just watch it with an open mind. You might just find the hidden gem inside this awesome anime.\\n",

I went into this Anime expecting it to be just the usual Shounen, Sci-Fi, Action, Garbage that's marketed toward teenage boys these days. And in a sense; it is. But it does so perfectly.\r\nIn the sense of Story (so far that is) Accel World takes a basic plot premise and massively expands on it. I see no holes, I see no deus ex machina, I see no excuse for the writers to shove in an extra battle or character death or fanservice shot. Everything looks planned out, everything looks structured; it looks like Accel world is headingin the exact direction it needs to go. \\n\\n\r\nIn the terms of it's Genre and it's Target Audience; Accel World succeeds. It plays to it's strengths; it doesn't try to be original; and in the act, it ends up being so. I see Accel World as an example of what we could have got if Guilty Crown or Mirai Nikki weren't train-wrecks. \\n\\n\r\nWon't comment much more now; will leave room for the next few episodes.",

            "content": "Please keep in mind that I have been viewing only two episodes upon writing this review. As this is still my second written review, I will chose the simplest words and try to keep it short.\r\nAccel World, or Accelerated World. It's an imaginary world of accelerated thought process. In this imaginary world, the time moves 1/1000 faster than the real world. In other word, one second in the real world is 16 minutes 40 seconds in Accelerated World. Cool, huh?\r\nIt has a great and modern concept, and aside from Accelerated World which is only accessible for some 'chosen' persons, every area has a Global Linkor a server where everyone can access using a device. Just imagine your school turning into a big server, and each student will have an avatar representing themselves in that server.\\n\\n\r\nStill a little bit confused? Well I encourage you to try watching it, but allow me to finish my review beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 7\\n\r\nWhy seven? Because it has been only two episodes. It has great concept and great potential, but sadly it's not fully developed (yet). Many unanswered questions and many small details that yet have to be revealed (yet). In the future, I believe the story rating will go up as the story moves on.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nI really liked the art, especially the character designs. Main protagonist are a little bit crappy, but that makes Accel World unique and different from another animes, as main protagonist doesn't need to always have an ideal posture. Kuroyukihime is one of my favorite main heroine in this Spring 2012, aside from Sanka Rea from Sankarea.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nI really liked May'n - Chase the World, and the soundtracks blend pretty well into the atmosphere. Not much to say on this one, but I don't found this section troublesome at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nAs long as I watched animes, there are only a very little few animes that chose the protagonist to be a bullied student. Most of the protagonist is not also chubby, and Accel World offers a good pace of change. The protagonist is introvert, shy, childish, and unreliable. But slowly, good character development appears. Aside from that, the main heroine trait is a classic ojou-sama type and there's nothing too special about her (aside from her character design).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8\\n\r\nI watched this anime for the first two minutes and I'm already HOOKED in it. This show is very enjoyable because it has a great concept and unique character backed up by good art and sound. I really can't wait the third episode, and I guarantee you this is one of the most enjoyable anime on Spring 2012 (second to Fate/Zero S2 in my ranking).\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\nOverall, this show is worth watching. And believe me, you won't be disappointed. Maybe you're a little bit confused about the anime concept upon watching it, but fear not as it would become clear as the show continues.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found my review helpful.",

Rather, there are more things that irked me than things I liked.\r\nLike SAO, the series started off opening a gate of opportunities. A secret world exists where points you earn can be used in real life. But what the heck, let's just turn this to a harem anime instead.\r\nWhere da hell did they come from?\r\nThe one thing that really ticked me off was the main character, the fat guy. I see that they're trying to pull off a uniquecharacter and make one that can't be judged by appearance, but he's just like any other harem lead that's as dense as hell, only ten times as ugly.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't very well thought out either. I mean c'mon, 2nd season is ditto to the 2nd arc of sao. The same author used the same plot twice...\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork had its nice touches. It was the only part you COULD enjoy about the anime, but all the battles start to get boring after overusing it. One Michael Bay is enough.\\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, I think Accel World is a waste of potential.

It's clich\u00e9d, it's overdone, it feels like every other battle anime/manga out there.\r\nBut for some reason I can't stop watching it.\r\nOkay, it's not as bad as all that, at least it's a little original, and the superpowers are actually all within a computer game, and it does actually matter in real life for once, which is one of the greatest failings of this type of show. It manages to make itself at least credible, if we make allowances for virtually impossible feats of sci-fi. But thatall seems to be part of the fun.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I find intensely annoying about the show is the fact that all the main characters are pretty standard templates, from the wuss of a main character who actually acquires some courage to the girlfriend with a dark past and the latest story arc's 'for teh evilz' villain. It drags the show down, given that it's main attraction is the awesome fight scenes (which are nicely done most of the time), and having people shout heartfelt but clich\u00e9 nonsense over the top gets irritating quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is not a terrible way to waste 25 minutes every week, but it still leaves me wondering why I watch it. I do enjoy it a fair bit, but I still can't say why, and I doubt it will leave a great lasting impression on me, unless the last few episodes are beyond awesome.",

            "content": "I had the pleasure of wasting my time on such a crap anime; Yipee!! So let me tell you why you should definitely waste your time watching this anime! \r\nThe setting takes place in the future, 2046 where nothing is different from our current time except that there's a real life virtual game called Accel World, which slows down the speed in real life and the person's brain goes into an sped up imagination world. What's the point of the game? Level up and become the strongest.. I think. I honestly have no idea. Anyways, in this game it's sort of like Sword Art Onlineexcept instead of the characters looking like their real life faces, they look like avatars (pig, fairies) and when they fight they become a robot (Dumb shit right here). \\n\\n\r\nFirst, the anime starts off with our fat, dumb, pathetic, cowardly, whiny, and virgin main character whose computer avatar is a fat pig. He gets bullied at school, and nobody likes him except conveniently the most popular girl at the school and the only reason why I even gave this show a 3: Kuroyukihime. Kuroyukihime loves our piggy main character and teaches him about Accel World, leading our heroic pig to join the game. There he gets beat up, loses to everyone, and vows to get strong enough to protect the ones he cares for. Unfortunately for him, he can't do crap and always has to hide behind Kuroyukihime. Sure there are plot twists here and there about who the \"villain\" in the anime is... But it always leads to absolutely nothing. But you know, good ol ecchi is included so for those of you perverted fans, give this robotic no plot version of Sword Art Online a shot!\\n\\n\r\nAccel goes into very deep concepts about the universe. Allow me to list all these genius stuff:\\n\\n\r\n- If you get bullied in real life, run into a game and TRY to level up! That fixes everything!\\n\\n\r\n- If there's a love triangle going on with your best friends, try to keep it going for as long as possible, it will fix everything in life. \\n\\n\r\n- There is only one solution to isolation in real life: make friends online!\\n\\n\r\n- If a popular girl loves you, then try to protect her and lose consistently! According to Accel World, that makes you more charming. Also to make a beautiful girl love you, just get fatter and fatter and whine to her about the 10000 problems you have.\\n\\n\r\n- Most importantly, remember that in the sense of the deep universe that we live in, virtual games decide our fate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTruly a masterpiece, I recommend it to all the people out there that want to waste their time!",

            "content": "I have never been a huge fan of Virtual reality games.. Really, the concept of \"levelling up\" or just numbers on a server never appealed to me. This concept is oddly baffling since thousands and even millions of people spend every second of their life stuck to their computer screens  and never adding anything to their personality or Real life. VR are currently limited to MMORG which has potential to grow into a world to rival the real world raising psychological and societal concerns. Though I steered clear of VR anime until now, but after watching accel world I realised something important,  Whatif some people are only good in VR worlds??...\\n\r\nAccel World is just another VR world where people who have a program called \u201cBurst Link\u201d installed can join and battle it out with their Avatars. The protagonist  Haruyuki is your average student but with the fact that hes short , fat and unpopular, hes bullied and picked on by his seniors . He also gets the distant impression that his only 2 friends pity him in his condition.  So, he closes himself in his VR world and plays the only thing he\u2019s good at which is VR tennis. Enter  kuryokihime , the hottest chick in the school and the one who possesses brain burst, she is unable to beat haruyuki\u2019s  tennis score and had to resort to \u201ccheating\u201d to beat his score. She realises that haru is the only one who can help accomplish her dream in the Accel and subsequently starts liking him\u2026.\\n\r\nSupporting Characters:\\n\r\nThe one thing good about this anime was that the role of the supporting characters was just as good as the main character. These include Haru\u2019s childhood friend\u2019s Chiyuri  and takumu both of whom help him in the accel world. Be it ash roller or \u201csky raker\u201d kurasaki , everyone was responisible for Haayuki\u2019s character development both inside and outside Accelerated world.\\n\\n\r\nMain Character:\\n\r\nThe main character Harayuki-kun is a badass  in the VR world while his alter ego in the real world is completely the opposite. The one thing I liked about Haru and its something even other viewers will also like is his tenacity and the will to never give up. It doesn\u2019t matter whether he facing a Fortified tank which can fire 100 missiles per second topped with 2 cannons or a guy who has a large number of abilities to choose from, etc, Haru never gives up. He tries till the very end even \u201cbursting\u201d through his own limits  to emerge the victor of the day.  Another thing  was that most of the time Haru won was because he used his brain and thought of a plan instead of the usual story where the protagonist gains some new power or so.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and animation:\\n\r\nAnimation is really top-notch and way superior than many anime already out there. The soundtrack is quite amazing as well which includes Accel world\u2019s battle theme, \u201cburst the gravity\u201d,  \u201c-unfinished->\u201d  . Some of the battle scenes are spectacular  and really done well. The art is also of a high calibre.\\n\r\nThing Lacking:\\n\r\nThe only thing I thought that was lacking about Accel world was the absence of a main antagonist.  I do know that kuryokihime wanted to accomplish her dream (no spoilers revealed) but the \u201catagonists\u201d in season 1 were somewhat lacking. Don\u2019t get me wrong,  one of the antagonist Seije Nomi is a complete douchebag and guy you would like to kill over and over again XD but I felt as if season one was more about Haru and his pals disciplined some school kids who were misusing accel world including takumu. So it was more about what Accel world,  how to use it and what to use it for\u2026\\n\r\nThat\u2019s it for my review, I HOPE you guys enjoyed, This was my FIRST EVER , so plz drop me comment on my profile if you liked or even if you didn\u2019t like it, just let me know ^_^\u2026 Also, I don\u2019t rate my anime (plz read my profile)..\\n\r\n But I would like to say that Accel World is a must watch Anime.\\n\\n\r\n(MINOR SPOILER: \\n\\n\r\nThere is small \u201csomething\u201d (try and spot in the anime) that connects Sword Art Online and Accel world. Also there are rumours that the daughter of kirito and Asuna is actually kuryokihime. Although the Author has denied any connection between SAO and Accel world but they were hinting on a joint season between the two in the near episode\u2026 )\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so the 24 episode anime has ended, so how do I find it? Well, I say that the anime's genre, sci-fi, school, action, romance and cyberpunk are all well balanced of the make of this anime. However more emphasis is on the sci-fi, action and cyberpunk genre, since everything revolves around it, the romance and school were merely additives for the anime's entertainment. I can't say that I totally enjoy this anime, but I also can't say that I find this anime boring, co'z to me it is something interesting but not in a level where I would like it totally, so how doI rate this anime???????Here's how:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is more on the plot which is too simple. It is a loser dude meeting a mysterious cool chick and mysterious cool chick feels pity for the loser dude and helps him out by introducing him into a different world and as always  loser dude did good in that world, and there is this mysterious hot chick developing feelings for the loser dude. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt is pretty obvious that studio Sunrise has put a lot of effort into the art, the way the main protagonist the chiquito pureco (it means little piggy boy in Spanish) Haruyuk was drawn really epitomizes your typical loser boy and the way Hime was drawn, her avatar really gives that impression of an elegant mysterious cool chick with something to hide.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that both opening and ending themes are ok. No need for me to say anything else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about them characters is most of them started with the usual enemy turned allies as in the case of Takumu and Yuniko, but there is this very unique thing where Chiyu turned enemy when she sided with Noumi in ep. 19 and then returns to her usual side co'z she only use Noumi to gain points in order to activate her avatar's special ability to help the Chiquito Pureco (Haruyuki). I would have given this part a higher point, but then again the main protagonist - I'm referring to the Chiquito Pureco, Haruyuki pisses me off because of his stupidity and his incisiveness where it looks like that his charcter can't hold it's own without Hime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell, have you ever watch someone who is playing games be it console or on- line, where you enjoy most by watching them players than you  playing the game yourself? Well, it is like that, in fact watching this anime is just like a being a backseat player, in fact the cyberpunk genre is the enjoyment of this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about this anime is that it focuses on a person's escape from reality,  where a person cannot accept the way reality is so he goes to some fantasy land knowing that there he/she is somebody, in this anime's case that fantasy is the augmented reality of \"Accel World\" where people who can't stand the reality of the real world go to in order to become someone else. As much as I hate to say it, this anime conveys that kind  of suggestion. Though, this anime for me is interesting enough for me to follow through, I really don't like the idea of people confining themselves in such alternate reality, so overall my thoughts about this anime is split between liking it and being disgusted by it. So  such rating would be enough for the overall of this anime, BURST LINK!!!!       \\n\\n",

            "content": "-Welcome to my Accelerated Accel World review! I hope you enjoy reading it.-\r\nStory-10\r\nThe story of Accel World revolves around Cartman from South Park, who used JohnTitor2036's time machine (Refer to the first Steins;Gate review) to get to Japan in 2046. In the process, Cartman lost his memories and is accustomed to his new life in future Japan. As expected from his quick learning with foreign languages, he has mastered Japanese. Also, as expected from the Pimpmaster Cartman, In Japan, he managed to score himself 2 hot babes named Kuroyukihime and Chiyuri (who even already has a boyfriend named Taku), who are madly in love withhim and hunger for his Burrito.\\n\\n\r\nIn future Japan, he was bullied by his Senpai upperclassmen, so he found himself often escaping to the world of futuristic virtual reality video games which he is a Pro in them (Again, as expected from Cartman).\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I'm describing here you can already tell that Accel World is the anime masterpiece of the decade. It has Cartman in a futuristic setting, it has hot babes and virtual reality video games. What more can you ask for? Yeah... boobs, I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance in Accel World is extremely well developed. Cartman has fan catering harems who make the viewer envy his position. He's damn lucky. I want to be Cartman.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World's story is a clash of Pros in futuristic virtual reality video games that are aiming to be the best of the best. It's an epic that rivals to none in the Sci-Fi genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation-10\\n\\n\r\nCartman is drawn even better than in South Park. The Art is simply stunning and the animation doesn't have a tiny bit of Quality which we witness alot in anime these days. The team behind the animation is Sunrise who is known for producing eye candy animated shows who make the viewer drool from the hot drawn babes in it. If you want to get a boner, this is the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\\n\r\nIn the Japanese dub, Cartman is voiced by that guy from Guilty Crown and the voice fits him perfectly.\\n\r\nBabe number 1 Kuroyukihime is voiced by a new talent named Misawa Sachika and her voice is so erotic I can't help but to imagine her saying nasty stuff to me.\\n\r\nBabe number 2 Chiyuri is voiced by that girl from K-ON and her voice fits her extremely well.\\n\r\nBabe number 2's boyfriend is voiced by that guy from Tatami Galaxy and his voice is described well in one word: 'COOLU'.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\\n\r\nCartman. Hot babes. A guy with a 'COOLU' voice. The characters are the best ever indeed in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed South Park you would love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Accel World to anyone that wants to enjoy the best story ever, and to devoted fans of South Park. Enjoy!\\n\\n\r\n-Accelerated Accel World review - END.-",

            "content": "A spectacular anime first time Made by Sunrise single handedly(Helped produce Code Geass).Everything was pretty good although I was actually quite shocked that they lack in their creativity of art. Apparently I just didn't like the fact that the main protagonist is so chubby & small which makes me want to mock him. Maybe that was added as a joke? The funniest part was that his avatar is a pig which just happened to knock me out cold. The story starts out pretty average(cliche). Its like this person has special powers & he's an utter dork but the hottest girl in the entire school wantsto talk to you. You join up with that girl & battle evil. That's not exactly what happens but it runs somewhere along the same lines(No creativity there). Although I think the characters are developed pretty well & they tend to have there own unique personality which is considerably notable. I happen to be a lover of games & anime. What makes this anime particularly attractive is the very fact that it revolves around the so called \"Virtual World\" where there are NPC's & humans(MMORPG). I don't really have much to say since I only saw the first 2 episodes & that really isn't enough to analyse the anime & give a good review. But I'd saw the art is really cliche & the idea of a really fat & chubby protagonist isn't really a funny joke & also the fact that his transformation (Dual Avatar) is a copy of iron-man in silver. This anime is a must try from my perspective. The First 2 episodes came out on the same & there really interesting. What attracts me to this anime is how the story is elegantly made. Disregarding the chubby protagonist who thinks he's a knight in shining armor which he is. \\n\r\nGood Points:\\n\r\n-Great Anime\\n\r\n-Quite Amusing to watch & ponder\\n\r\n-The Queen is rather appealing\\n\r\n-Not many animes with this type of genres\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The Main Protagonist is just to Fat\\n\r\n-The Anime story is very common but kind of varies in some ways\\n\r\n-Allot of copies like bike from (ghost rider), Dual Avatar from (Iron Man)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Disregarding all the cons I've said I personally think this anime has allot of potential & I'm most likely sure that you shall be appeased",

So hard to get out of my head.\r\nI picked up this anime after watching Sword Art Online (I'll never quite get used to the oddness of that name) and after mostly enjoying the series, decided to check out one recommended item, namely Accel World - written by the same author.\r\nI enjoyed SAO for the premise.  Having played way too many computer games myself, I thought the idea of being trapped in one was really interesting, and it was that, and the fantastic animation, which kept me watching.  And at the end I was mostly satisfied.\r\nSo I started on AccelWorld.  And immediately I noticed the difference in the level of engagement.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World focuses on a little round kid who gets bullied a lot at school, but is trying his best to survive.  And then this real life online \"game\" comes along which completely changes Haru's life forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I enjoyed Accel World so much was the main character.  Haru.  The little fat kid.  Now, when we watch anime, read books or manga, view films, we want to suspend reality to a degree and imagine ourselves in another world, being another person.  I get why people don't like the series, because the last person you'd want to imagine yourself as is Haruyuki.  He's short.  He's really fat.  He's not even clever.  He's more or less a coward.  But that's what I loved about it, because it was more real.  It was so easy to imagine.  And watching Haru's journey, and his inner life blossom, his character develop as he is forced to overcome himself and his own demons, was thoroughly enjoyable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is competent.  The fight scenes are mighty enjoyable.  The \"world\" and the \"system\" that Haru finds himself is really well thought out and clever.  The series has its odd \"what the...?\" moments, but at the end I found myself wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nThe tropes of Shounen anime are all here.  There is levelling up.  There is the villain, the good guys, the romance, etc...\\n\\n\r\nBut what turns around all the stereotypes is the main protagonist.  It's this that I think will make Accel World the more memorable of animes and make it stand out above others.  While I'll probably forget SAO after a few months, I'll be keeping an eye out for a season 2 of Accel World in the hope I can keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "So I feel like writing a review for this Anime because I saw some very negative reviews and I think this show is really worth trying. I have watched many .. so many Anime and its rare for me to really like a show. And I am not a fan of skc-fi..... and above all computer game sci - fi like hack sign for example (even tho hack sign was okay) \r\nI haven't seen the whole anime yet, since only 5 episodes are out and if it just gets better I think its going to turn out to be a masterpiece, if it gets worseits going  to be a \"very good anime\".... \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story evolves around the main protagonist which is a fat small highschooler, who gets bullied. His self-worth is depended on computer games so he really rocks in one of those. The story is set in the future where everything works through computers. \\n\r\nBut there is one computer system which surpasses all which came before it is highly developed and can influence space and time. This computer system unknown to the public is called Accel Word. Because of the main protagonist's computer playing skills he gets recruited by one of Accel Worlds's kings (actually a queen)\\n\r\nSo the story begins the main protagonist sees many aspect of  his life changed; his relations, his self-perception and his love- life. With one of Accel world's kings/queens he turns everything up side down and tries to discover Accel world's secrets.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI like the Art because the main protagonist for example is not your typical good-looking hero. And the heroine is also beautiful. The art itself is not outstanding but it is nice and has some really nice pictures to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is good and fits the story but there hasn't been a remarkable piece of music yet\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe story itself sounds interesting, even tho I prefer non sci -fi. So what makes this Anime outstanding is the character development/interaction and the development of their relations. The main protagonist is a guy who is in a constant crises and turns away from his friends and is full of self-hatred. The heroine is an ambitious pro-gamer who finds herself in love. All in all the characters are well-defined and their emotional reactions are very good. Even tho sometimes maybe it might be too much. (Too much whining, but if that happens the main heroine steps in and balances everything out, so for me it was always the right amount of whining)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFor me it was and is a big enjoyment. Because I like the mixture of the characters and the development of the relationships. But that wouldn't be enough for me for a great enjoyment: what makes it a great enjoyment and what is the icing on the cake is that it has epic battles and unexpected turn of events.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI recommend this story.",

            "content": "I've seen good shows. I've seen bad shows. Never have I ever wanted to stop watching a show before until I watched this. I get it, people like this show. Heck, I even liked SAO. But this show is something else.  I haven't seen the whole show, so I don't think it's entirely fair to give critique it at the moment, however I just need to get this off of my chest.\r\nFirstly, let's discuss the characters. Haru, our main protagoinst, is meant to be someone we identify with and empathize. His entire design is based around garnering sympathy from the audience. He's even introducedin a way where I as a viewer looked at him and thought \"Man, I feel sorry for this guy\". This all goes out the window within the next 5 minutes. Haru, our main character, is not likeable at all. How am I supposed to get behind our main character when he is so fucking unlikeable. Sure he's treated poorly and I feel pity for him but how can any of the characters truly like such a toxic personality. \"Oh, I get bullied everyday therefore I get to treat my friends poorly\". He also complains about wanting to get away from the real world, claiming it to be a \"living hell\". HOW?! You have two good friends, both of which have been trying to help you for who knows how long, and you've been refusing. They offered to do something about it. \"OH I GET BULLIED, LIFE IS A LIVING HELL. FUCK YOU CHIYUU AND TAKU\". The whole pawn speech he gave to Kuroyukihime was the last straw for me. I don't care how people treat you. You don't make stupid assumptions and use that as justification to say terrible things to those close to youChiyuu and Taku aren't much in the way of characters but at least they're likeable. The most likeable character in the show, Kuroyukihime, falls for Haru, leaving me to ask the question \"...Why?\". I suppose it's because he's the main character, therefore he has to have all the girls wanting his D. He's not really nice to people. He's not handsome. He doesn't even have a nice personality. Like come on, fall in love with someone worthy PLEASE...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't bad, however the fight scenes lack any real impact to me. Haru's artstyle is also somewhat jarring, being drawn in a \"chibi\" style while everyone else is designed more \"shonen\" style.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I'm experiencing right now is almost nil. I feel physically ill trying to continue to watch this show. However, before I make a fair complete judgement on this show I will continue to watch it. It may get better but from what I've watched so far, its not good. I can't get behind a show if the main character is just so unlikeable.",

A guy goes into a video game, and becomes super epic. Eventually he gets the love of his life and goes through hardships and blah blah blah.\r\nArt(8): The art was very nice in my opinion and I just loved the action scenes and how everysingle character looked (Yes, even Haruyuki).\\n\\n\r\nSound(9): I loved the OST in this anime, there were songs that made you feel sad or some battle music where you just want to start fighting someone, thinking you can do anything you want, although chances are you can't :P.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10): Now this is probably what made me incredibly biased towards this anime and believed it was the best and that is character development, and well the characters personality in general, My favorite being Kuroyukihime, The fact that she invited someone like Haruyuki into such an important game, and actually liking him, has made my jealous meter go way past the limit. After this anime ended I basically took an entire month, where I didn't watch anime at all, through the month I kept on thinking about how amazing Kuroyukihime is and how jealous of I am of Haruyuki, this is probably strange to get this attached but damn dude.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10): Loved it, enjoyed it, want more of it... GIVE ME MORE OF IT NOWWWW!\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10): It was a good anime one of my favorites I absolutely loved it, but unless you get as attached like I did to this anime, then it might not be all that great, but I can never see another perspective of this anime again.\\n\\n",

And here's my thought about this anime\r\nStory :\r\nSeriously, it's so much waste a technology setting in a story to be just used as a THE BEST IN THE GAME story. With that kind of technology, the story is just explore a fat kids playing game to escape the reality that he's so sucks in real life, and then a popular beautiful girl appear and give him a new game and changes his life...\r\nArt :\r\nI don't really mind about the art of an anime, as long as thestory is enjoyable, the art doesn't really matter for me. The art of this anime is fine I guess, but to be honest I actually dislike the loli-like art style. The animation is fine too, so I guess there's no serious problem in this part.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nI don't really mind about this too actually. There's no special about the voice acting or the OP/ED theme IMO. But I guess everything is just fine here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nThis is the part that I really hate beside the story concept. There's no interesting about character in this anime. The main dude, Haruyuki, is a bad combination of a standard shounen, whiny, and a bad appearance unattractive guy. He's always bullied by your-standard-bad-delinquent-dudes in his school and trying to be an emo forever alone guy even though he has 2 close friends that cares about him. There's no actual purpose in his life and nothing special about him except he's so good at a game in the virtual net. About the main girl, Kuroyukihime, she's just another delusional popular beautiful girl that you can easily find in many pointless harem animes. She give our main dude Haruyuki a new game and 'purpose' in his life. The other characters is just your cliche average supporting and bad guy characters, there's nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nI don't really enjoyed it. When I watched the first few minutes, I'm pretty impressed about the technology used in the story. I expected something new and different in Accel World like brain-hacking, spying, dangerous bug, data virus, but it turned out to be just a standard fighting to be the best in the game with popular beautiful chick as partner in the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nOne lesson that I got from this series, If you're just a normal unattractive guy with no special talent in so many subjects, just keep playing game to escape from your horrible reality, until a beautiful popular girl come and bring you some drastic good changes in your life.\\n\r\nOverall, there's nothing special about Accel World, but I guess this series is okay for teenage casual anime watchers.",

Hey, but this means there won't be any major spoilers! Let's cut to the point.\r\nSo, we have a not generic looking light novel guy. Small, fat, not a typical handsome one. This could be a pro, this could've meant this broke out of the teen light novel clich\u00e9, BUT! The protagonist we have is a pathetic piece of garbage. Most other characters ignores or bullies him. He has no dignity, self respect, confidence. Evenhis VR avatar is a piglet. There is not a single thing likable or relatable in him. He has no qualities we could point out and say, yes, he is at least a good guy and gets bullied solely because his appearance. He don't even try to break out of this position or make himself better. All he do is whining. A lot. Almost constantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters: He has only two childhood friend. A cute girl and her boyfriend. And later it turns out, the girl is attracted to him... for plot reasons and the guy hates him, because the girl likes him. Well, at least this is understandable. And the school's alpha bitch, who once approaches and fall in love with him, because he is... good at video games, and vice versa our hero, because she doesn't deal with him like the pest he is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in one sentence: A1 Pictures at its finest.\\n\r\nThe exact same characters and backgrounds like in almost every series of this company. Appealing at first sight, but don't give it a closer look.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point this point, I couldn't continue watching. This anime went full retard.",

I was surprised that I even managed to finish watching this anime, since there wasn't many good things about this anime. The only reason why I even watched it because it is by the same people that made SAO and apparently they were similar. I was sick of the conversations that Haru andKuroyukhime always had, they were always like this:\\n\r\nHaru: I'm scared, senpai\\n\r\nKuroyukhime: Don't worry, you will do fine\\n\r\nHaru: Really?\\n\r\nKuroyukhime: Yes, believe in yourself\\n\r\nHaru: But I'm still too scared.\\n\\n\r\nYou get the idea, whatever came out of Haru's mouth was him complaining/ crying about every little thing. I was like come on, stop acting like a 2 year old who just lost his favourite toy.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-unique story line, I guess\\n\r\n-art is decent\\n\r\n-openings are good\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-possibly the worst main character in anime history\\n\r\n-the series was going no where\\n\r\n-hard to watch because of everyone being so optimistic of everything\\n\r\n-only one character that was decent and that was the main girl character. But seriously, why in the world will you fall for that pessimistic retard?\\n\\n\r\nHopefully you will enjoy watching this anime unlike me who hated it. If I were you i probably won't waste my time on this anime.",

            "content": "Alright, I first want to start of by saying this is my first review I have ever done, so please bare with me, I'll be using the general layout to help me with the foundations of my review.\r\nIf you've ever been into a situation where you don't want to school based on how you perceive yourself? Well, I can say for myself that I very much related to the concept of this anime, lacking the hot girls as friends.\r\nI would say for people to read a review with a reasonable rating, I've been seeing 3/10's and even lower, it's only been three episodes, can onereally slap on something so demeaning when it first starts out? \\n\\n\r\nStory : 8\\n\r\nThe story takes place in 2046, a very interesting date to start off an Anime, as we usually have things from earlier dates, or from the next century, but I won't drag on about that. The main character is Haruyuki Arita, a young boy suffering from bullying and harassment from other students, he finds relief in the net, which allows him to release his anger on one of his favourite video games. One faithful day, one of the most popular students in class notices his ideals and goal sets to always want to be the best in  any video game he plays. After awhile she gives him the opportunity to take part in a project called \"Brain Burst\", basically a fighting game.\\n\\n\r\nI really do love these ideas for animes, as they're interesting and allow for a decently paced, not too fast, not too slow. The main character is chubby? we never see this actually executed in a serious anime, as most people always want their main characters to be perfect, completely biased without a doubt. \\n\\n\r\nI for one relate to the story, maybe that's why I feel it's right to give such a work a good score like this? maybe because in the three episodes(10 chapters in manga, I believe) that this will for sure have potential to impact how things are done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nThe art style is quite amazing, for a lack of a better word. Everything is nice and crisp, yet smooth. Landscapes are very nicely done and scenery. Character design is pretty much at the standards and surpassing the standards in some aspects. Many people I found comment on the main characters design, but think about it like this, would he really look better with different eyes given his body structure? maybe some comment on this as chibi'esque, but I don't believe it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\r\nThe opening and endings for this anime are very nice, and really blend well with the anime itself as a whole, I enjoy listening to the soundtracks occasionally. The opening, sang by the amazing May'n, was amazingly done, the soundtracks played during the anime episodes themselves to give off the mood of the situations really were done nicely, I had no problems what so ever sound wise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nBefore I begin on this aspect, I would like to say, this is very early, so we really can't comment on character development and such via different scenarios/situations. The main character seems to be a bit of a wimp, due to how he's treated and such, so that gives off his overall personality, that he really has problems expanding out to other people, maybe he's embarrassed about his weight? People have to think outside of the box before they comment on this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nKuroyukihime, in my opinion is a bit of a generic Moe, persuades Haruyuki to help her in her little ulterior motive to figure out the secrets and such. Though I consider her one of my favourites, mainly because she can fall in love with a guy like Haruyuki, now that takes a lot of work, and we barely see it, yeah I know, UNREALISTIC ATTRACTIONS, but come on guys, think outside the box, maybe she likes him for how he acts in regards to wanting to be the best?\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed this anime, how it is so far, after finishing episode 3, I quickly headed over to MF to read the manga of it to where it is currently. I'm already hooked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8.5\\n\\n\r\nA must watch, take my word on it, please don't follow on with the complete biased reviews, I enjoyed this, because I enjoyed it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Accel World is a bit of a mixed bag for me to deliver my thoughts on. Taking place in a future where augmented reality is the norm with the younger generation, a bullied outcast named Haruyuki meets up with popular girl Kuroyukihime who gives him a game called Brain Burst that allows him and others with the game to have the ability to accelerate their capabilities in the real world and face off against other users of the game to compete for Burst Points that allow one use of their abilities.\r\nWhile the series does have some interesting elements to it via its battle system andthe means that characters have to \"accelerate\" in the real world, the series suffers in the fact that it doesn't really feel like anything too serious outside of the game is at stake for anyone and the motivations that others have for being in the game feel kind of petty, reducing any major tension that could engage me to care for anything besides the show's Brain Burst elements. Sure, there's mention and showing of characters dealing with bullying, neglect or family abuse that the series says is what manifests a user's ability to use Brain Burst. But the motivations for many characters are no different from if you wanted to play an MMORPG with getting stronger, having allies to form alliances, gaining new skills/items or purposely breaking the rules for your personal gain; which I've already experienced from the Dot Hack franchise which at least had some major stakes to it during its first generation run with Sign thanks to the nasty effects any human player getting struck with Data Drain would experience in the real world. Here in Accel World though, the worst thing that would happen is all your Burst Points are lost and you lose accessibility to Brain Burst as no one is at risk of dying in real life (except for one instance at the start of the series unrelated to the game).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit of a mixed bunch. The major ones have character archetypes that they fulfill, yet get enough fleshing out to have you care for them in many instances, though Haruyuki's occasional angst fits would have me tempted to want to whack him. The majority of the secondary ones, on the other hand, don't get so much and are mostly reduced to archetypes. The anime does introduce a faction of villains and a plot element that affects Haruyuki's experience in Brain Burst for the second half of the series. But with this being based on an ongoing light novel series, these plot developments are left unresolved.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Accel World's regular character designs are on the plain side following the standard anime style and Haruyuki's design is of particular note as he is drawn differently from other characters and seems more like he'd be suited for a slapstick anime comedy with his appearance, with scenery in the real world being detailed and vivid. However, the visual highlight of the series comes from its incorporation of its augmented reality elements as characters are able to visit richly detailed virtual worlds with avatars they personally create (Kuroyukihime's avatar sticking out prominently here in both design and its fan servicy attire). The Brain Burst game renders the characters in armored avatars with differing abilities that are slick-looking and make for the best animated parts of the series when characters battle one another with a great amount of fluid movement involved in battles.\\n\\n\r\nWhile sporting an interesting premise that I did enjoy some aspects of, Accel World does still stick firmly in conventional territory to a great extent, the stakes for the game felt rather underwhelming compared to other titles I've seen that featured MMORPGs or other technologies employed in any sort of serious plot and it ends inconclusively. You might get more enjoyment out of the series if you are a recent anime fan that hasn't picked up on many of the common cliches employed for anime as I have. But otherwise, I'm mostly indifferent to Accel World.",

If you are not too overly bothered about looks, read on and let me explain why this anime is so heavily underrated. \r\nThe first comments I see about this anime is about how people dropped it after seeing the main character, generic comments are usually \"no way a beautiful girl could fall for him\", \"I can't stand watching such an ugly protagonist\", \"he whines about his life too much\". However if youlook past that and look a little deeper, you will realize that this anime is very touching.\\n\\n\r\nPut your self in the shoes of the MC, you are ridiculously short and fat (these people exist in the real world), you are bullied everyday by people who you know have better lives than you and you comfort eat because of it. The only girl you ever truly felt a connection to was stolen by your best friend, and you didn't even bother fighting for her because you knew you didn't even stand a chance against a normal, good looking guy who is athletic and smart. And yet, you still try to be happy for the both of them. His only escape from reality is playing squash by himself in a virtual world in the male toilets...now tell me that he has no excuse to be moaning and winging about his life. \\n\\n\r\nThen all of a sudden, you are introduced to a world where the pain and suffering you have endured for so many years is manifested into strength and courage. This beautiful girl falls in love with you for those aforementioned qualities and for once you feel loved in the world. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is the premise of Accel World, a story about how a guy finds happiness using the years of pain anf suffering he has endured, people often compare this to SAO for obvious reasons, but the tropes and meanings could not be more different. In fact if you are looking for type of anime where a good looking guy gets the good looking girl, go watch/read SAO.",

            "content": "TL;DR Charlotte\u2019s Web. The Anime Ver.\r\nPigs can fly. And that\u2019s a fact. Imagine the pig Wilbur saved by an intelligent spider, Charlotte who then turns his life around. OH WAIT, this sounds familiar. It\u2019s Accel World! (Spiders and Butterflies >.>, semantics).\r\nOf course, it\u2019s not really as simple as E.B. White\u2019s children\u2019s novel, and to be perfectly clear, besides the spider saving the pig, it\u2019s not even remotely similar. Read on for los detailes.\r\n*Jump straight to Character if you have gripes about Haruyuki. So do I, and I even like this sow (o.O) *show.\r\nSTORY : 8\r\nThe premise of this series is surprisingly original. It\u2019s the futureand everyone\u2019s hooked up a global network. Via the implant in their neck, they can literally access the world wide \u201cinternet\u201d and browse numerous files, play numerous games, and otherwise engage themselves in a VR (virtual reality) world. Complete with custom designed avatars and all the works. Our story here is about chubby Haruyuki who suffers from chronic depression and low self esteem. He\u2019s the only chubby/physically unattractive person in the entire school of standard pretty anime stereotypes. This gives him cause to mope. (I would too, imagine going to a high school for supermodels.) However, in the virtual world, (in which his avatar is a pig), he meets the school\u2019s beautiful idol, Kuroyukihime who introduces him to Brain Burst.\\n\r\nBasically an amped up fighting game that can reveal the secrets of the human psyche if you can clear it.\\n\r\nNot too much pressure for our main man is it? Well, the story, after introducing this unique setting, proceeds much along the lines of a typical shonen story. Boy then develops secret power, beats people, loses to people, becomes inspired, suffers personal losses, deals with demons, grows stronger, romance buds, etc. All well and good. And well done, and which is why this story works in terms of entertainment. It\u2019s just fun. And fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8.5\\n\r\nOk, ok, people gripe about Haruyuki, and its legitimately justified. He\u2019s basically Ouma Shu, but chubbier and has even lower self esteem, if possible. He thoroughly comes off as an uninspiring main character if you take him at face value. Besides the nascent fact that anime is not littered with fat MCs, much of entertainment serves to provide us with images of pretty leads and perfect (looks wise) people. Haruyuki is different, and normally you would say that\u2019s great. Break the stereotype and all. But because he has Ouma Shu\u2019s personality (at least at first), he\u2019s thoroughly unlikeable. \\n\r\nBut wait, I still like him, and that\u2019s because the second character, Kuroyukihime, his foil, his love interest, and the most interesting character in the show, allows the Haruyuki to move beyond an initial type of pathetic-ness. \\n\r\nKuroyukihime is everything Haruyuki is not, yet she\u2019s attracted to him, don\u2019t worry this is not  a spoiler. Why, and why is what Haruyuki asks himself. But there is no doubt, in the scenes between the two of them, there is undeniable chemistry and inspiration. I\u2019ve not seen such chemistry between leads in a while. The romance between the two is always underscored by Kuroyukihime\u2019s intensity and dry wit, it\u2019s fun to watch. (And to bring it back to the Charlotte\u2019s Web analogy, Kuroyukihime\u2019s avatar is a big butterfly, (which is not unlike a spider >.>).\\n\r\nThe other characters are also fine in their roles, the childhood friends, the enemies, the unlikely allies, etc, the personalities are pretty well developed and fleshed out. Character gets no complaint from me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7.5\\n\r\nIt\u2019s well done, but standard. You have your typical fast BPM OP, appropriate music where it fits. Well done, but not transcendent. Good enough. The voice actors, I thought, were also decent. Haruyuki, smh, is voiced by Kaji Yuki, who voices Ouma Shu, but at least Haruyuki get\u2019s past Shu\u2019s stupid personality after the first 3 eps or so.\\n\r\nKuroyukihime\u2019s voice was decent, I actually enjoyed the deadpan delivery more than some other viewers who thought that for Misawa Sachika\u2019s breakthrough, it was mediocre. Personally, calm, sometimes cold Kuroyukihime does have that voice. Even the emotional scenes in which the understated \u201cbaka\u201d declarations come out, were in character for this role.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 9\\n\r\nProduction quality was top notch. It\u2019s like Guilty Crown, but better. (Man, I seem to be bashing on GC quite a bit). GC\u2019s animation still trumps AW, but for all intensive purposes, if the series is better as a whole, story telling, character, etc, then it\u2019s better. That said, the animation was always fluid, character models moved well, the fight scenes superbly animated and cinematography done surprisingly well in certain scenes. (Usually where heavy emotion was involved).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nGripe about Haruyuki because I know I did. It was because of him that I put off watching AW for as long as I did. But once I took plunge, I found a deep, interesting, and dynamic show that manages to infuse the shonen genre with some much needed originality and difference. The romance, for once, was a highlight of the show. The chemistry between the main leads, superb.\\n\r\n*Some of you may see Kuroyukihime as a manipulative ice queen, and that\u2019s plausible. But I prefer to look at it like Charlotte\u2019s Web.\\n\r\nSpider saves pig. Pig opens his wings and flies. \\n\\n",

No!Omua Shu is gonna destroy this anime!\\n\r\nMy points is that every \"Thin\" characters but some of the cools one might be boring despite that there's a lot of anime with boring looking thin characters now but as for this character he's much cute and lovable character.So if you hated this character because of being fat then you are a terrible person.\\n\r\nWell as you can see Unlike Ouma Shu.Haruyuki is more desperate that he would like to stay in virtual than the reality.So that would makes him sad than Ouma Shu.Well the other characters are good too and there's one helpful character too.\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\r\nA person who uses a device to access to your system is cool its just like a computer but it's in your brain.And the battle is also good to enjoy too.You may not find it boring as I said they have summarise the explanation for us.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nIt's a Very good anime.I recommended you to watch this.Viewers can also go read the manga if you don't want to wait but the manga version is also awesome.",

In the end I came to an conclusion that, this is one of the most boring anime I have seen in my life, due to slow progression.\r\nIt would have been better if there was more involvement with the Kings and high level fights, rather than only fight for dignity. The story linein of Red vs Yellow could have been progressed at all. Though its true that anime follows manga not the desire of a viewer.",

I didnt feel the much joy in this serie.\r\nBefore im gonna explain my rating I want to tell you this. There is no fantasy and its a little bit based on a robot/mecha game. If you are like me and dont like Mecha. You can better watch something else first. If you like Mecha and games. Enjoy the serie.\r\nStory 8: Not a hard story to follow. Little story without much explain.There serie is about a boy is getting bullied. And met a pretty awesome and beautiful girl. Who likes him and present him Burst Link. And thats the story in short. Good story and enjoyd it alot.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7: Because im not like Mecha and not sure how to rate that part. If giving it a seven. Good art work and some part where awesome. Like the main persons avatar. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6: Its fine but not great in my opinion. The first part of the seasons opening was good. Only I didnt like the endings in this serie. And just the sound effects where good enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: From bullied and shy boy to a hero. Well that was the only part I didnt like in this serie why. He got to cocky and thats what I really dislike. The other main and sub characters where fun to watch. Only got a little bit confussed by one of the mains. Split personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7: its a great Anime. And enjoy it alot. Much action, drama and sometimes funny parts. I will rewatch it again if needed. Only I did like to see a little bit more different things in the serie. Like maby fight against all king. Level up to 10 and what next?!\\n\\n\r\nOveral 7: So...as i explained. I dont like mecha based serie. But is also a yes and no. Yes its a little bit robotic. But the game how its works etc. Its a good go. Do you need to watch it. Well...its up to you. If enjoyed it at some points. But if you have seen SAO or something similar. Its different taste. And you probaly will see alot of PvP.",

The characters are well developed especially haruyuki maybe people don't like accel world because of haru but for me the design of him being fat is genius because it's different from the other stereotypical male hot protagonist. And in accel world we get to see how will haruyuiki overcome his problems,insecurities and such and the power of him and silver crow is also very well explained and it has connections. The female lead is kurukyuhime one of my favorites because she's pretty,elegant and yetstrong and also the other characters are also well developed. The only problem that I think is the ending which is very plain and cliche and the romance between haru and kurukyuhime is also too much ?? and also not believable but all in all it's a great anime with good anime and great animation to watch.",

            "content": "I am going to write the background of Accel World then move on to other things. Remember I am writing a review based on 2 episode of anime and 9 chapters of manga so it might not be in depth\r\nAccel World is basically a cliche story about a guy and girl meet and suddenly super powers arrive. Although it is cliche many people likes this type of story and willing to watch them. For me however is the element of Sci-fi that made me like this.\r\nAccel World is set in future Japan were the children are fused with computers. The Neuro link is basically acomputer stuck on your neck that is directly attached to your brain so that you can see computer screen within your eye. Not only that the school is learnt by teachers sending packets into the students head as shown in first 1 to 2 min.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the animation shows the basic problem of the world. When there is a rule in place, there are people who evade them. The \"social camera\" is in place everywhere to make sure nothing bad is going on however bullies have a program to look for blind spot for them. Therefore bulling is not stopped for people like our protagonist. He endures it by going to a virtual world where full 5 sense are transferred into an internet world.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nI like how they set up the background story but story itself is still cliche girl and boy meets, girl loves boy because of something, boy gets stronger to defend girl.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is great. Using the normal art for real world and CGI for virtual world, we can get the sense of change and have a good look at the good art styles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThey seem normal... nothing unusual except most popular girl falling for a fat unknown guy with all her heart. Reason? you will see, and it isn't very reasonable to me (but some people will say love ain't reasonable)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe battle scenes were very enjoyable. The little struggle and love comedy at the side makes this an interesting animation. Just wish they will do more than just 24.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8\\n\r\nExcept the main idea is common this animation maybe amazing. The unique background (atleast in anime) where each person is a computer and the society completely accepting it is rare to see. Therefore I give this a 8",

It never truly concludes and what normally would of been a couple episode long story-arc begins the entire second half of the season. \r\nFor a show that keeps touting ideals about Haru being so awesome and so much better than he gives himself credit, he -NEVER- stops needing others to come saving him and wins purelyby brute force, intervention of others, and outnumbering the competition. \\n\\n\r\nThe pointless fanservice went too far as well.

            "content": "I actually brought myself to watch this anime because of it's unique story and the concept of neuro-linker. I haven't watch too many anime with similar concept, so I have to say that I was content to watch it on overall basis.\r\nBut one thing bugs me though. If we put the brain burst and neuro-linker aside, this anime will leave us with a bunch of teenage with identity problem:\r\nFirst, there is the main protagonist who is bullied at school and having a problem with his \"real world\". Seeks refugee in the virtual world, and even becomes oblivious of his friends. To the point that hemade one of his friend cries, a girl for that matter, and the other friend hate him because his girlfriend is giving more affection towards the protagonist. These problems could easily avoided if he is content of what he already has, and paying attention to his great friends in the first place, which is oddly enough this was shown in the rest of the story (for now I can't judge it as either for the sake of his retribution or his real identity shows up). I know this was maybe for the sake of story development, but I certainly don't think that it is the best thing to tell your subconscious to.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, there is the female protagonist who shows our main protagonist the concept of brain burst. She sure is an interesting character. But on the other hand, her curiosity makes her betrays a truce. A truce that were made with the rest of her mass. I understand the condition she were in, and her motivation. But she blames children naivety as her justification, that's what troubling me most. Don't get me wrong though, I didn't try to verdicts certain age for I am incapable to do so. But I think children's role is to LEARN. And adult is the one to SUPERVISE them while they were learning. As long as one need to learn, then they were children. When one is content of his learning and can guide others in the learning, then they were become adults, age doesn't matter here. At least that was my own preferences for this matter. And regarding her ability and her role, the female protagonist certainly an adult in the \"brain burst\" proposition. And to think that someone that I expect to be a supervisor would betray the mass out of curiosity and then make others follows her path and continue her deeds, that was way too much. If I were to have a child on my own, that is certainly NOT something I would teach them to.\\n\\n\r\nMost anime I like usually has characters does something horrible for the sake of others, not for one own benefits. Maybe this is my own preference, but I can't stop myself to point this bizarre out.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the matter at hand, I like this anime for it's excellent neuro-linker interface. And the crews certainly did their best to make use of these to build matching atmosphere. Such as, the interaction between character when direct link is provided. The explanation of brain burst and neuro-linker is itself interesting. I praise the art and sound for this, therefore making the whole anime itself more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is adaptation from a light novel, and it has also adopted into a manga. But I can't bring myself to read those other materials as I still hopes this anime could \"surprise\" me more. By this time, there are only 7 episodes aired out of 24 in agenda. I personally hopes the story development will prove what I wrote in this review wrong. And if in the end it did, I beg you all a pardon. After all, that would be what \"Not Helpful\" button is for.",

The two main protagonists totally aren't both just losers who complain about everyone...and Kaji, Yuki totally isn't the voice act(or/ress; I'm not sure) of both Arita, Haruyuki, and Ouma, Shu... And, the plot isn't totally garbage. .. Oh and there's actions scenes, which isn't done better in mostly mecha anime.

            "content": "It's my first review so I'm sorry if anyone finds that I talk nonsense or if I accidentally offend someone.\r\nFirstly, I just want to say that I absolutely did not like the main character. Not at all. The way he was drawn was just retarded and his personality is really... However that's the whole point of it because apparently, everyone in school hates him, that's how he got his awesome avatar, so yeah... I don't think the anime has done anything wrong in making him look like that.\r\nSo.. Setting wise, I found Accel World extremely unique and original. If i had to say, it wasthe setting that made me like Accel World so much. Not everyone can come up with a futuristic setting where everything is so advanced and cool, and i cant even imagine how hard it must be for the author figure out how to explain to the audience all the technologies being used so that it wouldn't be confusing. (Honestly, I am a really slow person especially when it comes to sci fi which is super hard for me to understand, so I think Accel World has really done a great job on that.) For the story, I thought it was really good as the way the different 'arcs' were introduced was appropriate and the solutions were nice, but I felt that Accel World didn't really make the motives of the bad guy so realistic. Just because the main guy's is 'different', everyone thinks he's all that? I really didn't find that so impressive as there are many other 'different' avatars but is it me, or is he the only one the everyone finds 'badass'.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art, the characters are really well drawn and really suit their personality. It is sharp and the designs of the characters really suit their personality (If you know what I mean) which makes it easy to remember the faces of the characters without striking hair styles and colours. The fighting scenes are really good in my opinion and the colours of the avatars make it really cool and colourful in fighting scenes. Though I wouldn't know what a good fighting scene is as Shounen isn't one of my favourite genres so excuse me if you disagree with me. However at some points of time, the art looks weird, like in between the episodes and the main character has to be one of the easiest character ever animated since he has no details added to him. It's like they didn't even try to make him look less.. Irritating. However, I loved how the artist drew the avatars and the fighting arena as it really brought out the whole 'game' concept which made the fighting scenes enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are not bad. Having a fat, low self-esteemed, self pitying loser as a main character probably won't make this anime good based on it's main  character.  \\n\r\nKuroyukihime seems like the generic 'bishoujo\" reliable and perfect senpai that makes everyone looks up to her and you can't hate her because she's so perfect. However she can be really adorable sometimes, even though I have no idea why she fell in love with Haru. Opposites attract maybe? \\n\r\nChiyu is also pretty ordinary. The normal childhood friend who spends her time worrying about your social circle, just that she has a boyfriend (I know, weird isn't it?) At first she's really irritating, but after you get past all that, she's really adorable and funny.\\n\r\nAccel World has done quite a good job with the more important characters as by the end of the whole thing, you feel like you really understand the them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the side characters are what makes the story more interesting.\\n\r\nNoumi is the most memorable character ever. I have no idea how anyone can even come up with him. He's a complete genius who comes up with these plans to wreck other people's lives (And not the good kind). But thanks to him, the main character isn't the worse character in the anime.\\n\r\nThe side characters are really awesome and compared to other side characters are much more developed and talked about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found Accel World a really enjoyable series and the fighting scenes were really nicely done. I recommend this to everyone and I think it would not be a waste of time. Unless you are really looking for a fantastic plot with extremely intense fighting, otherwise I think that Accel World would really be nice to watch. The story is pretty predictable and there are many issues regarding the main character, but I feel that the best thing about Accel World is the awesome Brain Burst Program and the cool futuristic setting so don't worry so much about the flaws and just try to enjoy the anime as much as you can.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this and if you disagree with me, I am really sorry.",

            "content": "A Mixed Bag of Virtual Reality Mayhem\r\n*note* I have not read the LN. I judged this anime based on its credibility as an anime alone and not an adaptation. *note*\r\nA mixed bag is really the best way I can explain Accel World. While the production elements behind this anime were fantastic, there were scenes and character interactions in this anime that seriously made me groan. Let me start with what this anime did right.\r\nThe artwork/animation and music for this anime was fantastic. I thought Accel World has perhaps one of the best soundtracks of any anime I've seen in 2012. The OPs and EDs werecatchy, upbeat tunes that any fan of I've Sound would enjoy. The animation was simply outstanding, in fact, downright gorgeous. Accel World itself was visually captivating as the many environments within the VRMMORPG were great. I thought the character designs were also extremely well done with the lone exception being Arita. I'm not sure why because I know this sort of characterization had been done before in other animes, but I found his character design to be far too cartoonish for this series. I understand the animators were trying to make a character that obviously is short and chubby but even the facial design made it way too obvious.\\n\\n\r\nI found this anime to be extremely enjoyable with how it executed Brain Burst and Accel World. My interest was extremely piqued during the fight sequences. Perhaps as someone who is a gamer as well as an anime fan can take some enjoyment of seeing such elements in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I found the story and character development to be rather weak...or at the very least, the weakest part of this anime. More specifically, there were sequences during this series where I screamed \"WHAT?!\" at my computer screen because the most absurdly inaccurate things would happen, especially in the latter half of the anime. There were also interactions between the leads that would make me groan in agony at just how unrealistic that sort of conversation would be and the implications it has toward the plot. Trust me, Chiyu had MANY groan-worthy moments in this series. Also, to be honest, Arita is not one of the more likable protagonists you'd find in anime. I don't mean that in he's short, fat, and does nothing but play video games. Hell, I'm completely fine with that aspect. I found the way he interacted with his friends at times to be completely unrealistic and off-base. There were also sequences that would happen earlier in the anime, emphasize that they are important, and then never really come back to them. Granted, they could come back to them in a 2nd season (which it was setup for) but in the meantime, peeved me slightly.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way I can describe Accel World is that it was a fantastic anime that had its flaws and kept it from being a fantastic anime. It's still a nice and a fun watch, but this series really underperformed with its cast of characters. Nevertheless, I'm still intrigued by the prospect of a 2nd season and if it can somehow manage to at least tweak some of the things the 1st season did wrong, I'd be ecstatic with the product Sunrise would be able to put out.",

            "content": "Hmmm I can't claim that I hardly rate anime a 10 since it looks like I have at least 5. But my initial reaction after having just finished the episode is that this anime, like all the anime I rate as a 10, does one thing, and one thing well: Tell a great story. Something that sucks you into a world, immerses you, losing all thoughts other than the characters and the plot. \r\nAccel World brought all the elements to tell a great story: the art, the music, the animation itself. The animation itself was really pretty as well as the character designs. Coming froma person that has not read the LN, and didn't know the events beforehand, watching this anime was an emotional roller coaster for me. The unique thing I found with this anime was that I found the guy characters cute and funny as well. They often times brought a comedic effect that often times helped lighten the very dark and depressing themes in the story. Although sometimes those same character made me wanna slap them a couple times myself from the view of their own self-worth and hurting others from that. I found myself laughing with them and crying with them, and being happy with them.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the cliptime spent with each character you could tell it was important to the staff to spend just enough time to get the emotions across. I could feel the TLC. Noting seemed rushed. The music did a very good job of supporting the story and suggesting the desired tone at the moment. The art and fight was very well done. Most of all though, I loved how they developed the characters and the time they spent with each. I'm sure to someone who has watched the LN it might feel rushed or maybe even totally skipping out on relevant backstory or arcs but for me I felt they spent just enough time on the character and back-story to really observe these characters as all struggling with their own hopes and dreams and sadness. Time was spent when they cried, when they were happy, when they laughing. I really felt that they spent just enough time for someone watching to really start to empathize with these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside, I would say is the distaste with all the characters having dark pasts and insecure but I think it'd be unfair to say they were one-dimensional characters. The other reason I rate something a 10 is because whether you end up not liking the anime or not...it definitely is something worth watching to see for yourself. Hands down.",

            "content": "Accel World is a very interesting concept, and had great potential. Unfortunately, the characters and their motivations are illogical, annoying, and hypocritical. The initial concept of the game the characters play makes sense initially, but as the series goes on the game logic becomes clouded and muddled to the point where things just stop making a whole lot of sense. The main character is a fat loser, which was pretty unique at first, but I never really felt like he was a fat loser. He thinks he's superior and when he beats somebody, tells them he's superior. There's some sort of love triangle thing Iguess, but it's confusing and inorganic. None of the characters presented feel like people, and I actually found myself hoping the good guys would lose because I hated them so much. But the anime does look really pretty, and the show does have its cool moments but overall the anime is quite mediocre. I wouldn't really recommend watching this.",

With fantastic art styles, and solid character development, it makes this anime quite an enjoyable experience. Despite the main character being a disappointing fail for most, the anime does a good job making him grow and develop in the virtual world and also the real world. He transitions from being a person with low self esteem who lets others take advantage of him to a somewhat more mature character who learns to stand up for himself and hisfriends. Basically this story  shows the life of a nobody in the real world becoming a somebody in the virtual and also the real and with him realizing that, thus enabling him to seek his full potential. Overall this anime is worth watching, with a wide range of characters with interesting personalities and a great concept of futuristic virtual gaming in a dramatic way. During this anime some of the episodes may get a bit trivial to the main plot but yet it still makes for a well executed episode regardless. I enjoyed this anime series because it was well done in all aspects and it is very vibrant which makes up for the poorly designed ( avatar not included ) main character with a some what negative personality.",

I love the futuristic VR gaming world that Accel World creates. While it's been done a million times, at least they don't mimic SAO or .Hack\r\n2. The psychological aspect to this anime is also very likable. Watching how the character's personalities become submersed into Brain Burst was an interesting look into how games can actually have an effect on people.\r\n3. The art designs for avatars and landscapes were well thought out. They were allvivid yet solid in their concept. \\n\\n\r\nSome bad things:\\n\r\n1. I hate how no matter how powerful he gets in the game, Haru always berates himself even though he brags about how he became more confident because of Brain Burst.\\n\r\n2. Didn't care for the generic \"Loser meets perfect girl\" scenario they set up. Especially since their character dynamic as a couple doesn't develop AT ALL.\\n\r\n3. Usually, a good villain is defined by their intricate back story that led up to their evil action. Noumi takes everything I like about villain dynamics and throws them in the trash. He only exists to make Haru suffer and piss off the viewer.\\n\r\n4. Like most anime adaptations, there isn't enough all-around character development. Chi would be a perfect example. She didn't spend a lot of time with taku because she was always worried about Haru.He means the world to her (which pissed off taku) and splits up with taku but still treats Haru like a child.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that were wrong with this anime, that are typical of many anime I've seen. The only things that make this anime redeemable are the art and theme. Was kinda pissed when the season ended being all about Haru vs. Noumi",

Personally, I really like the idea of a kid being a main protagonist, and how he changed himself and the people with him for the better. I learned the imprtance of true friendship and other stuff. Only sometimes, I just get irritated when a character in the story loses hope and becomes negative. But having a good positive outlook afterwards is what I like too.\r\nFor the Art, I think its outstanding. I just liked how creativelythe characters and their avatar were drawn. I felt the SciFi within the drawings.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sounds, I like all of it. The OP and ED songs were well matched. The soundtracks for Action parst and Drama parts were perfectly fit. I like the casting for voice actors/actress too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I like the characters. But its just that I'm just a little disappointed because the protagonist is unrealstically fat and small, sorry, but I'm just a little bothered by it. But I still think that that concept was for the sake of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment... Hell yes I enjoyed watching every episode of it. To the point that when I am outside, I will shout, \"UNLIMITED FULL BURST\", or get my USB wire and connect it to my friends' necks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Accel World is indeed on of the best SciFi. I personally recommended it to some of my family members, and some of my friends. It is must see if you wanted this type of genre.",

            "content": "First review, so cut me some slack, please. Note: I haven't read the manga.\r\nStory: 8\r\nI like the story, even if it's not exactly unique. I give it 8 since I'm not entirely sure of the motivations behind each of the main characters. Also, I assume there will be a bigger rival then the wannabe Ghost Rider and the bully, although it'd be nice if they came back and did something to try to avenge their defeats. Since this big rival hasn't been introduced yet, I can't give this any higher than 8. \r\nArt: 9\r\nGood art style. The character design is pretty good and Chubby-kun looksadorable, in my opinion. The battles are pretty damn good too, although the lack of an OP and ED with the first double episode leads me to believe that quite a large chunk of the episode's budget was spent on them. I expect the fight quality to go down in the following episodes, but this is a 9 for now.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nNo OP or ED in these episodes, and I'm not really a big fan of the two songs being used either. The rest of the music was just decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the characters. Chubby-kun is someone many people can relate to, and his pig avatar seems perfect for him. I wonder why he chose a pig though. Maybe I missed it in the episode, but I'd think that in a virtual world, wouldn't someone with low self esteem create a cooler looking thing? I'd like to know the reason for the pig, but it definitely fits his appearance. He also has room to develop, unlike a lot of other characters, and his development could really mirror that of a real human being, as he tries to raise his self esteem and confidence.\\n\r\nKuroyukihime, meanwhile, is superbly illustrated and I'm grateful they didn't exaggerate her figure. If I remember my own days in middle school correctly, unlike in anime, girls there generally didn't have a 36 DD rack. She seems to genuinely care for the kid and wants to actually help him out. She definitely has ulterior motives, but she did everything in her power to give him a chance, which tells you she won't be the stereotypical \"cheerleader\"-type.\\n\r\nHaru's two friends, meanwhile seem pretty interesting too. The girl is nice enough to get him food and the guy seems like he's willing to help him as well, although he might become jealous of the fact that the Chiyuri seems to like Haru. This may turn into a problem for Haru later on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nTypical of it's genre. I am a bit biased towards anime such as this and generally enjoy a good animated fight, so this is a 9.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWhile the technological aspect of this story is a little overused, it's refreshing to see a main character that I personally (and I'm sure many, many middle schoolers in the United States in particular) can relate to. I was Haru when I was that age. Of course, I managed to grow out of it in time and without the assistance of a pretty girl (debatable). At the moment, I'm liking the where this anime is headed and I like the message it's presenting a lot: Find something you like, that you're good at and that you can share with other people, and even the pretty girl who you have absolutely no chance with will at least notice you. Considering what's happening in the world today, with the sheer amount of bullying that goes on in our schools, this anime couldn't have come out at a better time.",

            "content": "I don't usually watch the seasonal animes of the year and wait for them to finish. I did this with Accel World. Accel Word is created by Reki Kawahara the same creator of the light novel Sword Art Online, which was also adapted last year. The popularity of Sword Art Online was very high and lots of the Sword Art Online fans will say that its better than this series by only watching one episode. I have to say Accel World is a much superior series compared to Sword Art in story and character. This series tell the story of Haru and is set inmore of modern futuristic city where everyone has holographic screens put in their face to click certain options and crap. He is fat and often bullied in school this all changes when he meets Kuroyukihime the president of the school. Over the course of the series he attracts a lot of females much like Kirito only he makes it quite clear who's with instead of completely ignoring everything that's happened. She installs the program brain burst which is a virtual reality world. Quite frankly my theory is Sword Art takes place years before World but eh I could be wrong. With the game comes the supernatural ability to slow down time to the point it looks like its stopped. If you lose a fight in the game you lose burst points lose all your burst points lose the memories of both accel world and lose the ability to go back forever. So really compared to Sword Art Online there was more of a suspense with that. The show picks up pretty fast right when you think its going no where and has lots of plot twists. I have to really recommend this to anyone who watched Sword Art Online it really is a good show and you'll enjoy it a lot. The only problem I have with this show is a problem I have rare with any show is that its to short. It should have had more episodes to explain better back pasts and the setting of the virtual world a little more. You'll find  similarities in both Kirito and Haru a lot as well but this is due to Reki's writing style in my opinion. Its an amazing show. Its a show I actually wanna re watch. Its a solid 8/10",

            "content": "It's my first time reviewing an anime, so please bear with me...I was actually wondering why Accel World was rated so low but now I completely understand...  I hurriedly watched it because I was addicted to SAO and was wondering the connection on why Accel world was rumored to be a continuation of what happend after the whole SAO plot .Furthermore , I know SAO was a bit overrated and lacks some story elements .. but it was still enjoyable and the characters ( Kirito and Asuna) seems to save the story( as for me) ....  I am a  big fan ofadventure and romance anime and SAO really hits the spot...but this one.. I truly,madly, deeply hated it..\\n\\n\r\n[spoiler] The lead girl is the only thing, I liked about the story.. It was obvious that she has connections with Kirito or even Asuna by the whole rumors going around the web... All of it make sense because the anime even hid her own real name ....(Why don't they just reveal it earlier since everybody already knows and the fact that at the epilouge  it was an open end question) The author and anime already gives many hints about her real identity..... Somehow, everything can still be handled but what drag on is the main guy.. Seriously, how could you watch an anime when the main guy looks chibi, constanly cry, and has almost no good point.While watching, it was so disturbing that he was the only one drawn in that way... If the author wanted a bullied person that turns into a hero, he could still have done it with a reasonable figure not a 4 feet tall roll of melon.. It was so lame that the girl even fell for the guy without a very valid reason .. It does not make any sense just thinking about it makes me wanna puke...[/spoiler] I like SAO much better... It dwells with the same problem as fate stay night... the prequel did better than the sequel ... It was so nerve wrecking too watch that such anime was a \"continuation\" of SAO. If I were the author, I would rather have explored on the story line of the main girl rather than adding the main guy in the story. :( It was a major let down for me!",

So I took the chance and unfolded the story of Accel world.   \r\nAfter the first three episode, I was already intertwine on how Accel world worked and the concept behind it is marvelous. Although it isn't your typical action/ fantasy anime it had the lush of something similar to it. You would call it, romance/action/slice of life/fantasy/comedy packed into one. That is something I haven't seen in a anime in a while. \r\nWhatstood out the most in Accel World is the character development of almost all of the main character. From start to finish, it seems like almost all of the character had a major change through the anime. Each one had its uniqueness to it and the author capitalized it excellently.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World fell behind ultimately on the art. Although I usually don't discriminate on the art, I got to say that almost every girl in the anime had blushed or pink cheeks. That is something that is obvious and obvious. The art overall is not on par with current anime but it did not fall behind much. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending faltered a lot of plot holes but it opened a possible squeal. Potential is what see. Hopefully a squeal is delivered as I enjoyed much of it in Accel World. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8/10",

It's absolutely unnecessary to constantly emphasise sexual attraction between the lead and his female best friend (in a relationship with his best friend) as well as with the elven year old little girl he's friends with, it's just another (creepy) wish-fullfillment for the target group \"overweight andsocially isolated\". \\n\\n\r\nAccel World would have been a decent anime if they focused the energy that was put into fanservice into a bit character and story development.

Now, almost two years later, I finished it.  This should not discredit you from watching this at all.  What originally caused me to not be hooked was that this type of show or the sci-fi aspect of it is not something I normally lean towards.  That being said, it didn't take long to make me binge on it and finish the show in three days.

It shows that you are never alone and that there are people who care for you if you only allow them to be there.

How we should use it to empower us to reach potential in ourselves we never knew we had.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"A scar is a sign that something is missing, something important to you has been removed, leaving a hole in your heart.

            "content": "I will begin by stating that I only started watching this show after seeing some of the fights on YouTube and thinking \"Wow, that was intense\". Was I impressed? Sadly, no, but I haven't finished the show yet so I may be revising this review later. The reason I'm making this review now is because if I force myself to watch another episode without taking a break and venting to you poor readers, I will end up hating and dropping this show... Which isn't something I want to do with this anime. Here's my take so far...\r\nThe story line is actually quite nice. It's gota simple goal, reach level 10. Quick and easy. The setting is a futuristic version of Japan where just about everything is monitored digitally. Everyone is hooked up to a global network through Neural Linking devices on there necks. They use these in place of computers, phones, Ipod's and just about every other entertainment and communication device. The show itself often takes place in the \"Accelerated World\" which is part of a game called \"Brain Burst\". In this game you fight and level up to obtain burst points which you can use to cheat in the real world. The highest level that is referenced in the show is level 10, which no one has ever reached. That about sums up the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is done flawlessly(... Other then the main character...) and the fluid animations are what drew me to the show in the first place. It takes a bit for you to reach the episodes with the good fights, but they're well worth the wait. The designs of all the avatars are really intriguing to say the least. They look like human sized Gundams that were smashed together with Tron outfits to forge a look that's quite creative and variable, allowing every character to have there own truly unique appearance. Outside of the virtual world are your basic cookie cutter mold characters, though they are still fantastic looking in 1080p XD. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was enough to get you pumped up in a fight, which is to be expected, but other than that it didn't really stand out. The sound effects where everything they needed to be so there isn't anything missing from it, but they certainly didn't add anything special or exhilarating.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the part that brought this show down to a 7 from 9... The characters. All there personalities are as cookie cutter as there appearances. They include all your typical characters from other anime copy and pasted to this shows shallow selection of inhabitants. All the relations and bonds seem forced, and the only ones that feel somewhat natural are the bonds between Haru, The main character, and his friends Taku and Chiyu, which you don't get to see the forming of since they're already friends when the show starts... And even then, there relationships don't seem to make sense. The only character I liked is Chiyu, and that's because she's the only person who knows that games are supposed to be fun. Everyone else makes the game out to be some sort of alternate reality where any wrong move could spell the end of there lives... All that, and I still haven't touched the subject of all my rage and disappointment... THE MAIN CHARACTER!!! His nickname is Haru and he is a pig shaped short kid who looks, acts and feels completely out of place. Everyone in the show states repeatedly that he's this loser who's a master at video games and he's the fastest gamer they've ever seen. But they never show anything to prove those accusations. He spends 95% of the time being awkwardly unsocial, dimwittedly thick, and incapable of performing the most basic of actions efficiently with any sense of logic... His problem solving skills are unbelievably lacking for someone who's supposed to be a gamer, let alone the fastest gamer. It's like they wanted him to relate to the nerd population, but had no idea what nerds where like. The reason a loser is good at games is because they're not a loser in the games, only in real life, where their body can't perform the badass things they're capable of in games. I'd like to add that scientific studies have shown people who play games are 37% less prone to mistakes then those who don't... Ok, I need to move on or I'll be at this forever.\\n\\n\r\nI do enjoy the show, even if it is dumb a large portion of the time. Many shows are off balance because the main character becomes too overpowered so fast that any resistance from the tasks put in front of them becomes trivial. Other's make characters who remain just as strong as in the beginning so they can overcome the trivial tasks with moderate ease and then complete the moderately difficult ones with slightly less ease. This show throws you for a loop by giving you a character whose so obnoxiously inept he can barely accomplish the simplest of tasks without getting beaten like a rag doll even as he grows stronger. He gets his ass kicked by people who are just as pathetic as he is, only to spontaneously defeat impossible odds by defying physics and his own character traits to take down some guy that was made out to be really strong, much like himself, but turned out to go down like my ex. Then spontaneously go back to being completely inept... well I guess he was just as inept when he beat the silver giant dude who will not be named for spoilers sake, he only won because the story demanded he be temporarily strong enough to defeat that guy no matter how out of character... Wow, I started that up again... Was it worth watching? Yes. Will I keep watching? Probably. Do I hate Haru? ... Very much so... How do you fail posing as a Loser/Nerd? He found a way, which I guess makes him the greatest loser ever and thus perfect for the role...\\n\\n\r\n7 OUT OF 10!!! I'm out...\\n\r\nThis next part is an edit after watching 2 more episodes of the show. I can't take the show any more, I'm dropping it's score to a 6 and subsequently dropping the show on my list... Its turning out just like bleach, with the occasional badass fight thrown into a show about really dumb and inept people failing to keep me enthralled with the story... Chiyu started taking the game too seriously, just like everyone else... Just... To much stupidity for me.\\n\r\n6 OUT OF 10!!! I'm out for real this time T_T So sad...",

            "content": "I am absolutely appalled. Accel World is, without a doubt, the worst anime I have ever seen. Written by Reki Kawahara, the same author as one Sword Art Online, Accel World is an ugly amalgamation of everything wrong with the modern anime industry and should serve as a clear example of what not to do when attempting to create a work of any artistic value. \r\nFirst, let us dive into the characters. Our main character, Arita Haruyuki, is an obese and bullied junior high school student. He is also the center of his own personal harem, where the most popular girl in school and avariety of others lust after him. You have to ask yourself why this is a thing. Does he have a dynamic and charismatic personality that can't help making all the girls around him collectively swoon despite his physical appearance? No, not quite. Instead, the reason is something I like to refer to as \"awful writing.\" Our main character himself is blander than the chalk I attempted to choke myself with after getting halfway through the show. You'd think the fact that he is constantly bullied would lead him to have some sort of resentment towards those around him, but instead he is your typical white knight wish fulfillment mc. Gotta believe in your nakama desu!!! Not to mention, he's the chosen one who can never lose!\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are none better, as they fit perfectly into various tropes such as the childhood friend, sexualized loli, and perfect upperclassman. The characters also never develop throughout the show, instead making complete 180s in personality whenever it's convenient for the plot. Poor writing, character development; Tomato, Tomatoe; am I right? XDDD\\n\\n\r\nThe premise itself was quite promising for the time, when MMORPG anime didn't populate the industry wherever you looked. However, execution is poor and you need to have a certain suspension of belief to empathize on any level at all. All these characters are 15 years old or younger, and you want me to believe that they're mature enough to do even a third of the things that happen within the show? Stakes are at an all time low, where the worse that can happen is that you can no longer play the game. This completely nullifies the purpose of any in-game conflict, and anything that happens in real life will be ass pulled 100% of the time. It also suffers from FMA syndrome, in that every character has some sort of tragic past for no reason at all. One of the characters even has PTSD. They're 15 years old, for god's sake. \\n\\n\r\nArt really isn't worth mentioning. It's your generic budget harem stuff, and when in game is your choice of dreary background so they don't have to spend money designing a variety of places. Nothing notable here, but nothing quite awful either. I commend them on the use of CGI for health bars and the such, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, don't watch Accel World. This show is bad.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever wanted to be faster than anyone else in this world? Keep the fantasy going as you watch this anime. Accel World, as from its name, allows one to accelerate faster than other people in that world. 16 minutes 48 seconds in Accel World is only a mere 1 second in the real world! Imagine how fast you could actually be...\r\nStory :\r\nI\u2019m assuming that you\u2019ve already read a little about this anime so I\u2019m going to dive straight into this. The concept of this anime is really one that truly gave me a \u201c WTF\u201d moment. I mean, moving faster than anyone else in aspecial world, as if manipulating time in your own hands isn\u2019t something I would think of in a regular basis...Thus, the concept of this anime was undeniably a really catchy.  To be really honest, when I first started watching this, I was like, \u201cAwww come on! It\u2019s just a multiplayer duelling game! How in the world did this get so popular?\u201d However, after watching a few more episodes, I spanked myself for how foolish I was. This was not only exciting but it was interesting and somewhat motivational to some. Almost every episode was action-packed and heart-pumping which got me glued to my chair even though I cannot sit still for long, watching episodes after episodes non-stop, resulting in me finishing this in a mere 2 days. The 2nd part of the anime however was somewhat draggy because of the number of episodes dedicated to character development. Some episodes even seemed to have completeyly no link to the main plot. Maybe it was their plan to go through this development for us to understand the later plot. It was only towards the last few episodes where the action aspect of the anime begin to show which wasn\u2019t what I wanted, considering the fact that they could\u2019ve just reduced the episodes dedicated to character development and maybe focus more on the fight itself. Still, I honestly love this story!\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nQuite a commendable art work as almost all characters are beautifully designed, having a natural blush on their cheeks every moment which was kind of cute to me(I\u2019m no pedo...). Not to mention, the duelling avatars are all very funky too. Many people, though, have complains about the lead character, which I would focus on the next section. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n\u201cOMG! THIS GUY IS SO FAT AND UGLY!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t want to watch this anime because the main character is fat and ugly\u201d Alright, I\u2019ve had enough of these comments from my friends. I\u2019ll be honest. I had this exact same reaction too when I was planning to watch this anime. Until I watched the 1st two episodes did I finally know why Haruyuki Arita (Lead Character) was designed in this manner. To put it simply, the duel avatar in the game was crafted based on one inferior complex. Thus it is a must for him to posses such an inferior complex in order for his avatar to be strong. Just a really brief comment on him. He is always being bullied, afraid of things and thus escapes to the virtual world where he is the best there. Kind of pathetic at first sight. His partner, Kuroyukihime in contrast was smart, popular, beautiful and enjoys status. Perfect? I\u2019ll leave you to find out yourself if she\u2019s really a perfect girl.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSuperb openings & endings. Catchy and impressive. Never skipped any one of them until the anime officially stopped. The OSTs are as impressive any well. Some OSTs give you a tense feeling as you heard it while others give you a soothing and relaxing feeling. Moreover, the sound effects the duelling avatar emits is really really cool. I cannot stop commending how impressive the sound effects were. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nReally enjoyed it considering the fact I was willing to stay up late just to satisfy myself with just one more episode even though I do not have the habit of doing so. It made me forget everything around me and when I finished the anime, I then realised I was literally \u201cliving\u201d in this anime for 2 days. Got me into the chuunibyou mood whenever I finished a epic scene which is kind of embarrassing as I\u2019m 16 years old right now. Would strongly recommend you to watch this anime as I am sure most of you would enjoy this action-packed and heart-pumping anime. \\n\r\nThank you~",

            "content": "Amazing. Beautiful. Stunning. These are all words you could use to describe Accel World. In fact words don't do this review justice, thats how much I enjoyed this show. AW was one of those shows where I HAD to come back each week to see what was gonna happen next. It kept my interest from start to finish. While it had its faults, the series as a whole was (to me) one of the most addicting and most amazing experiences. I warn people though, this IS NOT an anime of just ONE focused genre. Part of what makes this anime so good is that ithas many different themes and genres that make the experience great. Many will say they hated the show and give it a super low rating and others will give it a super high rating, its all about preference. Some of the many genres that pop up frequently are Romance, School, Drama, Fighting, and above all Sci-fi. Some people go into this hoping for only one main genre but I personally don't think you can enjoy this without having at least some interest in those multiple genres. And if you have an open mind you'll enjoy it even more!\\n\\n\r\nStory: Well our story here is set in the not-to-distant future, where society is almost fully computer integrated. Everyone wears these mobile computers around their necks called \"Neuro Linkers\". These devices create virtual reality (HUD and you can \"Dive\" into a fully virtual world on your local network). Our MC, Haru, is picked on by almost everyone for being small, fat, and a loser. He is approached one day by the most popular girl in the school and she shows him a world beyond reality, a game called \"Brain Burst\". This game turns out to be so much more because it allows its users to speed up their minds (slowing down time) and in some cases speed up their bodies. Users can choose to use this power for good or evil. But there is one catch, its use is limited by your \"Burst Points\" and in order to gain BP they must continue to fight in the savage place known as Accel World!  Now I could go on all day explaining every bit of this story but my words alone are not enough to do it justice. The story is filled with ups and downs, hardships, overcoming obstacles, friendship, love and inspiration. The story is as complex as you want it to be. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Well there isnt alot to say here but the artwork is really top notch. Very well done, animations are smooth and very exciting to look at. During alot of the fight scenes I'd stop and rewatch certain parts just cause it was so badass! Wonderful design of the characters, Avatars, and environment. The visuals often added to the feel of the characters or setting, which is common but great none-the-less.\\n\\n\r\nSound: WOW, the BGM in this show blew me away! Everything from the fighting music to the emotional music. It was all above and beyond what I hoped for. Not many animes have given me that feeling where I have to rewatch a 30 second scene just for the BGM. And the Openings and Endings had amazing music! This is the ONLY anime I have ever watched the OP/END scenes for EVERY episode. 24 ep. + 4 OP/END = Some really badass and enjoyable music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well alot of people have very strong opinions here. The main character is fat and actually really pathetic at the start of the show, he really does make great improvements during the show. Alot of other characters make you want to throw your computer out the window (Thats how well the author makes you hate them!). Some characters you just love so much and fill you with joy when you see them. This show is focused around middle school students and does a great job of portraying how middle school students would act. I think this show does an excellent job of evoking feelings with its characters, and thats part of what makes this show so good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well if its not noticeable already, I am in love with this show! I stumbled upon this show because of boredom and im really lucky I did! This show is about video games and the future and school, and that appealed to me. I really felt this show was something special. Im not saying everyone will have this experience, but I know there are many who will. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Final Thoughts: This show is meant to be realistic while staying sci-fi. Some may hate it, some will love it, many will enjoy it. The way the story is told and its characters is just awesome and it has a very \"real\" feeling to it. The music is to die for! and the art is superb. All of this is only my opinion and above all else I recommend you take the time to try it out, the show only gets better as it goes on. The last episode left me with an amazing feeling, hopefully others can feel what i felt then and all throughout the show!",

            "content": "I often find it's difficult putting a numerical value on things that seem so difficult to quantify. Often, I can find myself enjoying a TV or anime series immensely, but when the time comes to put a number to the past 6 hours of my life, I struggle. In this particular case, if I think about it, the quality of each of the different elements is not earth-shattering. On the other hand however, and this is probably the biggest reason why I would recommend this anime, irrespective of why I enjoyed it, I did. \r\nI found myself emotionally invested with the characters, regardless of howdeeply flawed some people believe them to be, and I was on the edge of my seat a few times throughout the season. You can rate anime and you can rank it, but at the end of the day, we all want to look back on however many hours we've just spent watching that particular series and judge it worthwhile. With Accel World, I firmly believe this is the case.\\n\\n\r\nVery briefly, here is my breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe story is compelling for the most-part, and in sections very well thought through. It does however succumb to a bit of predictability in parts. There is the spark of originality in this anime's basic premise, and I found that to be quite refreshing. The whole \"VR\" sub-genre often challenges our concept of reality, asking questions such as \"what happens when technology can effect our minds?\" and \"how far can we go with this?\" \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing particularly special, but I have a fondness for Accel World's style of animating fights. I find that as the screen gets less clustered, and the colour darker (night-time for example), the art can be beautiful, and I appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nTwo endings, two openings - four great songs. \"Unfinished\" is one of my favourite endings, and the piano build-up to it at the end of each episode sends a shiver down my spine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this anime. I want to repeat however that enjoyment, as well as how much I like a certain character, does not equate to rating. While I adore Kuroyukihimi more than I can describe, I cannot rate the complexity, the depth of her character, the intelligence of her design, particularly highly. I realise that she fits the mould of \"harem girl\" as well as \"powerful female senpai\", and regretfully admit that she isn't a feat of character design. However, the playfulness common to some of my favourite characters is held by her.\\n\\n\r\nHaru's love of crying and his appearance is a little off-putting, but his heart's in the right place, and I don't dislike him as much as some people seem to. He is somewhat of a clich\u00e9, a classic anime character, much like Taku.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI've made most of my arguments previously, so I'll just repeat that I adore this anime, and enjoyed it despite its flaws and holes. Kuroyukihimi is my waifu, and I'm dying for a second season. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, it's a good anime.",

With the possibilities of technology continuing to increase, it's no wonder many individuals have their minds set on a technologically-driven future. Focusing on a rapidly-rising feature in the gaming community, Accel World seeks to depict what it means to take the \"virtual\" out of \"virtual reality\", albeit at a limited level. If one's life were to revolve around a video game, what would it be like? Let's see the results of this interesting premise.\r\nArt (7/10)\r\nI'll be honest here. I really dislike Haruyuki's character design. It's not so much that he's fat, butmore so because he's so disproportionate to the other characters. Given that he's the essentially the poster boy for the anime, this isn't a good impression to give. But aside from that, I thought all the other character designs looked quite nice, although they were a bit on the plain side. The background details of the show were on about the same level. The most memorable animation aspect was definitely the battle scenes, which should be expected from an anime of this nature. For the most part, the animation for the fast-paced fights filled with flashy attacks was smooth and of decent quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nLet's first take a look at the main male protagonist of the story, Arita Haruyuki, whose character has managed to more or less evenly divide viewers into two distinct groups of fans and haters. On the surface, he is indeed different from the usual anime characters\u2014fat, short, and whiny are just a few of the negative adjectives that have been used to describe him. And while people are entitled to their opinion, isn't judging a character based on his/her appearance a bit superficial? Upon further analysis of Haruyuki, you can see that he grows a lot throughout the series. Although his transformation is not so much a 180-degree turn, that is what makes it realistic. The other characters also display signs of growth as the series progressed. Through the difficulties and trials they experienced\u2014including battles with past demons and encounters with antagonists\u2014all the major characters ended up noticeably changing for the better.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nFor the most part, sh\u014dnen anime are rarely driven by great BGM pieces or talented seiy\u016b\u2014and Accel World is not an exception. Both the aforementioned aspects did their jobs well, but not to the point where they were memorable. For me, I found that the OP and ED were the best parts of the show in terms of sound, but that's not really saying much. All four tracks are upbeat to a certain extent, sharing a common synth feel. Everything was quite average overall.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\r\nThe idea itself was promising; integrating gaming elements into anime generally produces good results as quite a number of viewers are also gamers. However, execute it unsuccessfully and you have a subpar story at best. Although learning all about the Accelerated World, Brain Burst, and like was interesting at first, it soon got to the point where things started getting either repetitive or uninteresting. Overall, the story moved at a slower pace than I expected, and at times, felt bland and boring. However, it did have its moments in which it was able to earn my praise. Nonetheless, the slow pace of the story, in my opinion, is what hurt its score the most.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nAccel World is really just your typical sh\u014dnen anime. You get your typical \"weak at first, strong at the end\" protagonist, a bunch of high-octane battles, and some good dialogue. If that's your cup of tea, then by all means give it a try. But if not, I'd suggest giving some thought before watching this show\u201424 episodes is quite the time investment\u2014though that's not to say it's a bad show. When it comes down to it, the enjoyability of all shows comes down to the viewer, some more so than others.",

The cast are likable, the vast size of the game world mean Accel World going to be a really long ride (so far the novel have enough material to cover 3 24 episodeseasons.\\n\\n\r\nEach story arc keep pushing you to watch the next episode, I found it really hard to stop watching without finishing an arc.

Well, the anime itself is very good and the theme revolving around it is well put together, the show is still developing so I have no doubt that this will be one of the Top 10 anime's for this year.Let's go on to my opinion based ratings now shall we? :D\r\nStory - 8 \r\nI chose to give the story an 8 because the series is only 24 episodes down the road and as I have stated before, it will onlyget better. But if you guys want a short summary of what this anime is about, I'll try to sum it up.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, Haruyuki Arita  is an average school boy in the year 2046 who has always been picked on and bullied. This eventually comes to a halt after meeting a mysterious girl in his school ( Kuroyukihime ), she eventually introduces him to the program called 'Brain Burst' ; a secret program which allows a person to make time appear to stand still in their surroundings by \"accelerating\" their brainwaves in the real world. This key element changes his life for the better and the worse.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much the introduction of the story, I won't spoil too much for potential viewers.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nI gave the art a solid 10. There's not much to say, but if you've seen the first episode or even a glimpse of what it looks like, you'll understand why =)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nEveryone's voices seemed to fit their character great. The battle scene music is epic. The melancholy background music is also applaud worthy. Overall the sound compliments the art the show delivers with just as much of an impact.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhy did I give the character's an 8? Well to be honest I wish the main character was a little more..how do I say this without offending people, not short and chubby? But that element supports the story a lot by itself other than that, every other character that has been introduced has been very well put together with their different emotions to match their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nIt has failed to disappoint me yet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating - 10 \\n\\n\r\nEverything about this anime seems to break away at generic anime's, it introduces you to a whole new world in more ways than one :'D\\n\r\nI STRONGLY recommend this series to anyone who likes futuristic settings with a bit of romance in their anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Thanks!\r\nStory(3) : The setting is based on Sword Art Online atmosphere, but that doesn't mean it should get an instant 8 rating. There are these technological game devices that can give you god powers in real life like time freezing which seems to ruin the SAO connection. The main character has nonsensical reasons to be trying super hard on a game, come on, its not a life-threatening game like SAO. Also, the antagonist has nonsensical reasons to start taking games too serious and bringing it to the next level. There are a lot of timeswhen the creator of the anime decides to add in random dialogue of minor characters that no one will care about other than for their fan services or insert insignificant dialogue as time fillers. \\n\\n\r\nArt(7) : The art is good. The fan services, yeah okay?\\n\\n\r\nSound(5) : Mediocre, nothing special in this category.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(5) : As mentioned before in the discussion about the story. Characters have nonsensical reasons to try hard in a game, breaking its bonds with SAO with its life-threatening reasons to try-hard in games.\\n\r\nEx : The most popular girl decides to show high affection for a pitiful outcast guy because he has the \"power within\". While the guy already knows a girl who likes him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(3) : I kind of had to skip a bunch of dialogue times that I found insignificant time fillers. I decided to look back at them and went w.t.f. did I just watch. Also face palm a numerous times because of how dumb the characters are for taking the game TOO SERIOUS. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(5) Mediocre : I was drawn into the anime because of people saying this linked to the future of sword art online. The story is poor(sh*t), the art is good, the sound is mediocre, the enjoyment is poor as it doesn't really drawn you into it other than the fact \"THIS IS RELATED TO SAO, CONTINUE WATCHING FOR ANY TRAITS OF KIRITO OR ASUNA.\" which is biased. Personally, if this was the actual future of the world sword art online was set on, I'd never want to see any more of it ever again.",

            "content": "I realize that you can't take very seriously some guy who gives an anime a perfect 10 - you'll probably call me a fanboy, or some such tag. But let me tell you: coming off of my post-Code Geass depression, I've been finding shows that embody what I wanted from Code Geass, and even more. Accel World captures action, humor, art and romance (though unexpected) perfectly - each is balanced in a way that maximizes the show's effect on your heart. It got me over my Code Geass depression (though made me more depressed once it ended - oh well, can't be helped). This showwill not be a waste of your time - and at 24 episodes, why not give it a try?\\n\\n\r\nTake for example the plot line (which I gave a ten... whoops): Code Geass has a wild, confusing plot, due to Lelouch being a (criminal) mastermind. This makes the plot very interesting, and never lets you down by stacking up surprise after surprise. Accel World's plot is less about the complexity of the character (although Arita, Taku and Kuruyikihime are very intelligent players) and more about the complexity of the world they are in: the game that seems to think for itself, and is continuously throwing curve balls at the players. In this way, it is harder to estimate the outcome: you are familiar with Lelouch's mindset and personality, and can somewhat assume what he's up to, whereas you cannot necessarily read a game's facial expression.\\n\\n\r\nThe art makes me want to cry, it's so good. The only thing that bothers me is that they threw away their amazing talents on Arita - he really is... well... un-handsome, if possible. But then again, that just serves the character better. It is easier to understand his hardships with such a vivid visual. Apart from him (and I commend the team for making such a gross sprite) Kuruyikihime and the rest of the cast is beautiful. It screams ANIME, and the duel avatars are also amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, this is not your one dimensional show: while it might be an action show, it is HILARIOUS. My parents kept walking into my room after hearing me squeal, and being like \"You okay there?\" The sexual tension between Arita and basically every single girl never gets old, and his constant antics make me laugh. Also, Kuruyikihime's cool humor caught me off guard a couple of times. And don't forget Chiyu! \\n\\n\r\nThis show is a must watch! It's only 24 episodes, so it will only take a few days out of your busy schedules. Give it a shot!\\n\\n",

His appearance is obviously a code for his timid and weak nature as he is the first character I've seen thatis so short and fat, he looks like a shorter chubbier version of Simon from Gurren Lagann except he also just sooks ALL THE TIME, someone compliments him and he starts crying, he get s a piece of cake and he starts crying, he wakes up most likely crying, it's frustrating but at least the anime holds so many positives that i could get over this.\\n\\n\r\nI like the Concept of the brain blast program that allows people to fight in an MMO style game where they battle to try and keep enough points to 'burst link' in the real world, it basically lets them cheat on tests and be better at sports and stuff making life a lot easier.\\n\\n\r\nonce in the brain burst game, users take on avatars, meaning i can look at  Arita's awesome avatar the 'Silver Crow' instead of him, the fighting was really well done but i wish Arita would stop sooking during fights, it's like he cries and then gets the motivation to fight again after, i preferred the gurren lagann style where they would just get really pumped up about fighting spirit and all that stuff which got you as a viewer pumped up as well, sooking is just annoying as a viewer when it happens every fight.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a good deal of twists and double crossing and all that good stuff that make plots very engaging and dynamic. especially the later episodes when the villian Noumi is introduced, AW did a fantastic job of making you hate him, he's a young brat trying to manipulate your much loved main characters which infuriates youa s a viewer, i wish i could crawl in my monitor and beat him up which means he was very well represented as a villain.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this anime, it had a good blend of action but it's biggest flaw is it's main character which is a shame, if you can get over him (which is easy since the positives are so many) you'll really enjoy it.",

Sure it's in the future and yes it's an anime, but as far as making the world something that feels natural and smooth, it's completely different.\r\n-Story-\r\nThe story of Accel World is that of Haruyuki Arita and how his miserable life is changed by the Virtual Reality game \"Brain Burst\" and a girl known as Kuroyukihime. The premise of the story itself is interesting enough to get people to try out the series, but the way the story progresses is one ofthe flaws of this series. It has it's sessions of high speed progression then slows to a dull walking speed where it seems like it really can't make up it's mind.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nEasily one of the most impressive looking animation sequences of it's season, it stood out graphically among a string of high end animes. The scenery in the series is impressive enough to make you want to use still images of the series as wallpaper.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nI never found myself mesmerized by the soundtrack of the series and found myself skipping through the intro and outro every time. The overal composition and track list isn't impressive enough to me personally to make it memorable in any way, but it did succeed in not making me want to mute the audio every time I did play through the music.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nThis is where the series fails in my eyes. The story is solid, the art is amazing, the aura of the series is robust. The most glaring flaw of the series however is the characters. For the most part, it's hard to relate to the characters and the relationships within the series seem unnatural. Believing that well developed characters make a story able to write itself, it never felt like the characters made the story but rather the story made the characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nThere are plenty of good parts to the series that make it worth at least one play through. There's enough action to make most people happy and enough fan service to keep the pervs happy.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nOverall, I felt like more could have been done to better this series. The first couple episodes were slow, the first 1/3 of the series was great. After that, it slowly went down hill for me. It's well worth at least one play through so if you haven't seen it yet, at least give the first 5 episodes a shot.",

            "content": "Synopsis Overeview\r\nIn the year 2046 the virtual reality is used for almost anything. And Arita Haruyuku (our little chubby hero) is amazing at games, never the less he is in the lowest scale of his school being constantly abused by other students and thus constantly cries about his miserable luck.\r\nBut everything changes when Kuroyukihime, the most popular girl in school introduces him to \u201cBrain Burst\u201d a virtual reality program that grants him the power to stop time, at the same time it gives him an avatar, which he has to use to win battles, and win points, and that\u2019s the catch: If he happens tolose all his points he will lose the brain burst program, and all the memories of ever having it (which in turn means he would be returning to his miserable life).\\n\r\nEvidence for:\\n\r\nAs a shonen anime, is not surprising the battles are very well made, and the plus Sunrise was the producer, is not a surprise to see such an amazing animation, meaning: The battles and the Avatars are plain amazing, with the diversity of powers, dynamic movement, and amazing design. And this also applies to the \u201creal world\u201d animation, though some characters might be something you don\u2019t usually see in this genre (like A chubby little guy being the main character, and his best friend a first badass then whiner still popular guy).\\n\r\nEvidence Against:\\n\r\nEven though Accel world shines in the art an animation, it lacks everything else: All the \u201cPower of friendship\u201d and \u201cYou must stand to stay strong\u201d clich\u00e9 is a little overused. Plus the characters are plain, bland and a bunch of whiners (most of them).\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the plot as it is, doesn\u2019t give any sensation of risk. Even if you happen to lose all your points, you don\u2019t even remember having them in the first place and (as shown in the very last episode) the traits that you gains with the game (courage, sensibility, or anything else) stays with you, so what ends good\u2026 is good right?\\n\r\nAbout the OST, thought very epic is usually subdued by the constant yelling and crying of the characters, or by the same sound effect on the battles. Making it easily forgettable.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime truly shines in its graphics, but the plot, the characters and the sound don\u2019t live to it.\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt (and animation): 10\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 4.8->5\\n",

            "content": "A lot to say about this show but I will try to keep this review short and quick. I believe the first few episodes of Accel world carried the show. Meaning that the world of Accel world was so enticing that even though the story line of the show may have been non inspired, you still were willing to finish out the show based on the strength of the first few episodes. At least that's how I felt. \r\nIt seems that a lot of people didn't like Haru's attitude and look. However, I really related to Haru in a lot of ways. If you knowsomeone or are someone with low self esteem, you are able to say that Haru was not exaggerated at all. Definitely a lot different than his sword art counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the weakest aspect of the first season of Accel world. Like Sword Art, Accel World is able to create an entire world during the few episodes. This is a new world of battle, friendship, rivalry, and defeats. I was very excited about the potential of the possibilities that could arrive because of this game, rules and character. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, these expectations were not met. The first half of the series was okay, the purpose was to mainly get some characters introduced, and understand more about the game. Around the second half of the show is where things really took a turn. For the worst.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain has to be probably the most annoying person that I've ever heard or seen. Every time I heard him speak, I cringed. He had no rational motivation for what he was doing, and his power (in the game) was just too freaking too much..I won't give spoilers..but I really didn't like this villain..and the arc just dragged on and on..it was so tiring and was the ultimate downfall of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on but I'll stop here\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful, I was captivated by the backgrounds and the new world. When Haku started flying for the first time, I was in awe of the scenery below him, it was really well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design were really well done, everything looked really well and fluid. The animation is a high point in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI also like the background music, it fit most scenes perfectly and I think this is a ost worth getting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI like Haru. Yes, there were moment where I facepalmed at his actions but overall, as someone who doesn't have the highest self esteem, I really related to his sentiment shared in the first few episodes, having people look down on you because of your looks. Being so ashamed and believing that you are inferior to others and don't deserve good relationships...I don't share those extreme feelings but in a way I could related. And unless you can, I doubt that you will like Haru.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI also like Kuro, she's intelligent, confident, and caring. She has some very nice characteristics about herself, and is enjoyable to watch. I was kind of wary about her intents first on the show since I just couldn't believe how quickly she fell in love with a fat chubby \"loser\" but her sentiments are real and she's legitimate.\\n\\n\r\nI don't care too much for Taku. He's really really generic, and doesn't really bring any substance to the show. He also doesn't have that much potential to be that interesting unless he self sacrifices himself or something. I don't care too much about his relationship with Chiyu.\\n\\n\r\nChiyu is interesting, I liked her until she got too nosy and started to want to involve herself in the game. It would have been better for her to stay away from it, in my opinion. I think that like Taku, she's a bit generic but at least she has a really good character design and not all of her actions are that predictable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first half of the series a lot, but not so much the second half, I wish that the story line was more inspired and really went deep about the content and mystery surround burst link..but none of that happened.\\n\\n\r\nI still think the show has potential so i look forward to he second season.",

For the sake of all humanity and its hot anime girls...... why the fuck is the main character which the romance is focused on a fat small kid that turns into a pig in the game and a the most beautiful girl loves him. I will be surely to leave an angry comment now don't get me wrong the storyline and the action was great ^_^ but the romance part here is just why the fat kid of all people im just picture it the most beautiful girl in the school making babies with that guy I mean really that would never be possiblebut its just the way it gos so I I was watching this anime but ant help notice how awesome the fighting and the powers were going down it was truly amazing to see mecha type people fighting in brain burst but I think they took it to far with the cat design -_- BUT THIS IS A HORRIBLA ANIME TO WATCH IF YOUR LOOKING FOR ROMANCE AND A GOOD ONE IF YOUR LOOKING FOR ACTION OR THRILLERS. thanks for following me and my reviews.",

            "content": "In my opinion better than the first season of SAO.\r\nAccess World is about this fat middle school student Arita aka Haru as he plays this game called Brain Burst which is an app he got from Kuroyukihime. His avatar is called Silver Crow and he later finds out more about the game as the series progresses. The interesting thing about \"Brain Burst\" is that if the user loses all of his/her burst points the app is deleted instantly and the user won't be able to re-download the game. In addition, the user would forget the existence of the game as a whole. In the beginningHaru is a victim of bullying and can't do anything about it until Kuroyukihime helped him by getting the bullies suspended. After a series of events Silver Crow gains the ability to fly and is the only people in Brain Burst to have that ability. After the first half of the season the plot focuses on a character called Seiji Noumi who blackmails Haru into giving him his burst points so he could help his friend Chiyuri. Seiji's avatar is called Dusk Taker and it's ability is the ability to take away another user's ability or weapon.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some good character relationships in the show, but the best is the relationship between Haru and Kuroyukihime. Now I'm not going to spoil anything, but what she does to him in this show is a testament to how much she loves Haru.\\n\\n\r\nThe one notable character I could remember off the top of my head is Seiji. He is just a despicable character and a really good antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Accel World is great. I really enjoyed the dub for this show.\\n\\n\r\nI overall loved Accel World. It is has everything I love in anime from it's characters, story, animation, character relationships, development, and ending. Speaking of endings Accel World has one of my favorite endings in an anime. It was a very smart ending that made sense and it caught me by surprise on how good the ending was. The only thing that makes me cringe is that there is no season 2 to this amazing anime.  If I had to give my two cents, this show doesn't disappoint and is highly recommended to watch.",

A typical video game anime, but it did have an insecure main character and he grew over time which I thought was nice. I thoroughly enjoyed the action though.\r\nLet me just say that the first half of this anime was VERY boring and I had trouble watching it. It did pick up andthe last half was better. It does not excuse the fact that the first half was very boring. I do like to see incompetent characters grow, but they have to make it interesting. The ending villain was pretty bad too. It was like they tried to make him as much of an asshole as possible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime was pretty good. The action was good so I enjoyed that and I liked most of the characters, but I didn't like how the main character was so dependent on others. He did grow a lot as a character and it was nice to see a different kind of main character instead of always seeing some badass kid. The last half of the anime pulled it up to a 7 or else, I would have given it a 5 or 6.",

Despite falling prey to typical things you would see out of most anime that would take place in a high school/adolescent setting they actually did a great job of making the characters likable, the storyenjoyable, and the pacing steady and consistent to the point that this anime was actually quite addicting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn this anime you have an unpopular and supposedly unattractive high school student that gets made fun of because of his looks so he sinks his time into online games to help him deal with some of the depression he goes through. This all changes when an attractive girl in high school gets interested in his talents in online games and asks him to be a part of this game called Brain Burst. He is unsure of all of this, and thinks he is being used but the two eventually develop feelings for each other throughout the course of this anime but the overall core of this story focuses on this game and his evolution as a person into this game\\n\\n\r\nThe story that revolves around this game is really what makes this anime incredibly enjoyable. They build up a great story inside the world of this game and the constant battles that take place. The action in this anime is top notch and I can't say that I was never bored while watching this anime. There were no episodes that were needless filler and there was literally the right amount of story progression with each episode. They spent the first half of this anime building this online game world with a very interesting premise that focuses on the main female lead of the story and her desire to be the best player in this game but it comes at a tremendous cost that a lot of other players don't want to even entertain that thought.because it may ruin what makes the game enjoyable for so themselves. I really wish they kept to the overall story arc of the first half throughout the entire anime because it seemed really interesting but by the time they got to the second half.of this anime they changed tactics a little bit when they decided to focus on a villain that made the main characters lives very difficult and unbearable and unfortunately because of that the main essence of over-arching story had to take a backseat which is a bit of a crying shame because I wish they would of elaborated on it more because it would of made for some really excellent battle scenes. However, the second half of this anime was still enjoyable because they made the villain incredibly easy to hate and despise. Thankfully the fan-service is kept to a bare minimum.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is what made me really love this anime. All the action scenes were really good in this anime and probably some of the best I've watched yet and they evened out the action with the character building and story telling really well. Fights did not last any longer than what was needed and the characters regardless if they were protagonists or antagonists did not overstay their welcome. I also have to admit that the music for this anime is really good. Both opening songs and the first ending song have made it into my anime playlist.\\n\\n\r\nI think overall the best thing about this anime is that its a perfect example that sometimes things didn't need to be overly complicated for it to be good. The anime is a little bit like .hack but without the philosophy and the preachiness. You have an awesome online world where players battle each other with a wide range of special moves and abilities. The designs for all the different characters in the online world are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a really good series that I got quite addicted to very quickly. I hope we get a little more of the accelerated world beyond just a film and a few ova's which I'll eventually get to.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Arita, Haruyuki\\n\r\nLeast Favorite Character: Kurashima, Chiyuri\\n\\n\r\n9/10 (I Highly Recommend It.)",

Every character looks nice but the main character looks horrible.I think they tried to show that the main character didn't have anything from the beginning and how he achieved everything from each sub stories by defeating his inner problems which we all face everyday, nice concept but didn't work in this show in my opinion. Naruto and one piece were a good example in this matter.....\r\nThe songs were just awesome in the show. Characterwere nice. Story was good. Art was nice. Overall nice but not excellent because they could have even made it better in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end it is a matter of entertainment and if possible whether we learnt something from it to apply in our real life to improve. So was it their in this show ?? \"YES\" So i recommend watching it....   \\n\\n\r\nHope it helped u but common watch it guys....",

            "content": "Accel World suprised me entirely, dynamic battles and an interisting setting \r\nA short and good summary and the first episode couple episodes made me feel like going to watch it overtime because of the technology that shows the anime and taking place in the future where augment reality to virtual world.\r\nHarayuki Arita is the biggest loser in school despite of his appearance. He\u2019s 3 feet tall, morbidly obese, and has a propensity to cry more than your 3-year-old nephew. His character design was too exaggerated; you can still be a loser while having the right body proportions you know?\r\nIf your interested in future  technologyinvolving video games and some other mmorpg this anime will definite good to you. There are action and one of the best fight scene and love scene and some other being friends. Just the thought of the technology they use in anime is a Neuro Linker\\n\r\nthat blows your mind and taking a wish that we have that one.\\n\\n\r\nThat story is great and ends a good introduction from the last episode of the Anime. It goes into depth and covers the viewer needs to understand the main protagonist and the Anime\\n\\n\r\nThe Arts are also great pretty much like the duel avatar designs every character, actions scenes are cool, it all looks great while Silver Crow ( Harayuki Arita Duel Avatar ) is flying.\\n\\n\r\nKuroyukihime the most popular girl in school and has the all knowledge of the Brain Burst and also who saves Harayuki Arita from the bullies and who gives him the game Brain Burst that allows him and others with the game to have the ability to accelerate their capabilities in the real world and face off against other users of the game to compete for Burst Points that allow one use of their \\n\r\nabilities. As I said knowing this character is good, Her goal is to fight all the kings to become level 10 and meet the owner of the game.\\n\\n\r\nAccel World is certainly not all bad, But overall it is an enjoyable anime to watch.\\n\\n",

The first few episodes may seem odd to some people but if you continue to watch it eventually gets better.\r\nThe story is really nice and well placed but it would been better if it went into more details on Kuroyukihime a.k.a Black Lotus but hopefully it will introduce more of her story if theresa second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime can annoy some people at times such as Haruyuki that can seem depressing at times, Chiyu that seems really isolated from everyone else and she doesn't open up much.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art is amazing, the sound effects of the game are really good and the fight scenes will certainly get a hook of you. The background music and background scenes are beautiful and matches with the emotions in that scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall is a brilliant anime that people will love if they a nice story that is quite futuristic but also has characteristic of modern day. Its certain an anime for people that love virtual worlds  \\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is like Pizza that\u2019s been left outside for about 24 hours\u2014not quite a steaming pile of shit but not something that I\u2019d recommend ingesting either.\r\n At its core, Accel World is a mediocre MMORPG, mini-harem, shounen. It\u2019s a tale about a high school loser, Haruyuki, joining a sophisticated VR PvP gaming subculture. Playing this game allows one to slow down time in order to PvP battle, but also lends itself into manipulating real world situations. In addition to gaming for the sake of gaming, Haruyuki follows his stubby little c*** into the \u201cAccelerated World\u201d in hopes of winning the favor of his crushand helping her achieve her goal of becoming the ultimate high ranking player in the game. \\n\\n\r\nThe mediocrity is strong in this anime. It lacks character development and contains many cliches and stupid plot lines. It ultimately fails to be much of anything beyond a waste of time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nClich\u00e9s vs Rules:\\n\r\nA clich\u00e9 is born from lazy, unimaginative writing. It copies something that worked in another setting and clumsily pastes it onto the current one. One example of this in the MMORPG anime context is giving the protagonist a super special in-game power that nobody else has. We saw it in Sword Art Online with Kiritu\u2019s Beta-testing head start and his *ahem* special power pertaining to swords. We saw it in that Dungeon anime where the wimpy protagonist leveled at x10 or whatever the pace of everyone else. Anyway in Accel World we see the same shit where Haruyuki\u2019s character gets a special skill that lets him soar above competition. Convenient, right?\\n\\n\r\nRules are just basic, genre-specific facts that are necessary to the plot to make sense. In this case, it\u2019s a rule that MMORPG anime should have real world stakes. Imagine in Sword Art Online if the solution for escaping the SAO virtual world was\u2026.*Drumroll*\u2026.Logging out?!?! Holy shit man. Boom. All the suspense, urgency, purpose etc. would evaporate. In SAO at least the anime characters were as trapped as the viewers of that shitty world. Accel World it\u2019s just a game. If you lose all of your points you\u2019ll just no longer be able to play that game. No Death, no brain-melting retardation, you just suddenly have a lot more free time to devote to homework. You have these faux emotional scenes were Haruyuki freaks out when he sees his friends slaughtered in the game and you can\u2019t help but roll your eyes. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! DON\u2019T DIE!!!!!!!!! Then the match ends and they get ice cream and talk.\\n\\n\r\nThe unforgivable part of this anime is that they hardly explore the amazing real-world uses for their ability to slow time. Everything is about leveling up and getting a stronger character not robbing banks or setting world records. The conflict in the anime is just juvenile and ultimately uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nRomance Angle: Props for making the main character legitimately physically unattractive. None of this good looking, tall, athletic but can\u2019t seem to get a chick archetype. Haruyuki flat out looks like an Anime Eric Cartman. That being said, their unconventional character design makes the all-too-familiar clich\u00e9 of having the school\u2019s hottest girl throw herself at the MC even more ridiculous. Really? The class president/hottest girl in school/academic prodigy/Miss popular etc gets all hot and bothered watching this chump play virtual squash with a piglet avatar?!?! Fuck! I feel cheated by my high school experience. But seriously, the romance subplot is just lazy and irritating. There\u2019s no chemistry and she does all the work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is absent. \\n\r\nAnimation is acceptable but not great\\n\r\nSound meh\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It\u2019s painfully clear that I\u2019m too old for this. Ignore my opinion if you want and enjoy the rancid Pizza.\\n",

The show is very well written and all the characters, for the most part, are all relatable and believable in the story. \r\nAddressing the main character's design. Haruyuki Arita's character design is not shit. His design is a reflection of his trauma and his scars. He \"unique\" appearance is merely a visual symbol of the isolation the character has with the rest of the reality. So, his design is actually quite well done, and cute looking. Besides, you should judge a person on how they look. Haru's character is very deep andgoes though alot of evolution throughout the show. \\n\r\nHe's a good character, and discrimination the show, just for his looks, would keep you from experiencing this wonderful story with these enjoyable characters.\\n\r\nNow, the ending. Without spoiling it, the ending of the show, while good, doesn't complete the ultimate plot of the series. This is due to the fact that the story continues past the anime in the light novels (which gets even better). But, though more support, Accel World will see a second season. \\n\r\nOverall, This show is amazing and deserves more attention. If you like scifi, good characters, and don't mind a technically unfinished plot, this is a definite watch.",

What anime is this? What kind of protagonist is that? Don't tell me that chibi is the hero?\". That was my questions. After this questioning, I decided to postpone watching it.\r\nTwo weeks later one of my friend suggest me to finish this anime, because he said that it's a good anime. I am not following his suggestion directly, besides I look at some reviews from Youtube andmyanimelist. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I got an amazing result. Most of the reviews I read and watched said that Accel World is even better than Sword Art Online. I said \"Okay, I will finish it. I will prove what the reviewers say\". \\n\\n\r\nAfter watch it. \\n\\n\r\nACCEL WORLD is a good anime. The technology is fantastic and the system of accelerating is great. Accel World timeline is the same as Sword Art Online. It takes place several decades after SAO. Sound effect is nice, Character design is cool, and everything was great. \\n\\n\r\nOnly one reason that makes Accel World just a GOOD anime. That reason is that the story IS NOT OVER YET. Arghhh. I can not wait for another season of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for those who still not watching this anime, WATCH THIS ANIME. If you like SAO, you will like Accel World more. \\n\\n\r\nThat's my review, \\n\r\nplease enjoy the show.\\n\r\nWineZ",

            "content": "\u201cI don\u2019t really want power; I just want to teach you to enjoy the game instead of taking it all so seriously.\u201d\r\nFrom the producer of Tiger & Bunny, arrives another brilliant blend of CGI armour suits. It is colourful, engaging, and entertaining. Accel World has a futuristic setting where The Sixth Sense is commonly used in society; people can dive into networks with their avatar to socialise and more. In a game called Burst Link, known only to a few, characters duel each other to earn points. These points allow the users to accelerate their thought process in real-life, obtain advantages in anything and everything.\r\nWhatmakes this virtual world captivating is the Lord of the Flies, no adult, no rule, canvas. 15 year-olds or below have formed policies and have taken territories in the Accel World. Split into 6 factions, each led by a level 9 King, players fight to complete the game by becoming level 10. Plan and implement strategies, set traps and backstabs make some great turn of events. Fights include 1-on-1, tag duel, faction war, and free-4-all. Each faction sought to recruit players with special or rare abilities.\\n\\n\r\nReferred by his classmates as \u201cthat round thing\u201d, our protagonist is a coward.  Haru\u2019s only escape is \u201cDirect Link\u201d to this virtual world. The protagonist is the biggest threat to the viewers\u2019 enjoyment of this series. He can be as hateable as Shinji from NGE and he has the looks of Morty from Shaman King. The fear of being looked down upon by others prevents him to bring out the best of his abilities, who easily allows his spirit to perish. One exception to this is that Haru is willing to give everything to protect and fight for his King, the girl he falls in love with.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters might appear shallow at first, but each one would reveal more about themselves as the series progress. The characters are stereotypical, and their character development might be labelled as predictable. However, the execution was well done and although the characters can be extremely irritating at times, with the sudden turns of events both on and off the battlefield, their actions can make you change your opinion of them very quickly. New characters are introduced often to spice things up, creating problems as well solving problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is colourful and bright, animation is smooth and fluid. Sparks and other lighting particles are a bonus. The opening song is rejuvenating, and the soundtracks change to set the mood, blood-boiling techno in fight scenes which varies in relation to the stages the characters fight on; bright or dark tunes can be heard for their respective scenes. Fanservice include panty shots, shower scenes and grabbing breasts, not too excessive. A negative is that characters sound more mature than their supposed age.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 virtual Avatars are not as detailed as they could have been, considering the use of CGI. It would have been better to have the designs less rigid, less android, but more erratic and free-flowing. It would have been rewarding to rid of such restrictive metallic armouring that many Avatars have in keeping to the mecha feel, having said that, we do see some better designs that are more freestyle, which give the artists more room for creativity and fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are reasonably well done. Lots of fights are long ranged; those that are in close quarters tend to be a bit rushed or are animated in black flashes. The build-ups to battles give a sense of anticipation. When characters tell a story, it feels like I am going to learn something new and very interesting. The suit-upgrades, new power-ups, and new attack moves make me eagerly wait for the next act.\\n\\n\r\nThemes include trust, betrayal, romance, and jealousy. Although, the series is set in a school environment, majority of scenes take place out of it. This makes the school affairs interesting when they do happen, and the change of surroundings makes the world more believable. Accel World has a fantastic concept. It could have made itself more unique by expanding the concept of territorial wars, in both the virtual world and real-life (which it tries). Behind the avatars and their elevated fights in this virtual game, laying all your honour to fight without regret is the essence of what Accel World conveys. If you want to see a colourful and entertaining shounen in a sci-fi setting with hints of fanservice, this is a great series to go for.\\n\\n\r\nAre you \u201cready to lose gloriously?\u201d\\n",

            "content": "Story: 6/10\r\nI'm going to start by saying that I have not read the manga for this or played the VN if there was one.\r\nThe plot line for Accel World was a bumpy road for me. It was really all over the place. The first episode was nice because it really pulled me in, but then from there to about episode 5 there was really no action and it was all talk. It bore me up to the point where I actually dropped this series while it was airing. I only decided to pick it up because I'm on holidays and wanted something recent to watch.Anyways getting back to the story, I'm just going to be honest and say that I didn't like it. While watching I felt bored and felt like I was just watching it because I wanted to finish it, not because it was amazing. Usually the first season is the one that attracts all the viewers, but if Accel World ever gets another season, I have a feeling that I'll enjoy it more. If there's anything that this story lacked, it was action. For an anime called Accel World and which is all about accelerating, you'd think there would be more action. I'd say it was 90% talking, 10% fights. The fights weren't anything inspiring either.. I found myself predicting what would happen numerous times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nBeing an anime about a whole virtual world, there were tons of characters introduced. There still remains several unrevealed back stories especially for one of the main characters, so at the end of it all you're still left with tons of questions. There certainly were a ton of characters that just disappeared throughout the story and could have used some more screen time. I don't really know what to say, I just feel like everything was poorly planned out. There's so much darkness.\\n\r\nEven though it was 24 episodes I felt like I only watched 5.\\n\r\nThe girls were OP and the guys were wimps. In the future I predict it'll be the opposite though. But for this particular season it was saddening.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\r\nI didn't particularly grow found to either of the two opening or ending songs for Accel World. I feel like music didn't suit the videos or the anime. The background music was also sub-par, I can't even remember a single tune even though I just finished watching all 24 episodes in a row. It was plain and random.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was nice, and the girls were cute ^.^\\n\r\nThat's pretty much what got all the points.\\n\r\nThe boys however.. tsk tsk tsk..\\n\r\nI can't say that there were any \"cool\" male characters that aired in this anime.\\n\r\nIt was complete female dominance. Not that I have a problem with that but..\\n\r\nSeriously, all the girls were OP and the guys were helpless wimps. Of course they're going to become stronger in the long-run but for this particular season it was unfortunate. The background art was okay, nothing really unusual or striking/notable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nMy overall feeling at the end of Accel World was, \"meh\". It was good, but nothing amazing. There wasn't a single time where I had that feeling like, \"OMG I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEXT EPISODE\" it was all.. meh. Whenever suspense would build up, it would always end in a mediocre way. I should have just continued watching it weekly because I kind of feel like I wasted my time with this. At the moment I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone, but I have a small hope for a second season that will be much better. There was so much juicy stuff that was left out and waiting to be revealed and I can't wait to see that.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL RATE: 33/50 (7/10 on MAL)\\n\r\n\"Meh\" anime. Wasn't amazing. Felt like a waste of time, especially being 24 episodes.\\n\r\nI dropped it while it was airing for a good reason I suppose.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, all the good stuff that I wanted to see was left out and unmentioned for now...\\n\r\nHOWEVER!\\n\r\nTons of potential left for a sequel that could make all of this worthwhile.\\n\r\nHopefully the manga-readers are enjoying it, because the rest of the story is what I'm interested in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReccomendations:\\n\r\nIf you liked Accel World, or even if you didn't, I recommend the following anime...\\n\\n\r\n- Sword Art Online -\\n\r\nIt's pretty much the exact same thing.. but better. And the music is waaaay better.\\n\r\nAccel World is in the future of SAO... So this is kind of like the prequel.\\n\\n\r\n- [C] The Money of Soul and Possibility Control -\\n\r\nThis is a 11 ep anime but it has everything. A great story, characters, and a very nice ending.\\n\r\nIt's also about a guy who fights in \"another world\"\\n\\n\r\n- Guilty Crown -\\n\r\nFuturistic? Check, Awesome? Check, Derpy protagonists? Check, Awesome female protagonists? Check, Rival childhood friends? Check, Awesome seiyuu? Check!! What else is there to list?\\n\r\nMost of the seiyyuu are the same as well~",

            "content": "First off, this series IS NOT FINISHED! Well the anime is, but it is an adaptation from a manga so it has that \"anime done read manga next\" feel to it with an open end. That being said, the story was NOW getting really good. \r\nThe animation is great, the battles visually EPIC and the coloring was beautiful. Even the drawings of the characters were satisfactory....I mean they were pretty and cute, hell even the main fat guy character was attractive (i don't mean that in a sexual or wierd way....usually when anime draw fat character they make them HIDEOUSLY GROSS...few animes have drawnattractive fat people....this show did it well). \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was EPIC....the battle music was really well done that you got drawn in.....perfect synchronization; voice acting was also excellent and the OP and ED (both) were nice....including the videos that went with it.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters and story. The plot is interesting. Ever since Hack// a good few animes have been trying to adopt a virtual reality plot, many have failed...some succeeded. This succeeded. The characters are basically Kuro-Yuuki-Hime (black snow princess) whose real name nobody but Arita knows. Arita...fat self-loathing but okay protagonist (little hint of annoying at times), Chi-chan (surprisingly cool character except for the second arc where u kinda wanted ta kill her until the last episode where u were like \"OOOHHHH, DAMN...WHAT SHE DID WAS EPIC...5 stars for her\") and Takku who despite starting off cool, became a GIGANTIC TOOL for about 2 or so episodes, then returned to being one of the most likeable characters and comedy relief \"THE PROFFESSOR\". The cast is kind of steriotypical...i.e.e they aren't innovative...it's the normal \"COOL SENPAI/LOVE INTEREST WITH WICKED POWERS\", \"CHILDHOOD FRIEND/LOVE INTEREST\" and \"CHILDHOOD/BEST FRIEND/RIVAL\". But they did have some character development, very little in the way of kuroyuukihime unless you count her development of falling in love....but I don't really see that as much for her. Arita's self confidence is a bit annoying, his manner of giving up and doing nothing at times gets you annoyed, BUT when he gains resolve it can be REALLY EPIC, and well...the guy could stop crying like ALMOST EVERY DAMN EPISODE. Taku was annoying at first, he then became cool, and loyal and important. He was actually funny to see at times for being the \"brain\" of the group. Not much was done for Chi-chan in the first half of the series, except for her obvious love for the main character while having a boyfriend already. I MEAN SHE WAS PRACTICALLY BEGGING THE DUDE TO MAKE A MOVE ON HER...in the ending episodes (21 or 22 or something) she literally ASKED FOR IT...sorta! She was likable enough, and her role in the second arc was important, her method of carrying it out was EXTREMELY ANNOYING, but well the last episode really redeem her....or I should say *SPOILER* she didn't really need redeeming at all *SPOILER END*.\\n\r\nThe show was a romance/harem....although harem isn't the actual genre it would fit into, the main character had 2 girls gunning for him, with a few other \"POSSIBLES\"...and he was fat/short.....which makes it UNIQUE for this genre. That being said, it focuses a lot on the action, the bad guy for the second half was REALLY detestable which was a GREAT thing....and the development for both Arita and Taku was done quite well. \\n\r\nThe PROBLEM however was this show is part of a long running shonen series....what I mean by that is, it has way too many things TO BE COVERED to just be 24 episodes, making you feel EXTREMELY INCOMPLETE. The romance aspect could be pushed aside since that is SORTA KINDA RESOLVED THOUGH NOT REALLY YET SATISFACTORY, but the action and the story development WAS NOW GETTING STARTED. Because of this, the show could have gotten a 8 or even 9/10...or depending on how great the story developed maybe even closer to 10 itself BUT since it was incomplete it CANNOT get more than a 7...and that's being generous. ONE LAST THING....PPL CRIED TOO MUCH IN THIS SHOW....\\n\\n\r\nThat said....I recommend this series as definite watch....not collection material, but something that SHOULD be watched as it was GOOD. IF there is access to the manga, then I suggest reading the manga instead IF the manga is anything like the anime (didn't read the manga so I don't know....but basically if the manga is a continuation of the anime then it is better to read the manga).",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\nThe story for this anime is very interesting. An accelerated world where 3 years in the accelerated world is 1 day in the real world. The protagonist at first seems very pitiful, but as the anime progresses he becomes a perverted harem master. No joke here. The pace is good, because it doesn't have fast transitions or DBZ paced episodes. Although you would be curious of what will happen to the protagonist after the end of the series, I think this 24 episode anime was well worth it.\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe art of this animation was good, because the fighting scenes were flowing, and the designsfor the characters were alright. I don't what to say in this section of the review, but all I could say is that the designs and art were good enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI liked both OP and ED. The sounds were perfect and you could enjoy listening to it. Can't comment too much on this one either, cause I didn't pay attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI'm gonna cut this short, but characters were alright. Not much development but new characters were introduced just to be part of Haru's harem. The character that I liked would probably be Takumu, because of how his loyal friendship creates his character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nNot something to get hyped about or eager, but something that is worthy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIt was a good anime.

            "content": "Accel world, the anime that ran parallel to Sword Art Online, shares the same manga creator and also the same universe in different time settings - Accel World staging a few decades after Sword Art Online. While there are no connections in the story line's, I feel that the author has a plan to connect the two. I hope that is how it goes.\r\nNow coming to the anime itself, there is a sure sore reason to avoid watching it for many people - namely being incomplete akin Claymore and so many other names that come to mind. However it ends well - more like Claymoreagain, ending at a sturdy arc rather than leaving things totally open like Deadman Wonderland graciously did.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well done - it, for me has a concise plot that has been defined in the first few episodes and all that is left for the story telling elements and character intrusions to define the anime. The setting is futuristic of the believable nature, not the super cyborgs or flying spaceships type, a big plus for me. Now what made it an enjoyable anime for me is that it connects story line elements well, most episodes themselves have a connection to the main story unlike Cowboy Bebop where many episodes can be considered from a standalone point. They give background but such that is relevant to the over all complexity of the universe. Not saying Cowboy Bebop lacks due to that trait, just saying I find it a plus in AW.\\n\\n\r\nIt has its share of light comedy moments, serious events and action, neither of the three overdone for me. The procession at certain points is certainly a little hasty for my taste however it does not compare how Sword Art Online messed up and it dismays me to see Accel World rated as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot points were very intriguing for me, they build tension and there was a fair share share of plot twists given the length of the anime. There were of course a few shounen elements but for me they weren't that big a distraction. So, alongside the disappointment of no sequel, I felt satisfied in having watched the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt was good. The colors were bright with shading well done and shadows handled well, the scenes were crisp and beautifully depicted. The character design's were good - other than the main protagonists who seemed too far off believable proportions but the other characters stuck more or less to proper proportions and those proportions thankfully did not vary with camera angles.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting sequences and the stages affiliated with Accel World itself were GOOD, each had its own ambiance with details properly handled and fighting sequences were equally well handled. There kept the fights flashy and vibrant resorting to style rather than the comparatively realistic scenes one witnesses in Requiem for a Phantom. Just to add a note, realistic fighting sequences can be tantalizing like in Shigurui - at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also came as a big plus since they felt synchronized with the scenes, they reflected the mood at the moment and were not just fillers in the background. That for me made the anime quite enjoyable and added a certain charm to it.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I comment on the characters, I'd like to say that if I based this around whether I like a char or find him/her pathetic then it would be a different story however I will judge whether a character makes sense, is defined properly with their traits believable and whether they are crafted as reflections of typical Shounen characters with no additional originality or have something good. To give an example I found Mayuri from Steins;Gate a... well not a well crafted character.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'll say it bluntly - the main character is pathetic, reminds me of Amano Yukiteru from Mirai Nikki which is not a good thing. Haru lacks self confidence and considers the situation from a pessimistic way when the matter pertains to any positivism related to him. However that is justified and while I hate such personalities, the traits are believable - there are people very similar to his personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the personalities fit well in as well - they each have certain traits to them, sarcasm, humor, manner of speech which make them not very interesting characters but in no way is that boring. They do have unique traits that make them stand out yet not too much. So over all the character development is well done - you see them not only as a couple of repetitive notions of justice or goodwill but see them in a broader light.\\n\\n\r\nOne another positive that relates to the art as well is that there are no super endowed women in the anime and especially the main females in the series are just... fine in that manner.\\n\\n\r\nOver all I enjoyed the anime a lot - it kept me wondering what will happen next, got me angered, not as in making me hate the anime but making me anxious over how the story proceeds which is a good thing since animes rarely get me anxious. In the end I was wishing for more but not disappointed as I was with SnK. There were few draw backs to it that I wouldn't want to discuss since they will give spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nSo for people who like gadgets and are into networks, hacking and a little futuristic stuff, it is a really good anime if you can just accept the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nHope you like my review and feedback is always welcome!",

Due to the technology, it can also modify all you 5 senses an put you in a virtual world. Think Google glasses meets The Matrix. The story dives into an unofficial fighting game called Brain Burst that allows the players to be inaccelerated state. The tech concept by itself deserve some attention. Outside of the tech, it's the feel-warm kind-of story with typical themes like friendship, trust, not giving up, etc, with sprinkles here and there as pointers for the doujin community. ;-)\\n\\n\r\nAt least for now, you have the weak but cute and persistent main character, the loli love interest, the good looking best friends (with one turning into a handsome megane chara). Either you love them or you don't. Clearly not many people are too fond of the main character, Haruyuki Arita. He is drawn comically compared to the rest of the characters, but that is true to the source material, the light novel (although I think the anime made him shorter than the manga, which is unfortunate). But the story development itself, paired with the tech, are too fascinating to ignore. Due to the medium, the anime doesn't convey some of the background and subtle points for the character that are present in the light novel. I guess it falls back to most common conception how \"the book is better than the movie.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous. Backgrounds and the environments are highly detailed. The augmented reality UI, and duel avatars, the VR worlds, all are top notch. As expected from Sunrise. I'm still amazed how though-out the augmented reality UI is (the mail inbox notification, the logging out process, the awesome file transfer gesture, etc). \\n\\n\r\nIt's been a while since I enjoy an anime this much. As a gadget geek, I'm truly fascinated with the tech. The unusual yet loveable main character, the cute avatars, the feel-warm story, gorgeous art, awesome music, it's hard for me not to be addicted to Accel World. If you have interest in Accel World, make sure to check out the manga, and even the light novel, as they will enrich and make the Accel World's world even more enjoyable.",

            "content": "Okay i already knew this anime from long time ago, but i think its a bit of childish anime earlier so i skip it. But after i heard lot of ppl spoke about this anime and most of all after i heard that Kuroyukihime is Kirito and Asuna' daughter and Accel World can be considered sequel to SAO (its airing time is almost at the same time), yes i dont know its some sort of fan prediction its true or not but they say Kuroyukihime is Their Daughter and after have been watched this anime, yes, SAO and Accel World is connected and Accel Worldsetting is year 2046, 23 years after SAO which is year 2022, both SAO and Accel World are adapted from LN and i dont know anything about LN. Its really poke my curiosity the most so ill give it a try. Also one of its Studio Producer is a Sunrise, i like Sunrise anime like Gundam Seed, Sookyu no Fafner, etc.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 6\\n\r\nEhm, i wouldnt comment much here, if i add anything positive im sure anime criticizer will hunt me down xD. Emm there are some flaw point that i can pinpoint from my point of view, all of them are considered fatal -_-\\n\\n\r\n1. I really hate male protagonist here, yes thats right that Arita Haruyuki :/ from what i see he is just bunch of Fatass, Idiot, Clumsy, Coward, Inconsistent, Careless, Fool, Careless, Inattentive, full of nonsense bull of talk, even at point when he showed his positive side in anime when he showed his courage, what i can see is just hes just blabbering bullshit everywhere -_- and talk too much. He is really idiot and u can see almost all of the main conflict in story solely only caused by his own stupidity and he keep repeat and repeat it again, goosh. Usually protagonist in Anime is not someone perfect and have many weakness, but as story goes we can see how he overcome that weakness and grow stronger, but i cant see that in this anime, hes full of weakness and deep scar, but he cant impress me with change he made even he tried so hard as story goes. I cant believe it, even idiot protagonist like naruto cant be this stupid, i dont like naruto, but this guys is the worst >.< and ONE more [SPOILER] I CANT STAND the way his relationship with Kuroyukihime goes, hes like a pet, idiot lackey and Hime is a leader, its scratch the pride of the MAN! [SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\n2. Kuroyukihime, should be the female protagonist here, but i cant see her shining in the story, shes just in the back, the way i see shes just a spectator and commentator, even though she is more reliable than Haruyuki, she is more careful and thoughtful.\\n\\n\r\n3. U guess it, yes there is a big hole in the story, just like SAO. Its a bit different from SAO though, its not overleaping story, Accel World story still tight and not leaping but more to so little to a whole story, yes i can see this anime just cover so little of the whole story, so tiny tiny and so little story thus we cant get grip of the main essence of the story. What we expect is dissapointment, mockery, dissatisfied, anger, and WHat THe??THats ALL this STORY goes??.[SPOILER] And Anime MAKES it WORST by telling us HOW BIG and so many things not yet done in Accel World, story still didnt cover all of the 7 kings, story just stop when they are level 4 or 5, story just stop at few enemies THATS all :( [SPOILER]. I dont know anything and never read LN, but just like SAO i think its common issue for all continuing LN/Manga adapted anime series, in general because LN story not yet finish and Anime schedule so tight and short, they must make one choice of two, its either to cover so little of the story and force ending it makes it force conclusion in the end with last word like \"There will be plenty of obstacle we must overcome ahead but we wont give up\" or anything like that, or its the worst they make whole new ending that totally different from LN/Manga series that will provoke the spectator the worst xD. But all in all dont make things exaggerated, i already know this issue and understand this long ago, just accept in and find other enjoyment in Anime we watch, there are plenty of way to enjoy this great Anime :)\\n\\n\r\n4. Emm i dont know if any of you will recognize this as much as i do, but its really annoying for me. This anime story is so inconsistent, my logic keep contesting and some of them even makes me laugh and i recognize it at several spot in the anime like \"Why they do that, its really simple should be like this..\",\"Hey why is it like that, from the prev eps, its not possible and should be like this\", etc. One example [SPOILER] special move gauge need to be recharged before use special move, but i cant see Lime Bell recharging her special gauge to use her special move Citron Call at some scene, and also last conflict they dont want to tell Kuroyukihime but in the end Kuroyukihime forced to help and knew it, DAFUK why didnt u guys tell her from the start -_- [SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nArt here is the best i can say that, all colors so vivid, scenery even the most complex can be built and the detail so smooth. Especially since this anime takes place setting in ideal future world with so many enhanced technologies. The Chara design here is the best also, all so proportional and cute and moe :3 well maybe its not mature anime taste but i love moe :3\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nSound yes yes good and great, no comment here. Backsound great, OP and ED song nice, sound effect clear. And i can sense something here, u guess what?? do u know that Accel World use many FINAL FANTASY 8 backsound in peaceful situation, i know it any my ear wont betray me :D\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nAs stated earlier, chara design is the best here no comment good just good. Character depth involving that 4 main char is also great, all conflict circling involving different tought of that 4 main char so nice and since in this anime tells u so many of heart scar, mental scar, fear, anxiety so its very touching [SPOILER] because ur duel avatar is the manifestation of ur heart or so they say :D [SPOILER]. All supporting chara also good and enough explaining about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7\\n\r\nHmm, despite the story so dissapointing, there are many other things that i enjoy. First, even though there is a big hole in the story, if i focus on the story that was covered, this anime picture it very well and also touching for me, conflict is nice and enough bring me enjoyment. Second, what is it? of course its moe moe :3 well even though its not the main features that provided here well at least i enjoy it, the art, i love it very much :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 6\\n\r\nWell, i know that some of you probably hate this anime, because there are ton of flaws in the story, u cant enjoy much from the story, i know i know but there are also some plus in this anime, we must also see the good point from anime not keeping judge and mock it from its bad point. I already know from the start this anime weakness as much as other continuing LN/Manga adapted anime, so i get past through it and see other aspect to enjoy this anime. Hmm overall score 6, i hope i wont give too much score on this anime. Happy animeing, peace regard and out.",

            "content": "Accel World is based on a light novel series of the same name, and takes place in a futuristic universe where virtual reality is commonplace. It tells the story of a boy, Haruyuki, and his discovery of a game called \"Brain Burst.\" The game allows a player to assume a virtual identity and defeat others in-game in order to gain points and use them to 'accelerate' (slow down time) in real life.\r\nAW\u2019s storytelling definitely isn't perfect, but in spite of its faults, it manages to be incredibly enjoyable. The battle sequences are great, and the protagonists are easy to root for. I'd recommend it toanyone looking for a fun series that focuses more on action than logic.\\n\\n\r\n| Story: 5 | Art: 10 | Sound: 9 | Character: 5 | Enjoyment: 9 |\\n\\n\r\nRead on for the full review. Warning: contains mild spoilers.\\n\\n\r\n= = = = = = = = = =\\n\\n\r\n- The Universe -\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\nAfter watching the first few episodes, my interest was piqued: the premise--real-life underdog getting his chance to become a knight in shining armor via a virtual game--seemed decent, and the universe/setting was constructed well. Despite its generic school setting, AW maintained a futuristic theme, complete with holographic interfaces and thought-sharing cables. Virtual reality certainly isn't a novel concept, but AW pulled it off by combining it with modern school life themes. It's an interesting mix, and it sets AW apart from series like Sword Art Online or Btooom!, which delve entirely into the virtual aspect of their storylines. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nLike most shounen series, AW had a tendency to introduce new rules/abilities and reveal hidden information as the show progressed. For the most part, these \"game changers\" happened within the virtual side of the anime--the Accelerated World. Because of the world's RPG-like system, you'd think that the reveals would've made sense, since leveling up in an RPG amounts to gaining new abilities and information anyway. However, a lot the new abilities and information in AW felt more like cop-outs/deux ex machina that were just there to advance the plot, rather than enhance the universe.\\n\\n\r\n- The Story -\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime was wonderful in terms of storytelling. Brain Burst and the Accelerated World were useful devices for facilitating character development, and it was nice to see the bonds between the characters evolve as they interacted with each other both in the Accelerated World and real life. Haruyuki's transformation from a rookie Burst Linker to the famed aviating Silver Crow was fun to follow, and it was nice to see him being trained by other characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nLoose ends. A lot of them. I understand that the producers wanted to follow the plot of the light novel, but the shift in the story halfway through was a bit jarring. The goal established at the beginning of AW was to help Kuroyukihime defeat the other kings and reach Level 10. However, the second arc of the anime had KYH on a school trip, detached from most of the action. AW introduced a new antagonist and focused on the Haru/Taku/Chiyu trio\u2019s efforts to defeat him. KYH was only brought back at the very end, to provide assistance in the final battle.\\n\\n\r\n- The Characters -\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\nCharacter interactions were fun to watch, and AW had plenty of quirky figures. No character with an important role had a one-dimensional personality. KYH in particular was my favorite character in the series--beautiful, badass, and one hell of a Legion Master.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nThere was little character development, and a few characters were introduced without any backstory whatsoever. As well, Haruyuki didn't change as much throughout the series as I'd hoped. (Even one of the post-series OVAs spoofed his low self-confidence.) The series began with him as someone whose sense of self worth relied only on how powerful he was in the virtual world, and sadly, it seemed as though that trait didn't change, even towards the end of the show. During the second arc, he got his wings stolen by the main antagonist. After this happened, he fell into a depression and henceforth felt as though his wings were the only reason why KYH kept him around. KYH was clear about her adoration for him, but he never gained enough confidence to reciprocate her feelings. That was probably one of the series' biggest disappointments.",

I intend to finish the anime, just cause I don't like leaving things half finished, but oh my god...it's getting painful.  Each episode is getting more and more boring than the last.\r\nPros? Great animation, cool armor design and what not.  On a fundamental level, it's cool.\r\nCons? Everything else.  Story is lame, characters are extremely two dimensional and lame, and without anything to back up the cool armor, it's just extremely boring.  I'd constantly put off watching the anime, cause although people said it was good, I just hadthis feeling that it it was nothing more than it's original premise, and my assumptions were, again, right.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime, it feels like this guy just doodle some awesome armors and thought \"Huh, I should animate this.\" without any consideration for what a good anime actually requires, that primarily being a story and characters of at least SOME note.

He is honestly the Biggest Negative in this anime. From start to finish hes crying and whinning he wants to change but he really doesnt. (If only he was a regular sizedanime character with normal eyes the anime could be a point higher)(They also show an almost completely unclothed 11 and 13/14 yearolds. so yeah)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - If you are a Sadists and like watching the main character breakdown, suffer, and cry his eyes out youll be hooked from start to finish. If you hate hearing him cry and bitch dont bother with this anime(and the fact he yells also can also get on your nerves)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - The big let downs to this anime is the fact the Story goes nowhere after episode 4(besides lvling up a little) and the Main character is a huge(litterally) turn off.",

Definitely not a plus in my book.  I can tolerate pussy characters AS LONG AS THEY DEVELOP AND GET BETTER.  yes we can see some development with the mc but he is still giving me this vibe that he has not changed a bit on the inside.  How he creates harem,the world will never know.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story then drags on and on with uninteresting arcs of him trying to protect his girl and him failing so on so on... he finds himself in all these uncomfortable and cliche ecchi situations.  Okay, let's be honest. I really don't mind ecchi clich\u00e9s.  In fact I would say I borderline enjoy them.  But this anime...is the kind of anime that will give you tits on your screen but the way it ends up to that outcome and the dialogue that goes before these romantic comedy scenes is just cringey.  I'm sorry. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were good yes, but overall I just found the plot very uninteresting and nothing was unique.  \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict? If you can stand a fat kid whining about getting stronger every episode, then yes you can make it through this anime.  If you don't have that kind of skill, I suggest you stay away.",

The sotry disgusting, each episode ends strong and leaves a strong expectation in you, to be disappointed in the next. \"Intrigues\" between tha charapter in the school and out side is are a exaggerated. Meybe in real life the main charapter \r\nwould have clinical depression or mental problems. The Kuroyukihimes ambitions are caused by problems, but for 24 episodes it does not solve them, even deepens them and transferred to other characters making their lives more difficult. The anime is bad novel/drama rating is based on \"virtual reality\" put there, which is the only thing attracting new viewersof this animes disaster. The only good thing in anime is the first opening. Watching this anime just lost my time, all the while expecting a amazing end but in the end I was disappointed that I gave a chance anime. The anime score is 7.63, making it one of the most overrated animes ever. \\n\r\nOn the other hand anime is teaching us to be tolerant with people like Haruyuki,   because we know that in every school there is one.",

            "content": "So this is my very very first review after watching quite a bit of anime but... here it goes:\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis story has a really good concept, considering it came from the same author as SAO.  The idea of having VR games and the like just sparks my geeky nerdy side.  I can't quite pinpoint it cause I am not much of a judge of storylines as of yet, so I apologize for my lack of depth in this part of the review, I promise to be more descriptive with the other parts.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nComing from someone who is used to watching anime from the90s, I seriously thought that the artwork for this anime was quite exquisite.  Although, the fight scenes could be a little bit more animated but hey who am I to judge. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat really drew me into this anime besides the story concept was the music.   Music that somewhat fits the scene is a plus and I say this anime hit it on point MOST of the time. I've watched some anime where the music was good but its timing was so off that it ruined the entire scene, so this was a pretty good improvement.  I also enjoyed the ending and openings of this anime which is another thing that drew me in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay this is where I can get really critical.\\n\\n\r\nNothing irks me more than MCs who are either stupid, whiny, or any of the sort like that.  Now I don't mean for the MC to be a  perfect character like Kirito from SAO (too perfect is not a good thing either!) and I'm really tolerant when it comes to level of perversion and stupidity.  But Arita Haruyuki falls under the category of MCs that annoy me.\\n\\n\r\nBiggest gripe: He's whiny. I mean its already bad enough that he's half the size of the other characters, but to make his personality just as bad as his outer appearance is just overkill.  Although there are times where he grows a pair and actually shines, but most of the time, he's either crying or whining over something that he had/lost like a little kid or realizing that shit just isn't going his way (being in Jr High in the anime timeline doesn't make it any better). I don't mean to sound mean but his school avatar of a pig pretty much fits him haha.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are pretty likeable in my opinion, although some of their actions still leave me asking.... why you do that?? *ahem* Chiyu *ahem*.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE 11/17/2013: After rewatching this series, I now understand what Chiyu did what she did... But man did it make me not like her for the longest time.  I also gave myself a mental whipping for missing important info such as this.  But my overall rating for this anime does not change.\\n\\n\r\nThough my favorite has gotta be Kuroyukihime: dark past, and trying to repent for what she did is a good basis for an MC.... butttt she isn't the MC so oh well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though it had an awesome storyline, maybe storytelling could've been better, the art and the sound is good enough to keep me going but the character mainly Arita is what ruined the anime for me.  His constant crying and hating on himself just made me really agitated that I was close to dropping the anime, but stuck to it cause I don't like leaving any anime unfinished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nGave it a 5/10 all because characters are what drives the show, if a half-assed character exists then that person either better develop into some bad ass by the middle-end of the series or you just eave the viewers going \"wow eff this MC man\".\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I have not read the light novels so I don't know how accurate the anime was to the original source but this was my two cents.",

            "content": "Ok, first time anime review writer here!\r\nI won't go into detail about what all goes down for this anime, you can get wikipedia to do your dirty work for that.  Just to give you a personal opinion from a slightly biased p.o.v., I'd love to say that it is the first anime that has gotten me that addicted feeling in a while.  I've started and stopped countless anime's before this, but this one (once you let your self watch past the first episode) takes you for a ride in which every episode ends with a cliff hanger.  Sure the main character ischubby, but he is probably the only character who doesn't look like a model in the show.  Sure the artwork lacks the most detailed and colorful pictures you have ever witnessed in anime, but its not like they are down right crappy!  They are above average in my opinion as is the music.  It doesn't have that iconic song that you can put with your favorite anime but the music plays toward your emotions, escpecially the later couple of episodes when the main character/s reveal more of the plot to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that makes this anime one of my favorites to date is that it has that predictable feeling yet you can't really guess how exactly the plot is going to play out, and it is a feel good anime unlike alot of others.  Besides that, the anime isn't very long (24 episodes) and if you start now, you'll only get through 5 episodes which is about 2 and a half hours of your time.\\n\\n\r\nJust thought I'd point out that you shouldn't judge an anime by its cover, because this one could possibly (and I know this is kind of a stretch) get good enough to where you'll relate it to the like of Death Note or Lelouch.  I'm not saying it will be, and I can see how the main character can put you off, but just give it a chance and hopefully you'll NOT prove me wrong:)",

(I like the cute voice though) What I like most about this anime is that the main character is not exactly good-looking and long-legged like every other anime. It gets better when you find out the thing about the main (girl) character since shesbeautiful. Overall I really liked it but near the middle of the series, it gets really intense, and it hurts me in my soul yet it keeps making us wait for like 3 or 4 episodes.",

It wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either\r\nThe main character which is a little chubby loser encounters the most popular girl in school, popular girl changes his life, and they work together to accomplish a certain goal. Yes, thats how I percieved the anime, but its probably just me hating on the main character, but seriously he whines about how much of a loser he is like every flippin episode!! The idea of accel world wasn't bad though. So basically Accel World is a cyber world where characters transform to a metal suited avatar based on their mental scars. The avatarshave 6 different colors and each have different meanings (if you want to know more watch the anime! Lol) oh and the funny thing is chubby the main character (haruyuki) happens to be the only avatar that has a certain ability and certain color that has showed up in the history of Accel World. Well I guess that was his advantage of being the biggest loser. Ofcourse there are some fighting involved in order to get points that can be used as an advantage in the real life, but the downfall as usual is if you lose all your points your memory will be erased about the game. So basically a loser turns into a hotshot, The popular girl (Hime) teaches him how be a boss, friends and supporters help along the way, some twisted enemy appears and boom. Overall as cliche as the story sounds, I'll still give it a six, not gonna lie but I actually enjoyed the series, if you try to get pass the flaws of the main character (which I still haven't, because I just dont like him lol) then its an alright anime to pass your time with.",

            "content": "Accel World. The dream of every anime-addicted gamer. With a story that revolves around a game that could affect your entire life, why wouldn't it be? Now let's move on. To provide you with a quick summary of the story, it revolves around Haruyuki, a fat, midget crybaby who always gets bullied. But then, he meets kuroyukihime, the beautiful student body president who is also actually a player of the game Brain burst. She then discovers Haruyuki's hidden talent at fast-based games, and so the story begins.\r\nStory: the story is beautiful, although not perfect. As a anime based on the concepts of a game, ithas certain inconsistencies, like for example, in a normal match, your body can be torn into a million pieces, yet in the second match your body would be as good a new but for some reason, some characters never grew back their limbs.  Although such things are present, they aren\u2019t that big of a deal that they could ruin the story. Now on to the good stuff. The good of the story is that it is clear and not confusing unlike other animes. It gives enough questions and cliffhangers to keep you interested and excited but not so much that the story turns into a complete mush. Overall i give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt : to put it simply, the animation was beautiful. The anime was wonderfully animated, giving a lot of detail to the character and the environment, which changes in almost every episode. But the thing that amazed me most is the amount of detail they put into the fight scenes. They put so much emphasis on the character's movements and techniques that it's difficult not to be amazed. Heck, i would even put it on par with the animation of angel beats, if not better. Overall i give it a 10/10 for being the one of the most visually stunning animes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: the voice acting was superb, being one of the best i've heard. The voicing was done just right; it conveys the emotions of the character without sounding exaggerated like naruto's annoying \"sasuke\" shouts although i do hate haru's whiny voice. Aside from that, the music is something. How do i say this? It's awesome enough that i could make it my ringtone and never get tired of listening to it. Overall i would give it a 10/10 for wonderful voice acting and a beautiful soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: One thing I hate about Accel World is the characters. The story is beautiful, the art is beautiful, but the main character is so whiny, it\u2019s not even funny. Another character, Takumu , is also very annoying. He\u2019s acts like some self- loathing guy although he has already been forgiven for what he has done. There are probably more annoying characters in the story, but I won\u2019t mention all of them. All I can say is that Accel world has a weak main character, which can make you facepalm from time to time. Overall I would give it a 7/10 because the characters are (mostly) whiny teenage highschool students who just cry when there are problems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed watching Accel world. For a person like me who loves a good adrenaline-inducing fight scene, then I would say that Accel world is a great anime. It also has those touching moments that can amaze you, but most of the time it just ends with Haru crying which totally kills the moment because he does it like every other episode. Overall i would give it an 8/10 i really love those fight scenes(or maybe because i'm just biased?).\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it an 8/10 for all the reasons mentioned above, and I do believe that I could\u2019ve been higher, if it wasn\u2019t for the weak main character. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first time writing a review and English is not my first language so I would gladly accept any criticism. Thanks for reading :))\\n",

The art is pretty good, the music had me tearing up, and the story becomes increasingly favorable with its many intense action scenes and incredible twists and turns of the plot.  \r\nI found the main character very difficult to relate to.  Haruyuki does however have very appropriate dialogue for his character and the plot leads to amazing character development for himself but mostly the other main characters.  He goes through quite the transformation from being the quiet, shy nerd who's always being bullied to the quite, shy nerd who hasa pretty epic avatar in a video-game... oh and also a really pretty girl by his side.\\n\r\nKuroyukihime is the black snow princess.  Calm, elegant, and wise; she is very kuudere.  Her already seemingly invulnerable personality also goes through quite a change as she begins to open up to the other characters.  \\n\\n",

To be honest I was a bit thrown off since I wasn't used to something like that after having watched so many other anime. I decided to give this anime a try after first watching Sword Art Online (henceforth referred to as S.A.O.), and I found that they both share a mutual concept - Virtual reality and online gaming. I watched the entire things through and sorta felt like this anime was better than S.A.O. It made me feel like S.A.O.was a bit of a disappointment especially since S.A.O. focused way too much on a love story than what most people were interested in (which was the MMORPG).\\n\\n\r\nThe art and soundtrack was very good which is something I really appreciate. The fact that the lead character was much different than your typical male lead kept me interested. I wanted to see how much the character would grow by the end of the series and I wasn't really disappointed. It explored a little more of the world of MMORPG than S.A.O., so it kept me entertained and interested.",

            "content": "Accel World...\r\nIt's ironic that in this Accel World, the fat ones are the ones who excels the most. I'm talking to Haruyuki, the biggest (literally) damn loser in his school. I personally believe that his character design must be changed? Why? His appearance is not suitable in the lovey dovey scenes with Kuriyukihime.. That's my honest opinion.. I think that Haruyuki's design must be the weak, fragile and the un-nutritious type of loser, not the healty loser..\r\nOn the other hand, I appreciated the way of Haruyuki being a loser. He is really bullied and disrespected. That is a good plot device and a good reasonwhy all of this Accel World stuff happened. The guy wants to be tall, to be thin, to have a good reputation, to be a perfect guy.. Who doesn't want that? \\n\\n\r\nOk, here's a short introduction of the series.. Haruyuki is a big loser in the school. Then out of nowhere, I don't really get the logic, the school council president Kuruyukihime took an interest in him. Not that simple interest, also a loving interest.. (What the Hell) She gave the loser the program that can change his life, the Brain Burst.. And it really happened.. The loser became a champion... in the Accel World... So, here comes the challenger and the show begins!! FIGHT!!!\\n\\n\r\nLike what I am doing.. Here are my thoughts..\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThis is the story of underdogs.. No doubt.. It is the story how underdogs rise from the pits of hell to the top of the mountain.. This is the life struggle of Harayuki.. He is bullied, so he has low self esteem.. In the real life, he is a loser, but in the Accel World he can do unlimited possibilities.. The story also elaborates the concept of having Alter Egos.. You know, just like superheroes.. They are living normally in normal life but when danger arises they became different individuals.. This is also the same with this game.. Not only that, all armors embodied personal scars and trauma.. You can say that this series has an emotional direction mixed with awesome action scenes and sometimes off-the-hook love scenes..\\n\\n\r\nI would like to comment on Haruyuki.. Like what I am implying.. He doens't need to be fat and short in order to be a super loser. There are still character designs that can match the character spirit.. But, I must admit.. the super loser factor is a key factor in order to insert the emotions in this series\\n\\n\r\nI would like to thank everybody that this is not a pure harem anime or whatsoever because I will not really watch it.. Why? Because of Haruyuki..\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nThis is good.. The artwork in the real world as well as the Accel World are good. In terms of the Accel World armors, the armors of the main characters are good. Haruyuki's armor is good.. The armor will look good with the shiny shimmering effects.. Though sometimes there are armors who are lacked of design or rather effects.. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is OK... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis is where things get interesting..\\n\\n\r\nThere are this times wherein I say \"What the hell.. Why are you like that\".. I will discuss why..\\n\\n\r\n1) Haruyuki... Big losers act like big losers.. Well, he is crying and disappointed.. But the way he act and cry, he is like below 5 years old.. I mean I was like \"AARRGH!! Stop it!!\". And the way he is obsessed with Kuroyukihime, what the hell.. There are also times wherein he will have perverted thoughts about the girls he met, that was absolute \"AAARGH!!\" I don't know why, but I think I'm gonna blame it to his appearance.. He is like a maniac when he is in perverted mode (Pardon me).. But the catch is this, and I keep on telling this.. Maybe all of that character setup is to the sole purpose of injecting emotions in this series..\\n\\n\r\n2) Chiyu.. What the hell is wrong with you? Who are you in love to? Haruyuki or Taku? (Mataku..) It is like she wants to do a two timing between the two guys.. I find it really \"AAARGH!! What the hell..\" Come on... Not only that, I found that I'm really annoyed on her tsundere like attitude.. Was that Tsundere?\\n\\n\r\n3) Seiji Noumi.. This is the real villain type.. From the moment he entered the series, he shows the true meaning of evil.. He is bullying, creating mind games, doing dirty tricks, blackmailing.. From the moment he was introduced, I really want to punch him in the face and say \"FU!!\".. Wow, that is so good about this series.. I really hate the guy so much that when he was defeated I shouted \"Yeah!! Die Motherf*****!!\" To be honest, Seiji Noumi helped me watch the show and complete it overnight.. He is too damn annoying, which means he is a effective villain..\\n\\n\r\nWell, there are the main points I noticed.. On some characters such as Kuruyukihime and Taku.. They are both fine.. The others were fine..\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEven though at times the characters are annoying, they are contributors in having a good series.. The super loser mode of Haruyuki is the main focus.. He is an underdog and I like underdogs who beat the hell out of those bossy class individuals such as Noumi.. The main enjoyment factor for me is when Noumi was defeated.. He is like very pathetic at the same time you will feel the loneliness because there are flashback that shows how he lost everything.. But I don't give a damn about the drama side of Noumi.. I really enjoyed the moment when he was defeated. It was the absolute victory.. Even I had an evil laugh when Noumi was defeated. It was refreshing.. Really..\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nWell, it is mixed emotion but I gave it a high mark because of the enjoyment factor.. The emotions are in the air.. Sometimes you feel the drama and sometimes you feel annoyed. But, one things for sure, you will experience annoyance but it is integral part of the story..\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's my review of my first anime series that I finished with an MAL account that's why the ideas are so fresh.. Accel World is a good anime.. That's it\\n\\n\r\nThanks..\\n\\n\r\nLightningSnow :)",

In fact, the World Health Organization should list that show as a carcinogen.\r\nI would have rendered a score of 10 if this show's most glaring flaw wouldn't have happened, which is that there is no proper ending. There's a lot of plot threads that aren't tied up and that's because it abruptly ends after 2 arcs.\r\nThis show excels in character development. The characters aren'tubermensch that solve all problems. It's quite the opposite. A lot of them are horrible people that have problems of their own that they need to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nThe direction is also much better than the other series I mentioned. Instead of incomprehensible battles there are well animated sequences, good transitions, and logical extensions from scene to scene. The humor is also really good.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, someday, the rest of this series gets adapted and it's as good as the rest.",

            "content": "Accel World is a pretty decent anime esp for MMO and VR fans , It has awesome opening and endings and the overall sounding is done really well , the visuals are good it's obvious that they have worked a lot on it , the battle scenes and the whole scenery , objects in them , the details you can see and everything else about them is well made .\r\nThere is the story next that some may complain about . Yes it's nothing flashy but at the same time it does engage the viewer and does surprise him at times getting him all excited espwhen it gets accompanied with beautiful scenes and good soundtrack but no matter how good it is you can say it's sth cliche and just go with that word afterall it's about a stupid fat kid that all girls like for no reason , always falls down then gets courage and rises up and every other crappy play you've seen before but it's kinda enjoyable most of the times . \\n\r\nThe main issue with Accel World is it's characters . The protagonist is just unbearable it feels like you're just gonna throw up any moment . Both the design and sounding of the character are way below the level of the show you can easily see the particles in his face it's like they just got some cute slim design and then just dragged the sides and made him fat and chibi , not good chibi it just sucks they even made his avatar a round pig as if that figure in real life wasn't enough and you know what he says later in anime ? '' That he has gotten used to it '' actually i wanted to drop it at that moment , it is so much that it gets unbearable. Other characters are mostly well made although there are some that don't get much screen time and remain vague but those that do are actually touching .\\n\r\nI'm giving this an 8 but still there are better animes if you are into this genre .\\n",

            "content": "If you thought Sword Art Online was bad, you'll think it's a complete masterpiece by the time you get through just one episode of Accel World. I watched the series almost 2 years ago but I've had this unfinished review sitting in my Gmail account all this time and I thought I'd do myself a favor by finally getting rid of it. Agree to disagree if you want.\r\nI wrote pretty much wrote the entire review after I watched the series so I'm currently just revising what I wrote. The scathing harshness of my words drip like poison. This is basically a very long, salty rant.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory(3/10) - Poor:\\n\r\nI wasn't all that surprised when I found out Accel World was done by the same author as SAO because the overall traits are the same. Advanced technology that can make fighting games feel like reality and a ton of generic cute girls all going for the main character. The only difference is that this main character is beyond unrealistic in terms of looks, has absolutely no backbone, and zero redeeming qualities. Also, apparently, losing one's privileges in a game is about the same as being executed in real life. Having privileges in said game gives you magic powers to control reality (or something.)\\n\r\nOverall, Accel World is full of complete nerds who want to escape reality. In all honesty, I don't feel that AW sends out the right \"message\" to the audience because it basically tells you that reality can be escaped, video games will solve all your problems and reality doesn't mean squat.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) - Very Good:\\n\r\nDespite Haruyuki's appearance, I must admit that AW's art is genuinely good. The colors are soft and the use of it is also not bad. Some of the fight scenes are really well choreographed and I found them interesting in a  lot of ways so, kudos in those regards.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) - Good:\\n\r\nAttack on Titan called, they want Eren  Jaeger back. At some times, I could totally tell it was Kaji Yuuki voicing Haruyuki, at others, well.... He just sounded like a really whiny baby. In terms of voice acting, the AW's do as well as any other. Soundtrack is good, but I feel that sometimes the sound effects overrode the other sounds at certain points. It wasn't that the voice acting was poor, II'm just so bitter and spiteful that I can't even rate the easiest category the score it [might] deserve. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10) - Dreadful:\\n\r\nI've seen many a complex character in my day, but never have I come across one like Haruyuki. He's got absolutely zero charm, is a cry baby, a chibi, and obscenely obese. To top it off, he looks like a chibi piglet (just like his avatar) and I'm pretty sure even puberty can't solve his problems. The author of AW literally gives no break to Haruyuki's physical problems.Now then, if you can imagine all that, good. Now imagine the most \"kawaii gorgeous beautiful\" girl in an anime (at least according to this universe) actually having a crush on the character mentioned previously and getting jealous over him if one girl even sticks one toe towards his direction \\n\r\nNow, it's not that Haruyuki is a crybaby that's a turn off or that he's shorter than a five year old or even that he's obese because it isn't really the looks that turns a person off to them (although it can be a major factor). It's the fact that he's all of this, makes no attempt to correct any of it, still gets the chicks and isn't even all that nice. This is the power of the harem genre, friends.\\n\r\nI will admit, he has shown a certain amount of \"valor\" but for what, a video game? True, I understand these \"video games\" are advanced enough to feel like reality, but no matter how real it may feel, it isn't and treating it as anything than such is beyond wrong. Now, I could understand how with Haruyuki's shortcomings he might want to escape reality but pretty much everyone else in the series has no excuse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10) - Pathetic:\\n\r\nI literally could not finish the series sooner. By the end of the season, I'd almost completely stopped paying attention and truth be told- I have no idea how it ended. Just that it did and I was praising /God/ that my brain cells were spared. \\n\r\nI'm Agnostic, which means I don't even really believe in God. This is how grateful I was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10) - Dreadul:\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I love my video games and I would totally support virtual reality if it existed, but AccelWorld takes things beyond what is realistically believable even in this universe. AW offers nothing new and is pretty much your average harem in a nutshell. I enjoyed SAO more than AW. \\n\r\nThis is literally the harshest review I've ever shared. Or, actually one of two.\\n\r\nBut this is my personal best- worst review.",

            "content": "Oh boy, where to even start with this one..\r\nI guess I should start with the good things first.\r\nAnimation is great, art style is viewer friendly, important scenes are very well animated, fights, specifically last one, are a join to watch and definitely the highlight of the whole series.\r\nSound is not very exceptional, but sound designers did a good job piecing together soundtrack that fits whole show quite well, especially improving in big fights or important moments. \r\nStory is exceptionally interesting and unique, at least from the perspective of sci-fi anime fan, but this is where good things end and bad things start.\r\nDespite whole idea forthe show being very interesting indeed, the way the story is treated is just painful. Characters, specifically the main character Arita Haruyuki, is literally the worst protagonist of any anime series I've ever watched. Seriously, he is so ridiculously weak, clumsy and annoying it almost immediately killed my desire to watch this anime. \\n\r\nEven though he has few high points during the show, any and all possible sympathies towards him are brutally murdered by every single annoying thing he does. By the end of 2nd episode I started hating the main character more than I have ever hated any anime character ever, especially because Arita is probably the biggest crybaby and most helpless character in anime history.\\n\r\nOther characters actually improve the situation somewhat, especially the characters of Black Lotus,  Kuroyukihime , and Cyan Pile, Mayuzumi Takumu.\\n\r\nBut they also could've been handled way better, but I guess can't ask much from anime watching which I was fantasizing about all the ways Arita could be killed off entirely for the rest of the series so he would never ever come back.\\n\r\nCharacters and their story and interactions is actually what made me hate anime as a whole and delayed me completing this anime for like 2 weeks, which is unusual for me, as I normally watch 20-ish episode anime in one or two days max.\\n\r\nAnd here lies another problem. Characters are definitely the low point of this anime, but if you ignore them, the rest of the show is fine, with the problem being theres not much left. Characters are pretty much 70% of this show, and its bad, because Accel World could've easily been new Sidonia No Kishi or Neon Genesis Evangelion, if the characters were treated in different way. At this point it actually seems like this anime is directed strictly at 8 year old children or so, who only enjoy flashy colorful shows and don't care for the substance, because anyone who can think in long sentences probably will hate this anime as much as I did.\\n\r\nAt most, this anime is good for one time viewing, as reviewing it for 2nd or even 3rd time most likely cause severe anger issues and might result in traumatized psyche of anyone who dares to attempt such foolishes.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR Quite pretty and well-stitched anime that is brutally killed by its characters. Watch only if you like great action scenes, but beware, the action in this anime takes maybe 10% of whole runtime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Im not a huge fan of anime where the main character is a weak guy. I like anime were there is a strong main character that is a guy that protects others (mainly girls). That being said this anime was put together very well, having a weak main character that doesnt have much for confidence or self esteem really had me ticked off for the most part but through out the story he did get stronger and did work on his weaknesses which I thought was a little reassuring, however it wasnt enough for me to be satisfied... however Kuroyukihime made up for a lotof that, you didnt really see her in action for most of the anime but she was probably the only reason that Haruyuki Arita even bettered him self. She was the one who pushed him to improve himself which is something that i like just as much as a strong male lead. He pushed himself for her sake and improved upon himself almost every time because of it. as for the rest of the anime besides the two main characters, the story, art, sound, and characters were overall very good because they were well put together and they helped each category instead of getting in its way or even hurting it. (by that I mean they made each other category better then if one wasnt there to support it.) This is a good anime and I recommend it to anyone who likes anime were part of it is in real life and the other part is inside a game, with a hint of romance (this anime didnt really have to much, it almost seemed like they were best friends or really close rather then dating.)  and a little bit of having to figure things out in situations.",

The author that made this also made SAO and I will tell you know they are completely different from each other. First half you have the MC ,Haru, trying to have a decent school like but gets bullied only to get introduced to a Augmented reality game called Brain Burst by a girl she likes.  \r\nAlso you think he would try to get her but he doesnt as he knows how much of a loser he is so keep that in mind. Asthey progress they they face with players trying to get rid of them as if you  have no points you lose the game forever.  \\n\r\nThe story is simple but not like much other stories you would come across.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty simple with its bright colours to show off the augmented world and decent art style of character design. (besides Haru but I will get to that)\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED Im not a fan of but the soundtrack isn't half bad.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where people stop watching. I dont know, Haru essentially looks really cartoony compared to the other characters and so a lot of people really dont like that. Now let me tell you. JUST GET OVER IT. GEES.   \\n\r\nI did dislike it but its not like Im gonna not watch it because of that. Just dont think so heavily about Haru's design and move on. Its literally so pathetic that so many people stopped watching it because of that.   \\n\r\nMoving on. The character development isnt so bad as well as you learn why they turn out the way they did. But are at least 3 I can think of that should really have more time to let us know who they are better.  \\n\\n\r\nThe action in this anime is pretty clean as there's no random ridiculous manouvers unless theres a reason or that its actually capable of doing. Where the story goes doesn't fail as there goal is clear within the game.   \\n\r\nThe only thing I could complain about is that sometimes there are moments where it doesnt really seem logical of it happening but its not that big of a stain so you wont you dont need to worry over it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Whilst there are things that can be tweaked this anime is pretty good for its action, story and character development and I recommend you watch if you watched SAO as its set 20 years after that and is different compared to it.",

He very quickly becomes one of the best players out there. Okay, so I'm sure that just about every other review out there gives you a much longer summary, but I'm going to skip to the actual review part, because that's what you're here for, right?\r\nI thought that this was great anime, particularly for those of you who fell in love with SAO. (If you haven't watched SAO - THAT'S A CRIME - then I suggest you watchit before Accel World, because there are just some little things that would make more sense to you if you did.) The art was great and I actually didn't care at all that the protagonist doesn't have the traditional \"hot guy\" look. In fact, I don't really find him attractive at all, but that doesn't matter at all in this anime. He still gets the girl (not really a spoiler considering that he gets her within the first couple of episodes), and, I don't know, it just... doesn't matter. (Sorry for all you people who don't care whether or not the protagonist is attractive or not, just thought it was a point I should make.) \\n\\n\r\nThe plot twists in this anime are things you may or may not be able to see coming. I know that when I watched it, I didn't see it coming, but I think that if I was watching a certain episode for the first time today, I would've guessed it. I think it just all depends on how much you really think about it, and how much you trust in certain characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the anime is a good one. The plot isn't the most amazing thing ever, but it's pretty darn good. The characters are awesome and you will most certainly come to love them. I would definitely suggest trying it out.",

What I remember about Accel World is that Kuroyukihime was awesome as she was a capable character and a great main heroine. Haruyuki, our main man, has an extremely short stature was annoying and his stature was a cheap ploy to make him look less manly. Silver Crow's unique power has actually a well thought out and one would think it's a shame that this ability was wasted on Haruyuki. Unfortunately that isn't the case. As far as I remember, Haruyuki didn't ever have his power's full potential drawn out. The art and soundweren't memorable enough for a comment so they are neutral. Thus Accel World has great supporting characters and a lame hero with a cool power that could be used in a better way. Everything else was sub-par. You probably won't remember much about this series after watching it, so I only recommend watching it if a close friend or somebody you know has similar tastes recommends it. Otherwise, you're not missing out on much. My friends and I all watched it and it has never come up in conversation.",

            "content": "Okay. So I have to be honest with this. I don\u2019t like mecha animes. Zoids, Transformers, Gundam; no. I really don\u2019t like them. I didn\u2019t want to watch this at first, but then I said: \u201cHey, maybe it\u2019s time to watch something different.\u201d I thought that if I didn\u2019t like it, I could just type it down, and let others know that I didn\u2019t like it. \r\nFirst off, the story goes like this: It\u2019s Year 2046. Haruyuki \u201cHaru\u201d Arita is fed up with getting bullied because of his physicality. The effect of this: he has a low self-esteem. That is why he always logs onto the school\u2019s local network, his only scapegoat. \\n\\n\r\nOne day, he finds his highest score in Squash get beaten by Kuroyukihime, his upperclassman and Umesato Junior High School\u2019s Student Council Vice-President, whom he has a crush on. Kuroyukihime, or Snow Black, invites him to lunch. There, they talk about the Brain Burst Program, which Haru eventually installs in his Neuro-Linker. But, not only did he find out that it is a virtual reality multiplayer online fighting game, but also, its point system, the Burst Points, can be converted into acceleration abilities in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (9/10)\\n\r\nIn creating stories involving the future, the possibilities are endless. But it still should be presented naturally. The Nero-Linker is a good example. You\u2019ll definitely be thinking of saving some dough just to get this device from the store. I wish smart people would invent it now.\\n\\n\r\nThe story\u2019s really good. It didn\u2019t explore too much on the other kings (which were practically insignificant at the time), and focused only on Haru and the others. A big plus point? It would be Kuroyukihime\u2019s feelings for Haru, which we rarely (or, not normally) see in the society. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\r\nYes. Art. 10 points. I don\u2019t think anybody will disagree with me on this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\r\nBetween the first and second opening, I\u2019d say that Altima\u2019s Burst The Gravity fits the show better. It has that vibe that unquestionably gave the second part of the series a revolutionary introduction.\\n\\n\r\nSachika Misawa\u2019s Unite was good. It suited the second part of the series since it showed us Kuroyukihime\u2019s point of view in some matters. Kotoko\u2019s Unfinished, on the other hand, fitted the show much better. If you have heard it, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack overall is great. It has that futuristic feel that makes you want to turn up the volume while watching each scene (especially fight scenes).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\r\nThough some characters were not developed well and were not dealt with properly, it was okay since Haru and Kuroyukihime were the most important pieces of the series. \\n\\n\r\nI love female protagonists who have black, long hair, and are cute and beautiful, which makes Kuroyukihime my most favourite character in the series. She\u2019s really beautiful. And I love how she reacts sometimes when around Haru. She may have been a major contributor to why I loved the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nI have to say this again: I dislike mecha animes. But it\u2019s fine now. Accel World gave me a change of heart. [Insert tears and sobbing]. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\r\nI dislike mecha animes. Really. I genuinely thought I wouldn\u2019t like it. I was wrong though. I have to say that I\u2019m really hoping for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nA great animation, unforgettable scenes, the developing love story of Haruyuki and Princess Snow Black, supplied with almost-perfect timing of gags, Altima and Kotoko\u2019s opening and ending themes, little mysteries, and metal versus metal, Accel World may be one of the best mecha animes I\u2019ve watched thus far. \\n\\n\r\nOops.. Make that \u201cthe ONLY mecha anime I\u2019ve watched so far\u201d. \\n",

            "content": "-may contain spoilers-\r\n*sigh* Accel World, huh? \r\nLet's jut start, shall we?\r\nStoryline: 3\r\nThe overall concept of the story is really interesting and could be SO much more, unfortunately the potential it has is only used in the last 3rd of the series. Other than that it is overly dramatic and especially in the first half of the series the characters act overly exaggerated, cry because of every little thing that comes along the way and that doesn't really change as the story comes along, except for that it makes more sense in the end, because the characters have lived through things together and learned to appreciatewhat they've been through and the relationships they've built. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nKinda generic, but still enjoyable. Clean lines, nice colors, good concept art. The animations are nice to look at and the fighting scenes look great. Not much more that can be said here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI didn't really pay attention to the sound, I admit. I remember some decent backgroundmusic during the fights and some music to the underline pressure/excitement. The opening or ending themes didn't really stick with me, but I guess they're alright as well. As long as the music doesn't annoy me, it's fine. Same goes for the voice acting. The annoying drama of the plot is not something they're responsible for. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nLet's face it... the only character, who actually changes a little for decent REASONS is Haru. \\n\r\nSure, we have Taku, who also \"changes\", but that change is so sudden and exaggerated that it's not believable at all. Hime stays the same bossy tsundere throughout the whole series and Chiyu is still chasing for what she wished for in the beginning even in the end, the only difference is that later on she has new means to do something to make her wish come true. \\n\r\nNow, let's come back to Haru. There are scenes where the game and the time he spent in it actually seems to have affected him in the real world, but in general he stays the same loser. A hero in the game, a loser in real life. Just like in the beginning. \\n\r\nAll the other characters are supposedly children of 14 years or younger, but act like adults. It would make sense, if they also acted as mature in the real world, but they don't. This is something that have been focused more on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI did not enjoy the first half of the series... at all. The second half however finally drew out some of the consequences of the possible usage of the Brain Burst game that is also accessible in the real world. I mean, come on... you can slow down time and the only thing you do is playing a game? What a WASTE! Of course there would be much more people, who would use that power to their advantage in real life, especially if the only ones, who can use it are children and that should have been focused on, as well as on the mental state of the people, who stay for longer periods of time in the game world, where time goes by slower. Besides... the consequences of dying in the game that are known to Haru and the viewers are far too small to make such a fuss over not wanting to lose the game. \\n\r\nOnly in the very last episode one get's informed that you not only lose the possibility to play the game, but also the memories you acquired there. Why is everyone making such a big deal of losing the game if almost nobody knows that they'll lose their memories? I don't know. It's stupid. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nAs I said before, this show could be so much more. There is so much wasted potential and nothing to make up for the lack of it's usage. If someone would ask me to sum this anime up, I would say: \"It's an anime about kids, who take a game way too seriously\". Just like real MMO-addicts, only in a futuristic setting. \\n\r\nWell, yes there is a weird romance going on which is not explained at all... like, really just like children. \\n\r\nAnyhow, if you expect something from this anime, wait until Ep.16 or so, if not, don't bother watching.",

            "content": "kaaaaaay so it's been a while since I watched this anime but it's okay cause 5 minutes ago I went on the wiki page and now i remember why I though this anime was ummm okayishkinda. Basically this anime is centered around some game that kids 15 and under play called brain burst. This is a game where you fight other people in order to steal their points. Now why would someone subject themselves to physical harm in order to play a crappy pokemon knock off, well the reason behind that is because they want to get these points so they can slow down timein order to achieve... stuff. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character. He was never hugged enough as a child and so he cries a lot. He is like this because that is what everyone looks for in a main character, since in anime there hasn't been enough annoying protagonists that bitch and whine. He is like if yuno wasn't bat-shit-crazy and expressed how broken she was by crying to everyone. Now this yuno's yuki is a skinny chick. She is the most popular girl in her school and she is into emotionally disturb children much like yuki and so wants to get into out main characters pants. However our main characters pants are simply to tight because of how obese he is and so she finds it very difficult to accomplish her task. There's also all that stuff with the brain's and the bursting but really it's just used to strengthen the superficial relationship's of all the main characters. Then there's the male best friend  and he is there because there has to be a smart person. Then there's the other female love interest and she is their because she has to be the other female love interest. As well we all know you cant have a full party without a tank and a healer. Then there are other characters\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to this anime's story at first its generic romance with generic misconceptions and generic romancy stuff mixed in with generic shounen stuff about how he must be stronger and what not then later on it turns into a stupid  generic romance with generic misconceptions and generic romancy stuff mixed in with generic shounen stuff , however this anime makes a radical change by making all their characters look like there wearing fencing suits making them look like power ranger rejects. Then there's the fight's which are exact copies of the pokemon tv show's. There is also some stupid lvling up system. All in all the game aspects suck because its nothing like a game and really its more like an engine to create the stupidest deus ex scenario's  I've ever seen. Literally near the end they actually learn moves based of off will power alone. You know how hard it was to teach my ferrothorn rock spikes. YOU KNOW HOW MANY I HAD TO BREED AND YOUR TELLING ME THESE PEOPLE ARE LEARNING IT THROUGH WILL POWER NO ZERO POINTS GET OUT. all in all i give this anime a 10/10 in every section and recommend you go buy every single copy available ever.",

The first half of the series was a recap of the series. wut?\r\nWhy?\r\nWHY?\r\nI don\u2019t need any recap. I just wanted a sequel to the series.\r\nAnd what do I get? 40 minutes of original content. Only 40 minutes. It felt like a 2-episode arc on a series. WTF man. If I had watched this on theatres, I might\u2019ve rant so crazy.\r\nSigh.\r\nAfter the recap, of course, I was expecting to be blown away by the main premise of the story but I got the opposite. True, I would admit the main story of the moviewas interesting, but it was wasted. It was too rush, and there was so many things going on I sometimes can\u2019t even follow anymore. I also had so many many questions left unanswered. After the movie, I was dumbfounded, bruh.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like there is a big big time gap between the series (as seen in the recap) and the main story of the movie. Like, why was the wheelchair girl regain her freakin\u2019 legs?!?! That was totally random!! Who is this little shrine maiden girl?!?! Was there an untold alliance between the black & red faction?!?! What!?!?!? and many many more.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the series (I haven\u2019t read the light novel), this movie was a total disappointed. I cannot fathom how much I dislike watching this movie.\\n\\n\r\nI think the only good thing I could compliment about this series was the art & animation. Well, its freakin\u2019 Sunrise production movie, its always good. The fight scenes was visually appealing. That\u2019s the only positive thing I could say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime movie was a disappointment. I\u2019m not really sure if this premise can be found in the light novels, if it is, this movie was then for the fans of the light novels and not much on the anime fans (like me T_T ).\\n\\n\r\nI am still hoping for a proper sequel to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n\r\nThat is all.\\n\\n",

The main character looks like Eric Cartman from South Park and while I have nothing against his apperance, the cover depicted him as some funny, sometimes angry fay guy. In reality he is a whiny, constantly crying and pathetic fatso. The way he is depicted as shorter than his peers is really annoying to me.\r\nI, personally have no specific requirements for art or sound, but I care how good a story is, as wellhow enjoying it is, and this one has very mediocre story and the enjoyment wasn't big at all. The biggest compliment I can give to this show is that if I was 12-13 when I watched it, the chances of me enjoying it more (due to my underdeveloped tastes at the time) are higher.\\n\\n\r\nThen the coolest girl in school that everyone admires instantly falls in love with him and even risks her life to protect him. Around that time I lost my patience and started skipping forward just to get rid of it.\\n\\n\r\nNothing really happened that piqued my attention, aside from the last villain who had particularly annoying personality and I honestly wanted him to get defeated. The show ends with a cliche happy ending and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like romance that makes no sense or unlikely heroes, you might enjoy this, for me those two aspects were forced to the point where the show became a pain to watch.",

            "content": "Long before I joined the anime community, I was just a short, nerdy, obese grade 7 student who only cares about video games and nothing more. That was the time when my name \"Midget King\" was found. Of course, I hung around people who matched my interests and personality, my so-called \"followers\". But not all of our classmates join in to this type of crowd so we were often bullied. We would play card games in every break or free time we can get. For a whole school year, that's what my life was about every single day of school. In the midst of thatschool year, I began to think that I should be doing something productive and that I should change myself because it felt that my life was taking a dive and it's getting harder to resurface. One of my friends then told me that even a fat midget can become popular and badass just like in one of the anime that he has seen. And that anime is Accel World. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if that story is in any way relatable but that's one of the true stories in my life and I felt like I was reminded of that when I began watching this series. So... all those years and I just chose to watch it now. Maybe because I still have a lot of regret about that life I had during junior high. But now I can just laugh it off because I've gotten over it and without that situation, I can never be who I am today. Well... enough talking about me because I know you're here to read about the review I have prepared for Accel World. \\n\\n\r\nAccel World.. just a short-cut for \"Accelerated World\". When I first heard about it, I misinterpreted it as \" Axel-World\" instead so I thought it was an anime about racing. Well.. good thing I realized it sooner. When I read about the details to this series, I see that is very similar to Sword Art Online though this one was released sooner. Since I saw the latter one first, I couldn't help comparing both and somehow I thought that I should have seen Accel World first because I didn't enjoy the game-fantasy introduction that SAO did for the anime. Accel World was much more simpler in terms of game creativity. The story is somewhat unique and a bit common at the same time and the RPG elements are so-so. Since this was a series made for audience who just entered the world of anime, most of the story line was as I was expecting and the scenes are events not too uncommon from other related series. The first few episodes didn't really get me that much excited and I thought that nothing was too grand or astounding in this anime. The art was well done and I see that those backgrounds were well detailed for a futuristic timeline. And once again I thought about SAO on that platform. The anime being well illustrated and animated but the plot was not as exactly followed from the manga. The soundtrack is decent and the opening and ending themes give that action vibe that you are about to see in every episode. I loved the BGM especially the comic relief one. The characters are somehow strange but they were the typical types for these genres. What I didn't like about the characters is that they gave off the shounen aura and ambition that wasn't really supposed to be highlighted. Maybe that shouldn't really be a problem since the characters are still in the ages of middle-school. I hate weak-willed main characters so I was kinda thrown off by the MC here. I would appreciate it more if he had a bit more development throughout the plot. The main thing that I enjoyed about this anime are the fighting scenes. This anime is action packed in almost every episode so that might keep your boredom away. As weak-willed as the main character is, he has potential into becoming overpowered and he doesn't really disappoint that much. The ending was satisfying and it seemed that loose ends have come to connect but it feels that there is more work to be done and there should be a sequel to this series. We can't just cut it off at that arc. So I hope there would be a second season. Still, this series is very much recommended if you're new into anime or haven't seen SAO yet. This series is all about futuristic MMO's.\\n\\n\r\nThat was my review and my storytime for Accel World. If you want to ask some more questions, feel free to message me and I hope you have a good time watching.",

            "content": "NOTE: Although this review focuses mainly on the tv series, it covers the entire animated franchise up until this point. If you happen to be one of the few people that didn\u2019t watch it, thought of giving it a chance, and are reading this right now, I should advise you that there are some spoilers here, so take this TL; DR instead: THIS FRANCHISE IS COMPLETE GARBAGE AND YOU SHOULDN\u2019T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH IT.  With that said, let\u2019s move to the review.\r\nAh, Accel World, the title that blew everyone\u2019s mind when it came out for being about people playing videogames with an advancedvirtual reality technology, for featuring a fat ugly male protagonist and for being made by the author of Sword Art Online (this anime adaptation came out before SAO\u2019s, but it was the other way around in the light novels). Since it panders to both the otaku and gamer audiences it was hailed as a masterpiece, and guess what, IT\u2019S GARBAGE.\\n\\n\r\nSo the show presents this futuristic society where people basically get a wireless virtual world installed in their heads since they were born. They have access to internet whenever they feel like it and thus can mail and call other individuals, take notes and do their homework or search information virtually. All of which appears as windows in front of them which only they can see. It\u2019s presented in the cheapest way possible with people moving their hands in front of thin air. \\n\\n\r\nThey can also talk to others mentally if two or more people connect each other with a cable. This is also presented in the cheapest way possible with people sitting on a table and talking to each other without even moving their mouths. Good use of an advanced technology story presented in a visual medium there. Also sometimes their thoughts mix in and sometimes they don\u2019t. Is there a rule which controls that? Nah, it changes whenever the author feels like throwing an ecchi joke or not. \\n\\n\r\nSo it\u2019s a society that wasted money and technology on an application that allows them to being anti-socials that don\u2019t really communicate to each other but it\u2019s really awesome because people can (not really) play crappy videogames from within. Yay!\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s some app called \u201cBrain Burst\u201d which transfers them to the \u201cAccelerated World\u201d that allows people to think way faster than the normal human brain but in order to do that they need some experience points and how does people gain said experience points? They play a crappy mmorpg and fighting game fusion which is obviously a serious and very dramatic thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe game already begins in a ridiculous way by basically raping the players\u2019 mind to get information about them and create their avatars based on their emotions and psyche (mostly insecurities). Um, what? Why would someone do such a thing, why no one demanded the developer for being a potential cyber-terrorist group that brainwashes people? Who cares, let\u2019s play videogames! And the designs are ridiculous, simple yet deformed robots with one or two colors and no explanations whatsoever about how that specific design reflects its player. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about the game itself? A generic mmo where people kill creeps and gain level; there isn\u2019t even some lore behind the world they play in. They don\u2019t even form factions because those were already formed when the game started by some people that apparently didn\u2019t have better things to do than playing a bad videogame the whole time, said people didn\u2019t even wanted to reach the finale of the game and instead tried to be at peace. What kind of gamers are those? But don\u2019t worry because the main girl of the show didn\u2019t like that and betrayed them and decapitated the guy that proposed that and since then there are factions at war in the game. \\n\\n\r\nWhat that means is that the little bit of story within the game was made by the players and no from the game itself, how sad is that for a game that is not about creating your stuff with whatever is given to you like some simulation game or Minecraft? (And even that game has some sort of story).\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the leveling and abilities system and the gameplay? People gain experience by killing creeps or fighting against other players, just like in any other mmo. But since this is also an rpg they also unlock new abilities when they gain more level. How? Weren\u2019t their personas based on each person? Why don\u2019t they begin with all of their unique abilities if their avatars were created based on the individual characteristic of each one? Why are the character\u2019s abilities so similar to the ones of generic rpg classes like mages or healers when they are supposed to be based on each individual? What about those abilities represents the players? Who cares let\u2019s just play videogames! \\n\\n\r\nJust like in any other mmo, the players have a health bar, and while that should balance the battles, it doesn\u2019t. What I mean is that they play a game, they have health bars, they battle with specific abilities that consumes specific amount of energy (they have some form of it in the game too) and deals a specific amount of damage. Yet the protagonist can be easily owned by whoever he encounters and is always about to lose, but when he has the lowest amount of health you can imagine, the same abilities that almost killed him (or new even more powerful) now deal nearly to no damage, what does that mean? It means that he has a ridiculous amount of plot armor. Oh, and he also can easily defeat his opponents in the end with just a few attacks, of course. And let\u2019s not forget that he is able to do that because he has THE SUPER AMAZING, UNBELIEVABLE, UNIMAGINABLE AND UNMATCHABLE ABILITY OF\u2026 being able to fly, wow\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe players gain experience points whenever they kill shit or defeat other players, you know, basic stuff, and that\u2019s a super important and dramatic thing because if they lose all of their points they lose in the game, and if they lose in the game, what could happen? Are whole races and kingdoms going to submit to others like in No Game no Life? No. Will the players lose their lives like in Sword Art Online? No. THE SUPER IMPORTANT, DRAMATIC AND SERIOUS THING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF THEY LOSE THE GAME IS\u2026wait for it\u2026that they won\u2019t be able to play the game ever again. The system blocks their ID and thus it doesn\u2019t allow the losers to play the game ever again. Those are some really high stakes, right? Also, what kind of mmorpg blocks its players permanently? One that doesn\u2019t expect to stay afloat for much time, I guess. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the losers can\u2019t even recommend the game to other people because the app instantly erases their memories of the game, and their time and role there. Do you need another proof that this developer is a potential cyber terrorist group? Say what you want about how games make people stupid, no game in real life (up until now) fucks up the players\u2019 mind like this one, thankfully (well, maybe porn games, specially the vr ones that are being developed, oh God, what are we doing\u2026). \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happens when you create a nonsensical futuristic society with an advanced virtual reality without any form of control. How do they deal with hacking in such a society?\\n\r\nAnyways the brainwash is done supposedly because the game must remain secret, yeah, because having people yelling BURST LINK every time they enter is not suspicious at all. \\n\\n\r\nRemember how experience points work? Well, forget about that, why? Remember when I said that the main girl of the show killed another player? Well, here\u2019s what happened: she caught off guard the other player and instantly chopped off him. What happened with all the experience stuff? Well, turns out whenever two or more top players fight, they one-shot the other, taking away their whole experience and thus making they lose the game instantly. Why would such a broken rule which completely contradicts the mechanics of the game exist? Well, I guess it turns the game into something like Day Z and it becomes more interesting\u2026if the protagonist didn\u2019t have plot armor, that is.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, when Haruyuki, the protagonist, loses, he just gets his ultimate ability robbed by another player and becomes an unimportant player that slowly goes back to the top to fight against the asshole that defeated him once again, no big deal. \\n\\n\r\nEven in their real life the main characters have plot armor. In the early episodes of the show Kuroyukihime, the main girl, wants to help Haru with his bully, so she gets him being punched by that guy so the asshole gets expelled, and what does he does for a revenge? HE ATTEMPTS TO CRASH HARU WITH HIS CAR, OF COURSE. But do not worry, dear viewer, here\u2019s Kuroyukihime to save the day. After a long, unbelievable, lame, melodramatic, hypocritical and selfish love confession, she uses a once in a long time unique ability only the top players can use and thinks even faster, and uses her avatar to move her real body, so she gets crashed by the car instead of Haru, and after a few days, she\u2019s ok and playing the game again, of course. \\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the third arc of the series, because the other two were about people playing games where all those problems I already mentioned appear. So this particular arc is about how another student of their same school uses the app for something different than playing the game and that is cheating in the school exams so he gets better grades. It was refreshing to see something slightly different but the handling of this arc was also really bad. On one hand, it brings out an interesting question to the table, if we had and application like this, wouldn\u2019t we abuse of it in order to get personal benefit? And wouldn\u2019t we try our best to do that? Yet, again, the handling of this arc was terrible.\\n\\n\r\nLeaving the fact of how minimal his main objective is aside, the antagonist of this arc is so edgy that you can\u2019t take him seriously; he laughs as a maniac and treats everyone like shit because he gets better grades and because he has a higher score on a videogame. He does all that because he suffered bullying in the past from his brother, meaning he is not only edgy but also victimized; Haru went through something similar and he didn\u2019t become a piece of shit. Also, he use one of Haru\u2019s friends to gain points in the game, because she has THE SUPER AMAZING, UNBELIEVABLE, UNIMAGINABLE AND UNMATCHABLE ABILITY OF\u2026being able to heal. What kind of lame ass mmorpg is this where a basic ability like that is a big deal?\\n\\n\r\nThis girl kept saying the whole series that everyone is stupid for taking a game so seriously and when an asshole tells her to betray her friends in order to gain more experience in a game she supposedly doesn\u2019t care that much about she instantly agrees? Well Haru and this girl were extorted by the antagonist, yes, but it\u2019s a futuristic society where they have all kind of stuff in their heads, they can record conversations and videos anytime they want. If it\u2019s possible to do it today with no much difficulty, imagine how easy it should be for them, the whole arc could\u2019ve been avoided. \\n\\n\r\nAnd what does the super pro player Kuroyukihime is doing? She is on a school trip until she appears at the ends of the arc and easily defeats their enemies except for the main bad guy who has to be faced by Haru, because otherwise he wouldn\u2019t regain his ultimate ability I guess. And of course, the final fight is full of plot armor, ass-pulls, new abilities similar to others and lame motivational speeches, what did you expect, strategies and fair conditions for each player? Oh, silly you. \\n\\n\r\nThis third arc ended up being the worst, not only has all the problems from previous ones such as plot armor and ass-pulls and could\u2019ve been avoided as I stated before but it also contradicts the most basic rules of the series:\\n\\n\r\n-Two players who have similar abilities to those of Haru and a girl from the second arc appear and Haru gets his ultimate robbed. How is it possible for his ability to get robbed by other player? How is it possible that there are players with similar abilities? Weren\u2019t their abilities unique because they supposedly represent every player\u2019s personality and psyche?\\n\r\n-During Kuroyukihime\u2019s trip she has her own adventure fighting a random monster and she gets the help of her best friend, who was a Burst Linker before but she\u2019s not anymore. It is stated at the beginning of the series that whenever someone loses the game and it\u2019s uninstalled that person can\u2019t play it again. What happened to that? Also this mini arc was thrown in during the last arc interrupting the story. I don\u2019t care if it was a side story in the light novels or something like that, in the anime adaptation it killed the narrative flow just like a filler arc does. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the characters, shall we? Unlike most of the others modern anime\u2019s protagonists, Haru is fat, short, ugly, suffered bullying and have an inferiority complex. So this isn\u2019t a story about a bland self-insert Gary Stu that haves all the chicks for stupid reasons and an empowerment fantasy for otakus and is actually about an interesting, flawed and well developed protagonist? No, is the same shit as the others but even more retarded. Why? Because lots of girls fall in love with him despite all of his flaws because he is kind and good at videogames, featuring not one but two clich\u00e9 and lame characteristics of modern anime\u2019s protagonists in one package that no girl would see as enough of a reason to fall for a guy. \\n\\n\r\nTo his credit, he gets some development throughout the story as he becomes stronger and thus he gains more self-confidence, but that is also inconsistent since he is constantly going back to how he was, and the circle repeats forever whenever something positive, immediately followed by something negative, happen to him. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, there\u2019s Kuroyukihime, the perfect waifu of the show that is somehow a pro player, a top student, and a kind hearted person at the same time, yet in reality she\u2019s selfish and hypocrite. I can\u2019t believe how every fan of this series takes her characterization at face value and don\u2019t realize how she only wants Haru for his (not real) capabilities of taking her to the top of a freaking mmorpg. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the others, edgy enemies with close to none characterization, and some turns out to be clich\u00e9 harem archetypes that fall for Haru because of the aforementioned reasons; Takumu, a typical protagonist\u2019s best friend, and Chiyuri, that bitch that isn\u2019t just annoying and useless and not only betrays her friends for stupid reasons but is also jealous of Haru and Kuroyukihime and she tries to take advantage on him despite being his best friend\u2019s girlfriend. Fuck this girl.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s it for the series, although it has an interesting concept and some attempt at showing people\u2019s change of attitude by the dependence of advance technology and less social interactions, as well as some attempt at showing how we would abuse of some power or facility gave to us if we have the chance to get benefits from it, along with some development for the main character, everything failed in the long run. Apart from the interesting premise, the only positive aspect regarding the story that I can think about is the pacing, which is not good, but not bad either. Take in count that while it\u2019s still an adaptation with no ending, it covers three arcs where the protagonists fight against various other factions, which means that every important character was already revealed. But then again, this is also questionable because they keep making progress and going back to square one and then they constantly keep repeating the process. \\n\\n\r\nIf there are some positive aspects in this show, those would be the visual and sound department, the character designs are generic, bland, and Haru and the avatars are ugly and retarded, and the voice acting is nothing special; but the backgrounds, the motions, and the special effects are well done, and the sound effects and soundtrack range from fine to good, making the world they play in and their fights spectacular on a superficial level. I don\u2019t want to waste more time in this, I\u2019m moving to the rest of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe tv series was followed by two ovas that were silly ova material about a pumpkin hunting other players full of fan service, even more retarded designs and melodrama regarding the not couple from the show and another one about onsen, Haru being fat and having to lose some weight in order to pass a medical exam in school, what does this have to do with gaming? Well if he doesn\u2019t lose weight he can\u2019t play videogames for stupid reasons. That\u2019s it, don\u2019t lose weight to gain better health and appearance, do it so you can go back to play videogames for another person. Overall good pacing, visuals and sound apart, there\u2019s nothing more to these ovas, moving on.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, another studio released some two minutes specials about every character being even more retarded, barely trying to hide their fetishes (Haru\u2019s best friend is literally treated as a dog by his girlfriend in these specials) and, of course, everything is shown in a crappy chibi style. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, four years after the tv and ova series finished, Sunrise released a movie, and it\u2019s easily the worst thing in the franchise. It tried, and failed, to be a recap movie, a sequel to the former entries, a stand-alone entry, and an adaptation of some volume of the light novel series to please the fans that were waiting for a second season, all at the same time. How is it possible to fail that hard? Well, like this: \\n\\n\r\n-Bad as a recap movie: It only covers part of the series, leaving some details from the show off the summary. \\n\\n\r\n-Bad as a sequel: The events here happen way after the tv and ova series, if it is watched by a person that never read the light novel series, said person would ask him/herself: Who are all of this new people? When and how did the long time characters gain so many new abilities? (Said abilities are pretty op btw) Why are the two factions still allies when they already accomplished their common objective in the series? Shouldn\u2019t they go back to be enemies already since they want to reach glory (if you can call reaching the top of a mmo that) by their own? What are the new areas they go to? When and how Haru got rid of his curse?\\n\\n\r\n-Bad as a stand-alone entry: You may think that this movie shouldn\u2019t be judged as such because it doesn\u2019t try to be one, but it is. Why would it include a recap then, if it wasn\u2019t? The people that watched the series already knows the story, and the same goes for the people that kept reading the light novels, of course. Yet the movie starts with a recap that lasts for half its duration, and wastes said duration in stupid things instead of telling the viewer all of its important details. That aside, it\u2019s also just a bullshit mission about two factions fighting against a feminine player that somehow allied with a monster in the game for escapists reasons, and she was defeated by the power of lame speech about love and friendship, and bullshit op new abilities. But that does not mean that the film can\u2019t include some silly moments about the main (not) couple, right? Talk about wasting screen time in nothing.\\n\\n\r\n-Bad as an adaptation: It is not even good as an adaptation of its source material because it changed some important details from the story it\u2019s supposed to be adapting. \\n\\n\r\nGood animation and sound apart, this movie is a complete disaster, there is not a single good thing about its script and thus, it does not deserve more than the minimal score. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s it for the franchise, the tv series alone is slightly better but, as a whole, is the anime equivalent of the third Spy Kids film, and that\u2019s definitely not a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nAccel World: 4/10\\n\r\nAccel World EX: 3/10\\n\r\nAccel World: Acchel World: 2/10\\n\r\nAccel World Infinite Burst: 1/10\\n",

However once they lose all their points, the game uninstalls itself and the user gets no more benefits from it.\r\nArt: It is good, there is nothing special or great aboutit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: English dubbed is terrible, but the show was so bad overall, not worth watching subbed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here is my rant. This show had great potential to be a decent show. But no, they decided to make the worst characters ever. MC is fat, whiny and contributes nothing to the show, however he is granted a rare avatar in the game. Main female character is beautiful, popular and powerful. And of course when a villain finally appears, they are poorly constructed. All of the characters have as much depth as a puddle. Horribly done and that is the downfall of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Read characters then you'll get my point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If I could go back in time I would never watch this show. I hate this show for having potential and then having such poor character development to the point where it ruined the show. Watch at your own risk.",

In a good way. The amount of character development that the creators went through to improve the more lower characters is very pleasing.\r\nWhile watching Accel World you should expect to have:\r\n1.

            "content": "Just finished this anime, and felt compelled to write a review on it. I feel very ambivalent about it. On one hand it has a great many good points, but on the other hand it also fails quite spectacularly at others. Disclaimer before I start, I haven't read any of the manga associated with this anime, and i did speed through some episodes in the middle.\r\nStory:7\r\nThe story has its high and low points. First the high points. Initial premise regarding the accelerated world and it's workings was very intriguing and unique. I especially enjoyed the idea of it being able to support situations in thereal life as well. Game avatars were also a cool idea. Basically the main premise of the show was so mind-blowingly satisfying (coupled with the art, characters, etc.) that if it had ended earlier, i would have given it a 10. But, beyond the halfway mark of the anime, things took a turn downward. In fact, It could be more accurately described as a nosedive. I don't know why, but i strongly disliked this anime's plot after the first half, beginning with the introduction of Dusk Taker. It just seemed so contrary to the story's progression. And after that, it became very predictable and devolved into your generic game fighting anime. There were also strong undertones of bullying, so trigger warning there. I did not like it after that midpoint. But it was semi-redeemed at the end when we got to see the MC grow a pair and follow through (i would spoil the actual ending). It was very satisfying to watch an MC who follows through and doesn't have that sudden sense of compassion. So overall, two very polar opposites combined together gives it a middling rating for me. The first half was awesome, eye catching, and interesting, while the second half was mediocre, predictable, and overplayed. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWell as expected of a newer anime, the art is top notch. Very consistent in style, quality, and color choice. Character designs (with the exception of the MC) were very well done, pleasing to the eye, and fit with the genre and setting well. Depictions of both the real and accelerated world were satisfactory, and the animation was crisp. Unfortunately, this anime has the curse of being watched by me after UBW, so it gets a 9, since 10 should only be given to F/SN UBW. But other than that, very well done in all aspects visually.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nFor the most part again, not too bad. Similar to the story aspect of this anime, it was pretty good. I enjoyed the first opening and ending songs. VAs were chosen well, not unfitting of the characters. In anime sound was also pretty good, nothing flashy and noticeable, but it blended well with the art and flow of the story. Overall not bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\r\nEasily the weakest part of this anime. Lets get in depth here. First off the MC. As I mentioned before, his character design is not the best. I personally did not enjoy it, It felt out of place. Also, he is a crybaby who can't do anything on his own, and I quickly got annoyed with his repeated antics. Honestly as a whole, a very weak MC. Next, the MC's triage of friends; Taku, Chiyu, and Black Lotus. Out of the three, Taku is probably the best, he is levelheaded, strong, and responsible. But other than him, the rest of them are quite lacking. Chiyu presents the big-sister type who disregards the MC's games, but eventually gets sucked in as well. totally predictable. And the Black Lotus character is pretty much just so overpowered that she is just the be-all-end-all to all fights. If a fight gets too hard for the MC, count on BL to show up in the nick of time and save the day. And finally the other characters. Here's where my main beef with the characters are. Almost all of the characters in the story were a means to an end. What i mean by that is that they are perfectly designed to meet a certain need of the MC at the exact perfect time. And once that purpose is served, the disappear without much afterthought. And I dislike that. Its as if the writer brought these characters to existence just to  do one thing, and then disappear. And some of the situations surrounding them are so contrived that its so painfully obvious that a certain character has only one purpose, for the entire anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nagain, here its split into two parts. At the beginning and first half of it, I enjoyed it immensely. with the exception of the MC, the story was great, the art and sound were amazing, the premise of the story was refreshing, and the characters were flashy, cool, and with style. But after the halfway mark, the entire anime fell flat for me. From that point on, all the characters felt rushed, contrived, and very one dimensional. In addition, the story became painfully predictable, which when combined together made the second half of the anime hard to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7\\n\r\nWavered between a 6 and a 7, and decided a 6 would be a bit too harsh. It had a great premise, a great cast and awesome sound/art, but that only lasted the first 12 episodes, and from then on, most of it was pretty underwhelming, especially when compared to the first half. And yea i kinda explained this in the section above, so there isn't much to elaborate on. So broken down, it'd probably be along the lines of 3 for art+ 2 for first half of story +1 for characters +1 for the ending = 7 overall",

            "content": "Accel World is yet another series that starts strong but fails to muster enough momentum to keep going. There are definitely some good points to this show but equally many, if not more, negative points. If anything, the series generates some serious feelings from viewers if the other reviews are an indication of anything.\r\nSo what is it? It's a futuristic setting where a computer is essentially connected to your brain through a neck bracelet, think of Google's Project Glass except the glasses are in your mind. This allows everyone constant connections to the web and, importantly, the ability to \"dive\" into a virtual world- verysimilar to the Matrix but with a much less painful wireless connection. Our protagonist, being a South Park derivative character, isn't worth much in the real world and so has become an expert in the virtual world. He is soon approached by what must be one of the only reasons why I'd recommend watching this show, Kurohime, who offers him a chance to take the red pill.\\n\\n\r\nI'm fascinated by futuristic, technology-centric settings, and this is no exception. However, this show is plagued by cheap plot tricks, a protagonist who makes Yukiteru from Mirai Nikki look like a hero, and arcs that are painful to watch and take forever to finish. If you're into fantasy/futuristic-based shonen action series, then this might be fun. If you're looking for serious relationships or a mature, well-executed storyline, this is not for you. If your willing to put up with the above shortcomings, welcome to the Accelerated World.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation quality in Accel World is quite good. Colors are vibrant, battles are fast paced, and effects are everywhere. This isn't your run-of-the-mill cheap animation. I was very impressed with the innovative heads-up UIs though still question why one still needs to use their hands if it's all in ones brain. Overall, the series does a great job in immersing the viewer in very interesting environments. As for character designs, I guess the series was trying to be unique with piggy but... man is he an eyesore. And the thought that Kurohime would choose the lard-ball over everyone else... it's really setting some weird expectations for guys. Luckily, there are a wide variety of female characters to satisfy all fetishes ranging from tsunderes to bookworms and from lolis to maids. Despite the overwhelming amount of supporting characters, all the \"important\" ones are distinguishable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for battles, the majority of them take place in the virtual world so \"pain\" is felt though we are spared blood (though amputations, beheadings, etc. of metal frames is very common- think FMA). There are a lot of special moves and abilities so expect some pretty cool graphics. Choreography is good but not brilliant, ecchi is vaguely present though (luckily) not a key trait.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAccel World uses some pretty nice electronic-based songs for the OP/EDs (including big names such as Kotoko and Altima (SNS Final anyone?). The BGM likewise follows this theme with some electronic themes as well; there are some gems hidden between the other more-forgettable tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAs for VA cast, I'm honestly surprised the protagonist of DxD could sound like such a wimp so I guess props to Yuuki Kaji for doing too good of a job. There are some pretty big names voicing some of the supporting roles but the real star is Sachika Misawa. If you haven't read her profile yet I recommend you do, she has amazing talent given her age.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAccel World has a pretty intricate story with a lot of details, you won't really fully understand the setting until you've finished half a dozen episodes. However, do be aware that this is not a finished product, while many plot elements are introduced many are not resolved. Yes, like Hagure this is another case of \"wait till season 2 to find out\".\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Accel World does do a slightly better job of entertaining through the season. It starts out as a chaotic mess as Piggy's reality is completely turned upside down. Unfortunately, as things unravel, the series loses its pacing and decides to throw in random twists and inexplicable situations to keep the viewers interested (these fail miserably). This unfortunate turn is capped by a final arc so sour and off-putting that I really almost stopped watching. While there is a resolution, it is by no means satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nThey really had a chance to make this one great, but unfortunately they did not deliver. Your only hope is to enjoy Kurohime. Hopefully we'll have better luck with Sword Art Online (by the same author).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is a hard one as this series has some of the best characters I've seen a while, and a handful of the worst characters I've ever seen. Kurohime and the short but blissful appearances of Fuuko work magically to cancel out some of the tragically weak characters. Perhaps it's because these are really the only mature characters in an entire show filled with illogical, childish characters who hold on to pointlessly stupid ideologies. Really, if Japan continues to promote characters like Haruyuki... their youth really are doomed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for development, there really isn't much as relationships are quickly established early in the series- and nothing much changes from that point on. I believe there's some point to the Brain Burst program, but no one will truly understand why until the next season. Until then, it's anyone's guess.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis show truly had some unique ideas (who wouldn't want superhero-like reflexes?), some of which break all know laws of physics; but those aside it's an intriguing watch that raises philosophical questions. Unfortunately, my thinking highs are almost always interrupted by the throbbing sense that everyone other than Kurohime is an absolute idiot. While some aspects of the show are truly memorable and interesting, there are others that I would rather never see again. Accel World is an interesting concept that ultimately fell victim to a fat piggy and poor execution. Here's to hoping for a better season two.",

Just weak in some points and strong in other areas. if the weak points were different or better i'd probably give this anime higher ratings. although if they were changed anime could have been better or worse.\r\nPros: Along with others i've watched, definitely a great idea for an anime. One that you would fantasize about having in it in the real world. Really cool \"battles\" really just mean the fighting parts. Also a cool way to imagine the future as this anime is setin the near future. \\n\\n\r\nCons: My main concern about this anime which probably brought this anime down for me was the main character: Talk about annoying aggravating, and just plain out frustrating. This is honestly the only negative thing about this anime that i can think of but i just take it so seriously that it makes me give this anime a lower rating then it should deserve.\\n\\n\r\nOther: It's a \"longer\" watch sometime unbearable at times but honestly felt like it could have kept going, just cause i could endure more.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend: I would only recommend you to this anime if you like fat, crybaby, self-pity main characters. if you do then this anime is honestly a great anime.

I do believe that it should have a sequel because I believe there were a lot of things left unfinished.\r\nThe art was pretty good. The character and avatar designs were very fitting to the characters and series themselves.\r\nI believe one of the things that could've improved it definitely the soundtrack. While it's not necessarily the most important aspects of an anime/movie/show, it's what emphasizes the atmosphere of a certain moment. Like for example, when Haruyuki started going berserk when the Armor of Catatsrophewas activating, the soundtrack that backed it up didn't make it seem as epic as it should've been. Also, the soundtrack is what makes you keep coming back to an anime. To me, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty awesome. Haruyuki's character I believe was underestimated in his design because he isn't as pathetic as how he looks compared to Yukiteru from Mirai Nikki or Takumi from Chaos;Head. One thing I find odd though is the fact that they are \"breaking the peace\", so doesn't that make them the bad guys? Just a little something that throws me off everytime I think about it.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, I think it was good. It's nothing special but I liked the concept of mixing RPG and Fighting Game.",

With it you can search the net, play online games, and call other people directly\u2014talking virtual avatar to virtual avatar. Nearly from birth, everyone has one of these computers and it affects the very social structure of the world. Talking avatar to avatar isconsidered a common method of communication. On the other hand, cabling\u2014i.e. connecting Neuro Linker to Neuro Linker directly with someone else sans the avatars\u2014is considered one of the most intimate of actions as you not only talk mind to mind but also can access the other person's computer. It is the deep examination of the cultural impact of such a computer that makes Accel World so enjoyable.",

            "content": "Plot: Set in 2046, Young Haruyuki Arita \"Haru\" who is a short chubby junior high student is the primary target for bullies. With his miserable life (in the real world), he blows off steam playing games on the virtual reality and is ridiculously good at it. People have access to this virtual world (kinda like the internet) with the help of a device called Neuro-Linker , everyone has it installed in their necks. Despite being a loner and bully magnet, Arita still has his childhood friends supporting and trying to cheer him up, Chiyuri Kurashima \"Chiyu\", (She is an annoying character who can't decided betweenhis boyfriend and our MC Arita) and Takumu Mayuzumi \"Taku\" (Chiyu's boyfriend)\\n\\n\r\nKuroyukihime a.ka. Princess Black Snow (Her fascination with Haru will eventually become affection as the story progresses) the popular Student Council Vice Pres. of the same school, discovers Haruyuki's amazing talent in the virtual world and eventually gives him a program called \"Brain Burst\" w/c gives him access to the \"Accelerated World\". Now \"Burst Linkers\" (People who had installed Brain Burst) whenever they choose can accelerate their thought process a thousand times faster than normal people. Meaning a second in the real world is like a thousand seconds for them, making everything around them stop. Haru however will unexpectedly discover that the Brain Burst program, beneath it shell ,is a multiplayer fighting game. He gains a humanoid avatar called silver crow. The plot revolves around him fighting fellow brain bursters (with the guidance and inspiration of kuroyukihime) and climbing up and eventually \"flying up\" (he'll eventually have access to a skill that is unique to the Accelerated World) to the top of the ladder. A lot is going on with the plot, issues with side characters \"Taku\", \"Chiyu\" and the enigma \"Kuroyukohime\" will keep you busy and entertained. (More Side characters will be introduced as the plot progress).There will be ups and downs for Haru as he tries to evolve from sore loser to be the best at what he does with the help of his friends.\\n\\n\r\nReview: The show offers a lot of entertainment, the fighting scenes are good and well-thought-of and there are a lot of characters (though a lot will annoy you w/c is a good thing for villains but bad for side characters). Viewers will be amazed by the well made virtual world that is the \"Accelerated World\" with all its rules and politics. Character designs are well made, the human counter parts are good but the android looking avatars are really great, colorful and well designed. The plot may sometimes be too shallow or not serious but it is expected from a \"shounen\" anime and it doesn't really affect the enjoyment that the show brings. It's mild and easy to watch and at the same time has good depth without being too analytic in its plot. If you want a good action shounen with logically well made plot this one is for you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Rating: 8/10 Nothing outstanding but will rarely bore you.\\n\\n",

Ashamed of his miserable life, Haruyuki can only cope by indulging in virtual games. But that all changes when Kuroyukihime, the most popular girl in school, introduces him to a mysterious program called Brain Burst and a virtual reality called the Accel World.\r\nThe first half of the anime was really exciting. The incorporation of the RPG element enhanced the genre and made the anime more interesting. \r\nThe second half of the anime actually never mentions any of the established plot points in the firsthalf and introduced a new one. Haruyuki was made to look very weak despite his progress in the first half just to accommodate the length of the second half. \\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are really great. The anime utilizes shaky camera techniques to amplify the scenes. They use different angles on most of them like when Haruyuki is flying or when a bunch of missile rockets scatter in the air makes the scenes more exciting  The fight scenes themselves are pretty straight forward but it is used to enhance the story as well. The anime is pretty smart in doing the storytelling in the fights which makes them a lot more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is pretty good. It\u2019s a satisfying anime with all the fixing and it captured the world of MMORPG pretty spot on. The fight scenes are exciting and there is much to enjoy in this anime. I recommend it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nThe story of Accel World is pretty good. The story is pretty simple, and easy to follow, but remains engaging throughout, putting in quite a few twists and turns that makes you want to keep watching. However, in my opinion, has a major flaw. There are pretty much no stakes in the story at all. It takes the weight out of a lot of the fights when you realise that there isn't really anything to loose. However, in the last episode, after the last battle, they reveal something that would have made people a lot more invested in the story, and I think that itshould have been revealed earlier. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI really like the art style in this anime. It is full of an array of different colours due to it's varied environments throughout the show. This gives the show a lot of visual variety, and makes it stand out. The designs of the Battle Avatars are also pretty good for the most part, but a lot of the female battle avatars start to look a little too similar to each other. The general character designs for the show are also good,  looking quite a lot different from other shows I have seen. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty good. The background music always fits the scene, but none of it is very memorable, outside of the second OP, which I thought was pretty good. The voice acting (English dub) was also just pretty good. Nothing really outstanding, but above average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are the main reason to keep watching, in my opinion. As I mentioned previously, the story in just pretty good, so it needed great characters, and that was the main draw for me. Sure, the characters are mostly different traditional archetypes, the nerd, the bully, etc, but they are really likeable, and I felt myself really rooting for them throughout the show. One early episode in particular really got me on an emotional level, because I was really starting to love the characters in this show. My only issue with this part of the anime is that around the second half of the anime, one of the characters does a massive 180 and it really hurts your view of the character. They do justify it at the end, but it's a really weak, but plausible, excuse, and I feel the character had already been kind of ruined at that point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, despite it having some faults, and only a slightly above average story, mostly due to it's characters. The action scenes are really well done, and thoroughly entertaining due to the various abilities that are seen throughout the show, and you can really get into the characters' and their relationships. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

Kuroyukihime though, is not a very interesting character and she doesn't get much better thoughout the series.\r\nThis anime, although really enjoyable to watch, has many flaws.It's really cheesy sometimes with its themes of believing in yourself and friendship and certain little scenes made me cringe but those things don't completely take away from the anime. The biggest flaw with this anime is that it doesn't have a proper ending. It's really sad because so many questions are left unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention Accel World was written by Reki Kawahara, the same person who wrote Sword Art Online?

            "content": "***Please take note that the  spoilers do not state anything major, and I find them to support my point even more, so please consider reading them***\r\nNow, before you guys start bringing out your pitchforks and start calling me names, hear me out. I know what feeling you get when you first read the summary, and see the first few minutes of the anime. You're probably thinking, \"Is this really the protagonist of the story?\" Now, I'll explain why this is actually not a bad idea for an anime, and it shouldn't be the only reason why the anime should be consider bad. However, Ishould first go over why this anime is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nStory(9.0):\\n\\n\r\nThis story's premise is pretty generic, a new video game that comes out and changes a loser's life. Now most people would probably be thinking that its cheesy. However, I believe if you were to watch the first five episodes of the anime, you will be hooked. \\n\\n\r\nI love how the protagonist of the story is literally a fat loser. Why? Because it gives me a breathe of fresh air. Like most animes you see today contain characters that are simply OP and have very few flaws. I'm looking at you SAO. Also, the anime is taken place in the future, which I thought the writer who made this anime did really well to support this premise. I, mean, seriously, the story is taken place roughly 30 years from now, and humans thrive through technology, but not so futuristic that characters are living in mars (as far as I know). This gives the story realism through their own world. \\n\\n\r\nTo add, the story gives out unanticipated plot twists as you watch the anime. This gives the anime a layer of suspense on what might happen during a fight scene. How will the protagonist overcome this strive? Will he lose? \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime's story does contain some flaws. For example, there are some parts that are unexplained in the anime, and sometimes, I find the duel system is little silly.(MINOR SPOILERS INCOMING NOTE) In Accel World, the players of the game, Brain Burst, have a dueling system in which you can fight players that are in the same network as you. This is stupid because what is to say that someone attempts to duel you forever? Then they will be stuck in time for eternity. There was no time limit explained in the anime (SPOILERS FINISHED)\\n\\n\r\nArt (9.5)\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that the drawing portion didn't have anything that stood out especially. I do like their art style, however, mainly because of the great uses of background and color. Everything in the drawings seems balanced, however, there are times in which I question the drawing. Like when the protagonist's eyes look like freaking basketballs. The animation, on the other hand, is simply stunning. The animation for the fight scenes are flashy, intense, and really great. \\n\\n\r\nSound(10.0)\\n\\n\r\nThis is completely my opinion, but you might not have my taste in music. I really like both openings of the anime. They both give me emotions as if the protagonist can overcome the challenges he faces in the anime. Its as if you can do anything if you try hard enough. Sorry if that sounds corny to you.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but the soundtrack is well-done as well. There might not be a lot of soundtracks for you to listen, but I'd prefer songs that I can recognize and know the mood of the scene rather than some mysterious soundtrack that was lazily done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(9.5)\\n\\n\r\nI guess this is gonna be my longest section for my review. The anime introduces quite a small cast of characters, but they all of their own unique traits. Most of the characters of the story are definitely likable, and sometimes even cryptic. However, most of the characters explain their backgrounds in a few short minutes, and this seems very rushed. I thought that the anime would be better done if the characters were to go a little bit more in depth.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll now explain the main protagonist of the story. Now, now, most people turn down this anime because of the pathetic little protagonist of the storyline. Now before you. A year ago, when I knew little about anime, and watched English dubbed because I never knew about subs, I decided to watch Accel World. My first impression of it was that the protagonist was pathetic, and I couldn't bear to watch him get punished. Instantly, I clicked away from the anime. \\n\\n\r\nFast-forward to the present time, and I finished the entire anime within two days. I have to say, I still dislike the main character, and thought the story would be even better if the protagonist wasn't so bad. Nonetheless, this character does contribute a lot to the anime, and many scenes wouldn't had happened without him. Many vital scenes of the storyline wouldn't even had happened if it wasn't for this pathetic little character. This gives the watcher the idea that this little midget is actually the most important piece of what I call an astounding anime! There shouldn't be rants about how this anime sucks because of a weak MC, rather there should be MORE animes about these types of protagonists. Seriously, the story wouldn't be as good if Kirito was the main character, now would it?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10.0)\\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, I watched the anime in two days (no life), so its probably gonna be enjoyable to take up so much time in so few days. I thought the anime was well-paced, and three arcs for a season just just right. I really thought I made the right choice to watch this anime once more ever since my first encounter with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10.0 or rather 9.75)\\n\\n\r\nNow, this anime definitely has some flaws that deprive it from a perfect score, but I still think it deserves some more praise. Little things such as an unnecessary tutorial explanation or lack of death sentence is a bit harsh to call it a bad anime, wouldn't it? (MEDIUM LEVELED SPOILERS INCOMING) And to be honest, the ability to lose the game and memories of it actually suits the MC as the relationships he makes because of the game. Making the threat of losing those relationships would be pretty scary, as well. (MEDIUM LEVELED SPOILERS OVER). Overall, this anime dope slaps you hard if you stick around for even two episodes.\\n\\n",

I expected one character to make a return and she never did. I felt there was an incomplete story in regard to the cursed armor. The goal that the characters wanted to reach wasn't achieved by the end. One-hit kills are boring. Kuroyukihime hardly did anything the second half of the anime.\r\nThe Good: Neuro linkers are cool; I want one. The idea of how the fighting avatars were created was neat. The powers the game gives you in the real-world arecool. Watching the formation of alliances and enemies was entertaining. Noumi really pissed me off, but then I couldn't hate him because of his story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: Haru's real-world appearance shouldn't have been permanent. I like chibi-sized people for funny scenes only. Why be a pig when you can be anything else??? I wasn't fond of Kurashima's or Niko's fighters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: The different landscapes were nice; I like how they were related to the real world. Kuroyukihime's fighter and avatar were nice. Ash Roller, thumbs up. The futuristic neuro linker visuals were nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThis is my least favorite part of reviews. Unless I'm watching a music-based anime or the soundtrack is really good/bad, I usually give this a 6 and move on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: Haru cries a lot. Kurashima is indecisive. Some side characters only last 1-2 episodes. Megumi is an enigma. I wanted to know Kuriyukihime's real name.\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: Haru can be a jerk because he's so depressed and has low self-esteem; I understand that. Taku is not indecisive. I like Taku better than Haru. When trying to right his wrongs, Taku learns to not spite himself. Kuroyukihime gets jealous. I got a good laugh from Niko's personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe anime held my interest long enough for me to watch all 24 episodes and 2 OVA in two days, so it wasn't bad. Still, I've seen better, but I've also seen worse. I probably won't watch this again because I hate stories that feel unfinished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6",

The beginning seemed to be suggesting that there was going to be a very interesting ending to this series. It was fun to watch. But by the end it was bland and like whoever had created the plot had changed their mind at the last minute. I also liked the art-style of this anime, none of it looked particularly bad or lazily done. The characters were somewhat decent, too. I didn't really find them particularly annoying, I honestly think it was just the unimaginative endingthat ruined it.",

I really did like the concept in the beginning with all the acceleration and everything, but where the actual story ended up was pretty bad. The main character made this even worse. After the first half of the series, I had to force myself to finish the series because I wanted to see if it gets any better and because I didn't want to be biased and rate this without even completing the anime. \r\nArt (9/10): I like it. It's flashy and also has really well done moments with the dark atmosphere.\r\nSound (9/10): Well...no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (1/10): I actually didn't want to watch this anime because the main character's appearance was so lame, but a friend told me to try it out. Back then I thought, \"I guess I shouldn't judge a book by it's covers before actually trying it out.\" Now I think to myself, \"Why did I listen to my friend? Is he even my friend?\" Anyways, time to rate the characters: Literally trash. I thought the main character from Mirai Nikki was useless, but then I see this... The main character makes everything so infuriating. The fact is, he is a loser... however, because of this I was expecting improvement or something at least, but this character just makes dumb mistakes, does dumb things, and pisses me off while doing it. There are a lot of characters that are losers who improve such as the main character from Boku no Hero Academia. I assure you, Deku is like 100x better than Haruyuki. Haruyuki just doesn't change. He just stays like the weak little chibi he is and never improves. I have literally nothing good to say about the main character, but Chiyuri became much more frustrating near the end of the series. I won't spoil anything, but wow... never thought there would be a day where I'd hate someone more than Haruyuki. The only \"good\" character was Kuroyukihime because of her calm and collected personality. She never really does anything that is infuriating or idiotic which is really nice. Well, since I have nothing better to say, I'm just going to end my rant here. I think you get the idea of how I personally think about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10): Well, considering the ratings so far, I really doubt I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10): I did give it a 5 because I'm somewhat of an easy grader, but if I was forced to watch it again, I'd rather watch Boku no Pico. Honestly, I actually enjoyed SAO unlike many other people, so since this was by the same creator, I expected at least something good to come out of this series. All I actually got was anger and rage.",

The story line is slow in some episodes but it picks up the pace in others. The story line is also very enjoyable to follow so I am scoring it a 9/10.\r\nArt\r\nThe Art work in Accel World is a great tolook at wheter the characters are in the real world or in the Accel World, but in my opinion the art work in the Accel World is so well done its close to being a masterpiece. So im scoring the Art a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIve got no complaints with the sound. The sound is very clear and the back ground music, opening scene music and even the closing scene music is well done and it fits in perfectly with this Anime series. The battle music is also done really great and doesn't overshadow the character voices at all. So for the music I will score a solid 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters is well drawn and the development of the main characters and even the supporting characters is pretty well done. If I have to be honest there is in some instances where the MC does cry a lot and it may get annoying to some viewers but I guess its for you to decide on that. But otherwise I am scoring the Characters a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis was a really fun and enjoyable series to watch from start to finish. I loved the battle scenes although they are not done in scale or overly flashy it was still done pretty well. So for the enjoyment I will score a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nTo finish my review I will say that I will recommend this anime series to all the fans out there that are fans of SAO and similar anime genres. This series was great to watch and although I might rate SAO higher than Accel World I would still say that its worth to watch Accel World. And I do hope that a new season will get to be rolled out as soon as possible. I am scoring it a very solid 9/10.\\n\\n",

The characters are incredibly rich and well-thought, especially the main character Arata. It's not really common for the main character of a shounen to be short and overweighted, which adds an interesting aspect to the anime because his personnality is influenced by hisphysical aspect which makes him shy and uneasy. I personnally consider this series as the brother of Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, even if the context is a little bit different. The fact that the story takes place in the real world is original in comparison to the other VRMMORPG series which often take place in a video game. The animation is really well-made and all of this is supported by an amazing soundtrack. The 9 on 10 is well deserved.",

I'm not saying fat people are generally ugly, but this character is making it seem like they are. Besides, just because you're fat doesn't mean that you'll be bullied - I mean, everyone gets bullied at one point in their life.\r\nI didn't like how Chiyuri got all wet over Haru. Yes, Kuroyukihime was a little obsessed with him but Chiyuri was always acting desperate, or an over-protective mother. It was plain annoying, my opinion however.\r\nThose are afew things I disliked about the plot. Overall, however, it would be 9/10. The plot would be 10 if it wasn't for Haru, but still, it's a really great Anime that I highly recommend.",

In this anime the main character downloads a game and it becomes his reason to keep on fighting and continuing on in life. And of course in this game he has his own unique special rare power but I'm not going to go into detail.\r\nThis anime had a lot of plot holes and to me lacks action scenes. This anime included strange fan-service that made no sense to me. *spoiler* One scene wherehis childhood friend just randomly starts stripping. To me I was like what is going on. This show also lacked detail on what kind of game this was. The point system was not explained very well and wasn't shown as much.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment was alright and fair. It had some cliffhangers that made me want to watch it more. But towards the end there were like 3 episodes that were fillers to me in a sense but not sure if it was in the manga. This anime had a feel of Sword Art Online since it had a cameo of the Neuro Link. If you like the futuristic anime that have advancement in technology I would recommend it.",

I know that there are a lot of haters towards this anime just because of the fact that the main protagonist - Haru, is at first a short, fat and rather useless boy who is seen as pitiful and a gamer who garner sympathy from other gamers such as Kuroyukihime and et cetera. However, other than the character side of this anime, the story is pretty good (in my opinion) on how MMORPGs work in our world. We start from rock bottom with level one (noob), and work up to the top (sometimes with a high level friend who introducesus to the game) and we both share the common goal to eventually reach the top of the game. \\n\\n\r\nMy point is that people should not give so much hate to this anime just because the main portag is quite useless and underachieving in terms of how a portag should be XD.",

            "content": "Unlike other virtual rpgs, Accel World has a unique type of story plot. Some elements such as romance are similar, but it doesn't affect the story as a whole. I praise Accel World for creating such a unique environment that is set way into the future, but the story could be a lot better developed.\r\nStory-8\r\nWhat was one of the most intriguing things was that they set a little chubby boy as the main character. It's not that I hate him or anything, I just find it unusual considering how many normal looking guys are present in all other anime. What I know about the storyis that Haru obtains a game that allows him to accelerate in the accel world. If he were to lose all his points in that pvp game, the game would uninstall automatically and all memories associated with the game will be deleted. And so beings a series of adventures of leveling up and fighting other enemies. I appreciate that they create all sorts of enemies. Also, the settings/landscapes for the battle grounds are very interesting. I'll admit though that I found the concept of \"accel world\" hard to follow. Kuroyukihime tries to describe all about it in the first couple episodes, but I cannot seem to get my head around it. It got rather frustrating to be honest, but as the story progressed, the concept became easier to understand. Something that was very interesting was the incarnate system. Obviously, lots of anime involving action have to do with how strong their resolve is; that is, how strong their willpower is. They describe it as the incarnate system in Accel World. Also, there are 2 sides to the incarnate system. One side gives you a stronger power that is done by forming images in your head and pretending that your body is the object. However, the second side fills you with despair, anger, hate, and could potentially draw you into your own darkness and awaken as a relentless monster. When they described it in the later episodes, that was what got me into Accel World.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nif anything, the future virtual world with the neuro-linker is amazing. You literally have a personalize computer by looking through your eyes. You can type and navigate with your hands in mid-air, literally. And the different types of enemies in Brain Burst are well thought out. I can tell Kuroyukihime was thought out very well, considering what her name means. (*Spoiler*/Trivia: Kuroyukihime means black snow princess. kuro = black, yuki = snow, and hime = princess) Although, i do not understand what a butterfly has to do with \"snow\" or what not, but shes definitely one of the best designed characters, not just in terms of her looks, but her personality, and character. If anything, I already fell for her the first minute I saw her in the anime. And who would've thought that she was so into games. It's like a dream girl for most guys. All i can say about the art in this anime is that it is very detailed. This is probably one of the main reasons why I've come to like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9 \\n\r\nI love the first ending of Accel World: unfinished. Makes a great ddr/osu music and the vocalist has a very strong voice to be able to hit the high notes. All openings and endings are great, I'm just more biased towards the first ending just because my tastes are especially into that music. The anime soundtrack itself isn't bad either. It works well with the virtual world, but to be honest it doesn't compare to Sword Art Online's OST. The battle sounds and animation in the pvp fights are pretty good. It's not too fascinating, but I've grown to like it anyway. If you get a chance, I would recommend that you listen to the openings and endings\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nI'll be frank, I do not like Haruyuki. I'm sure he is strong willed and what not, but I cannot imagine a pig having such strong powers and gaining the love from a black snow princess. As I mentioned earlier, it is unusual, and unfortunately it does not work with me. He keeps saying sorry in real life for doing the littlest things, and only fights well because of his will power and friendship bonds. He can't keep his emotions down all the time either, which can cause him to go on a rampage. Ironically, I love Kuroyukihime. Her smartness and cleverness really shines out in this anime. And i'm pretty happy that she goes all the way to attract the main guy who is always being bullied and looked down on. Would i marry her? of course, if she was real. I'm glad that they look into the other minor characters with depth. That way, it gives us a better understanding as to what their relationship is to one another. It makes the story easier to understand, despite the fact that the story is not all based around them. The character development as a whole is well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 9\\n\r\nIf you are bored and are desperate to watch an anime, I would probably recommend this. If you're not into virtual games or romance involving the most beautiful girl pairing up with the most unlikely of characters, then you would probably not want to watch it. I'd recommend this because of its story plot, music, and action. Romance is all cliche in a way, other than who the lovers are, but it still fits into the story. I would love to watch accel world again, if I grow bored, but I would want to be in that future world even more. It this anime the greatest? Of course not. I have seen better, but this is an anime I do not regret watching. I understand all the criticism on this anime. Rightfully so, but somethings you just can't agree with. If this anime can affect me emotionally, I consider it good in itself.",

First off, I would like to say that I am a huge Sword Art Online, so when I found out that the same person was involved with Accel World, I was eager about what this one was about. I can honestly say that I was just as impressed with this one as I was with SAO.\r\nStory (8)\r\nI found the story to be very interesting because I found myself getting involved with the world and wanting to know the reason for this world as well. However, I gotta say that when they pulled anothermove like in SAO for the second half, I was not as involved. Nevertheless, I was definitely involved with each character and each scene emotionally. So I gotta give it an 8, for there are few animes that can emotionally involve me personally (especially when there are animes like Angel Beats).\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\n... the graphics were fantastic. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\r\nWhen it comes to animes, if the opening does not catch my attention, I will drop the anime. However, this is not the only reason I would drop an anime. Overall, I loved the music, the sound effects were pretty spot on. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\r\nI've always loved watching animes as the characters grow and develop. With all of the characters in this one, every character, especially Silver Crow and Cyan Pile grow so much as characters as they bond after reforging their friendship. Also, I could connect to each of the character's relationships with each other as well. It was great to see each relationship, especially with Silver Crow and Black Lotus, grow and become very close. I think that meeting a gamer in person helps form a bond, which can lead to a lasting friendship and/or a friendly rivalry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\r\nI loved it! It has been one of the few animes that I could bing watch and enjoy every second of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\r\nIf you love action and want some good character development, this is definitely worth the time!",

            "content": "I love the idea behind the show, it was really exiting just exploring the risks and possiblities of the burst system. Kuroyukihime was hugely mysterious, you can't tell if you can trust her or not. Her background is particularly interesting and mysterious, enough to draw you into the show.\r\nUnfortunately, beyond episode 12, I'm not feeling it anymore. I think the show needs to focus on building character instead of just furthering the story. We barely knew chiyu, and she's almost been removed from the show, we barely knew Fuuko (sky raker), and she's never around, to top it off, kuroyukihime is on vacation and she'spractically the star of the show. The characters of this arc are not so great. Haru is your boring typical looser that gains courage and becomes a hero. Nomi is the stupidest villain ever, but maybe it might make sense due to the incarnation systems side effects.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, this show is still great. It even hints at ties to Sword Art Online (a similar show made by the same people), which I thought was a neat little touch. I would like to see more progress towards the kings side of the plot, but the show decided to be more episodic or arc like in nature, typical of the larger shonen titles. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are not a shonen fan, it might still be worth watching the first 12 episodes.",

I would really recommend this anime to anyone who goes for action though the romance part in this story is cute too. Since Kuroyukihime who is so pretty actually fell in love with Haru which makes it unbelievable. The battle scene can be improved to be better butoverall it's still awesome!

The rest of the review will be free of spoilers.\r\nNow that we have that out of the way, let's get to the review.)\r\n\"Welcome to the Accelerated World!\"\r\nAccel World is one of two adaptions from Light Novels by Reki Kawahara. While not as popular as its counterpart, it certainly is not a bad adaption. The main weaknesses of anime are that it may lack substance at times and the characters are not all that different from most otheranimes. Although the story and characters are the show's weak points, there are enjoyable arcs, decent characters, and the fantastic art and sound of the work do more than enough to bring this series above other Action or Shounen shows. Accel World is a must watch for any fan of intense fighting scenes. Even if you aren't a fan of fighting or Mecha shows, Accel World is a series that is an enjoyable watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Art: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Accel World is extraordinary. Every scene is animated with great quality and the fighting/action scenes are no exception. Rarely does the quality of the art slip. There was obviously a large amount of the budget put into animation. The fighting scenes are a cut above the rest, with crisp effects and incredible detail. Each fight looks different from the rest, with exciting special moves and skills that are sure to please the eye. The special effects may go a bit over the top at certain times, but this makes them all the more intense, and they bring that \"wow\" factor. The background art isn't a disappointment either. Every episode, the backgrounds are detailed and eye catching. Never did I wonder if the animators were saving money or time with certain scenes, they were all animated beautifully.\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Sound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Accel World is definitely outstanding. The OPs and the EDs are, for the most part, extremely fitting, and are the perfect songs to hype up and end every episode. Even the background music and battle music is extremely well done, with each song fitting the mood and scene. When the special effects come out, so do some great sound effects that help the battles in Accel World shine. The battle music is intense and epic, while the normal background music is soothing and catchy. The only gripe I have is with the second ED, which is not that well suited to the themes in the second half of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Characters: 6\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the adaption falls short. Although the protagonist Haruyuki is supposed to be an overweight, self-esteem lacking character, it seems overdone, to the point where Haruyuki looks like Eric Cartman from South Park. Many watchers may want to drop the show after seeing how Haruyuki is at the beginning of the show. However, Haruyuki does show growth throughout the course of the story, becoming less and less reliant on others and more able to stand on his own. The main female character, Kuroyukihime, is one of the better characters in Accel World. She does have her own flaws in character design, being a near perfect person, and her reasoning at times are a bit far-fetched to believe. The rest of the cast each have defined roles which they fulfill, and they fulfill those roles decently, even though there are some shortcomings. The main antagonist in the second part of the story is not just a character for the purposes of being a villain. His motives are believable and the conflict between him and Haruyuki make sense most of the time. \\n\\n\\n\r\n| Story: 7\\n\\n\r\nTwo sections will be for \"Story\", one with spoilers and one without. Scroll past the spoiler part for \"Enjoyment/Overall\".\\n\\n\r\nNon-Spoiler:\\n\\n\r\nThe general story goes something like this: Haruyuki, the bullied and overweight kid is noticed by for his gaming abilities by the popular one, Kuroyukihime, who wishes for Haruyuki to join her in the Accelerated World, where people battle it for Burst Points which can be used for various purposes in real life and in the Accelerated World. Kuroyukihime wants Haruyuki's help in achieving her goals. The story is fairly clich\u00e9d, popular girl notices the outcast boy, and they become friends and work together. The story isn't really unique or different, but it is a well done story. There are some interesting moments and unique parts, but for the most part, the story is fairly generic. Rarely does the story take risks or deviate from the norm, but it does what it aims to do well. One good aspect of the anime is that there's not a lot of Deus Ex Machina. Very rarely does Haruyuki just acquire new abilities for the sake of defeating enemies. There is always growth and training, not just an unbelievable last moment intervention that comes along and saves him. Most of the Arcs in the story are decent and enjoyable, but some filler episodes ruin the flow of the anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler:\\n\\n\r\nLater in the story, especially during the Noumi arc, things start to get a questionable. The last arc is also a little bit off track of the main focus of the \"main\" story, where Kuroyukihime is looking to defeat other Level 9 Kings. The first few arcs are good, but when Noumi enters, the story falters, especially with Chiyu not explaining her motives for teaming up with Noumi, even though it could've saved her a lot of grief and fighting with Haru and Taku. For a lot of the story, people just become villains with no real change, but luckily their motives are explained after, and they're not just villains for the sole purpose of having villains in the story, but the drama created through the lack of explanations just further adds to the melodramatic nature of Accel World. It's not to say that these melodramatic moments aren't entertaining, but a lot of the time, I sat there scratching my head and asking myself why what happened in the story happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Enjoyment/Overall: 8\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Accel World is enjoyable. The art and music are nice, and even the weak points of story and character are alright. Although there is a lot of melodrama, there's no denying that it doesn't create some interesting moments in the story. Accel World was enjoyable to me, and I don't typically like Mecha and large action and fighting scenes (although the story isn't really about Mecha, the fight scenes are). Accel World is a mostly enjoyable watch for Action fans and non-action fans. I recommend it if you're fine with generic animes that have some interesting aspects to it, or if you're an action fan/mecha fan. If you don't like clich\u00e9d stories or characters, then you should try a few episodes before deciding on dropping it or continuing with the series.",
