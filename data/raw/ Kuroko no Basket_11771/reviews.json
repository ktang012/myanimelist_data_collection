            "content": "The most common criticism I've seen so far of Kuroko no Basket has been how unrealistic it is. I myself am an avid basketball fan who plays regularly and watches NBA games. I can understand the criticism as this anime has a lot of spectacular dunks, blocks and flashy passes, the stuff you usually only see in highlight reels, but occurs regularly throughout the games in here. There's also the shounen elements with the special powers of Generation of Miracles members and other things such as the \"martial arts\" Seiho employs. \r\nThat being said, I am completely ok with this. Why? Because it makes itinteresting. Think about it. As a basketball fan, it'd be great to see the teams run plays like the triangle or pick and roll, but you can't expect the average viewer to understand what's going on. Plus, trying to explain this and other technical terms would eat up screen time and bore a lot of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThis is first and foremost entertainment. Kuroko no Basket is great to watch BECAUSE of these elements. Watching Kagami slam the ball down or Kuruko go ninja and make a flashy pass is far more exciting than watching a player hit an open jumpshot from good ball movement. It's the same reason why many people label the Spurs in the NBA as \"boring\" despite their well-oiled offense. If you really wanted realistic basketball, you'd watch an actual game. What Kuroko no Basket excels at doing is showing how exciting basketball can be to a mainstream audience. I have yet to be disappointed by any of the episodes, as they have all left me with a big, goofy grin on my face from the thrilling games or cliffhangers at the end of each episode. Look around and you'll see that many viewers are not basketball fans, but love this anime. This is great because it's garnering interest in basketball in people that would have never noticed the sport were it not for this anime. This is especially true in Japan, where basketball is nowhere near as popular as sports such as baseball or football(soccer).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the anime itself, it captures your attention with epic scenes, likeable characters, and funny comedy. Kuroko's sudden appearances that startle every character out there is a running gag, opponents with names like \"Papa\" and Kagami's Engrish \"THIS IS JAPANESE LUNCH TIME RUSH!\" keeps things interesting. The story is your classic sports anime, with the Seiren basketball team aiming for the top. However, if you were expecting some athletic, hot-headed knucklehead who excels in the sport...well, that's the deuteragonist Kagami. Kuroko is the protagonist here, and he's an unconventional lead for a sports anime. He's terrible at almost every aspect of basketball except passing and stealing. Together, he and Kagami form a exciting duo to watch reminiscent of real-world duos such as Stockton and Malone. The other characters aren't explored too much and I was afraid the other Seiren members would just become useless bodies, but slowly we've been introduced to their own unique skills. The only other characters that the anime really delves into are the members of the Generation of Miracles, who are all distinguished by their special powers and...colorful hair, Kuroko included. Here is where the shounen aspect of the show is most visible, with the members displaying everything from behind the backboard shots to full court shooting range (though I have to admit that's really pushing it). They are the equivalent of the boss characters you see in other shounen anime, as Kuroko, Kagami, and the Seiren team must find a way to overcome them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are pretty good, however, animation isn't as consistently fluid as I would've liked. The movement of players shooting or passing the ball feels too rigid or unnatural at times, as if they didn't draw enough frames (with the exception of Aomine's ridiculous handle). It compensates for this by having a lot of slow motion and close up shots of dunks, blocks, and steals which really help excite the viewer and make this anime so thrilling. It is definitely one of the better looking sports anime out there, which is part of what makes it so appealing to a wider audience. For the most part, the music consists of guitar-heavy tracks that come in whenever something notable happens, such as opponents being surprised by one of Kuroko's passes. The opening and ending feature rock songs that keep the same adrenaline pumping feel the anime has. The one thing that really bugs me though is how each episode starts off with a narrator introducing the Generation of Miracles story. It's understandable in the first few episodes, but past that there's no point in it, since viewers would already be familiar with the backstory (Edit: They finally stopped this nearly HALFWAY through the season).\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Kuroko no Basket is an entertaining anime to watch, even if you don't like basketball. The thrilling games will capture your interest and many can relate to the story of going for the top and exceeding expectations, as the underdog Seiren team does time and again. Don't go into Kuroko no Basket expecting expertly executed plays like in real basketball. Don't go into it thinking you'll see a mirror image of a real game in anime form. Go into it expecting a thrilling game of dunks, blocks, and crazy passes, a lot of O.O faces from the characters, and competitive trash talking. Watch it for the determined characters, comedy, and overcoming special powers we've come to love in shounen anime. It doesn't portray basketball too realistically, but realism in this case would only drag a fun anime like this down.",

However sports anime fans or not im sure realize just how awesome this anime is. This could very well be Slam Dunk Successor.\r\nStory-9-Once upon a time, the basketball team of Teikou Middle School rose to distinction by demolishing all competition. The regulars of this team became known as the \"Generation of Miracles\". After graduating from middle school, these five stars went to different high schools with top basketball teams. However, a fact few know is that there was another player of the \"Generation of Miracles\", thephantom sixth player. \\n\r\nThis mysterious player(Kuroko) is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, if little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko, the sixth member of the \"Generation of Miracles\", and Kagami, a naturally talented player who spent most of middle school in America, are aiming to bring Seirin to the top of Japan, taking on Kuroko's old teammates one by one.But along the way there gonna to have to fight teams that are just a strong without a GNOFM(generation of miracles). The 3 kings of Tokyo Seiho-king of the north,\\n\r\nShinsenkan-king of the west and Shutoku-king of the east.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9- is simply amazing. The CG on the hoops whenever they score is well done and the fights....er matches are fluid and crisp. The characters are in detail and very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10-this is were the anime excels. The music gives off a old school hip hop feel to it with a unique Japanese spin. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9- i like how all the characters are different and talented int heir own way. It;s also great to see the series focuses on other characters besides Kuroke(epicness) and Kise(badass). Everyone awesome and likable especially Riko.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is easily, without a doubt one of the best anime ever.",

Kickers, but Captain Tsubasawould always have a special place in my heart.\\n\\n\r\nTo all the sports anime fans that grew up with this style of Shounen, the anime with the potential to dethrone the generally accepted king is finally here. The story is just what you expect from a sports anime, it's unrealistic? It's an anime. How many anime about sports are realistic? hell, other than slice of life how many anime about anything are realistic? and is that really what you are looking for when you're watching anime? realism? the answer is obviously no.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, whoever wrote the anime and drawn the moves definitely knows his basketball since some of the plays are copy/paste from some of the greatest dunks, three-pointers or behind the hoop shots in real life, they know their technical therms, they know how basket works, and they made a damn good anime about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe generation of miracles is exactly what they said it is, miracles, players that usually are born in the united states, once every other decade, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James... except these were born in Japan, all at the same time, and now, they're all rivals. You will love them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is not some overpowered monster that destroys everyone, no, he's very simple, you barely notice him, but you know he creates the biggest hype, and you can barely wait to see what he will be capable of in the future, but he faces hardships, real hardships, he's the underdog you like to root for. Right at the beginning of season 2, his potential will scare you.\\n\\n\r\nHis rivals are not only his rivals, they're his friends, you will get to know them, their traits, you will appreciate the anime as much for its school and story characteristics as much as you will do for the sports component. The character development is ridiculously good, and you will get acquainted with all players from the top teams in about 25 episodes, games last 2 or 3 episodes, which is just the right amount of time, it's packed with action, it's packed with story, it has just the right amount of each!\\n\\n\r\nIt keeps topping itself, over, and over, and over, and you get more and more excited, and not only for basketball or sports fans! No! You can like fighting anime such as Fairy Tail, Zetsuen no Tempest, Bleach, Naruto, and you won't be let down by the action of Kuroko no Basket, I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nNo one would ever thought an anime about basketball could be so interesting, so filled with adrenaline and action packed, no one would ever think it could have such an amazing story, but Kuroko no Basket will prove you wrong, your heart will race, you will laugh, you will get excited, you will root for your favorite characters, and you will watch another, and another, and another, until you inevitably surrender to the awesomeness of Kuroko no Basket.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sports anime, it gets a 10. As an overall anime, it still gets a 10 because it is that awesome!",

            "content": "Before I review this anime, I have to say that I am old school. When you talk about sports and anime, I am from the Slamdunk! generation. I also watch NBA.\r\nFirst episode did a decent job of introducing the main characters. The joke about Kuroko being unnoticed by everyone was funny up until the point that it was actually considered his main weapon on the court. I have to say that the first episode ended badly with this weird unrealistic confrontation between Kuroko and Kagami. Also...I have never seen a basketball player in anime or real life as feminine as Kuroko.\r\nI did keep watching inhopes that this can be anything similar to Slamdunk!\\n\r\nI have to say it was very...very disappointing. Unlike good sports anime, Kuroko no Basket had very little details about the sport itself. Granted the pictures look great, but basketball action was again disappointing. When watching them play, you don't get the real feel of the game, because they do not show much dribbling, defense, and passing. They never showcase realistic basketball skills. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat you know this anime is very shounen. You may be invisible to people because that's your personality. Problem is they actually used that as his weapon on court. cmon bro..realistically, how can you \"disappear\" during a game. and its not just the players in the game that think he dissapears--its EVERYONE.\\n\\n\r\nKuroko's passing is also very fake. You CANNOT touch pass every single possession. Especially when Kuroko is considered \"weak.\" You got to have strong wrists and arms to do one handed passes, touch passes and back hand passes. Especially if you're doing it all game long. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Basically, do not watch this anime if you're expecting anything on the level of Slamdunk. If you like realistic sport animes: Slamdunk!,ookiku furikabutte,  Hajime no Ippo, Major, Giant Killing, and even Chihayafuru.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: After watching episode 12...HOLY ROFLCOPTER this is as bad as Prince of Tennis. If you like animes like Prince of Tennis where the sport itself is being mocked and trampled all over, then this is perfect for you. \\n\\n\r\n**Spoiler alert** I'm sorry but what??? Shooting from full court? and never misses. LOL BRO. whats next, dunking from the 3 point line? pass that goes around the world and lands perfectly in teamates hand?",

            "content": "EDITED AFTER IT FINISHED AIRING (9/22)!\r\nI've never written a review before, but this show is so good, I just had to voice my opinion. I am not a sports anime fan to begin with (well, more like I've never watched one before) but that didn't stand in the way of me loving this show. I started watching this show because everyone was talking about it. I couldn't understand why alot of my friends who are into dark and supernatural (or along the lines of) animes were watching something as random as a sport one. Overall, I found this show to be very funny and enjoyable.I seriously can't get enough. This show is definitely not overrated in my book.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not going to bother summarizing because you can read that yourself everywhere else, but as a huge fan of the manga, it stuck pretty close. There are some minor differences and they cut out some scenes to make it go quicker, but the plot is still there. The story is exciting and even before I read the manga (I started after I watched a few episodes while it was airing), I literally craved the next episode. It is so exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. The biggest thing in this show is probably the value of teamwork, sportsmanship and the cliche, \"whatever you put your heart into and try hard, you will accomplish.\" Thats what I got out of the first few episodes, and being a sports anime, you would think everything in the plot is obvious, but it's not. There's a couple of parts that will surprise you! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's not the most beautifully animated show I've ever watched. I'm not too sure how to explain it, but it's just awkwardly drawn sometimes and it just looks strange. But it's not hideous either. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nBoth openings and both endings are so nice. I even have it on my ipod! But the music during the scenes that are added for effect are kinda cheesy to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAt the beginning, it seemed like there was not much room for character development in Kuroko, since he is one of the ~*~Generation of Miracles~*~. But that's wrong. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9/10\\n\r\nI personally didn't like was that the anime felt so fanservice-y, it was really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the events in kuroko no basket during matches are extremely unrealistic. Like not noticing a player during a match or passes all the way across a court? I think that's what people who dislike this show say the most. But to me, fiction is fiction. They're supposed to be prodigies anyways, so what better way to illustrate that than by adding a little of the impossible. Just like when I watch spongebob, I find it very stupid that a starfish has a face on it's leg. But does it matter? It's still funny and doesn't change the fact that it's a great show.",

            "content": "\u201cThere's no such thing as useless effort.\u201d\r\nKagami Taiga (Kuroko no Basket)\r\nSo, as I have nothing to waste, I will bring to you a review of the immensely praised show that is Kuroko no Basket. Even though it is not a very popular show (not even in the top 100), most people that have watched it are immensely positive about it, and it made me wonder why. After being encouraged to watch the show several times, I figured it was the time to do so \u2013 and I can say it delivered. I soon became one of the people \u201cenchanted\u201d by the show.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nOnce upon atime, there was a basketball team that demolished each and every competition they came across: the all-star team of Teiko Junior High. The team consisted of 5 basketball players with each an astonishing amount of talent, and their own unique speciality: the Generation of Miracles After junior high school ended, the team naturally broke up \u2013 the prodigies all joined different high schools with great basketball teams. However, fairly unknown is that there was actually a 6th player which played in the all-star team of Teiko Junior High: Kuroko Tetsuya. This so called \u201cphantom\u201d player joined a new school, with an unknown basketball team, unlike the other prodigies. At this school, Seirin High, Kuroko meets Kagami Taiga, a natural basketball talent who has just returned from America (where he had lived for some years). Together, they are aiming to beat the generation of miracles, and become the strongest in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s just a very solid storyline, which is able to keep the viewer interested over the course of episodes, but it\u2019s not stunning either. It isn\u2019t a very complex storyline which leaves the viewer thinking, but rather a very simple storyline which is enjoyable to watch. The show does not have much filler, yet is not too serious either \u2013 this was a huge plus to me. It was a very refreshing watch; a show I could really enjoy without putting too much thought into it. The pace is very good, as I found myself blowing through episodes one after another. However, I was a little disappointed at the predictability of some (or maybe most) of the matches, and the story as a whole. But that does not take away the fact that the story is very enjoyable. Most people that dislike KnB do so because of its unrealism \u2013 but I don\u2019t agree on that. It\u2019s the unique abilities and unrealistic shots that keep the viewer thrilled. I think the majority of the people would not like watching very plain basketball games as seen in real life. In short, Kuroko no Basket features a simple, yet very enjoyable story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing astonishing here, nothing bad either. It is not a visual masterpiece, but some episodes really had a nice atmosphere to them due to the excellent animation in them. The drawing style is nothing to complain about either. Overall, I\u2019d say that given the budget, they did a great job on the art: it is more than decent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nSound is one of the aspects in which KnB really shines. The openings and endings are very good (and fitting), but even more impressive is the soundtrack during the episodes. They really manage to enhance the atmosphere of the matches and make episodes more thrilling than they already are. The sound acting is very well done as well \u2013 the sound as a whole is just excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAs for the characters, logically, the biggest focus is on Kuroko and Kagami. They are thoroughly described, and made to be very likeable: they both have characterising traits which perfectly fit their basketball abilities. The 5 \u201cProdigies\u201d are very well done too \u2013 as far as the ones we get to know in season 1. Furthermore, we get to know a variety of characters in the high school basketball scene. While they weren\u2019t all given the necessary description (for example, I think the other players in Seirin could have gotten more of a backstory), they were still decent enough to fulfil their roles.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI honestly enjoyed Kuroko no Basket as much as I was told I would. While the show definitely has some flaws and is not nearly as enthralling or well thought out as others (I\u2019m looking at you, Fate/Zero, Steins;Gate), it still turned out to be a great source of enjoyment. The matches actually did manage to keep me on the edge of my seat, and managed to get me to play basketball myself! It made me want to try those fascinating shots in real life, and got me to look up more about basketball as well. In short, if you are looking for a refreshing (perhaps simple) anime, or just really like sports shows, then you should certainly give this show a watch \u2013 because that\u2019s what Kuroko no Basket has to offer.\\n",

            "content": "Short Overall: Thoroughly enjoying, dynamic and engaging, and possesses characters that you will undoubtedly grow to love. Fantastic soundtrack to accompany somewhat seamless scenes, along with great visuals. Although it doesn't have a complicated plot with unexpected twists, Kuroko no Basket gives so much more than just your average sports series. \r\nPreviously, Kuroko no Basket had appeared in numerous threads and places whenever i was searching for something new to delve into. As a non-sports fan myself, i wasn't interested in this series until i read the reviews for it. Many of the people's comments stated that although they didn't like sports themselves, they foundthemselves enjoying the series thoroughly. So, why not try it out?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Over the 25 episodes, you're introduced to a wide array of characters that each possesses their own unique quality. They were all very likable, even if a few seemed difficult. The majority of them were given back stories that informed the viewer of their past, which was good for character development. Perhaps i would have liked to see a more thorough explanation of a few of the character's background.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One of the things i liked best about this series was the soundtrack. They were inputted perfectly and in the right scenes to give that bit an extra \"oomph\". Alongside this, there was a nice variety of different compositions to emphasize the atmosphere of the scene at the time. I especially loved the song near the end of the series, at the end of the last basketball match.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The visuals were nothing special, nothing of say, a Shinkai masterpiece, but it was nevertheless pleasing to the eye. During some episodes the quality did fall slightly, but my best guess was that it was due to budget. Some of the  animation in the scenes were brilliant, and made the movement of the characters seem much more fluent. \\n\\n\r\nStory: As i said previously, this show does not contain many serious twists and plot changes that will have the viewer sitting on the edges of their seats. That being said, i fully believe that it doesn't need twists to be a brilliant series. The enjoyment i got from this series was not because the storyline was complex, but because it was easy to follow and easy to enjoy. Everything was explained smoothly, and very few plot holes were left. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was surprised - incredibly surprised- at how much i ended up loving this series. It was hilarious, exciting and really fun to watch and to engage yourself into. I ended up loving the characters and sympathizing with each of them.  Kuroko no Basket is an engaging anime, and is one of the few i genuinely re-watch. It goes on my top 5.",

            "content": "\"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.\"\r\nAs a retired participant familiar with competitive high school basketball, I must admit Kuroko no Basket reminded me of the exact reasons why I fell in love with the sport. Adrenaline, leadership, endurance, and most of all, team work. In a world with so many instructed paths to follow, should one rely on team work, or their own skills in a sport like basketball? Surely, Kuroko no Basket tackles this question with considerable reflexes, not with constant waves of seriousness but with tremendously well organized comedy and series of basketball tournaments, which comprises of flashy to not-so-flashyshots. But, those of you experienced with the sport or have actively followed daily lives of NBA athletes know that made-shots can never be considered flashy, or absurd. Since, what essentially makes basketball such an exciting sport is scoring a hoop which one would've never expected to otherwise, without a whim of luck or practice. \\n\\n\r\nBesides whim and practice, though, there's also something many labels as \"talent\", but can anybody even consider being skinny-boned, inconspicuous an advantage? Well, many could beg to differ, Kuroko included. \\n\\n\r\n5'6 and 125 pounds, Kuroko is nothing short of an elementary school kid who lost his way on a school field trip compared to an average athlete. Although unable to achieve a standard masculinity, Kuroko obtains extraordinary skills of creating illusions and making expeditious passes to his teammates. He's an interesting character, and his unseen ability attracts five other mysterious individuals. The Generation of Miracles is a label given to these five apparent prodigies of basketball, and during their middle school careers they were enrolled into the same team as Kuroko. Due to disagreements on how one should proceed with basketball, however, Kuroko leaves his five reliable friends, and begins seeking for his own style of playing at Seirin High School.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, Kuroko immediately stumbles upon a hot-headed, ambitious American basketball player named Taiga, and their adventures of crushing the Generation of Miracles start there. What defines Kuroko no Basket as an exciting anime then is how they proceed to demonstrate how eccentrically one could play out basketball--not as simply a sport, but a fiery passion. Due to the focus on this element, the director purposely emphasized the amazingness of dunks, and how even difficultly-leveled (fade-away, etc.) shots were easily prosecuted. Of course, it does then leave out very uncoordinated, clogged dialogue in the middle of games and though trash talking between teams is common, I think they did drag out some of the excessive dialogue. But, even those flaws just as effortlessly get rampaged over by aggressive characters like Taiga. \\n\\n\r\nOftentimes bluntly assertive, Taiga is Kuroko's teammate, but also much more than a teammate. He oafishly overcomes major issues without much thought, but is at the same time someone who accompanies Kuroko in the worst of times. Although bearing only one simple ambition, Taiga embodies a colorful amount of energetic traits you'd want in anyone, which greatly constitutes the overall spontaneity in the team. And his egotistic self committing outrageous acts is just a genuinely hilarious element of Kuroko no Basket. Even among the side characters are several mentionable members with similarly strong aspiration, and where one can find the diverse ranks of this series. The Generation of Miracles especially, begin as merely two-dimensional enemies that Kuroko needed to face, but eventually progress into characters with intriguing insights of handling one's adeptness in any sports. \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to animation, the character designs are well-done. Animated action sequences were all smoothly and feasibly produced. Some camera angles really capture the correct atmosphere for the tense phases in games, while sometimes the focuses on long distance shots were mostly kind of awkward. Nonetheless, the major frameworks followed coherent transitions for the characters to move freely on the court. Although some of the jumps and passes (alley-oops, etc.) in Kuroke no Basket are \"ridiculous\" even if made by professionals, it fit all so well with the over-the-top nature of the show that Kuroko no Basket wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable without them. The so-called impossibly-made hoops don't actually distract from the story and thus are vigorously exaggerated slams more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks all viably made the series more interesting as it progressed - with change of pacing of some notably well-done melodies of hard rock, alternative, to relaxing, chill music. The OP appropriately fit the momentum some episodes started with, though a repetitive introduction of the generation of miracles does drag on for more than half of the series, which they did finally decide to rid of with a renewal of an alternative, better OP. Likewise, the OST is appropriately integrated within the series.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the bizarreness and absurdity are often what makes Kuroko no Basket stand out even among its shounen precedents like Slam Dunk and TTGL. Every character who speaks a line obtains a certain role in the story, never disappear off the screen without substantial explanation, and makes every shoot, block, or pass worthy of paying attention to. The story never nags the audience with unnecessary material, and it doesn't rely on a supernatural setting to make its exciting action scenes work. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all, Kuroko no Basket is really a nonchalant character when it comes to presenting wicked ways of playing basketball in real life, yet it speaks through its friendly characters the sweat and tears which someone would invest into the sport. Surely, Kuroko no Basket provides exhilarating visuals; but even more, it promotes the importance of sportsmanship, and is truly inspirational. I highly recommend this series to basketball enthusiasts and those looking for a spirited shounen anime at its best.",

            "content": "Y'know, for a show which was pretty retarded a lot of times, it wasn't too bad. Now you may be thinking \"he didn't give it a 10, what does this man know of this show's greatness\". Well, let me explain what it did right and wrong. But first an explanation of the story. \r\nThe anime starts off by explaining that a team of 6 players were the legendary super saiyans that had the ability to slap their \"special\" (special is the keyword here folks) golden cocks in the faces of their opponents. Now let me translate, a middle school team dominated their league and theirplayers were given the name the generation of miracles. Each player in the generation of miracles has their own special ability.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot focuses on the relationship between the two main characters, their relationship with their teammates and mostly how the team will win tournaments.\\n\r\nKuroko's plan is the help Kagami achieve his goal by becoming his \"shadow\" whilst Kagami is his \"light\". Obviously Kagami's goal is to be the strongest player in japan. \\n\\n\r\nSo a fairly normal plot for a sports anime, but I mean c'mon, aside from being the strongest player or the best team or winning a tournament, what else can a sports anime do? Do you want them to turn evil and fuck everything up?\\n\\n\r\nNow, what it did right, ahem:\\n\\n\r\n1. Relationship between main two characters.\\n\r\nNow the main highlight of this anime is the relationship between Kuroko and Kagami shared as partners, almost like brothers. Majority of the time the matches would be decided because of the actions of their teamwork. They are the underdogs, you'd naturally root for those two to win the game. The concept of Kuroko being Kagami's shadow and Kagami being Kuroko's light was a fairly nice one and it was good that it was further explored later on in the show. Individually Kuroko is the most interesting of the pair, physically he is weak but he is mentally strong. He brings the best out of Kagami whilst also helping to drive the team forward, he feels more like a teamplayer whilst Kagami feels a bit like a lone wolf. \\n\r\nThat's not to say Kagami isn't interesting as well, he may be a hot head but if it wasn't for him the show would lack a lot of it's \"woah\" moments.\\n\\n\r\n2. Relationship between Seirin team overall.\\n\r\nAgain, another thing this show did right as a sports anime was how they presented the main team to you, a group of likable characters with their own skills that contribute to the whole team. \\n\r\nTeamwork was the key here and even though it felt cliched at points in the anime, honestly, it's rather undeniably logical that teamwork is vital, even if it's constantly mentioned.\\n\r\nSeirin are the underdogs of this show, you'd think \"oh those guys are way stronger than Seirin, they'd never lose to them\", but secretly you want Seirin to win, think of it like a psychological thing, you know the odds of Seirin losing are high but it'd be pretty fucking sweet if they did win. Honestly this is the kind of thing I like about sports anime, they'll present you with odds which aren't in favour of the underdog team, yet they'll still pull through and win. The anxiety and suspense it builds up can really give you the feeling that you're part of that winning moment. Unless your name is Aomine and can just fuck up all the odds like a dick. \\n\\n\r\n3. Sound and animation\\n\r\nGenerally speaking this doesn't really contribute much to an overall score really, animation and sound aren't important as characters and the story. In terms of enjoyment it plays a role. But it did have pretty nice OP's and ED's. Good to see GRANRODEO back. \\n\r\nOST was good as well, not amazing though, considering they'd just play the same few good songs over and over. But it did play a major factor in the deciding moments of the game, you felt engrossed in the moment, it made it just a bit more enjoyable.\\n\r\nAnimation was good, nothing special, there were noticeable drops in quality here and there but still, it did it's job. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about what it fucked up in:\\n\\n\r\n1. Repetitive matches.\\n\r\nThis is where the show starts to stumble, most of the time matches will consist of back and forth power ups. At one point one team will be leading, then Kagami gets annoyed and starts dunking like there's no tomorrow. Then the other team will power up to get the ball around Kagami and score more points. Seirin will start working together, again powering up, to get back into the game. Now you're probably thinking \"well duh, they mention in the show that the flow of the game can easily be lost by the other team gaining momentum, the matches would be boring if it was just one team dominating, it has to be a bit back and forth\". That doesn't excuse the fact that it's fucking repetitive and when something becomes repetitive it becomes boring. The only reason people aren't get bored is because the power ups get more shiny. \\n\\n\r\n2. Poor power balance\\n\r\nThis is where the show starts to become retarded, the generation of miracles are extremely overpowered. Midorima, a member of the generation of miracles  has 100% accuracy on his shots so you are literally fucked, this guy literally fucks you over sideways. That's not a special ability, it's too off scale, honestly if it wasn't for Kagami in the team Seirin would just lose all their matches against the generation of miracles and there lies the problem. Aside from Kagami, no one else can stand up to the generation of miracles, Kuroko can only pass so he can't do much else. The other members of the Seirin team are nowhere near as good as the generation of miracles so if it was just their entire team vs Midorima, he'd still just win on his own. \\n\\n\r\n3. Retarded power ups and overpowered characters\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before the overpowered characters really fuck up the power balance but they ultimately make the matches less enjoyable. Characters become so overpowered that it's ridiculous, the shit they pull off is retarded. Aomine is the biggest fucker in the entire show, he is so overpowered that he can take on an entire team and not get tired, he'd rip them to shreds, why? Because he's Aomine that's why. You literally do not stand a chance against him. He just keeps on pulling shit from his ass and destroys the opposing teams. The same applies for Midorima with his 100% accuracy anywhere on the court, he could score 3 pointers all the time. \\n\r\nI understand that if this show was realistic it would be boring, but that doesn't mean it can be fucking retarded as well, there isn't a balance, the abilities the generation of miracles posses is just too unfair and ultimately hinders the enjoyment of the matches.\\n\\n\r\nIndividual Scores:\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 5/10]\\n\r\n[Characters: 6/10]\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10]\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10] \\n\r\nOverall: 6/10",

            "content": "Like any other shounen  Kuroko No Basuke tends to be very slow and with little character development .. It often relies on comedy like un-going gags or catchphrases ..\r\n.. Even so usually the best part of shounen is the intensity and emotionally gripping moments it brings.. In my opinion Kuroko no basuke was 50% of the time far from tense and it seemed really forced and unappealing.. The characters are cardboard cuttouts that even with actual motivations honestly it isnt enough to make a certain character good..\r\nThe characters are predictable and with a one-dimensional personality.\r\nThe premise is quite original however they dont make reallygood use of it due to the stereotypical nature and the predictableness behind it.. \\n\\n\r\nFirst its about Kuroko helping kagami to become a good player at the level of the \"kiseki no sedai\" and then theres character arcs for Kise, Midorima and Aomine.. wich, SURPRISE,  its the genki airhead guy, the intelectuall prick and the \"THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT MYSELF IS ME\" guy wich by that you\u00b4re already imagining that he is a total dick.. \\n\\n\r\nThe show often relies on its good animation, like a big old fat man riding his ferrari around the town and still getting some..

Having had read the manga beforehand, im aware of how each of the five are portrayed and I cant fault the series to how they have developed and portrayed them so far.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it does bring into question how a kids around the age of first year high schoolers can be over 6ft tall but that is the beauty of 2D world, anything can happen. \\n\r\nIf you are one of those who are pedantic about these petty details and decided to make a pass on the series then youre definitely missing out.\\n\\n\r\nEvery week, you just cant wait to see the next episode to be aired just to get more exhilarating action. \\n\r\nIn my opinion, this IS one of the best series to be released and i hope it gets more episodes as it is just pure enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSummarise why this series needs to be watched:\\n\r\n- Great animation quality\\n\r\n- Great art style\\n\r\n- Great characters\\n\r\n- Great soundtrack\\n\r\n- Great voices\\n\r\n- Great story\\n\r\n- Great enjoyment\\n\r\nYou cant miss out on something with that many greats in :)",

            "content": "Note: this is my first review on this site but I'm pretty confident that this will be helpful.\r\nYou don't have to know how to play Basketball if you want to enjoy this show or watch the NBA- though you should try just to see what it's like in real life but Kuroko no Basuket, also known as Kuroko's Basketball is an anime that will keep you glued to your seat from the first episode. Now, I have to say that I wasn't a very big fan of sports anime, in fact I disliked the whole lot of it, or I just didn't really have anyinterest in them. I have watched (The prince of tennis) before and it was average to me. I've heard of (Slam Dunk) and other sports anime that were famous but they sounded boring to me(not anymore). Kuroko to Basuket was the first sports anime that I gave myself a chance to watch, and I'm VERY glad that I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe Teiko middle school basketball club. An incredibly strong team with over 100 members and 3 consecutive championship wins. Amongst their brilliant record, the generation of 5 prodigies was known as \"The Generation Of Miracles.\" However, there was a strange rumor concerning the Generation Of Miracles. Despite being relatively unknown and lacking a game record, there was one more member recognized by the 5 prodigies. A phantom sixth man... (You'll recognize this soon) The story of Kuroko and Kagami and of course their team (Seirin) struggle and getting stronger and aiming for the top throughout the series is just absolutely amazing, because there is more than that of course. And with a great mix of comedy at times like the old classic joke when Kuroko suddenly appears and disappear and Kagami's English speaking skills. Now, I won't spoil anything so you can watch the series for yourself, but If you don't like the first few episodes, then you'll probably drop the series sooner or later. The development of the story is normal paste and they adapted the manga very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n With Production IG doing the animation, expect it to be nice and fluid (Have you seen Guilty Crown?), but not always. They can't just go changing the art style that the original creator of the manga (Fujimaki, Tadatoshi) did. But don't get me wrong, this kind of art is perfect for a sports anime, as for a sports anime the characters at many times are always moving around and that is not easy to animate though it can be rigid at times. They did a very good job in my opinion. This art style really brings out the aspects of the characters. It's not the best, but I like it. Overall the animation is great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAlright, I swear that I heard dubstep tracks in many episodes, not hardcore like Skrillex of course. The other tracks are pretty good but not outstanding. The score does a good job when telling the way the game is drifting and the emotions of players. (Has anyone ever heard Guilty Crown OST?) - No, the sound track of Kuroko to basket is good and has a nice pace.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThroughout the series, you get to see the different factors of major characters, what they went through, how they get stronger, and by all means... They never give up. This is what made them who they are today, look at Serin for an example, but I don't think this applies for Aomine and maybe some of the [GOM] \\(*[]*)/ Anyway, you will find that from the beginning to the end the characters change, some little and some drastically, like Kagami.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI just love this show from the bottom of my heart. To tell you the truth, I'm not a very active person. I don't play sports or exercise much, and I know this is only an Anime, but this show inspired me to go outside and actually DO SOMETHING! - No I am not a hikikomori, and plz don'th think I'm pathetic cause I don't exercise! So... all in all you really will enjoy this show;)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis show is great and I think most people will really like it. It's not a masterpiece, but it's VERY close to it. Hope there will be a season 2, maybe there will because of the profit the company's making since this is a hit anime in Japan WOOOOOOOO! Thanks for reading my review if you did :D",

            "content": "Other reviewers have already covered the \"unrealisticness\" of Kuroko no Basket, so I'm going to get right into the anime itself; what makes it so good. And what make it so good? \r\nIts storyline and characters.\r\nThe storyline is essentially Seirin High School's basketball team trying to be the best of its kind. It contains two of the story's main characters: Kuroko Tetsuya and Kagami Taiga. What makes Kuroko no Basket's characters so interesting is how diverse they are; the story\u2019s main characters, Kuroko and Kagami, could not be more different. This of course, makes the anime interesting, as you get to see the same experiencestold with two different perspectives. Strangely enough, while Kuroko and Kagami have completely different personalities and views on the game of basketball, they share the same goal: wanting to push Seirin High School to the top. They start on rough terms; however, it is immediately noticeable that if Kuroko and Kagami are able to achieve perfect teamwork, they would form an effective offensive partnership that would be impossible to stop.\\n\\n\r\nTheir goal is not easily attainable by any means, a point that is driven home with each successive game they play. There is simply so much talent within their competition; especially so with the teams containing any of the Generation of Miracles, \u201ca generation of five players with talents that you would see once every ten years\u201d. Despite Seirin also containing one of the Generation of Miracles in Kuroko, he is seen as somewhat of an underdog. Seirin also possesses Kagami; however, he is portrayed as a reckless hot-shot who still has much to learn. As a result, Seirin is characterized as an underdog school. However, that characterization only serves to make the story more enjoyable, as it creates situations where Seirin emerges as the dark horse within the competition. \\n\\n\r\nWatching an underdog improve, learn from its mistakes, and surpass its superiors is extremely rewarding. Why would anyone want to watch a set of unquestionably superior individuals squashing their competition, with little to no challenge? And that is the crux of Kuroko no Basket\u2019s greatness. It is a story about a group of underdogs who are on the rise to stardom, wanting to be the best; a story of trials and tribulations, success and failure. Watching Seirin's group of guys trying to achieve their ultimate goal only leads to a feeling of satisfaction; if you don't like Kuroko no Basket, you don't like anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "What makes a good basketball player? There are many attributes to consider here, but most of them amount to the same thing: athletic ability.\r\nKuroko Tetsuya lacks it. He's small, he's slim, he cannot dribble, he cannot shoot, and he has no stamina. In fact, everything about him is so incredibly unremarkable that he is practically invisible both on court and off. Thus, he considers himself \"a supporting actor, a shadow\", one whose goal it is to help another one achieve greatness, or, as he puts it, \"to make the brightness of a light stand out\".\r\nOriginally the rumored phantom sixth man of the \"Generation of Miracles\",a middle school team who used to demolish the competition, he is tired of his previous teammates' way of playing. With the only recently formed Seirin High School Basketball club and his newly chosen \"light\" Kagami Taiga, Kuroko aims to take on the former members' of the Generation of Miracles new clubs one by one, and in doing so prove the importance of team spirit. That is \"Kuroko no Basket\" \u2013 \"Kuroko's Basketball\" \u2013 the way of playing Basketball which Kuroko firmly believes in.\\n\\n\r\nJust like Kuroko possesses the skill of misdirection, each player, coaches and managers not excluded, has a special ability. These abilities are not something a basketball player of flesh and blood would be realistically able to perform and feel like super powers from a battle sh\u014dnen. One might be fooled by the large portion of BL-themed fan art for the show, but Kuroko no Basket is a  typical show of its demographic. In addition to fast-paced action and silly comedy, interpersonal relationships are important only inasmuch as the importance of friendship and camaraderie within a sports team is shown.\\n\\n\r\nAll the more of a bummer is it that with the exception of Kuroko and Kagami, the players of Seirin High remain oddly flat and feckless during these first 25 episodes, while the Generation of Miracles whose haughtiness Kuroko has come to detest slowly turn out to be the true stars of the show. This discrepancy is even reflected by their character designs: the Seirin players, with the exception of Kuroko and Kagami, all have relatively realistic hair colors, whereas the members of the Generation of Miracles have flashy unnatural hair colors most of which resonate with their names. It often seemed to me as if the show was contradicting its intended message by making the remaining Seirin players feel like extras in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nI was rather disappointed with the humor in Kuroko no Basket. I thought it was cheap and felt forced, but in the end, humor, even more so than anything else, is a matter of personal preference, and while I was especially annoyed by Kagami's Engrish, others have deemed it the highlight of the show. The highly suspense-packed, fast-paced basketball matches on the other hand were a joy to watch, and are the reason I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for a second season.",

            "content": "After being told over and over again by a fried that i needed to watch this show i finally caved in, and gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised by the show and enjoyed watching it from start to finish. Everything about the show was done very well. As someone who as played basketball up the varsity level it was pretty funny to see all of the classic stereotypes make an appearance in the show. \r\n*if you don't want a summary of the show skip the first paragraph\r\nJust a short summary before we start, Kuroko no Basket follows the story of a High schoolbasketball team that has only been established for 2 years. At the beginning of the school year they were able to recruit two freshmen who were exceptionally talented, and figured that they would have a good shot at winning a championship that year. The only problem is this year the \"generation of miracles\", which is a team of 5 players who were believed to be unbeatable, also entered high school the same year. Each of the miracle players went on a different team and each has their own unique talent. And all of them went to a different school that the main team would have to play against in order to win a championship.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect that was done especially well was the character development. While some of the back-stories of a few of the players were left out, each of them had their own traits that made them unique. That being said despite the fact that all the characters were unique, the show decided to focus primarily on 2 players in particular. This doesn't hurt the story too bad, but it definitely leaves you wishing some of the other players would get just a little more screen time. \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing i liked about this show was the fact that team that the story followed didn't take and extreme side of the spectrum when they started off. This is sadly pretty common in any show including a team of some sort, where one of 2 things happens. Either the team is sucks and losses every game until a magical transformation near the end, or the worse of the two, when the team simply put never looses. Thankfully Kuroko no basket doesn't take one side or the other.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the show had an interesting way of pacing its self. I liked the way they presented the story, where they would give the thoughts of every character whenever the chance was presented. This was nice because it helped further aid the character development and give you a good idea of what was going through everyone's head at a given time. But this same thing that made the show good, was also something that bugged me a little bit. This was because it didn't stop even during games. This lead to the pace being slowed down drastically during what would normally be very fact paced, or instantaneous events. and then while it really wasn't a huge deal it is worth mentioning that some of the \"abilities\" that the players from the generation of miracles had were blown a bit out of proportion which while they weren't meant to be funny i did find myself getting a good chuckle from time to time even during scenes that were suppose to be serious on behalf of these near super human basket ball skills. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end Kuroko no Basket was a very good show that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys sports anime or even a good laugh once in a while.",

            "content": "Hi, this is my review for Kuroko no Basket. If you decide to vote \"Not Helpful\", please tell me why you did so on my profile as I always look to improve and please, read the review.\r\nStory: 4/5 Plot, 1/5 Development, Total 5/10\r\nKuroko, now a junior high school student starts his semester Seirin High School, a team in it's 2nd year. What the other players at Seirin soon find out is that he was a player on the legendary Teiko Middle School team, and was known as the \"phantom sixth man\". Along with Kagami Taiga, Kuroko decides to beat the \"Generation of Miracles\", Kuroko's oldteammates which are all split up among schools around the area.  Reason why, is because Kuroko thinks they no longer know what it is to play basketball as a team.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kuroko no Basket is not very exceptional, but it's also unique in a way that the main characters don't only seek to be the best, but to beat 5 specific people. As the story unfolds we have few sidesteps from the main story and most of it is predictable. However, the plot keeps you going since you always want to see Kuroko's other teammates and learn about them.\\n\\n\r\nI am a person that can continue watching shows even after they are spoiled for me, but if you really can't handle knowing most of what will happen in the next episode, you might want to skip this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/5 Art, 4/5 Animation, Total 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is detailed and thoroughly done. The animators, drawers, whatever they're called making this animation and art have really outdone themselves. I mean, I really have nothing to complain about. However, when watching I noticed that some of the animation might've been missing some frames.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/4 Voices, 2/2 OP/ED , 4/4 OST, Total 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't complain a lot about the voices except for a few unfitting ones on a few of the supporting characters, however these don't really matter and the voice actors for Kagami, Midorima and Kuroko I think are exceptional.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED of Kuroko no Basketball are definetly not lacking and work really well for introducing the episod eand ending it. Can't complain.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the OST, we have Gyakushuu, Kagami Taiga, Misdirection and ofcourse Sessen. If you haven't heard Sessen or missed it in the anime, then I beg you; seriously. Go listen to it. Right now. The OST collection this anime has is one of the best if not the best. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/5 Design, 4/5 Development, Total 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kind of simple and clich\u00e8, but they got nice details to them and the fact that they represent a color of their own(Each have a color in their name) is really neat. Though the characters might seem clich\u00e8, I know the original mangaka put a lot of work into them. I can't see why people would dislike any of the characters for a bad design. The team is enjoyable to watch and even the simple talk is great, there's even more development further which makes me really like this show.\\n\\n\r\nOur two main characters and a description:\\n\r\nKuroko - strongwilled though silent, a bit of a smart type MC\\n\r\nKagami - probably more of a MC than Kuroko, eats a lot(clich\u00e9), musclehead\\n\\n\r\nAnd also, plot twist: The girl is the coach, not the manager!\\n\r\nThroughout the anime we have nice development arcs and we have deep insight in what the characters feel and think. The characters are never left alone once in the spotlight and the anime does a good job at the development(for a shounen anime!).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, though I maybe liked the 2nd season a bit more. There are neatly placed puns and jokes inbetween the serious matches and the anime is both full of action and full of great humour.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for very good. It is a good anime to watch but it's not a must see though it gives sometimes a good laugh and sometimes scenes so serious you think you're playing basketball yourself. I recommend it to everyone with the random thought \"I should watch a sports anime\"(the case for me). And if you've already watched it, you should watch \"Haikyuu!\" which probably is my favourite sports-and overall anime.",

I couldn\u2019t imagine how they could make such a game exciting. But started since I had been recommended it so much and Hajime no Ippo was the only sports anime I had seen yet. What is about boxing so it is still as much similar to fighting as to sports. So I decided to give it a chance and you cannot believe how happy I am that I saw this serie. However the serie isn\u2019t finished yet, it hasbecome one of my top 5 anime with the potential to jump to number one. If the serie keeps evolving itself, like it is doing now.\\n\\n\r\nBut what was so good about it? well I would say everything. But lets starts with probably the best part of the serie the characters. The character development is very well done. The way every character is introduced and developed during a game. The order and the timing of how you learn the characters. The way you are starting to appreciate or even admire almost every player, even when you disagree with their way of thinking. This especially on the (ex)members of the generation of miracles. Then the characters on there own are so good and so original. Lots of them really inspired me with their thoughts. The combination of all of them gave me that much motivation that I play much better since then. I don\u2019t even play basket but hockey is a teamsport of 5 players so it is kinda the same. Especially the thoughts of the generation of miracles and of course that of serin itself motivated me. Really everything of this serie could\u2019ve been made just by the wonderful characters with wonderful spirits but it even got support on top of that. The drawings of the players when they play basketball with all their movements are really well done and detailed. It has a great Ost that fits the serie perfectly. Especially the rock guitar solos for in the game are good however the sad music is also good. The voice acting wasn\u2019t bad either but most of the voice actings are from superb level in anime. All this made it very enjoyable. I was suprisely never bored while watching it what is pretty rare in my case. The way the series just keep becoming better is just like a car that accelerates if it keep going like this with the end as absolutely climax. It will become without doubt my favorite serie ever.",

            "content": "Pros\n+Crisp Character designs\n+Clear Animation\n+Nice Soundtrack\nCons\n-Unrealistic\n-BL dialogue\n-Uninspired storyline\n-Lackluster protagonist\n-Melodramatic\nKuroko no basuke, is a popular basketball manga/anime that strives to be successful as Slam Dunk but falls flat on its non-proverbial ass (this is a big ass grotesque anime) many times along the way. Kuroko no basuke is an anime about a group of basketball players called the generation of Miracles. This legendary densetsu group won all the Japanese junior high basketball championships. In particular the anime concerns the actions of the titular character Kuroko and his transition to seirin high school, his new team and their aspirations for national championship status.\nStory 7/10\nYou would think from whatI said earlier the story for this show would be simple. WRONG! You couldn\u2019t have a more convoluted mess of a sports anime if you tried (well maybe POT).  I watched 25 episodes of it and I\u2019m still confused what the story is. Somehow I think I grasp the gist of it. Our main character wants to prove to the generation of miracles that they were wrong for winning by\u2026you guessed it , winning. This makes about as much sense as someone saying drugs are bad then injects morphine into their selves while someone rams meth crystals up their anus.  Along the way our charismatic main character squares off against many of his old friends and former teammates.  At this point many of you who are still reading this review are probably wondering, \u201cbut hey what\u2019s the deal Daimyo? Why is this animu so popular?\u201d Well that\u2019s easy to answer guys. While what I described earlier makes for a pretty generic anime, it\u2019s unrealistic as silicon breast implants. Each character of the generation of miracles and even our shitty little kuroko has moves or preforms plays that make the NBA, at best, seem like a league of amateur players with shaky night cameras. There are characters who can shoot consecutive three pointers from their own goal territory, can instantly copy any move, and one who can shoot a ball at will from behind the back board.  This is a generation of bullshit. What makes it worse is the dialogue that sounds like a yaoi soap opera.  Here\u2019s an excerpt of the show\u2019s dialogue from episode 5 to illustrate my point. Kise:\u201cFirst you turned me down then we lost today\u2019s game, everything is going wrong in my life now\u201c Kuroko: \u201cI felt we lacked something\u2026I still I don\u2019t what\u2019s wrong with it\u2026all I know is that I hated basketball at this time\u2026that\u2019s why I was so impressed with kagami\u201d Kise: \u201cSomeday you and Kagami will part ways\u201d It got to the point I thought Kagami and Kuroko were lovers the way they kept talking about one another. The show is so BL oriented that in episode 12 during the half time of the serein vs. (insert team name here) game Midorima takes time to file his nails. Seriously who the hell does that during a sports match, let alone a basketball game. I almost half expected for Aomine during his matchup against seirin to explain his reason for being late as the result of him getting a pedicure. \\n\\n\\n\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\nThat being said, there are only like 4 or 5 characters you should even consider caring about throughout the course of this series. First off is our main character, Kuroko. He\u2019s the type of guy who just oozes charisma, the type of guy who can get a girl\u2019s panties wet just by staring at her, and ugh you know he\u2019s really badass.  Sorry I lied, he\u2019s a no good pussyface, pale, soft spoken, jacks off in a dark room dipshit.  They said he was the generation of miracles\u2019 sixth man, but they lied, this little pussy is no man. He was their shota. He apparently has this ability called \u201cwho gives a fuck\u201d. It involves no one giving two shits about him only to have suddenly appear before them much to their chagrin. He doesn\u2019t speak much, but when he does talk it\u2019s usually to proclaim his love for his boyfriend Kagami or to up the dramatic ante.  He\u2019s the uke in this relationship as you\u2019ll see even he agrees he needs a strong man to draw the best out of him. The next one up is Sakuragi Hanachimi\u2026.err I mean Kagami. This red haired all personality punk is the true one the story mostly revolves around. Returning from the U.S. he finds himself bored with the Japanese level of basketball until he meets Kuroko where he soon finds out that American players are chumps and Japanese people are the ultimate basketball players.  His dominant never say die attitude make him the uke. Now I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cgee Daimyo you must be some sort of yaoi connoisseur\u201d Who the hell do you think I am? I\u2019m Daimyo and this isn\u2019t mangafox motherfucker there are no connoisseurs here! I just happen to be very skilled at using urban dictionary and receiving texts from yaoi fans who proliferate the internet like the aids virus spreading their terminology and yaoi-ism to a network node near you.  Next we have Kise. His ability is being able to copy other people\u2019s moves and modeling and some other bishounen type shit. This next character really makes you question the sanity of the person who made this. Midorimasu, his ability is to be able to score three pointers easily from anywhere on the court. At the half court line? No problem. From his basket? No problem.  In the stands while boning your mother? Piece of cake. Who needs Reggie Miller or Ray Allen on your team when you have this guy. Lastly we have Ao fucking mine. I had to add, \u201cfucking\u201d to his name cause that\u2019s what he does. He fucks up the logic of this insane show even more. You ever thought a move was too physically impossible or difficult to preform in a game? Don\u2019t worry, Aomine does atleast 20 such moves every fucking game. This guy can break past 5 defenders in 10 seconds, has a 1 second instant score shot release, can preform a fullcourt sprint and block then switch up and dunk on a fastbreak, and when he pulls up on a shot his back is almost completely parallel to the ground, he then manages to scores and always lands on his feet. This guy wasn\u2019t born out of a vagina, he came out of a basketball net. It got to the point where I was like, \u201cwell damn what\u2019s next? Is he going to shoot lasers out of his ballsack?\u201d Also he was Kuroko\u2019s previous boyfriend as he received most of his assists. He has this childhood pink haired bitch friend that used to like Kuroko, but Kuroko must have given him an assist (though I bet they double teamed her) as it appears Aomine is the one tapping that proverbial (word switching yay!) ass. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\nIt\u2019s fairly entertaining. Not much more needs to be said but more will be said. As far as entertainment goes it is a lot more entertaining than a Daimyo review (which doesn\u2019t say much). \\n\\n\nOverall and Conclusion 7/10\\n\\n\nI think what prevents this show being better for me are all the weak aforementioned elements: the corny writing, the unbelievable events and the incredibly dull main character. The matches themselves while entertaining became boring after awhile because seirin would always win in some grandiose over the top way such as scoring a buzzer beating game winner (which even Lebron James himself has only down a handful of times).  Maybe I am being too nitpicky as I assume the majority of people who enjoy this show don\u2019t even watch real basketball.  Alright, but what about that other basketball series, you know the best selling sports manga of all time and one of the best selling series of all time: Slam Dunk. How does Kuroko stack up to it? It doesn\u2019t. Mostly because Slam dunk ended many years ago, and Kuroko no Basuke is still ongoing. It\u2019s too soon to tell how well Kuroko no Basuke will fare over the years. There are strong indications of growth as apparently this series was among the top selling manga of 2013, and the fact that a sequel currently ongoing anime was produced shows signs of strength. That being said, the overall impact and attachment to characters that Slam Dunk produced trumps most of what Kuroko no Basuke has to offer. Slam Dunk told a raw, cut no corners, realistic take on basketball.  \\n\\n\nTo summarize my too many words review, Kuroko no Basuke is a BL version of Slam Dunk with a few more prominent bitches.",

            "content": "The most common criticism I've seen so far of Kuroko no Basket has been how unrealistic it is. I myself am an avid basketball fan who plays regularly and watches NBA games. I can understand the criticism as this anime has a lot of spectacular dunks, blocks and flashy passes, the stuff you usually only see in highlight reels, but occurs regularly throughout the games in here. There's also the shounen elements with the special powers of Generation of Miracles members and other things such as the \"martial arts\" Seiho employs. \r\nThat being said, I am completely ok with this. Why? Because it makes itinteresting. Think about it. As a basketball fan, it'd be great to see the teams run plays like the triangle or pick and roll, but you can't expect the average viewer to understand what's going on. Plus, trying to explain this and other technical terms would eat up screen time and bore a lot of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThis is first and foremost entertainment. Kuroko no Basket is great to watch BECAUSE of these elements. Watching Kagami slam the ball down or Kuruko go ninja and make a flashy pass is far more exciting than watching a player hit an open jumpshot from good ball movement. It's the same reason why many people label the Spurs in the NBA as \"boring\" despite their well-oiled offense. If you really wanted realistic basketball, you'd watch an actual game. What Kuroko no Basket excels at doing is showing how exciting basketball can be to a mainstream audience. I have yet to be disappointed by any of the episodes, as they have all left me with a big, goofy grin on my face from the thrilling games or cliffhangers at the end of each episode. Look around and you'll see that many viewers are not basketball fans, but love this anime. This is great because it's garnering interest in basketball in people that would have never noticed the sport were it not for this anime. This is especially true in Japan, where basketball is nowhere near as popular as sports such as baseball or football(soccer).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the anime itself, it captures your attention with epic scenes, likeable characters, and funny comedy. Kuroko's sudden appearances that startle every character out there is a running gag, opponents with names like \"Papa\" and Kagami's Engrish \"THIS IS JAPANESE LUNCH TIME RUSH!\" keeps things interesting. The story is your classic sports anime, with the Seiren basketball team aiming for the top. However, if you were expecting some athletic, hot-headed knucklehead who excels in the sport...well, that's the deuteragonist Kagami. Kuroko is the protagonist here, and he's an unconventional lead for a sports anime. He's terrible at almost every aspect of basketball except passing and stealing. Together, he and Kagami form a exciting duo to watch reminiscent of real-world duos such as Stockton and Malone. The other characters aren't explored too much and I was afraid the other Seiren members would just become useless bodies, but slowly we've been introduced to their own unique skills. The only other characters that the anime really delves into are the members of the Generation of Miracles, who are all distinguished by their special powers and...colorful hair, Kuroko included. Here is where the shounen aspect of the show is most visible, with the members displaying everything from behind the backboard shots to full court shooting range (though I have to admit that's really pushing it). They are the equivalent of the boss characters you see in other shounen anime, as Kuroko, Kagami, and the Seiren team must find a way to overcome them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are pretty good, however, animation isn't as consistently fluid as I would've liked. The movement of players shooting or passing the ball feels too rigid or unnatural at times, as if they didn't draw enough frames (with the exception of Aomine's ridiculous handle). It compensates for this by having a lot of slow motion and close up shots of dunks, blocks, and steals which really help excite the viewer and make this anime so thrilling. It is definitely one of the better looking sports anime out there, which is part of what makes it so appealing to a wider audience. For the most part, the music consists of guitar-heavy tracks that come in whenever something notable happens, such as opponents being surprised by one of Kuroko's passes. The opening and ending feature rock songs that keep the same adrenaline pumping feel the anime has. The one thing that really bugs me though is how each episode starts off with a narrator introducing the Generation of Miracles story. It's understandable in the first few episodes, but past that there's no point in it, since viewers would already be familiar with the backstory (Edit: They finally stopped this nearly HALFWAY through the season).\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Kuroko no Basket is an entertaining anime to watch, even if you don't like basketball. The thrilling games will capture your interest and many can relate to the story of going for the top and exceeding expectations, as the underdog Seiren team does time and again. Don't go into Kuroko no Basket expecting expertly executed plays like in real basketball. Don't go into it thinking you'll see a mirror image of a real game in anime form. Go into it expecting a thrilling game of dunks, blocks, and crazy passes, a lot of O.O faces from the characters, and competitive trash talking. Watch it for the determined characters, comedy, and overcoming special powers we've come to love in shounen anime. It doesn't portray basketball too realistically, but realism in this case would only drag a fun anime like this down.",

Kickers, but Captain Tsubasawould always have a special place in my heart.\\n\\n\r\nTo all the sports anime fans that grew up with this style of Shounen, the anime with the potential to dethrone the generally accepted king is finally here. The story is just what you expect from a sports anime, it's unrealistic? It's an anime. How many anime about sports are realistic? hell, other than slice of life how many anime about anything are realistic? and is that really what you are looking for when you're watching anime? realism? the answer is obviously no.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, whoever wrote the anime and drawn the moves definitely knows his basketball since some of the plays are copy/paste from some of the greatest dunks, three-pointers or behind the hoop shots in real life, they know their technical therms, they know how basket works, and they made a damn good anime about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe generation of miracles is exactly what they said it is, miracles, players that usually are born in the united states, once every other decade, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James... except these were born in Japan, all at the same time, and now, they're all rivals. You will love them all.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is not some overpowered monster that destroys everyone, no, he's very simple, you barely notice him, but you know he creates the biggest hype, and you can barely wait to see what he will be capable of in the future, but he faces hardships, real hardships, he's the underdog you like to root for. Right at the beginning of season 2, his potential will scare you.\\n\\n\r\nHis rivals are not only his rivals, they're his friends, you will get to know them, their traits, you will appreciate the anime as much for its school and story characteristics as much as you will do for the sports component. The character development is ridiculously good, and you will get acquainted with all players from the top teams in about 25 episodes, games last 2 or 3 episodes, which is just the right amount of time, it's packed with action, it's packed with story, it has just the right amount of each!\\n\\n\r\nIt keeps topping itself, over, and over, and over, and you get more and more excited, and not only for basketball or sports fans! No! You can like fighting anime such as Fairy Tail, Zetsuen no Tempest, Bleach, Naruto, and you won't be let down by the action of Kuroko no Basket, I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nNo one would ever thought an anime about basketball could be so interesting, so filled with adrenaline and action packed, no one would ever think it could have such an amazing story, but Kuroko no Basket will prove you wrong, your heart will race, you will laugh, you will get excited, you will root for your favorite characters, and you will watch another, and another, and another, until you inevitably surrender to the awesomeness of Kuroko no Basket.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sports anime, it gets a 10. As an overall anime, it still gets a 10 because it is that awesome!",

            "content": "Before I review this anime, I have to say that I am old school. When you talk about sports and anime, I am from the Slamdunk! generation. I also watch NBA.\r\nFirst episode did a decent job of introducing the main characters. The joke about Kuroko being unnoticed by everyone was funny up until the point that it was actually considered his main weapon on the court. I have to say that the first episode ended badly with this weird unrealistic confrontation between Kuroko and Kagami. Also...I have never seen a basketball player in anime or real life as feminine as Kuroko.\r\nI did keep watching inhopes that this can be anything similar to Slamdunk!\\n\r\nI have to say it was very...very disappointing. Unlike good sports anime, Kuroko no Basket had very little details about the sport itself. Granted the pictures look great, but basketball action was again disappointing. When watching them play, you don't get the real feel of the game, because they do not show much dribbling, defense, and passing. They never showcase realistic basketball skills. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat you know this anime is very shounen. You may be invisible to people because that's your personality. Problem is they actually used that as his weapon on court. cmon bro..realistically, how can you \"disappear\" during a game. and its not just the players in the game that think he dissapears--its EVERYONE.\\n\\n\r\nKuroko's passing is also very fake. You CANNOT touch pass every single possession. Especially when Kuroko is considered \"weak.\" You got to have strong wrists and arms to do one handed passes, touch passes and back hand passes. Especially if you're doing it all game long. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Basically, do not watch this anime if you're expecting anything on the level of Slamdunk. If you like realistic sport animes: Slamdunk!,ookiku furikabutte,  Hajime no Ippo, Major, Giant Killing, and even Chihayafuru.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: After watching episode 12...HOLY ROFLCOPTER this is as bad as Prince of Tennis. If you like animes like Prince of Tennis where the sport itself is being mocked and trampled all over, then this is perfect for you. \\n\\n\r\n**Spoiler alert** I'm sorry but what??? Shooting from full court? and never misses. LOL BRO. whats next, dunking from the 3 point line? pass that goes around the world and lands perfectly in teamates hand?",

            "content": "EDITED AFTER IT FINISHED AIRING (9/22)!\r\nI've never written a review before, but this show is so good, I just had to voice my opinion. I am not a sports anime fan to begin with (well, more like I've never watched one before) but that didn't stand in the way of me loving this show. I started watching this show because everyone was talking about it. I couldn't understand why alot of my friends who are into dark and supernatural (or along the lines of) animes were watching something as random as a sport one. Overall, I found this show to be very funny and enjoyable.I seriously can't get enough. This show is definitely not overrated in my book.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not going to bother summarizing because you can read that yourself everywhere else, but as a huge fan of the manga, it stuck pretty close. There are some minor differences and they cut out some scenes to make it go quicker, but the plot is still there. The story is exciting and even before I read the manga (I started after I watched a few episodes while it was airing), I literally craved the next episode. It is so exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. The biggest thing in this show is probably the value of teamwork, sportsmanship and the cliche, \"whatever you put your heart into and try hard, you will accomplish.\" Thats what I got out of the first few episodes, and being a sports anime, you would think everything in the plot is obvious, but it's not. There's a couple of parts that will surprise you! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's not the most beautifully animated show I've ever watched. I'm not too sure how to explain it, but it's just awkwardly drawn sometimes and it just looks strange. But it's not hideous either. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nBoth openings and both endings are so nice. I even have it on my ipod! But the music during the scenes that are added for effect are kinda cheesy to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAt the beginning, it seemed like there was not much room for character development in Kuroko, since he is one of the ~*~Generation of Miracles~*~. But that's wrong. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9/10\\n\r\nI personally didn't like was that the anime felt so fanservice-y, it was really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the events in kuroko no basket during matches are extremely unrealistic. Like not noticing a player during a match or passes all the way across a court? I think that's what people who dislike this show say the most. But to me, fiction is fiction. They're supposed to be prodigies anyways, so what better way to illustrate that than by adding a little of the impossible. Just like when I watch spongebob, I find it very stupid that a starfish has a face on it's leg. But does it matter? It's still funny and doesn't change the fact that it's a great show.",

Making you want to watch on to find out how good they are.....\r\nThe things that makes me want to watch on and recommend to all you people is the ups and downs of emotions that you get.

            "content": "\u201cThere's no such thing as useless effort.\u201d\r\nKagami Taiga (Kuroko no Basket)\r\nSo, as I have nothing to waste, I will bring to you a review of the immensely praised show that is Kuroko no Basket. Even though it is not a very popular show (not even in the top 100), most people that have watched it are immensely positive about it, and it made me wonder why. After being encouraged to watch the show several times, I figured it was the time to do so \u2013 and I can say it delivered. I soon became one of the people \u201cenchanted\u201d by the show.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nOnce upon atime, there was a basketball team that demolished each and every competition they came across: the all-star team of Teiko Junior High. The team consisted of 5 basketball players with each an astonishing amount of talent, and their own unique speciality: the Generation of Miracles After junior high school ended, the team naturally broke up \u2013 the prodigies all joined different high schools with great basketball teams. However, fairly unknown is that there was actually a 6th player which played in the all-star team of Teiko Junior High: Kuroko Tetsuya. This so called \u201cphantom\u201d player joined a new school, with an unknown basketball team, unlike the other prodigies. At this school, Seirin High, Kuroko meets Kagami Taiga, a natural basketball talent who has just returned from America (where he had lived for some years). Together, they are aiming to beat the generation of miracles, and become the strongest in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s just a very solid storyline, which is able to keep the viewer interested over the course of episodes, but it\u2019s not stunning either. It isn\u2019t a very complex storyline which leaves the viewer thinking, but rather a very simple storyline which is enjoyable to watch. The show does not have much filler, yet is not too serious either \u2013 this was a huge plus to me. It was a very refreshing watch; a show I could really enjoy without putting too much thought into it. The pace is very good, as I found myself blowing through episodes one after another. However, I was a little disappointed at the predictability of some (or maybe most) of the matches, and the story as a whole. But that does not take away the fact that the story is very enjoyable. Most people that dislike KnB do so because of its unrealism \u2013 but I don\u2019t agree on that. It\u2019s the unique abilities and unrealistic shots that keep the viewer thrilled. I think the majority of the people would not like watching very plain basketball games as seen in real life. In short, Kuroko no Basket features a simple, yet very enjoyable story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing astonishing here, nothing bad either. It is not a visual masterpiece, but some episodes really had a nice atmosphere to them due to the excellent animation in them. The drawing style is nothing to complain about either. Overall, I\u2019d say that given the budget, they did a great job on the art: it is more than decent.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nSound is one of the aspects in which KnB really shines. The openings and endings are very good (and fitting), but even more impressive is the soundtrack during the episodes. They really manage to enhance the atmosphere of the matches and make episodes more thrilling than they already are. The sound acting is very well done as well \u2013 the sound as a whole is just excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAs for the characters, logically, the biggest focus is on Kuroko and Kagami. They are thoroughly described, and made to be very likeable: they both have characterising traits which perfectly fit their basketball abilities. The 5 \u201cProdigies\u201d are very well done too \u2013 as far as the ones we get to know in season 1. Furthermore, we get to know a variety of characters in the high school basketball scene. While they weren\u2019t all given the necessary description (for example, I think the other players in Seirin could have gotten more of a backstory), they were still decent enough to fulfil their roles.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI honestly enjoyed Kuroko no Basket as much as I was told I would. While the show definitely has some flaws and is not nearly as enthralling or well thought out as others (I\u2019m looking at you, Fate/Zero, Steins;Gate), it still turned out to be a great source of enjoyment. The matches actually did manage to keep me on the edge of my seat, and managed to get me to play basketball myself! It made me want to try those fascinating shots in real life, and got me to look up more about basketball as well. In short, if you are looking for a refreshing (perhaps simple) anime, or just really like sports shows, then you should certainly give this show a watch \u2013 because that\u2019s what Kuroko no Basket has to offer.\\n",

            "content": "Short Overall: Thoroughly enjoying, dynamic and engaging, and possesses characters that you will undoubtedly grow to love. Fantastic soundtrack to accompany somewhat seamless scenes, along with great visuals. Although it doesn't have a complicated plot with unexpected twists, Kuroko no Basket gives so much more than just your average sports series. \r\nPreviously, Kuroko no Basket had appeared in numerous threads and places whenever i was searching for something new to delve into. As a non-sports fan myself, i wasn't interested in this series until i read the reviews for it. Many of the people's comments stated that although they didn't like sports themselves, they foundthemselves enjoying the series thoroughly. So, why not try it out?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Over the 25 episodes, you're introduced to a wide array of characters that each possesses their own unique quality. They were all very likable, even if a few seemed difficult. The majority of them were given back stories that informed the viewer of their past, which was good for character development. Perhaps i would have liked to see a more thorough explanation of a few of the character's background.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One of the things i liked best about this series was the soundtrack. They were inputted perfectly and in the right scenes to give that bit an extra \"oomph\". Alongside this, there was a nice variety of different compositions to emphasize the atmosphere of the scene at the time. I especially loved the song near the end of the series, at the end of the last basketball match.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The visuals were nothing special, nothing of say, a Shinkai masterpiece, but it was nevertheless pleasing to the eye. During some episodes the quality did fall slightly, but my best guess was that it was due to budget. Some of the  animation in the scenes were brilliant, and made the movement of the characters seem much more fluent. \\n\\n\r\nStory: As i said previously, this show does not contain many serious twists and plot changes that will have the viewer sitting on the edges of their seats. That being said, i fully believe that it doesn't need twists to be a brilliant series. The enjoyment i got from this series was not because the storyline was complex, but because it was easy to follow and easy to enjoy. Everything was explained smoothly, and very few plot holes were left. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was surprised - incredibly surprised- at how much i ended up loving this series. It was hilarious, exciting and really fun to watch and to engage yourself into. I ended up loving the characters and sympathizing with each of them.  Kuroko no Basket is an engaging anime, and is one of the few i genuinely re-watch. It goes on my top 5.",

            "content": "\"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.\"\r\nAs a retired participant familiar with competitive high school basketball, I must admit Kuroko no Basket reminded me of the exact reasons why I fell in love with the sport. Adrenaline, leadership, endurance, and most of all, team work. In a world with so many instructed paths to follow, should one rely on team work, or their own skills in a sport like basketball? Surely, Kuroko no Basket tackles this question with considerable reflexes, not with constant waves of seriousness but with tremendously well organized comedy and series of basketball tournaments, which comprises of flashy to not-so-flashyshots. But, those of you experienced with the sport or have actively followed daily lives of NBA athletes know that made-shots can never be considered flashy, or absurd. Since, what essentially makes basketball such an exciting sport is scoring a hoop which one would've never expected to otherwise, without a whim of luck or practice. \\n\\n\r\nBesides whim and practice, though, there's also something many labels as \"talent\", but can anybody even consider being skinny-boned, inconspicuous an advantage? Well, many could beg to differ, Kuroko included. \\n\\n\r\n5'6 and 125 pounds, Kuroko is nothing short of an elementary school kid who lost his way on a school field trip compared to an average athlete. Although unable to achieve a standard masculinity, Kuroko obtains extraordinary skills of creating illusions and making expeditious passes to his teammates. He's an interesting character, and his unseen ability attracts five other mysterious individuals. The Generation of Miracles is a label given to these five apparent prodigies of basketball, and during their middle school careers they were enrolled into the same team as Kuroko. Due to disagreements on how one should proceed with basketball, however, Kuroko leaves his five reliable friends, and begins seeking for his own style of playing at Seirin High School.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, Kuroko immediately stumbles upon a hot-headed, ambitious American basketball player named Taiga, and their adventures of crushing the Generation of Miracles start there. What defines Kuroko no Basket as an exciting anime then is how they proceed to demonstrate how eccentrically one could play out basketball--not as simply a sport, but a fiery passion. Due to the focus on this element, the director purposely emphasized the amazingness of dunks, and how even difficultly-leveled (fade-away, etc.) shots were easily prosecuted. Of course, it does then leave out very uncoordinated, clogged dialogue in the middle of games and though trash talking between teams is common, I think they did drag out some of the excessive dialogue. But, even those flaws just as effortlessly get rampaged over by aggressive characters like Taiga. \\n\\n\r\nOftentimes bluntly assertive, Taiga is Kuroko's teammate, but also much more than a teammate. He oafishly overcomes major issues without much thought, but is at the same time someone who accompanies Kuroko in the worst of times. Although bearing only one simple ambition, Taiga embodies a colorful amount of energetic traits you'd want in anyone, which greatly constitutes the overall spontaneity in the team. And his egotistic self committing outrageous acts is just a genuinely hilarious element of Kuroko no Basket. Even among the side characters are several mentionable members with similarly strong aspiration, and where one can find the diverse ranks of this series. The Generation of Miracles especially, begin as merely two-dimensional enemies that Kuroko needed to face, but eventually progress into characters with intriguing insights of handling one's adeptness in any sports. \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to animation, the character designs are well-done. Animated action sequences were all smoothly and feasibly produced. Some camera angles really capture the correct atmosphere for the tense phases in games, while sometimes the focuses on long distance shots were mostly kind of awkward. Nonetheless, the major frameworks followed coherent transitions for the characters to move freely on the court. Although some of the jumps and passes (alley-oops, etc.) in Kuroke no Basket are \"ridiculous\" even if made by professionals, it fit all so well with the over-the-top nature of the show that Kuroko no Basket wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable without them. The so-called impossibly-made hoops don't actually distract from the story and thus are vigorously exaggerated slams more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks all viably made the series more interesting as it progressed - with change of pacing of some notably well-done melodies of hard rock, alternative, to relaxing, chill music. The OP appropriately fit the momentum some episodes started with, though a repetitive introduction of the generation of miracles does drag on for more than half of the series, which they did finally decide to rid of with a renewal of an alternative, better OP. Likewise, the OST is appropriately integrated within the series.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the bizarreness and absurdity are often what makes Kuroko no Basket stand out even among its shounen precedents like Slam Dunk and TTGL. Every character who speaks a line obtains a certain role in the story, never disappear off the screen without substantial explanation, and makes every shoot, block, or pass worthy of paying attention to. The story never nags the audience with unnecessary material, and it doesn't rely on a supernatural setting to make its exciting action scenes work. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all, Kuroko no Basket is really a nonchalant character when it comes to presenting wicked ways of playing basketball in real life, yet it speaks through its friendly characters the sweat and tears which someone would invest into the sport. Surely, Kuroko no Basket provides exhilarating visuals; but even more, it promotes the importance of sportsmanship, and is truly inspirational. I highly recommend this series to basketball enthusiasts and those looking for a spirited shounen anime at its best.",

But first an explanation of the story. \r\nThe anime starts off by explaining that a team of 6 players were the legendary super saiyans that had the ability to slap their \"special\" (special is the keyword here folks) golden cocks in the faces of their opponents. Now let me translate, a middle school team dominated their league and theirplayers were given the name the generation of miracles. Each player in the generation of miracles has their own special ability.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot focuses on the relationship between the two main characters, their relationship with their teammates and mostly how the team will win tournaments.\\n\r\nKuroko's plan is the help Kagami achieve his goal by becoming his \"shadow\" whilst Kagami is his \"light\". Obviously Kagami's goal is to be the strongest player in japan. \\n\\n\r\nSo a fairly normal plot for a sports anime, but I mean c'mon, aside from being the strongest player or the best team or winning a tournament, what else can a sports anime do? Do you want them to turn evil and fuck everything up?\\n\\n\r\nNow, what it did right, ahem:\\n\\n\r\n1. Relationship between main two characters.\\n\r\nNow the main highlight of this anime is the relationship between Kuroko and Kagami shared as partners, almost like brothers. Majority of the time the matches would be decided because of the actions of their teamwork. They are the underdogs, you'd naturally root for those two to win the game. The concept of Kuroko being Kagami's shadow and Kagami being Kuroko's light was a fairly nice one and it was good that it was further explored later on in the show. Individually Kuroko is the most interesting of the pair, physically he is weak but he is mentally strong. He brings the best out of Kagami whilst also helping to drive the team forward, he feels more like a teamplayer whilst Kagami feels a bit like a lone wolf. \\n\r\nThat's not to say Kagami isn't interesting as well, he may be a hot head but if it wasn't for him the show would lack a lot of it's \"woah\" moments.\\n\\n\r\n2. Relationship between Seirin team overall.\\n\r\nAgain, another thing this show did right as a sports anime was how they presented the main team to you, a group of likable characters with their own skills that contribute to the whole team. \\n\r\nTeamwork was the key here and even though it felt cliched at points in the anime, honestly, it's rather undeniably logical that teamwork is vital, even if it's constantly mentioned.\\n\r\nSeirin are the underdogs of this show, you'd think \"oh those guys are way stronger than Seirin, they'd never lose to them\", but secretly you want Seirin to win, think of it like a psychological thing, you know the odds of Seirin losing are high but it'd be pretty fucking sweet if they did win. Honestly this is the kind of thing I like about sports anime, they'll present you with odds which aren't in favour of the underdog team, yet they'll still pull through and win. The anxiety and suspense it builds up can really give you the feeling that you're part of that winning moment. Unless your name is Aomine and can just fuck up all the odds like a dick. \\n\\n\r\n3. Sound and animation\\n\r\nGenerally speaking this doesn't really contribute much to an overall score really, animation and sound aren't important as characters and the story. In terms of enjoyment it plays a role. But it did have pretty nice OP's and ED's. Good to see GRANRODEO back. \\n\r\nOST was good as well, not amazing though, considering they'd just play the same few good songs over and over. But it did play a major factor in the deciding moments of the game, you felt engrossed in the moment, it made it just a bit more enjoyable.\\n\r\nAnimation was good, nothing special, there were noticeable drops in quality here and there but still, it did it's job. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about what it fucked up in:\\n\\n\r\n1. Repetitive matches.\\n\r\nThis is where the show starts to stumble, most of the time matches will consist of back and forth power ups. At one point one team will be leading, then Kagami gets annoyed and starts dunking like there's no tomorrow. Then the other team will power up to get the ball around Kagami and score more points. Seirin will start working together, again powering up, to get back into the game. Now you're probably thinking \"well duh, they mention in the show that the flow of the game can easily be lost by the other team gaining momentum, the matches would be boring if it was just one team dominating, it has to be a bit back and forth\". That doesn't excuse the fact that it's fucking repetitive and when something becomes repetitive it becomes boring. The only reason people aren't get bored is because the power ups get more shiny. \\n\\n\r\n2. Poor power balance\\n\r\nThis is where the show starts to become retarded, the generation of miracles are extremely overpowered. Midorima, a member of the generation of miracles  has 100% accuracy on his shots so you are literally fucked, this guy literally fucks you over sideways. That's not a special ability, it's too off scale, honestly if it wasn't for Kagami in the team Seirin would just lose all their matches against the generation of miracles and there lies the problem. Aside from Kagami, no one else can stand up to the generation of miracles, Kuroko can only pass so he can't do much else. The other members of the Seirin team are nowhere near as good as the generation of miracles so if it was just their entire team vs Midorima, he'd still just win on his own. \\n\\n\r\n3. Retarded power ups and overpowered characters\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before the overpowered characters really fuck up the power balance but they ultimately make the matches less enjoyable. Characters become so overpowered that it's ridiculous, the shit they pull off is retarded. Aomine is the biggest fucker in the entire show, he is so overpowered that he can take on an entire team and not get tired, he'd rip them to shreds, why? Because he's Aomine that's why. You literally do not stand a chance against him. He just keeps on pulling shit from his ass and destroys the opposing teams. The same applies for Midorima with his 100% accuracy anywhere on the court, he could score 3 pointers all the time. \\n\r\nI understand that if this show was realistic it would be boring, but that doesn't mean it can be fucking retarded as well, there isn't a balance, the abilities the generation of miracles posses is just too unfair and ultimately hinders the enjoyment of the matches.\\n\\n\r\nIndividual Scores:\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 5/10]\\n\r\n[Characters: 6/10]\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10]\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10] \\n\r\nOverall: 6/10",

            "content": "Like any other shounen  Kuroko No Basuke tends to be very slow and with little character development .. It often relies on comedy like un-going gags or catchphrases ..\r\n.. Even so usually the best part of shounen is the intensity and emotionally gripping moments it brings.. In my opinion Kuroko no basuke was 50% of the time far from tense and it seemed really forced and unappealing.. The characters are cardboard cuttouts that even with actual motivations honestly it isnt enough to make a certain character good..\r\nThe characters are predictable and with a one-dimensional personality.\r\nThe premise is quite original however they dont make reallygood use of it due to the stereotypical nature and the predictableness behind it.. \\n\\n\r\nFirst its about Kuroko helping kagami to become a good player at the level of the \"kiseki no sedai\" and then theres character arcs for Kise, Midorima and Aomine.. wich, SURPRISE,  its the genki airhead guy, the intelectuall prick and the \"THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BEAT MYSELF IS ME\" guy wich by that you\u00b4re already imagining that he is a total dick.. \\n\\n\r\nThe show often relies on its good animation, like a big old fat man riding his ferrari around the town and still getting some.. If theres one way i can describe KnB is \"good to look at\" because other than that there isnt much else i can say about it.. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is actually good it helped me to get trough the series has it kind of gave me hope..\\n\\n\r\n Despite being a introductory season Knb 1 was still quite Mediocre .. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is actually appealing to say the least atleast it managed to pull of some giggles but if KnB wants to surprise me or change my Opinion the 2nd season needs to be way better and I am going to start watching whenever i can..\\n\\n\r\nI give Knb a medium-prority and if you arent into sports then you probably wont like this, but try it anyway its not like my opinion is the ultimate best you\u00b4ll find.",

Having had read the manga beforehand, im aware of how each of the five are portrayed and I cant fault the series to how they have developed and portrayed them so far.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it does bring into question how a kids around the age of first year high schoolers can be over 6ft tall but that is the beauty of 2D world, anything can happen. \\n\r\nIf you are one of those who are pedantic about these petty details and decided to make a pass on the series then youre definitely missing out.\\n\\n\r\nEvery week, you just cant wait to see the next episode to be aired just to get more exhilarating action. \\n\r\nIn my opinion, this IS one of the best series to be released and i hope it gets more episodes as it is just pure enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSummarise why this series needs to be watched:\\n\r\n- Great animation quality\\n\r\n- Great art style\\n\r\n- Great characters\\n\r\n- Great soundtrack\\n\r\n- Great voices\\n\r\n- Great story\\n\r\n- Great enjoyment\\n\r\nYou cant miss out on something with that many greats in :)",

            "content": "Note: this is my first review on this site but I'm pretty confident that this will be helpful.\r\nYou don't have to know how to play Basketball if you want to enjoy this show or watch the NBA- though you should try just to see what it's like in real life but Kuroko no Basuket, also known as Kuroko's Basketball is an anime that will keep you glued to your seat from the first episode. Now, I have to say that I wasn't a very big fan of sports anime, in fact I disliked the whole lot of it, or I just didn't really have anyinterest in them. I have watched (The prince of tennis) before and it was average to me. I've heard of (Slam Dunk) and other sports anime that were famous but they sounded boring to me(not anymore). Kuroko to Basuket was the first sports anime that I gave myself a chance to watch, and I'm VERY glad that I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe Teiko middle school basketball club. An incredibly strong team with over 100 members and 3 consecutive championship wins. Amongst their brilliant record, the generation of 5 prodigies was known as \"The Generation Of Miracles.\" However, there was a strange rumor concerning the Generation Of Miracles. Despite being relatively unknown and lacking a game record, there was one more member recognized by the 5 prodigies. A phantom sixth man... (You'll recognize this soon) The story of Kuroko and Kagami and of course their team (Seirin) struggle and getting stronger and aiming for the top throughout the series is just absolutely amazing, because there is more than that of course. And with a great mix of comedy at times like the old classic joke when Kuroko suddenly appears and disappear and Kagami's English speaking skills. Now, I won't spoil anything so you can watch the series for yourself, but If you don't like the first few episodes, then you'll probably drop the series sooner or later. The development of the story is normal paste and they adapted the manga very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n With Production IG doing the animation, expect it to be nice and fluid (Have you seen Guilty Crown?), but not always. They can't just go changing the art style that the original creator of the manga (Fujimaki, Tadatoshi) did. But don't get me wrong, this kind of art is perfect for a sports anime, as for a sports anime the characters at many times are always moving around and that is not easy to animate though it can be rigid at times. They did a very good job in my opinion. This art style really brings out the aspects of the characters. It's not the best, but I like it. Overall the animation is great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAlright, I swear that I heard dubstep tracks in many episodes, not hardcore like Skrillex of course. The other tracks are pretty good but not outstanding. The score does a good job when telling the way the game is drifting and the emotions of players. (Has anyone ever heard Guilty Crown OST?) - No, the sound track of Kuroko to basket is good and has a nice pace.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThroughout the series, you get to see the different factors of major characters, what they went through, how they get stronger, and by all means... They never give up. This is what made them who they are today, look at Serin for an example, but I don't think this applies for Aomine and maybe some of the [GOM] \\(*[]*)/ Anyway, you will find that from the beginning to the end the characters change, some little and some drastically, like Kagami.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI just love this show from the bottom of my heart. To tell you the truth, I'm not a very active person. I don't play sports or exercise much, and I know this is only an Anime, but this show inspired me to go outside and actually DO SOMETHING! - No I am not a hikikomori, and plz don'th think I'm pathetic cause I don't exercise! So... all in all you really will enjoy this show;)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis show is great and I think most people will really like it. It's not a masterpiece, but it's VERY close to it. Hope there will be a season 2, maybe there will because of the profit the company's making since this is a hit anime in Japan WOOOOOOOO! Thanks for reading my review if you did :D",

            "content": "Other reviewers have already covered the \"unrealisticness\" of Kuroko no Basket, so I'm going to get right into the anime itself; what makes it so good. And what make it so good? \r\nIts storyline and characters.\r\nThe storyline is essentially Seirin High School's basketball team trying to be the best of its kind. It contains two of the story's main characters: Kuroko Tetsuya and Kagami Taiga. What makes Kuroko no Basket's characters so interesting is how diverse they are; the story\u2019s main characters, Kuroko and Kagami, could not be more different. This of course, makes the anime interesting, as you get to see the same experiencestold with two different perspectives. Strangely enough, while Kuroko and Kagami have completely different personalities and views on the game of basketball, they share the same goal: wanting to push Seirin High School to the top. They start on rough terms; however, it is immediately noticeable that if Kuroko and Kagami are able to achieve perfect teamwork, they would form an effective offensive partnership that would be impossible to stop.\\n\\n\r\nTheir goal is not easily attainable by any means, a point that is driven home with each successive game they play. There is simply so much talent within their competition; especially so with the teams containing any of the Generation of Miracles, \u201ca generation of five players with talents that you would see once every ten years\u201d. Despite Seirin also containing one of the Generation of Miracles in Kuroko, he is seen as somewhat of an underdog. Seirin also possesses Kagami; however, he is portrayed as a reckless hot-shot who still has much to learn. As a result, Seirin is characterized as an underdog school. However, that characterization only serves to make the story more enjoyable, as it creates situations where Seirin emerges as the dark horse within the competition. \\n\\n\r\nWatching an underdog improve, learn from its mistakes, and surpass its superiors is extremely rewarding. Why would anyone want to watch a set of unquestionably superior individuals squashing their competition, with little to no challenge? And that is the crux of Kuroko no Basket\u2019s greatness. It is a story about a group of underdogs who are on the rise to stardom, wanting to be the best; a story of trials and tribulations, success and failure. Watching Seirin's group of guys trying to achieve their ultimate goal only leads to a feeling of satisfaction; if you don't like Kuroko no Basket, you don't like anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "What makes a good basketball player? There are many attributes to consider here, but most of them amount to the same thing: athletic ability.\r\nKuroko Tetsuya lacks it. He's small, he's slim, he cannot dribble, he cannot shoot, and he has no stamina. In fact, everything about him is so incredibly unremarkable that he is practically invisible both on court and off. Thus, he considers himself \"a supporting actor, a shadow\", one whose goal it is to help another one achieve greatness, or, as he puts it, \"to make the brightness of a light stand out\".\r\nOriginally the rumored phantom sixth man of the \"Generation of Miracles\",a middle school team who used to demolish the competition, he is tired of his previous teammates' way of playing. With the only recently formed Seirin High School Basketball club and his newly chosen \"light\" Kagami Taiga, Kuroko aims to take on the former members' of the Generation of Miracles new clubs one by one, and in doing so prove the importance of team spirit. That is \"Kuroko no Basket\" \u2013 \"Kuroko's Basketball\" \u2013 the way of playing Basketball which Kuroko firmly believes in.\\n\\n\r\nJust like Kuroko possesses the skill of misdirection, each player, coaches and managers not excluded, has a special ability. These abilities are not something a basketball player of flesh and blood would be realistically able to perform and feel like super powers from a battle sh\u014dnen. One might be fooled by the large portion of BL-themed fan art for the show, but Kuroko no Basket is a  typical show of its demographic. In addition to fast-paced action and silly comedy, interpersonal relationships are important only inasmuch as the importance of friendship and camaraderie within a sports team is shown.\\n\\n\r\nAll the more of a bummer is it that with the exception of Kuroko and Kagami, the players of Seirin High remain oddly flat and feckless during these first 25 episodes, while the Generation of Miracles whose haughtiness Kuroko has come to detest slowly turn out to be the true stars of the show. This discrepancy is even reflected by their character designs: the Seirin players, with the exception of Kuroko and Kagami, all have relatively realistic hair colors, whereas the members of the Generation of Miracles have flashy unnatural hair colors most of which resonate with their names. It often seemed to me as if the show was contradicting its intended message by making the remaining Seirin players feel like extras in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nI was rather disappointed with the humor in Kuroko no Basket. I thought it was cheap and felt forced, but in the end, humor, even more so than anything else, is a matter of personal preference, and while I was especially annoyed by Kagami's Engrish, others have deemed it the highlight of the show. The highly suspense-packed, fast-paced basketball matches on the other hand were a joy to watch, and are the reason I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for a second season.",

            "content": "After being told over and over again by a fried that i needed to watch this show i finally caved in, and gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised by the show and enjoyed watching it from start to finish. Everything about the show was done very well. As someone who as played basketball up the varsity level it was pretty funny to see all of the classic stereotypes make an appearance in the show. \r\n*if you don't want a summary of the show skip the first paragraph\r\nJust a short summary before we start, Kuroko no Basket follows the story of a High schoolbasketball team that has only been established for 2 years. At the beginning of the school year they were able to recruit two freshmen who were exceptionally talented, and figured that they would have a good shot at winning a championship that year. The only problem is this year the \"generation of miracles\", which is a team of 5 players who were believed to be unbeatable, also entered high school the same year. Each of the miracle players went on a different team and each has their own unique talent. And all of them went to a different school that the main team would have to play against in order to win a championship.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect that was done especially well was the character development. While some of the back-stories of a few of the players were left out, each of them had their own traits that made them unique. That being said despite the fact that all the characters were unique, the show decided to focus primarily on 2 players in particular. This doesn't hurt the story too bad, but it definitely leaves you wishing some of the other players would get just a little more screen time. \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing i liked about this show was the fact that team that the story followed didn't take and extreme side of the spectrum when they started off. This is sadly pretty common in any show including a team of some sort, where one of 2 things happens. Either the team is sucks and losses every game until a magical transformation near the end, or the worse of the two, when the team simply put never looses. Thankfully Kuroko no basket doesn't take one side or the other.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the show had an interesting way of pacing its self. I liked the way they presented the story, where they would give the thoughts of every character whenever the chance was presented. This was nice because it helped further aid the character development and give you a good idea of what was going through everyone's head at a given time. But this same thing that made the show good, was also something that bugged me a little bit. This was because it didn't stop even during games. This lead to the pace being slowed down drastically during what would normally be very fact paced, or instantaneous events. and then while it really wasn't a huge deal it is worth mentioning that some of the \"abilities\" that the players from the generation of miracles had were blown a bit out of proportion which while they weren't meant to be funny i did find myself getting a good chuckle from time to time even during scenes that were suppose to be serious on behalf of these near super human basket ball skills. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end Kuroko no Basket was a very good show that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys sports anime or even a good laugh once in a while.",

            "content": "Hi, this is my review for Kuroko no Basket. If you decide to vote \"Not Helpful\", please tell me why you did so on my profile as I always look to improve and please, read the review.\r\nStory: 4/5 Plot, 1/5 Development, Total 5/10\r\nKuroko, now a junior high school student starts his semester Seirin High School, a team in it's 2nd year. What the other players at Seirin soon find out is that he was a player on the legendary Teiko Middle School team, and was known as the \"phantom sixth man\". Along with Kagami Taiga, Kuroko decides to beat the \"Generation of Miracles\", Kuroko's oldteammates which are all split up among schools around the area.  Reason why, is because Kuroko thinks they no longer know what it is to play basketball as a team.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kuroko no Basket is not very exceptional, but it's also unique in a way that the main characters don't only seek to be the best, but to beat 5 specific people. As the story unfolds we have few sidesteps from the main story and most of it is predictable. However, the plot keeps you going since you always want to see Kuroko's other teammates and learn about them.\\n\\n\r\nI am a person that can continue watching shows even after they are spoiled for me, but if you really can't handle knowing most of what will happen in the next episode, you might want to skip this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/5 Art, 4/5 Animation, Total 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is detailed and thoroughly done. The animators, drawers, whatever they're called making this animation and art have really outdone themselves. I mean, I really have nothing to complain about. However, when watching I noticed that some of the animation might've been missing some frames.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/4 Voices, 2/2 OP/ED , 4/4 OST, Total 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't complain a lot about the voices except for a few unfitting ones on a few of the supporting characters, however these don't really matter and the voice actors for Kagami, Midorima and Kuroko I think are exceptional.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED of Kuroko no Basketball are definetly not lacking and work really well for introducing the episod eand ending it. Can't complain.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the OST, we have Gyakushuu, Kagami Taiga, Misdirection and ofcourse Sessen. If you haven't heard Sessen or missed it in the anime, then I beg you; seriously. Go listen to it. Right now. The OST collection this anime has is one of the best if not the best. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/5 Design, 4/5 Development, Total 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are kind of simple and clich\u00e8, but they got nice details to them and the fact that they represent a color of their own(Each have a color in their name) is really neat. Though the characters might seem clich\u00e8, I know the original mangaka put a lot of work into them. I can't see why people would dislike any of the characters for a bad design. The team is enjoyable to watch and even the simple talk is great, there's even more development further which makes me really like this show.\\n\\n\r\nOur two main characters and a description:\\n\r\nKuroko - strongwilled though silent, a bit of a smart type MC\\n\r\nKagami - probably more of a MC than Kuroko, eats a lot(clich\u00e9), musclehead\\n\\n\r\nAnd also, plot twist: The girl is the coach, not the manager!\\n\r\nThroughout the anime we have nice development arcs and we have deep insight in what the characters feel and think. The characters are never left alone once in the spotlight and the anime does a good job at the development(for a shounen anime!).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, though I maybe liked the 2nd season a bit more. There are neatly placed puns and jokes inbetween the serious matches and the anime is both full of action and full of great humour.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n8/10 for very good. It is a good anime to watch but it's not a must see though it gives sometimes a good laugh and sometimes scenes so serious you think you're playing basketball yourself. I recommend it to everyone with the random thought \"I should watch a sports anime\"(the case for me). And if you've already watched it, you should watch \"Haikyuu!\" which probably is my favourite sports-and overall anime.",

            "content": "To be honest I never expected that I would fall that much in love with this serie. I first didn\u2019t see potential in a basketball game. I couldn\u2019t imagine how they could make such a game exciting. But started since I had been recommended it so much and Hajime no Ippo was the only sports anime I had seen yet. What is about boxing so it is still as much similar to fighting as to sports. So I decided to give it a chance and you cannot believe how happy I am that I saw this serie. However the serie isn\u2019t finished yet, it hasbecome one of my top 5 anime with the potential to jump to number one. If the serie keeps evolving itself, like it is doing now.\\n\\n\r\nBut what was so good about it? well I would say everything. But lets starts with probably the best part of the serie the characters. The character development is very well done. The way every character is introduced and developed during a game. The order and the timing of how you learn the characters. The way you are starting to appreciate or even admire almost every player, even when you disagree with their way of thinking. This especially on the (ex)members of the generation of miracles. Then the characters on there own are so good and so original. Lots of them really inspired me with their thoughts. The combination of all of them gave me that much motivation that I play much better since then. I don\u2019t even play basket but hockey is a teamsport of 5 players so it is kinda the same. Especially the thoughts of the generation of miracles and of course that of serin itself motivated me. Really everything of this serie could\u2019ve been made just by the wonderful characters with wonderful spirits but it even got support on top of that. The drawings of the players when they play basketball with all their movements are really well done and detailed. It has a great Ost that fits the serie perfectly. Especially the rock guitar solos for in the game are good however the sad music is also good. The voice acting wasn\u2019t bad either but most of the voice actings are from superb level in anime. All this made it very enjoyable. I was suprisely never bored while watching it what is pretty rare in my case. The way the series just keep becoming better is just like a car that accelerates if it keep going like this with the end as absolutely climax. It will become without doubt my favorite serie ever.",

            "content": "Pros\n+Crisp Character designs\n+Clear Animation\n+Nice Soundtrack\nCons\n-Unrealistic\n-BL dialogue\n-Uninspired storyline\n-Lackluster protagonist\n-Melodramatic\nKuroko no basuke, is a popular basketball manga/anime that strives to be successful as Slam Dunk but falls flat on its non-proverbial ass (this is a big ass grotesque anime) many times along the way. Kuroko no basuke is an anime about a group of basketball players called the generation of Miracles. This legendary densetsu group won all the Japanese junior high basketball championships. In particular the anime concerns the actions of the titular character Kuroko and his transition to seirin high school, his new team and their aspirations for national championship status.\nStory 7/10\nYou would think from whatI said earlier the story for this show would be simple. WRONG! You couldn\u2019t have a more convoluted mess of a sports anime if you tried (well maybe POT).  I watched 25 episodes of it and I\u2019m still confused what the story is. Somehow I think I grasp the gist of it. Our main character wants to prove to the generation of miracles that they were wrong for winning by\u2026you guessed it , winning. This makes about as much sense as someone saying drugs are bad then injects morphine into their selves while someone rams meth crystals up their anus.  Along the way our charismatic main character squares off against many of his old friends and former teammates.  At this point many of you who are still reading this review are probably wondering, \u201cbut hey what\u2019s the deal Daimyo? Why is this animu so popular?\u201d Well that\u2019s easy to answer guys. While what I described earlier makes for a pretty generic anime, it\u2019s unrealistic as silicon breast implants. Each character of the generation of miracles and even our shitty little kuroko has moves or preforms plays that make the NBA, at best, seem like a league of amateur players with shaky night cameras. There are characters who can shoot consecutive three pointers from their own goal territory, can instantly copy any move, and one who can shoot a ball at will from behind the back board.  This is a generation of bullshit. What makes it worse is the dialogue that sounds like a yaoi soap opera.  Here\u2019s an excerpt of the show\u2019s dialogue from episode 5 to illustrate my point. Kise:\u201cFirst you turned me down then we lost today\u2019s game, everything is going wrong in my life now\u201c Kuroko: \u201cI felt we lacked something\u2026I still I don\u2019t what\u2019s wrong with it\u2026all I know is that I hated basketball at this time\u2026that\u2019s why I was so impressed with kagami\u201d Kise: \u201cSomeday you and Kagami will part ways\u201d It got to the point I thought Kagami and Kuroko were lovers the way they kept talking about one another. The show is so BL oriented that in episode 12 during the half time of the serein vs. (insert team name here) game Midorima takes time to file his nails. Seriously who the hell does that during a sports match, let alone a basketball game. I almost half expected for Aomine during his matchup against seirin to explain his reason for being late as the result of him getting a pedicure. \\n\\n\\n\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\nThat being said, there are only like 4 or 5 characters you should even consider caring about throughout the course of this series. First off is our main character, Kuroko. He\u2019s the type of guy who just oozes charisma, the type of guy who can get a girl\u2019s panties wet just by staring at her, and ugh you know he\u2019s really badass.  Sorry I lied, he\u2019s a no good pussyface, pale, soft spoken, jacks off in a dark room dipshit.  They said he was the generation of miracles\u2019 sixth man, but they lied, this little pussy is no man. He was their shota. He apparently has this ability called \u201cwho gives a fuck\u201d. It involves no one giving two shits about him only to have suddenly appear before them much to their chagrin. He doesn\u2019t speak much, but when he does talk it\u2019s usually to proclaim his love for his boyfriend Kagami or to up the dramatic ante.  He\u2019s the uke in this relationship as you\u2019ll see even he agrees he needs a strong man to draw the best out of him. The next one up is Sakuragi Hanachimi\u2026.err I mean Kagami. This red haired all personality punk is the true one the story mostly revolves around. Returning from the U.S. he finds himself bored with the Japanese level of basketball until he meets Kuroko where he soon finds out that American players are chumps and Japanese people are the ultimate basketball players.  His dominant never say die attitude make him the uke. Now I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cgee Daimyo you must be some sort of yaoi connoisseur\u201d Who the hell do you think I am? I\u2019m Daimyo and this isn\u2019t mangafox motherfucker there are no connoisseurs here! I just happen to be very skilled at using urban dictionary and receiving texts from yaoi fans who proliferate the internet like the aids virus spreading their terminology and yaoi-ism to a network node near you.  Next we have Kise. His ability is being able to copy other people\u2019s moves and modeling and some other bishounen type shit. This next character really makes you question the sanity of the person who made this. Midorimasu, his ability is to be able to score three pointers easily from anywhere on the court. At the half court line? No problem. From his basket? No problem.  In the stands while boning your mother? Piece of cake. Who needs Reggie Miller or Ray Allen on your team when you have this guy. Lastly we have Ao fucking mine. I had to add, \u201cfucking\u201d to his name cause that\u2019s what he does. He fucks up the logic of this insane show even more. You ever thought a move was too physically impossible or difficult to preform in a game? Don\u2019t worry, Aomine does atleast 20 such moves every fucking game. This guy can break past 5 defenders in 10 seconds, has a 1 second instant score shot release, can preform a fullcourt sprint and block then switch up and dunk on a fastbreak, and when he pulls up on a shot his back is almost completely parallel to the ground, he then manages to scores and always lands on his feet. This guy wasn\u2019t born out of a vagina, he came out of a basketball net. It got to the point where I was like, \u201cwell damn what\u2019s next? Is he going to shoot lasers out of his ballsack?\u201d Also he was Kuroko\u2019s previous boyfriend as he received most of his assists. He has this childhood pink haired bitch friend that used to like Kuroko, but Kuroko must have given him an assist (though I bet they double teamed her) as it appears Aomine is the one tapping that proverbial (word switching yay!) ass. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\nIt\u2019s fairly entertaining. Not much more needs to be said but more will be said. As far as entertainment goes it is a lot more entertaining than a Daimyo review (which doesn\u2019t say much). \\n\\n\nOverall and Conclusion 7/10\\n\\n\nI think what prevents this show being better for me are all the weak aforementioned elements: the corny writing, the unbelievable events and the incredibly dull main character. The matches themselves while entertaining became boring after awhile because seirin would always win in some grandiose over the top way such as scoring a buzzer beating game winner (which even Lebron James himself has only down a handful of times).  Maybe I am being too nitpicky as I assume the majority of people who enjoy this show don\u2019t even watch real basketball.  Alright, but what about that other basketball series, you know the best selling sports manga of all time and one of the best selling series of all time: Slam Dunk. How does Kuroko stack up to it? It doesn\u2019t. Mostly because Slam dunk ended many years ago, and Kuroko no Basuke is still ongoing. It\u2019s too soon to tell how well Kuroko no Basuke will fare over the years. There are strong indications of growth as apparently this series was among the top selling manga of 2013, and the fact that a sequel currently ongoing anime was produced shows signs of strength. That being said, the overall impact and attachment to characters that Slam Dunk produced trumps most of what Kuroko no Basuke has to offer. Slam Dunk told a raw, cut no corners, realistic take on basketball.  \\n\\n\nTo summarize my too many words review, Kuroko no Basuke is a BL version of Slam Dunk with a few more prominent bitches.",

            "content": "Kuroko No Basket is an anime that was recommended to me by a very good friend of mine who, like me, is a basketball enthusiast. I didn't take his recommendation too seriously when I read the description and found out that this was a sports anime. I never truly had an interest in sports anime since it didn't have a natural appeal to me. Anime were too me, a way to explore new realities, new universes where the laws of logic and (for some reason) gravity doesn't count. Places where you can be a ninja or a soul reaper, even a pirate. A place whereeven the whiniest loser can find love and romance. A place of fantasy that can sometimes be shattered by reality.\\n\\n\r\nTo me anime was that special place, so when I thought about sports anime, I just dismissed it as \"probably boring\", or \"not going to work well or be factual\", or \" can't be better than the real thing, aren't sports anime competiting with the real sport??...seems like a losing battle\"\\n\\n\r\nThese were my prejudgment about sports anime, and may or may not be fair judgments. After a while, my friend checked up on my list and saw that Kuroko No basket was never added. He then pleaded with me to give  the anime a try and just to watch the first two episodes, if I didn't like it, he would leave me alone and never speak of it again. I agreed. I watched the two episodes and..boy, was I blown away!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is extremely intriguing and catches your attention straight from the  get-go. The prelude before the opening already gives a feel for the mood and storyline of the show. You are curious to see who this mystery sixth man is, and what kind of player he is. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Kuroko seems weak and shy, but he is in reality very confident. You consider that he may be small, really quick and a good point guard. However, you then found out that he cannot even make the simple of layups, cannot dribble, and has no jumper. Then you come to the realization that this guy is a loser, and probably the whole show will about him learning JUST how to shoot a normal jumper and make a simple layup. Your heart drops at the idea of a slow, non fulfilling anime..again\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the episode though, you see the real extent of Kuroko's ability and you are simply amazed..amazed enough to go the second episode in which the story line then takes over.\\n\\n\r\nThis being my first sports anime, it is easy for me to say that the story line is original, I mean, who's heard of a middle school basketball team that contains five basketball phenoms (all with unique abilities) and a phantom sixth man whose the incarnation of Rondo and Steve Nash. Some may say the story line isn't original, but those aren't my sentiments.\\n\\n\r\nYou are immediately enthralled by the notion of these five phenoms, of the so called \"miracle generation\", you want to see them play and see how they stack up against Kagami who's been to America. \\n\\n\r\nThe way that these miracles are introduced, and used are in my opinion perfect. I was captured by every moment of it. In that sense, I give the story line a 10/10 for outstanding job creating a mood and suspense.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, not the best anime art that I've ever seen. I've said I've never watched a sports anime, but there's been scenes in other animes where basketball was played namely true tears..and the basketball scene in there was more crisp, fluid, and dynamic. Of course, I don't expect Kuroko no Basket to pull off this kind of art for an entire season, but maybe one or two moves of this kind of animation would have been fine.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have any great regret or criticism about the art, some of it was done extremely well but for a show this recent, I would have liked more fluidity. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters design were well done, and I was able to recognize most of the players in every scene. I like how most of the main characters all had different hair color to help us differentiate between them. A show about sports is bound to have a lot of characters so I enjoy the uniqueness of each char and they add to their personalities. I'm still amazed that some of these character can play full games with normal glasses on...not that I haven't seen that in real life.\\n\\n\r\n8/10, overall very good art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who has read previous reviews of mine knows how much of an importance I put on bgm music and the quality of sound in a show. The background music has the ability to make or break a show. The most important scenes can be altered dramatically by the music piece that they choose to use as background music.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I really liked and enjoyed the bgm of Kuroko no basket. There was a particular case I remember when I thought a better piece might have been used..I won't state the case since it would spoil and reveal for some people, but those who has watched the show may know which scene I am talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the piece that starts off most episode, the prelude, it really sets the semi-serious tone that this is all business and that the miracle generation are the main guys running things.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the game scenes the sound used to portray aggression, intimidation, desperation were all used very greatly and this only added to my enjoyment of Kuroko No Basket.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters make this show. If it wasn't for the intense personality of Kagami, or the calm confidence of Kuroko, then the enjoyment of this show would drop significantly. They are a great complement to each other and have an interesting and intriguing dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nThey aren't the only ones with interesting dynamics, it seems that every player from the \"miracle generation\" have a or  teammates that complement them and make it fun to watch them in the locker room. The teams really do feel like real teams, it's not always lovely dovey, teammates can really get in each other's nerves and this portrayed well in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the generation of miracles, at this point we are only formally introduced to a few of them, but the few that we know are well written characters, have perks about them and are overall good to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI wish that we would have at least a character that is American come into the show, someone from New York, or North Carolina that can also play basketball. It would bring a whole new dynamic to the show since now we can actually measure these \"basketball miracles\" to the real deal (the American youth greatly out measures the world in basketball...this is different when we start talking about the adults).\\n\\n\r\nI was patiently waiting for an American to be featured but this didn't happen, we got something close to that..but he wasn't American and thus didn't bring the same level of intensity that I would like. Maybe this will done in the future, but the goal of the characters in Kuroko No Basket is to be the best players of Japan, not necessarily the world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love the characters and they brought the uniqueness and the intensity to the show that captured from episode 1 up.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI've played four years of high school basketball, and planning on playing college basketball. So the sport is something that I hold dear to my heart and has been a part of my life for a long time. I didn't think an anime could portray the passion that I have for the sports but surprisingly it did. \\n\\n\r\nAs Kobe Bryant would call it \" The love of the game\" is strong in this show. Kagami comes to mind when I think of that. I was just like him when I was younger and playing in high school, I couldn't sleep the night before games. I was always excited to play better competition and better athletes than me.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Kuroko no basket gave me goosebumps by how riveting and how exciting and hype it made me. \\n\\n\r\nYes, a lot of the game play were unrealistic but this is an anime, and they should be able to defeat the restrictions that we have in this plane of reality. Yes, it is impossible to shoot a 100% from the floor but don't we all wish we did? Yes, we wish we had the ability to copy every move from every player that see..( some people can do this to some extend) but we cannot so why not give these abilities to fictional players and see how much more pressing a game may become. If we all wanted realistic plays, we could just go to youtube and watch a regular game..we watch this as entertainment and I would be gravely lying if I said I wasn't entertained.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 for Kuroko No Basket and I recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "Enjoyment has always been one of the most important aspects for scoring Anime/Manga for me, maybe even the most important. A show that just doesn\u2019t appeal to me in any way, even if it delivers in terms of writing, efficiently incorporating its characters in the plot and a possibly unique presentation, has a much harder time climbing the ranks than series which does an excellent job in entertaining me a great deal more. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t care at all for those aspects, in fact, they directly influence my enjoyment of a series, so I hardly ever enjoy straight-up 'bad' shows. However, the pointI\u2019m trying to make is, that an 'objectively' (which is a very vague adjective in its own right) worse show can end up being rated higher than better shows in terms of writing/presentation if my enjoyment was significantly higher.\\n\r\nKuroko no Basket is a prime example of enjoyment over good writing, not claiming that it is exactly bad at that either, but in what Kuroko no Basket definitely excels is entertainment value, making it one of the most enjoyable Anime I\u2019ve seen so far. The reasoning behind my rating and the good and bad aspects of the show will be described in more detail during my review and be warned that there will be possible MINOR SPOILERS covered in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is superficially no different from any other 'Shounen + Sports' series I\u2019ve seen so far, covering the story of an underdog team trying to defeat the powerhouse schools in their respective sport, in KnB\u2019s case the sport, of course, being Basketball.\\n\r\nWhat kinda makes the premise more unique, or precisely, a little more memorable than most of the other \u2018written by the same formula\u2019 type of Shounen-Sports is the semi-interesting backstory between the \u2018generation of miracles\u2019 and Kuroko, their team dynamics and eventual rivalry when moving into high school. The main goal of our protagonist, Kuroko Tetsuya, is to beat every single one of his former teammates through sheer teamwork, to basically cleanse them from their ideas of being able to win matches all by themselves and arrogant attitude towards others.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a pretty basic formula of consecutive episodes of either training or matches against other schools, preferably against teams with a member of the generation of miracles member in it and as expected the main team\u2019s duo of Kagami and Kuroko pose a real threat to the other teams, slowly getting better and better and develop new skills/tactics to defeat their opponents.\\n\r\nAs it stands, the first season of KnB has mostly solid writing, but only if you think within the realm of the Sports genre or to be more precise in the Shounen-Sports genre. Noticeable plot-armor in the first half of the series and some asspulls towards the end of the first matches bring down the enjoyment a little, while not being as overused as in the later seasons of KnB.\\n\r\nThe directing and production values of the show is top-notch and is easily one of the best aspects of the show. It\u2019s mainly due to the phenomenal directing why KnB is what it is: A thrilling ride which manages to keep the viewer on edge for almost the full duration of a match. And what I mean by 'almost' is, that the end is usually underwhelming. Seriously, NBA matches can be an absolute thrill to watch in the last quarter and last-second decisions aren't too uncommon, but when literally every match of the main team gets decided by a glorious 'BUZZA BEATER' in the last second, things get too predictable. This isn't a complaint about the lack of realism, but more a complaint about repetition. But then again S1 of Kuroko keeps that one somewhat in check, unlike the seasons to come.\\n\\n\r\nIf you will or will not enjoy Kuroko no Basket\u2019s matches is almost entirely dependent on the fact that you\u2019re expecting of the show. Watchers looking for a down to earth approach on Basketball with realistic skills will be utterly disappointed by how unrealistic Kuroko no Basket really is. There\u2019s a guy who can dunk by jumping approximately 3m away of the hoop, another one who is able to perfectly copy every move of another Basketball player within minutes and a player who\u2019s hitting 3\u2019s from every spot on the whole court when not being blocked. If you\u2019re reluctant of the show by simply reading this description, KnB DEFINITELY is not the right show for you.\\n\r\nWhile these aspects are surely a hindrance for some, I did actually really enjoy this unrealistic approach on, just because the show didn\u2019t make any fuzz about being realistic and down to earth, throwing superpowers and ridiculous plays in your face right from the first match on. This show truly feels like the offspring of DBZ and Slam Dunk and if you\u2019re able to cope with that, one of the most enjoyable shows will await you with this one.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the Art and Animation, there is actually little to say. The art style of Kuroko no Basket looks polished but is actually pretty standard, following the motto \u2018bishies for the win\u2019. There\u2019s nothing wrong about it, but sometimes the proportion between torso and head seems a little awkward with everyone having a body Arnold Schwarzenegger would\u2019ve dreamt of at the age of 16.\\n\r\nThe Animation is mostly solid throughout the series, having some little odd 'clippy' movements here and there during matches, but otherwise, nothing to both really complain or write home about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of KnB are the second best thing in the series, demonstrating that those bodies of the main cast are not just hollow shells, they actually develop and form special dynamics on and off the court and witty (sometimes even downright hilarious) relations among themselves. Rivalry feels lively, friendship feels real and grief feels kind of relatable. These aforementioned character relations are one of the biggest strengths of the show on one hand, but can actually be used to grasp one of KnB's flaws as well, if looked upon from a different perspective. Unlike HQ (Haikyuu), one of the most comparable Anime when talking about KnB, the show isn\u2019t able to show the strong bond within the team, as well as HQ, did. More in-depth relations are only shown to two members of each opponent\u2019s team, especially in season 1, unlike in HQ (especially Season 2), where the whole rival team is being developed dynamically and simultaneously with the main team. This leads to the obvious problem, that you basically don't end up cheering for the whole team, but rather for only the main duo. Also, some obvious fujoshi-baiting is present in this series, however, I don't see this as a big deal at all since it's not literally being thrown straight into your face (Free! I'm looking at you) or hinders me to like the characters as they are. Also, which Sports Series post-2010 doesn't suffer from it, being intentionally or not?\\n\r\nThat being said KnB offers some of the most hilarious character relations and rich 'standalone' personalities in several teams, mostly including one member of the generation of miracles, that you will probably forget about the lackluster development for the rest of the opponents\u2019 team.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise there\u2019s nothing to complain about either, KnB\u2019s soundtrack is rock-solid, offering a variety of different tracks that will pump you up, leave you at ease or make you feel the tension in-between a match. One of my favourites is the track \u2018Misdirection\u2019 which is being played during the best match with the main team in this season. Voice-acting is very solid as well, but that's to be expected due to the high amount of pretty famous male voice actors, namely Ono Daisuke and Ryouhei Kimura, while the other cast definitely isn't slacking as well.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nKuroko no basket is an incredibly fun series filled with action-packed matches which keep you on the edge of your seat, ridiculous superpowers which will even make NBA-players jealous, a stellar OST and one of the best and unpredictable matches I\u2019ve ever seen at the end of this season. There are mistakes here and there, like some overused plot-armor at the beginning and the lack of proper development for a whole team rather than just for a few selected members and some strange (and unintentionally funny) character designs here and there, but if you go into the series with the right expectations, you\u2019ll get a really enjoyable ride with two more seasons to watch afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5.5/10)\\n\r\nArt (6/10), Animation (7/10)\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)",

            "content": "After watching all the available episodes of Haikyuu! i needed something similar and fast.  So i remembered that people were super high on this basketball show, and i sort of regret watching it directly after Haikyuu! \r\nThe problem is that even though i'm trying not to compare the two, i'm doing it anyway, and i'm finding a number of things lacking.\r\nKnB is about highschool kids playing basketball, its a super quick starter, you watch a few episodes and then you're in a full on tournament where the protagonists are fighting for their life to beat teams that are probably better.  So its anunderdog story, at least the first season.  The basketball is not realistic, none of what you see would ever happen, the characters are too specialized, even though the show admits that basketball is a game for all rounders (and ofc tall people).  \\n\\n\r\nBut don't let that take away anything from it, without these sort of 'shounen' elements, the show probably wouldn't be nearly as much fun.  And the bottom line is that the show IS fun.  That doesn't mean there aren't some weaknesses though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first and most important issue is that the characters have no discernible weaknesses.  That's not to say they don't have weaknesses, but its not highlighted in any meaningful way.  Outside of the blue haired main character and the bench warmers, everyone is strong.  Really strong; and then you have the freak athletes.  While the MC's struggle thorughout the show, it isn't like they are on a weak team, its just most teams are stronger.  Perhaps b/c the Seiren team is a newly founded basketball club.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue i have with this approach is that the character development suffers outside of the court.  Most of the interaction outside of the court revolves around basketball as well.  So you aren't watching a character mature as a person, but as a player.\\n\\n\r\nI think that ultimately hurts some elements of the drama, but it isn't a coffin nail.  \\n\\n\r\nThe original japanese voice overs are really good, the art is a lacking in a few areas, but the show is cranked up to max on the intensity dial, so that the art and music are almost an after thought.  When it comes to the games, KnB exceeds in almost every way.  \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much of a story here, outside of championship level team looking to win a championship, but the way it delivers is incredibly good.  I think they missed some opportunities to expand the characters off the court, but at the end of the day, that isn't why you should be watching.",

            "content": "The perfect mix of sports and shounen genre, Kuroko No Basket dominates the genre with a blend of action packed entertainment accompanied by competitive atmospheres. After the split of the Generation of Miracles\u2014a middle school overpowered basketball team\u2014Kuroko, a stoic ex-member of the GoM, makes it his mission to prove to the world that his style of basketball\u2014teamwork over self-reliance\u2014is equally as effective as any other. Unlike the rest of the GoM, Kuroko's abilities are purely supportive, using methods revolving around passing the ball. Kuroko stumbles upon a strong basketball player named Kagami. Together, the two make it their goal to defeat the GoM. Kurokooften refers to himself as a shadow, which emphasizes light\u2014strong players\u2014when ironically he becomes the Sun to any team he joins. Together, Kuroko's new high school\u2014Seirin High\u2014dives into a competitive basketball tournament hoping to win the championships. \\n\\n\r\nKuroko No Basket succeeds through its ability to attract all viewers. Some will be drawn in by character appearance and personality, while others may simply enjoy the competitive scenery. A common misconception is that you need to know anything about basketball before watching this anime, that's far from the truth. Everything is self explanatory, and anyone can watch. Although the abilities of players are unrealistic, it is to be expected. Think of the anime as a mixture of a hardcore battle anime, but instead of physical fights, powers are directed into a sport. Each episode is action filled, the pacing of the anime is relatively rapid hopping from game to game. Personal growth is a notable theme; all characters in the anime grow socially and physically. As I noted before, the anime is fast paced, almost every character in the anime\u2014main cast or supporting cast\u2014show remarkable increments of improvement as the story progresses. The hard-to-believe improvements are defended by the large amounts of practice each team goes through. \\n\\n\r\nA wise choice by the creators was choosing Kuroko to be the main character. The prominent, yet invisible boy is likeable. His lack of expression and presence creates a character with less obnoxious flaws. As the saying goes, \"If you have a flaw, fix it\". Kuroko is bright, he adapts to situations and most importantly, isn't perfect. His imperfections exist, but aren't flaunted. The supporting cast are actually individual mini main characters. Each player on the team has their personalities and abilities highlighted. Unlike many other anime, they are not \"useless\" in comparison to the main characters. Albeit the team heavily relies on Kuroko and Kagami, they are still capable of succeeding to a certain extent without their two star players. Initially, I was hesitant towards the character Kagami, as he seemed to be heading the path of a Aomine\u2014a previous member of Generation of Miracles, who was a solo player\u2014, which would have been the exact same situation Kuroko had tried to avoid. In spite of my beliefs, I\u2014thankfully\u2014was proved wrong, Kagami is not a replicate of Aomine. Each character has their own unique abilities, and even though the word \"strong\" is overused in the anime, the word \"strong\" refers to overall capability, not simply physical strength.  \\n\\n\r\nThe female characters defy the gender stereotype of women being stupidly clueless about sports, portrayed in many anime. Coach Riko demonstrates wisdom in coaching. Aside from the casual fan-service boob boasting, manager Momoi exhibits superb analytical skills. The Generation of Miracles, having all members on separate teams, created the perfect setting and plot to the anime. They are considered the \"Aces\" to  their team, a secret weapon. However, it's important to distinguish that just because each team has a(n) \"Ace(s)\" doesn't mean that other team mates are useless.  The game is not simply about one on one, it's the combination of a team's compatibility and individual abilities. \\n\\n\r\nSportsmanship is seen through various perspectives. The GoM actually have many genuinely kind members. It's just the way they represent their kindness that is often misinterpreted as intentional bashing. A common conflict many characters face is a battle between loving basketball, and loving winning. Kuroko, a basketball lover, blatantly states that victory is useless if you are not happy. His opinion is not shared amongst some others. In the end, most of the teams admittedly would prefer a well played game accompanied by a loss, rather than a effortless win. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound could be described as basic, nothing beautiful and nothing horrid. The colors chosen are fitting, the character designs are simple, but not too plain. When someone from the Generation of Miracles plays at full potential, they are surrounded by a glowing color correlated to their hair color. Although at first it seems cool, it does at some points become over used. Character facial expressions are also sometimes overdone. Players often have a shocked face when someone does something amazing, but you'd think that after seeing so many amazing plays/skills you wouldn't be as shocked. Personally, I found the OP and ED average, it could have been better but wasn't necessarily bad. \\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, I would recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys fast paced action. It was neither the sound, art, or story that captured my attention. Simply put, it was the anime's ability to provide a large quantity of entertainment and enjoyment. The sheer intensity and character depth puts this anime at the top. Unique abilities, team work, individual strength, and growth allow Kuroko No Basket to maintain a fast pace without being too quick. The mental processes and beliefs of each individual just add even more interest to the anime as a whole. Holistically, this anime succeeds beautifully. \\n",

They were wrong. i did not find anything good about this anime\r\nStory:\r\nIt's about a two guys that wants to become the best in basketball. they also have superpowers, so instead of saving the world and using there powers for good like The Avengers. They just want to become good basketball players. if you had powers like this you would become a basket player? no you wouldn't and that is one of the reasons this anime sucked. \r\nAlso the Generation of miracles splitting up is shit, if you had ateam this good with superpowers that can even win against profesionel teams, would you? No, it makes no sense. You cant defend this anime, it is so bad story -.-\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWorse than normal in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNormal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nguys with superpowers that play basketball. i have actually once seen a basketball game at my school. and it did not play like this. Also Kuroko is such a boring character, he does not do anything. The girl that likes Kuroko, so many people liked her, I think they could have made her a neko and it would be better, that is what I think. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI hated every second of it, and people who  enjoyed this can't be serious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n1/10 it is really bad, I dont recommend to other anime lovers out there. it is really bad and very boring.",

            "content": "\"YO! Kuroko no Basket is so unrealistic. I'd rather watch REAL BASKETBALL over this piece of junk!\". Yeah... okay.\r\nBefore I start, I am going to review three seasons of Kuroko no Basket separately so, this isn't a review for the whole series.\r\nThe first season of Kuroko no Basket was pretty decent. It had some good moments but, there were times where it got down.\r\nSo, what is it all about? KnB is about a boy named Kuroko Tetsuya. He was once a player of Teiko High during his middle-school days. Teiko High was the team that had the \"Generation of Miracle\" players. By the time hewas High-school, he joined the team Seirin High. Along with him is Kagami Taiga. Together, they will show the power of Shadow and Light.\\n\\n\r\nDid you cringe from that synopsis? Because it's corny isn't it? Trust me, it's more than that. Kuroko vows to himself that his team will beat all the Generation of Miracle players. He will prove that his or their basketball is much better than theirs. Generation of Miracle players cares about themselves but Kuroko cares about trust on his teammates.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's really good about Kuroko no Basket is their basketball matches. In every game, you will feel a sense of thrill. Sure, there are some parts in the match that are slow-paced but that's just the build up for the thrill. One reason why I watch Kuroko no Basket is because of that thrill - the surprises that it brings.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the flaws. The first major flaw of season 1 is how it ended. It feels like I wanted something more and it just felt bitter. Though, it's alright, the series ended anyways.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just remind you though that Kuroko no Basket has some superpowers like copying one's move, misdirection, etc. People, there's more than that. Rather, stop comparing anime to reality. Those are completely two different things.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, it's good. It has it's fluid moments but, it's colors are pretty decent. For the sound, the OST are good but some soundtracks are forgettable. Though, I can say that it's opening and ending theme are really catchy.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, every characters on the story are great. The characters on these story sometimes showcases on what basketball really is. Also, from the GoM players, we will see on how they develop throughout the story and how they change. \\n\\n\r\nKuroko Tetsuya is the Phantom Sixth Man of the Teiko High during Middle School. He was called the Phantom Sixth Man because of his lack of presence thus, he can pull off moves like Misdirection. He is somewhat a quiet person but, he does show some emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThe light of Kuroko - Kagami Taiga. Like most Shonen anime, there's always one guy who is determined and that's him. He is determined to surpass the Generation of Miracle and become Number one. Yes, he maybe typical but as the story goes on, he develops a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this show. This was actually my very first sports anime and if you are finding on what sports anime to watch, this is the one. A great introduction to the world of sports anime.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.6/10",

So in my opinion they story was very well done (considering how much I HATE sports).\r\nThe pace of it was good, and kept the my thoughts going on wondering what will happen next.\r\nWhen they play matches in the game, I always had about 90% of what was going to happen. The reason youwatch is because you want to see HOW it happens. \\n\\n\r\nSo the forte in this anime is showing how they get to that very obvious win. \\n\\n\r\nThings get a little cheesy at times, but it gets cheesy during the right parts if that makes sense...\\n\\n\r\nArt--\\n\r\nThe thing that annoyed me was the line-shading they did on the characters. It just looked really ugly to me, but eventually you get used to seeing it and it doesn't feel that weird after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation wasn't ALWAYS that good, but this was mainly during parts that weren't the basketball matches. The more action there was I thought the better the animation was. However running and walking animation felt awkward at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt style fits the characters and the type of story, so nothing felt really out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSound--\\n\r\nI thought sound effects were pretty good, nothing felt fake or cheap.\\n\r\nVoice acting was well done too, I felt the voices fitted the characters and it felt pretty natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs felt really cheesy...\\n\r\nBUT I warmed to the 1st ending quite a lot in the end because it was pretty catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters--\\n\r\nThe generation of miracle characters were all unique and had their own little special feature between personality and physical talents. So I felt like there was a good range between them, also everyone seems to have their own favourite character out of them 5 plus Kagami.\\n\\n\r\nYou get to learn about most of the major character's history to some extent so you can get some connection to them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso there is a good balance between the main characters (Kagami and Kuroko) and the other characters, so you aren't always so focused on them.\\n\r\nWhich helps to keep the story fresh!\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this anime was actually a surprise to me about how much I enjoyed it (considering how much I hate sport).\\n\r\nI'll be looking forward to season 2!\\n",

            "content": "Finally having finished Kuroko no Basket (KnB) upon my friends constant praise for the anime, I figured I'd write my thoughts on it. I've seen lots of people who really love KnB, and others who dislike it. Having watched KnB right after watching some boring anime, it was a refreshing and exciting show for me. \r\nStory: Kuroko no Basket has the typical sports anime storyline with a little addition side fun. The main character is physically weaker and \"unskilled\" compared to other players, but he utilizes his personal strengths to help his [highschool] team win. The main character's team starts out weak, but through hardship,practice, and teamwork, they try to prevail in the end. What is the side story fun though? It's the addition of \"The Generation of Miracles\", Kuroko's middleschool teammates. They are basketball prodigies, Seij\u016br\u014d Akashi (Point Guard, Mysterious Captain), Shintar\u014d Midorima (Shooting Guard, Never misses a 3), Ry\u014dta Kise (Small Forward, Hot! All Around Copy-Cat), Aomine Daiki (Power Forward, Ace Scorer), and Atsushi Murasakibara (Center, Defensive Monster). Each one of them are now in different high schools, and they are competing in the Spring tournament to see which one of them is truly the best. And of course, Kuroko gets a new teammate who the story really revolves around, despite it being called \"KUROKO no Basket\", Kagami. Kagami is that ace player that has so much potential, potential to perhaps surpass the Generation of Miracle players. And so, the exciting basketball journey begins.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't really know what makes some art better than other art in anime, but I really loved the artwork and portrayal of the players playing basketball. It looked amazing! And the different color hairs according to their names for the Generation of Miracle players was funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The first opening was great, and the second opening was oookkkaayy. The overall soundtrack of the anime wasn't all that special. There wasn't that much music to begin with though. The voice casting was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Best part of the anime. I loved every single character. Every single one. I was rooting for all the teams (except for the nobodies ^^). There weren't that many female characters, only 2 memorable ones, but they were put to good use. Both girls was strong, smart, and were coaches (ast-coach) for their teams. Kuroko is absolutely kawaii, and Kagami was exciting to watch. The Generation of Miracle players were the best part of the anime, loved their addition! The development of the Seirin team (Kuroko and Kagami's team) was masterfully handled. Nothing for me to criticize. I can't wait for more in Season 2 and the upcoming Season 3!! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although the beginning started out slowly, and I questioned whether I was going to finish it all the way, the story quickly picked up it's pacing after like 5 episodes and I had a blast. The basketball matches were really fun and nerve-wrecking to watch, the characters were not only unique, but they were all really funny. That's another thing I loved about KnB; the addition of comedy and off the court scenes while giving the viewers great basketball games. One of the most purely enjoyable anime I've ever seen, definitely recommend others to watch it, especially if you love sports!",

            "content": "OK this one is extremely popular. I have dropped this for my own reasons, i.e. based on my own viewing. As there are a bunch of fan reviews all giving it a 10, I will only state the reasons why it is not as great as people think it is. You can read the positive reviews to balance things out.\r\nMy criticism of this anime is divided into\r\n1. Story\r\n2. Sport simulation\r\n3. Powers\r\nThe Story\r\nPlagiarized.  It's a rehash of  Slam Dunk. In both shows you get a basketball team that was really bad, and then the following year we have our protagonists who join and theteam gets a power surge and become this all conquering behemoth.  In slam Dunk we had Sakuragi and Rukawa, here we have Kuroko and Kagami. It\u2019s pretty much a pattern you see in all shounen anime. The story is also bad when one considers that Seirin is only a year old, but yet has the ability to draw players of the caliber of kuroko and Kagami to join them. In short this is an anime on how an ant becomes Goliath, Not David.\\n\\n\r\nBut who am I to complain? A vast majority of anime (shounen) feature similar inspirational stories of the underdog rising to the occasion and defeating far superior foes. The target audience for these type of stories  exceed those of far more complex ones, usually kids who would not be mature enough to criticise this. They say familiarity breeds contempt, not in Japan. It breeds lots of Yens there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSport Simulation\\n\\n\r\nKuroko no baske does not portray basketball (despite what its fans say). As a fan of the sport I can easily deduce that play is closer to netball than basketball. The players on this anime rarely dribble. The cause of this is....\\n\\n\r\n.......Powers\\n\\n\r\nI've never understood why Japanese writers are so obsessed with powers. This is understandable when one is writing a battle manga  like DBZ, but this is a sport manga  where realism is essential. The cause of this is the so-called generation of miracles. In short they are saiyans who play basketball, and not basketball players.\\n\\n\r\nIn each arc or whatever of this anime we get introduced to one of the generation of miracles, in Seirins rise to the top. Each match seirin plays they have to over-come a super human ability to progress. For example - Midoriyama can score 3 pointers from ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE ON THE COURT, he DOES NOT MISS. What makes midoriyama even worse is the fact that he scores 3 pointers than goes back to defense while talking to a team mate before the BALL GOES THROUGH THE BASKET. Even our very own protagonist Kuroko has an ability. He can disappear on the court, and no one will know where he is (Except another character who has a similar ability to his). \\n\\n\r\nEven their coach/manager has powers. She can deduce the abilities of players by just looking at their naked self in front of her. Really? Yeah right more like a closet prostitute.\\n\\n\r\nOK THE FANS WILL SAY TO YOU \"YOU DO NOT WATCH THIS ANIME BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE TRUE BASKETBALL REPRESENTATION, YOU WATCH IT BECAUSE IT\u2019S FUN AND EPIC\"\\n\\n\r\nSadly for them that is not true. When a person picks any anime it\u2019s because of the concept the anime is based on. In short we watch kuroko no baske because we want to see some basketball anime clear and simple. If that was not the reason, the viewership for this anime would be low. It's like watching naruto with the expectation of seeing ninjas, foolish.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. Now go and watch some more repetitious anime.",

            "content": "Kuroko no Basket... one of the big names out there. And for sure it is pretty good . \r\nWell, for those who think that a sport anime can\u00b4t bring you enjoyment, well you are wrong because i thought the same and thank god i gave a chance to it, because as soon as i started watching i could no longer stop until the 3rd season that it's being released now. \r\nStory (8/10). I said it was good but we gotta be fair, it just some schools in a basketball cup fighting against each others. But hey hey if it is so simple why i gaveit a 8? Easy, yes it would be a normal anime but in fact it isn\u00b4t. Since the first episode they show us a mythical team with extraordinary players from the \"gym\" (so what we call it at least here 3rd cicle, 7 8 and 9th grade). They won everything that there were to win and now they are fighting for their own school. This fact made me hooked to the plot because i wanted to know what they were capable of and why they were called \"the miraculous generation\". Each player has their own way to play and their own special skills that allows them to be different from the rest of the other players. \\n\\n\r\nBesides all of this, the rest is pretty normal for a shonen. The main characters getting stronger over time and at the final second of every game they get super strong because they have friends .. bla bla bla the same shit of all the others shonens. So why i gave it a 9 ? \\n\\n\r\nActually it is just a shonen, but the games are so epic that we just can\u00b4t stop watching. Especially here on the first season, we see the intensity of the games increasing over time, so the anime just starts good and just get better with the time. The final games of this season are so epic that made me laugh, they were so good and because of it i laughed. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10). It is pretty normal, nothing special to say here. The background detail sucks but that doesn\u00b4t really matter because throughout the games we just have eyes to the field and to the ball, and the details here are good. So .. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (7/10). Well for a shonen we could not expect more  .. as i said there all are pretty normal for a shonen so i can\u00b4t actually gave it a nice grade. The usual development that we see in other shonens, the guy that wants to be the best and his enemies call him weak bla bla bla so he gets over powered and fucks everything up.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10). This is one of the best points here. The sound makes the games even better. The sound fits perfectly in the action plus we have nice openings. They are not my music style but still i found them good so.. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, although in specific points this anime is not brilliant, the all thing together makes a super sport anime that can make you hooked right from the first episode. \\n\r\nI reccomend this show for everyone. EVERYONE. It is good, there is no bad points here, so i don\u00b4t see the reason for you to don\u00b4t give it a chance. Take my example, i like deep stuff and hard drama, yet i found this anime so good or even more that some dramas that i saw (:. Give it a chance, don\u00b4t think that for being a sport anime you won\u00b4t like it. I don\u00b4t even like basketball that much and i loved it anyway. \\n\r\n I hope that you enjoyed, again sorry for my crappy english but i think it is good enough to get the point.",

            "content": "Kuroko No Basket is an anime that was recommended to me by a very good friend of mine who, like me, is a basketball enthusiast. I didn't take his recommendation too seriously when I read the description and found out that this was a sports anime. I never truly had an interest in sports anime since it didn't have a natural appeal to me. Anime were too me, a way to explore new realities, new universes where the laws of logic and (for some reason) gravity doesn't count. Places where you can be a ninja or a soul reaper, even a pirate. A place whereeven the whiniest loser can find love and romance. A place of fantasy that can sometimes be shattered by reality.\\n\\n\r\nTo me anime was that special place, so when I thought about sports anime, I just dismissed it as \"probably boring\", or \"not going to work well or be factual\", or \" can't be better than the real thing, aren't sports anime competiting with the real sport??...seems like a losing battle\"\\n\\n\r\nThese were my prejudgment about sports anime, and may or may not be fair judgments. After a while, my friend checked up on my list and saw that Kuroko No basket was never added. He then pleaded with me to give the anime a try and just to watch the first two episodes, if I didn't like it, he would leave me alone and never speak of it again. I agreed. I watched the two episodes and..boy, was I blown away!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is extremely intriguing and catches your attention straight from the get-go. The prelude before the opening already gives a feel for the mood and storyline of the show. You are curious to see who this mystery sixth man is, and what kind of player he is. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Kuroko seems weak and shy, but he is in reality very confident. You consider that he may be small, really quick and a good point guard. However, you then found out that he cannot even make the simple of layups, cannot dribble, and has no jumper. Then you come to the realization that this guy is a loser, and probably the whole show will about him learning JUST how to shoot a normal jumper and make a simple layup. Your heart drops at the idea of a slow, non fulfilling anime..again\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the episode though, you see the real extent of Kuroko's ability and you are simply amazed..amazed enough to go the second episode in which the story line then takes over.\\n\\n\r\nThis being my first sports anime, it is easy for me to say that the story line is original, I mean, who's heard of a middle school basketball team that contains five basketball phenoms (all with unique abilities) and a phantom sixth man whose the incarnation of Rondo and Steve Nash. Some may say the story line isn't original, but those aren't my sentiments.\\n\\n\r\nYou are immediately enthralled by the notion of these five phenoms, of the so called \"miracle generation\", you want to see them play and see how they stack up against Kagami who's been to America. \\n\\n\r\nThe way that these miracles are introduced, and used are in my opinion perfect. I was captured by every moment of it. In that sense, I give the story line a 10/10 for outstanding job creating a mood and suspense.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, not the best anime art that I've ever seen. I've said I've never watched a sports anime, but there's been scenes in other animes where basketball was played namely true tears..and the basketball scene in there was more crisp, fluid, and dynamic. Of course, I don't expect Kuroko no Basket to pull off this kind of art for an entire season, but maybe one or two moves of this kind of animation would have been fine.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have any great regret or criticism about the art, some of it was done extremely well but for a show this recent, I would have liked more fluidity. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters design were well done, and I was able to recognize most of the players in every scene. I like how most of the main characters all had different hair color to help us differentiate between them. A show about sports is bound to have a lot of characters so I enjoy the uniqueness of each char and they add to their personalities. I'm still amazed that some of these character can play full games with normal glasses on...not that I haven't seen that in real life.\\n\\n\r\n8/10, overall very good art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who has read previous reviews of mine knows how much of an importance I put on bgm music and the quality of sound in a show. The background music has the ability to make or break a show. The most important scenes can be altered dramatically by the music piece that they choose to use as background music.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I really liked and enjoyed the bgm of Kuroko no basket. There was a particular case I remember when I thought a better piece might have been used..I won't state the case since it would spoil and reveal for some people, but those who has watched the show may know which scene I am talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the piece that starts off most episode, the prelude, it really sets the semi-serious tone that this is all business and that the miracle generation are the main guys running things.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the game scenes the sound used to portray aggression, intimidation, desperation were all used very greatly and this only added to my enjoyment of Kuroko No Basket.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters make this show. If it wasn't for the intense personality of Kagami, or the calm confidence of Kuroko, then the enjoyment of this show would drop significantly. They are a great complement to each other and have an interesting and intriguing dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nThey aren't the only ones with interesting dynamics, it seems that every player from the \"miracle generation\" have a or teammates that complement them and make it fun to watch them in the locker room. The teams really do feel like real teams, it's not always lovely dovey, teammates can really get in each other's nerves and this portrayed well in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the generation of miracles, at this point we are only formally introduced to a few of them, but the few that we know are well written characters, have perks about them and are overall good to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI wish that we would have at least a character that is American come into the show, someone from New York, or North Carolina that can also play basketball. It would bring a whole new dynamic to the show since now we can actually measure these \"basketball miracles\" to the real deal (the American youth greatly out measures the world in basketball...this is different when we start talking about the adults).\\n\\n\r\nI was patiently waiting for an American to be featured but this didn't happen, we got something close to that..but he wasn't American and thus didn't bring the same level of intensity that I would like. Maybe this will done in the future, but the goal of the characters in Kuroko No Basket is to be the best players of Japan, not necessarily the world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love the characters and they brought the uniqueness and the intensity to the show that captured from episode 1 up.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI've played four years of high school basketball, and planning on playing college basketball. So the sport is something that I hold dear to my heart and has been a part of my life for a long time. I didn't think an anime could portray the passion that I have for the sports but surprisingly it did. \\n\\n\r\nAs Kobe Bryant would call it \" The love of the game\" is strong in this show. Kagami comes to mind when I think of that. I was just like him when I was younger and playing in high school, I couldn't sleep the night before games. I was always excited to play better competition and better athletes than me.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Kuroko no basket gave me goosebumps by how riveting and how exciting and hype it made me. \\n\\n\r\nYes, a lot of the game play were unrealistic but this is an anime, and they should be able to defeat the restrictions that we have in this plane of reality. Yes, it is impossible to shoot a 100% from the floor but don't we all wish we did? Yes, we wish we had the ability to copy every move from every player that see..( some people can do this to some extend) but we cannot so why not give these abilities to fictional players and see how much more pressing a game may become. If we all wanted realistic plays, we could just go to youtube and watch a regular game..we watch this as entertainment and I would be gravely lying if I said I wasn't entertained.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 for Kuroko No Basket and I recommend this to anyone. show less",

            "content": "Sport animes were something that I know of but never really had the will to try. That was until I decided to absorb myself into Kuroko No Basket. This anime engrossed me in such a way that I will definitely watch more sport anime in the future. The main premise of the show is these two highschool freshman who are looking to be the best basketball players in Japan, I'm trying to describe the plot in the vaguest sense to avoid spoilers. On the outside Kuroko no Basket looks basic. Woah people trying to become the best at something in a shounen series wow wehaven't seen that one before. However execution is what makes this show a winner. The story is great well developed and interesting. The animation is beautiful just really well done; everything is so fluid which is important for something as fast paced as this anime. But lets get to the chase which is of course the basketball games. Wow these basketball games were so amazing to watch, they are so fast paced and exciting it always goes back and forth between the two teams and you're  always at the edge of your seat during these games. The characters are good they have great chemistry and are decently developed, I have high expectations for these characters in season 2. These characters are also like able  and interesting to watch and learn more about. The voice acting was solid and the music was epic and it's so high energy and fits the anime perfectly. I had some mild annoyances with this anime but nothing to detract from it's greatness. One annoyance was over utilization of tropes from the shounen demographic. Though this is forgivable due to the type of anime this is. Overall I just had a blast with this show and will definitely be checking out the next 2 seasons in this gripping show that is off to an excellent start. This anime is what any sport real or fictional should be: fun.",

            "content": "Plot\r\nThe progression of the story runs very smoothly and the characters develop beautifully. Everything falls into a nice chronological order, but still retains a certain element of unpredictability. Unpredictability and unique characters are important elements that every anime needs, but sports anime especially. Kuroko no Basket has a great balance of both. In this particular work you've got Kagami and Kuroko, who are practically foils. Kagami is first introduced into the story as boisterous and has an overwhelming presence, while Kuroko is quiet and lacks a presence all together. Unfortunately, not every character gets that same development, such as Mitobe and Koganei, but maybe we'llsee more in season 3 this January. When you look at the story progression as a whole it\u2019s actually very simplistic. Two basketball players become stronger to make their high school basketball team the best in the region. I love that simplicity. Not all anime need to have a hugely in depth story that has tons of lore and background. The background information in this story is simple enough to be accomplished through short flashbacks and that\u2019s a good thing. Simplicity is sometimes overlooked and it\u2019s nice having a basic, yet entertaining story from time to time.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nAt a first glance you might see the animation as stiff; however as the show progresses their movements become a lot smoother. That transition from stiff to smooth might have been unintentional, but it also could have been intentionally done to show improvement in skill. As for the art, it took me a while to warm up to it. The way the faces of the characters are drawn seemed to be slightly disproportionate, but it grows on you after a while. I look back at the anime now and hardly recognize it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a fantastic anime and I'm highly anticipating the release of season 3 this winter. One of things that makes, or breaks, an anime for me is character development. I can lose interest in a work if the characters aren\u2019t strong enough. Kuroko no Basket has well developed characters and relationships between these characters. If you\u2019re looking for an anime that makes your heart race when you know something cool is about to happen, or when the episode ends and you immediately click to the next one, this one is it. I understand this personally, because I absolutely burnt through this series. I\u2019ve only recently gotten into sports anime and out of the handful I\u2019ve seen thus far this is easily in my top three. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: I might accidentally say a couple minor spoilers so read at your own risk.\r\nI am fairly new to sports anime, and the only sports series I have seen before this is Major. While many people have not seen or heard of Major since it is slightly underrated, I still might use a couple comparisons to help get my point across. Going into Kuroko no Basket I had pretty high expectations because of the ratings, but I was fairly disappointed for certain reasons I have yet to explain.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story itself is nothing unheard of, having players want to become the best in the world,and it even manages to have an original aspect with Kuroko's great passing skill. While the show starts off well, it makes multiple mistakes as it keeps going on. The first of it's errors is the rules of the league they are playing in. In an anime that is 25 episodes long, and you realize that the team will be disqualified after losing once, the predictability of each match becomes too obvious. Who wants to watch a show where you already know what's going to happen? The second error I noticed was the constant \"slowed time\" during the games which tries to build intensity while also explaining what is going on. By doing this though, the quick pace of the basketball game diminishes instantly and interest is lost. One last mistake I want to point out is the failure to express the amount of practice the players put in to try and get better. Over the course of 25 episodes, I only remember seeing about 10-15 minutes of Seiren practicing. Without any scenes of the team practicing, the viewer fails to see the team grow and bond through tough times. Also, the development of each player seems simple, fast, and easy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kuroko no Basket is nothing special, but it isn't at all bad, considering the fact that it was made in 2012. The sweat that is put on each of the players makes the viewer notice how hard they are trying, yet sometimes the players will be sweating even at the very start of a game, which confused me. One negative part of the art I noticed was the shadowing. There were two different types of shadows, which got mildly annoying. There was the regular shaded shadows, but then each of the characters had this weird lined shadow on their necks which felt somewhat awkward. But besides that, all else was done well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings I found to be pretty dull, and not very memorable. The sound during the games was fine, although sometimes the fans would be cheering and then stop abruptly. All the characters sounded good, and the effects of the dribbling and shots were good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I had a big problem. Once again, the main two characters, Kuroko and Kagami, were good main characters. Each of them had a certain advantage and they didn't seem to amazing, which would help with character development. But as soon as they started introducing the members of the \"Generation of Miracles\", I was just speechless. Midorima, the green haired player, was just downright ridiculous. A player who can literally make any shot from any part of the court as long as no one blocks him? What kind of inhumane obstacle is that? And also with Midorima they showed his belief in horoscopes, which was a pretty lame plot device used. A horoscope should not be a tool used in predicting the outcome of a basketball game. Also Aomine, the blue haired player, had another inhumane \"super power\", which was once again ridiculous. Aomine was able to fly past every character, and those few times he couldn't and was blocked, would just make some crazy behind the back shot which made it every time. It may be an anime, but with these over the top powers given to the characters, development and enjoyment decreases significantly. One last character problem was the Seiren team itself. Besides the five main players, barely any of the other teammates were introduced well and even had any significance to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nEven though these super powers pissed me off and the predictability of the games was too easy, the show still managed to keep me entertained. It even had a pretty decent comedy aspect, which helped a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nHere is where I'll make some references to Major. In Major the team overall bonded well and all of the players would rely on each other. With Kuroko no Basket lacking this, I could honestly care less who wins or not, because I barely know anything about Seiren. Another good quality of Major is the setbacks throughout each season, and the ways the MC manages to get past them. Kuroko no Basket had minimal setbacks, and I think the biggest one was Kagami's \"hurt legs\", which ended up only lasting a couple episodes. And the two other things that Major does better are the predictability, and the more realistic characters. Now, to stop talking about the other show, I'll just say that overall Kuroko no Basket was decent, and had a great amount of potential, but there were too many mistakes made throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the length of this review, I just feel like I couldn't make it much shorter. And this is my second review, so if you have any suggestions or comments feel free to let me know. Thanks for reading, I hope you appreciated it.\\n\\n",

Being the girl that I am, I must admit that the character design was what drew me in, but this anime is so much more than a bunch of pretty boys playing basketball. \r\nEach of the characters are actually very well developed and you actually learn a lot about them.The different personalitiesof the characters balance each other out very nicely and it was a joy meeting each new character as they came along. \\n\r\nThe story progressed nicely and had a nice flow to it with really intense matches and some lighthearted comedy. I'd say the only downside is that it's somewhat predictable, but don't get me wrong, it's still a very interesting story.\\n\r\nAlthough I may be just a bit bias because I naturally favor this type of character design, the art and animation was handled very well. There weren't any parts of the animation that really stood out as lacking or rushed to me.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also worked really well for each of the different scenes and enhances the mood quite nicely. \\n\r\nOverall, I really did enjoy this series and I'd recommend it to anyone unless you absolutely detest sports, in which case this may not be the anime for you as they do play basketball a lot. But if you are unsure how you feel about sports anime and want to give one a try, this series is a great start. Kuroko no Basket will definitely be added on to my list of favorite anime and I really hope a new season comes out soon!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Quick Review - Kuroko No Basket\r\n      Kuroko No Basket is an anime that first seems to follows the Seirin High School Basketball team and their rise to glory with the arrival of two basketball prodigies to the school.\r\n      Kuroko No Basket is one of the purest sports anime you will ever see, meaning that practically all of the character development, emotional moments and payoffs happen while the team are on the court. Because a lot of the show takes place on the court with the games usually lasting for 2-3 episodes, the show feels asif it is very fast paced with no filler so it is very easy to binge-watch.\\n\\n\r\n    The shows plot is simple. The team want to become the best in Japan and to do this they need to win a tournament. The plot may be simple but the set up and subsequent payoff for the characters is what makes this show really worth watching as the payoff's make you wanna scream \"YES!\" every time.\\n\\n\r\n    The characters in this show are not incredibly fleshed out but each one off them gets at least a little bit of backstory and an arc in this season long story. It also helps that they are very likeable.\\n\\n\r\n    The art is alright in season 1 though it does look clunky at times. However the art is greatly improved in seasons 2 and 3. The soundtrack on the other hand is brilliant. Whenever there is a big moment the main them just brings it home and gets you so hyped.\\n\\n\r\n      Overall Kuroko No Basket is a much watch for sport anime fans. However I would say that if you are not a fan of anime that do not present alot of character developement then it may be a frustrating one to sit through.\\n\\n\r\n          8/10\\n\\n",

To such an extreme that I would on the edge of my seat while watching, getting shivers and feeling a buzz I usually only get when watching horror/thriller anime. I was hooked right from the beginning, intriged right to the end.\r\n*The story at first is a tad confusing, but after watching Higurashi, I can usually swallow any beginnings before ditching it. But, as itprogressed, I found myself caught up with the story, wanting to know more if I could. Even now when I'm finished, I am itchin to go read the manga cause I don't want it to end.\\n\\n\r\n*I found the art just stunning, it had a somewhat unique feel to it and it's rather catching at certain moments. I was always focused on the art and the style and the color, almost everything while watching.\\n\\n\r\n*I liked the music that played, in the openings and the endings as well as during the anime, but, I felt that it overstood most of the story as well as characters. \\n\\n\r\n*I like their personalities a lot and not every person is the same, everyone was different, even though you'd think some where similar, you'd later find out that they were so far from the truth. I enjoyed watching Kuroko, he has such an interesting personality that you just can't help but like him in a way, as well as Kagami and the other Generation of Miracles (the three that actually show up here). \\n\\n\r\n*I enjoyed the anime quite a bit, which is a slight shock, since this is so out of my genre as far as it can get. I was always glued to the screen and would always be annoyed when I had to go to bed or school, sometimes ending up dreaming the anime just cause I loved it so much.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall, it was a rather interesting anime and I highly recommend it. This is something that will keep you hooked and entertained to no end. But, that was one down point, it's unfinished. It may say complete but you can tell that there is much story to be told, but I guess it isn't so bad, since the manga is out there to be read. I just wish that they pick this up again, cause I would to see some more.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get mad at me if it's a bad review, I tried to keep all spoilers out but as detailed as possible. Anyway, I really enjoyed the anime ^^ Hope others would think so as well.",

The art is amazing, the story is addictive, and let's face it the characters are hot. There isn't a reason you shouldn't give it a shot.

            "content": "Before I gave this show a chance, I used to think that it was not the show for me. Firstly - I was not all that into basketball; second - the genre tags did not interest me one bit. If you were like me and grew up watching shows like \"Shakugan no Shana\", or \"Angel Beats\", you would probably share my opinion. Right now, I am up to episode 6. It is 2AM and I have my first day back of school tomorrow, but I simply can't stop watching. Here is why:\r\nMany Animes tend to make the main character overpowered, and exaggerate their brute strength(or miraculously give them the power to 'believe', as to magically give them a boost of strength so they can overcome their struggles) so they can gain admiration from the show's viewers. This is not the case in \"Kuroko no Basket\". The main character - Kuroko - in contrast, is extremely weak compared to the other characters in the series (arguably the weakest). However, that does not make him useless. Instead of making the main character a complete powerhouse, Kuroko is more of an accessory - a utility - which in this case really makes this Anime shine. This simple detail makes us realise what the concept of 'teamwork' really means in Basketball (and other sports, as well).\\n\\n\r\nBeing only 1/4 my way through the series, I do not have too much to write - i might add more later on. However, I believe that you should give Kuroko no Basket a shot (no pun intended), even if you think it's not for you. I, myself, got hooked on the first episode.",

            "content": "Let me begin by saying I knew nothing about basketball prior to watching this, I didn't know what a point guard was, what kind of shots are considered three pointers, etc. However, while I was watching some anime on animewaffles I noticed people in the chat talking about kuroko no basket and how amazing it was. I decided to look it up on MAL only to find out it was ranked pretty high and was a sports anime, a genre that I always wanted to give try. At first I wasn't expecting anything to exciting and fun to watch, I mean how could they makean ordinary sport become exciting? However, this anime succeeded in making basketball interesting and unique to have me marathon the entire first season within a day. The flashy passes, the dunks, and the jaw dropping shots being made was enough to get me hooked. Furthermore, there were five special players who each have their own special abilities, as these characters are revealed as the season goes on further contributed to the addiction I had with this series. There was a sixth player who also had a special ability that I will mention later in the review. I will refrain from specifying what these \"special abilities\" are in my review specifically to avoid any spoilers, so expect seeing this term being used a lot. However, let me first address some falsely stated criticism before doing so: \\n\\n\r\nA common critique is that Kuroko no basket goes over the top with these special skills that the characters have when playing basketball, and makes the game play look incredibly unrealistic. Its important to realize that this is an anime, of course its gonna be unrealistic. Look at one piece for example its about pirates with devil fruit abilities that cause ordinary humans to gain unrealistic powers, and swordsmen who have tornadoes flying out of their swords, while in reality we see pirates as people with eye patches and guns killing people for treasure. Despite this, one piece is incredibly popular and not critiqued at all for having this trait. If you want to watch realistic anime you are going to have a bad time especially for sports anime which would be pretty boring if they were to be realistic since there is already a channel for realistic basketball and other sports, ESPN.\\n\\n\r\nAnother common critique this anime receives is that its very yaoi like. This is not true however as the anime mainly focuses on its story of the main characters Kuroko and Kagami developing their basketball skills to take on the generation of miracles and ultimately become the best basketball team in Japan. While there is a little of man-service here and there it does not affect the overall story of the anime as a whole and it isn't present in every episode. Only the filler episodes contain yaoi but even then its pretty moderate. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThere was a middle school known as  Teiko Junior High which consisted of a legendary basketball team which consisted of five players known as the generation of miracles.This team dominated every competition they came across.  Each of these players had their own unique skill and an astonishing amount of talent. When their middle school days were over, the generation of miracles went to different high schools, each of which were well known for basketball. However, there was sixth member of the generation of miracles ,Kuroko who specialized in passing, joined the Serin basketball team which was not as well known as the other high schools the other members of the generation of miracles went to. It was at this high school that Kuroko met Kagami, a  player who transferred from America with lots of talent that haven't yet emerged. Together, Kagami and Kuroko plan to defeat the generation of miracles and become the best Basketball team in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story was not to complex and did not leave the viewer to think and  was really easy to understand. I was able to watch it without putting much thought into it. It also didn't have much filler, and the filler is when the yaoi scenes seem to come in so you could skip them without missing much of the main plot. The pacing of this series was great, I found myself watching one episode after another and eventually watched the whole series in one day. However, the predictability of who would win the match disappointed me a little but that doesn't take away from the fact that the show was enjoyable to watch. In fact, I think the unique skill that each of the main characters possess make the games more interesting to watch, especially if the viewer has a disliking to realistic basketball. \\n\\n\r\nArt/animation: 9/10\\n\r\nNot that bad, but not a masterpiece either. Some episodes had better animation than others but that may have been due to budget. At times some of the passes and shots being made felt unnatural almost as if they didn't draw enough frames. However, it compassionates this flaw with close ups of shots, dunks, and steals all of which contribute to the thrill and overall excitement of the viewer. However, the close ups of the faces of almost everyone playing a match each time someone made a shot was unnecessary and at times annoying. However, considering the budget, the animation/art was not too bad and is one of the better sports anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe actual soundtrack may be  where Kuroko no Basket shines. It fits perfectly with the scenes. In fact, the sound enhances the thrills felt with each scene. It also enhances the atmosphere and tension the players feel during a match, especially the heavy guitar playing tracks that come in whenever something epic happens such as an epic block or pass that  seemed to be impossible at first. The sound is acts as a great contribution factor to the adrenaline rush and thrill the viewer feels during these intense, epic moments.  The voice acting was great as well, though I don't think I ever saw an anime where the sub was bad. Overall, the sound in this anime was great overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe development we see in the two main characters(Kuroko/Kagami) in this series is one of the elements that makes this anime addicting. You want to keep watching this series because you want to see what kind of special technique Kuroko and Kagami will develop next. The reveal of each member of the generation of miracles and their abilities as they played a match against Serin was also what made me kept watching. However, there are a handful of players on Serin's team that get no back story or much screen time which was a real disappointment but they still fulfilled their roles. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nLike I said before, I wasn't expecting to become hooked to this show as I did considering my lack of knowledge of regular basketball. Needless to say, this anime was pretty enjoyable. While it did have its flaws, with the close-ups on the characters faces each time someone made a shot,  and didn't give as much of a thrill as some other anime (Monster, Death Note,) it managed to have me marathon it through its use of unrealistic shots and other elements that made watching this type of basketball more enjoyable. It even got me to look up more about basketball as well. In short, if you are looking for a sports anime to watch or just want to watch a simple yet enjoyable anime, Kuroko no Basket is the anime for you. \\n",

            "content": "Kuroko no Basket\r\nReview By: John Fragglepuss Evans\r\nKuroko no Basket combines basketball with anime in such a good way. The basics of basketball are there, but they are combined with the action and drama that anime utilizes so well. The dunks are intense, the passes are intense and they use beams of light to show just how amazing the passes truly are. Kuroko and Kagami remind me of the old NBA combo of John Stockton and Karl Malone, one with finesse and the other with raw power. In true sports anime fashion, the matches are all important and all last several episodes while the drama andintensity unfold.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You are a sports anime veteran or even if you are a sports anime rookie.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: Over dramatized motions and slow-motion sweat is too much for you.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Be prepared to get sucked into the story and watch a season in a day.",

            "content": "One of the mangas or animes that I will never get tired of re-reading or re-watching also the one that I remember almost everything from the manga and anime.\r\nArt: The art for me is outstanding and the animation is flawless. The setting, plot and character concepts or let us say everything is well played in this show. The ingredients are nearly perfect that will always leave you wanting more. Well for a manga reader like me I would say the anime exceeded my expectations since it made me like the show and finish it. That is for someone like me who would choose manga anyday of my life than anime. It is really that good to be honest!\\n\\n\r\nSound: I recommend you to use earphones when watching especially a match episode and I'll tell you you're like inside of the court watching the game. Openings and endings are cool too. The opening song Can't Do It  is so cool, I've never seen such timing and the awesomeness of the closing song Fantastic Tune.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Probably the only show that I will give a 10. I don't know how will I put to words of how awesome the characters in this show are. The intro is awesome and gave me goosebumps it is where \"Kiseki no Sedai or The Generation of Miracles\" is being explained. It is probably is the biggest thing that hit me since it reminded me the days when I'm still an athlete. Another thing that amazes me is also the colors of the rainbow concept, composed of a red, yellow, green, blue, violet and light blue haired characters. It is the genius concept made by the author having their hair color different from each other to symbolize their uniqueness as prodigies of basketball of their generation that only happens once every century.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Oh for the love of basketball! Thank heavens this is finally here after how many years of waiting. Each match episode is breathtaking and mind-blowing but the anime-ish is still there like the clock will stop if a character is talking in the middle of the game. If you used to play before, you will really enjoy this show because you can relate seventy to eighty percent of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nThis show can embrace my 9. The base of story talks about the coincidence happened in middle school. Four basketball prodigies of the same age having to enter the same basketball club at the same time and at the same perfect moment. \"Nothing but a sweet coincidence\" as the author have said. Followed also by a freshman who does not even know the basics but loves playing basketball and what completes the group is the one who's already bored because he excels at any sports he played and have found basketball as the only sport that he can't ace.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story is the reunion of each of the prodigy with their respective basketball teams having to do the vow they made before graduation to face each other someday together with each other's team. This is not just purely basketball, there is so much more!\\n\\n\r\nIf you happen to play in a team before, you will experience the feelings of being happy, sad and excited. The show will teach you moral lessons (e.g. being attentive, flexible, trusting your companions, never give up, don't lose hope and the most important: talent is not given it is how bad you want to achieve your goal) \\n\\n\r\n({ This is the most nostalgic anime and manga that I've ever read and watched because it really reminds me of what I was back then. }]",

            "content": "Ok, so this is my very first review but I just thought I had to share what I think about this anime.\r\nHonestly, this is the very first sports anime I've ever watched (aside from Suzuka but I only read that) and I have to say that after watching every existing episode up to date, I'm totally hooked on it now and am sad I have t owait so long between each episode to come out. Not only has this anime dragged me into watching more anime, it also made me search for more similar sports animes that were atleast as entertaining and as good asthis.\\n\\n\r\nThe story: I'd give this a very solid 9.\\n\r\nThe only reason the story is a 9 and not a 10 is simply because some points are very clich\u00e9, I will not ruin it for anyone reading this review but you will know what I mean if you watched it. The story is great besides that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art: 9.\\n\r\nThis is nothing new, nothing extraordinary. It's just normal which is fine by me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound: 10\\n\r\nEvery character sounds unique, and even though I can barely understand a word they are saying the tones they use make it clear no matter what your native language is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nKuroko is an outstanding character who is very interesting to say the least. Kagami is your typical hot headed character you have in almost every anime though he keeps surprising me at how interesting he stays.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A very solid 10.\\n\r\nThis anime keeps me at the very point of my seat every game they play, you just automatically want them to win. I love it when an anime makes me do that, makes me pumped up.\\n\\n\r\nOveral:10\\n\r\nRight now, this anime belongs to my top favorite animes. There's just something about it that makes it awesome to watch and I might even pick up the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSo honestly, if I didn't convince you to atleast watch a few chapters I don't know what else I can do. You just really have to give this anime a chance beacause once you get the hang of it you will really enjoy it and you will not be able to stop watching. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to you ;p\\n",

            "content": "Kuroko no Basuke is a lot more epic than realistic. Which is all the better, in my opinion, because it makes for a great accessible sports anime. I wasn\u2019t expecting to enjoy this genre, yet here I am shipping a basketball related anime! Honestly, the pacing is so good it\u2019s hard not to get completely hooked. With its strong themes of perseverance, ambition and self-improvement, I think this anime can not only please sports anime fans, but also just about any shonen fan. Just you watch it!\r\nStory : 9\r\nMost episodes end on a cliffhanger that really makes you want to watch the next episode, soI ended up watching them all in a very short period of time. I don\u2019t play basketball, but the anime is so well executed that the matches are very exciting to watch. It feels like a good action shonen, where the protagonists advance to face stronger opponents in epic battles, but it is easier to relate to since it\u2019s about a real sport. It really motivates you to go out there and be a motivated warrior, no matter what sport you play.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting enough. There are plenty of likable characters, a succession of prodigies with secret abilities, some mysterious villains and other passionate sportspeople. It\u2019s especially good that they have a past story to link them all, allowing for great character development. Also, the way they are slowly introduced throughout the story builds awesome suspense.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nThe animation during the games is outstanding, with fluid movements and impressive plays. For the ladies out there, it is worth mentioning that this anime features its fair share of nicely drawn muscled young men. It\u2019s hot, you know, even if it\u2019s just a drawing. But don\u2019t worry guys, this anime takes sport seriously, the focus is really on competition and testosterone-driven fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were nice to listen to. For the rest, I was too caught up in the games to notice the background music during the episodes. I think it shows that the soundtrack really blends in with the series. Good music helps build tension without causing distraction. The seyus did a great job too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series from beginning to end. It was suspenseful and intriguing all along and the matches were amazing to watch. It seems like they put a lot of thought in how they would divide the story into episodes, making sure each episode has something interesting to offer and is well balanced between action, character development, mystery and even comedy. There is always just the right amount of comic relief to highlight the tensed moments of the series.",

            "content": "For the first time I have watched a pure sports anime and it surprised me how non over the top it was.\r\nKuroko is one hell of a dude in my book, he hos the argo of a knife wielder in army of two and he can alter the course of a  pass like I can type out this probably really bad review, like all the rest I have made. He shows no emotions and just keeps them all inside until he can't hold them in anymore... but still shows no emotion. Oh and he is shortish with cool blue hair, and has a petdog (Hell yeah).\\n\\n\r\nKagami is peaty much the opposite of Kuroko in the fact that he shows all of his emotions of his \"sleeve\", or just shows his emotions really easily. He is full offensive player who leads the team in scores with the help of his shadow, Kuroko. He can slam dunk like it is nothing and jump like a he has the double jump move in a video game, life hacker. He is very tall, which helps with those hops, has fire red hair, and he does NOT like dogs. \\n\\n\r\nThen there are all the other characters which you could go do a paragraph on but that is to many for me, so I will just say a few sentences for them. They are all wierdos but cool at the same time, they all bring in their advantages to the game and story and they all help cover for each other ( not including The Generation of Miracles dudes, they are special). Whether it be taping up the player calf's or defending the hoop with all their might, they get their jobs done and do it good. \\n\\n\r\nI used to play basketball and love to look back at those days, but now I suck and can only enjoy watching this in my room or try and play it and suck at shooting so badly that it make me cry... not really but still, rather watch this than play.",

            "content": "I haven't written a review here on MAL before, but his show exceeded my expectations so much that I decided I needed to write a review for those (like me for the longest time) who may be hesitant to watch this. \r\nFirst of all, it is NOT required that you like basketball to enjoy this series- that's a major point I want to get out there quickly, and is also a big reason I'm writing this review. I'm not a basketball fan myself, but the show does a great job of pulling the viewer in and making what is happening on-screen extremely entertaining regardless ofwhether you like basketball or not. So again, give this show a shot even if you're not a big basketball fan. I delayed trying it out for a long time because of this and once I finally watched it I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on.  The comedy, characters, soundtrack, and art and animation are all top-notch and will entertain you even if you don't particularly care for the basketball part of the story. Now, on to the specifics.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show so great. All the characters who get significant screen time are sufficiently fleshed out. For such a large cast of characters (That is: Everybody from the \"main\" team that the story focuses on, and roughly a little less than a dozen characters from other teams), I was surprised at how each of them were so well developed and how they each had something unique about them. The characters are all so well developed and unique that it really didn't matter who was on-screen at the time, because it was guaranteed to be entertaining regardless. The show does a great job of giving all these quality characters a good amount of screen time each. This is not the kind of show where the MC hogs 80% of the screen time, and that really helps to develop each character and make the interactions between the different characters so great. Some of the best interactions between characters actually don't involve the MC at all, and yet, some of the best interactions DO involve the MC. There is a very good mixture of comedy, drama, and action, and each of the characters has something to contribute to that.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is the next thing that I would point out as being a major strong point of the show. All the songs are very catchy and they each do a great job of adding hype to a clutch moment or to add melancholy to a sad one. During the games, there is almost never a moment where there isn't background music. Some people may find this annoying, but I loved that about the show because it really added a sense of excitement to each of the games even when the teams are just going over strategies on the bench or a character is monologuing on the court. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are also very high-quality. The art isn't anything flashy but it looks good and the animation during some of the high-paced scenes on the court is very well done. I especially like the detail that went into characterizing certain characters through their facial expressions or their body movement. It did a lot for adding to that \"unqiueness\" I mentioned that they each have. Even the smallest details went into the animation to ensure that no two characters' bodies move the same on the court, which is a very cool detail when you consider that this is the case in real sports as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually really good for a sports anime. The \"Generation of Miracles\" are a very solid group of antagonists for the main characters to have to try and overcome. Each characters' motivations and goals are reasonable and it's interesting to see how they try to achieve those goals. While it is a good story for a sports anime though, it is still a pretty typical story for a shounen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a really good series that can be enjoyed by anybody regardless of if they're a sports fan or not. Really good art/animation, great soundtrack, GREAT cast of characters, but suffers from the fact that the story is typical shounen. \\n\\n\r\nRecap: \\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10 (amazing soundtrack)\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 (definitely the best part of the show)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Are you looking for a sports anime that's coherent, realistic, and handles the sport it features properly? If yes, stay far away from Kuroko no Basket. On the other hand, if you are looking something that's flashy, cool, funny, and couldn't give any less of a shit about stuff like logic and plot execution, this anime is for you.\r\nKuroko no Basket suffers from a very wide variety of problems. Depending on how much these problems bother you personally, your enjoyment of this anime will be affected from a bit to a lot. The pacing is bad, the plot progression is arbitrarily forced, the characters tendto be lackluster (with some exceptions), it is completely unrealistic but pretends it isn't, which is annoying, it is utterly incoherent, and finally, it makes no fucking sense.\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything mentioned above, I wouldn't say it's bad anime overall. Its main redeeming quality is that it is funny. When it tries to be funny, it usually succeeds. There are also occasions when it is unintentionally funny due to overflowing stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nHow much you are going to enjoy this anime depends a lot on how much you think about it. The more you think about it, the more it falls apart. But if you are just looking for mindless entertainment, this is a good fit. There's no shame in that.",

            "content": "\"Why would I watch 5 high school boys run around and play basketball? How interesting can basketball REALLY be?\" - Me, before watching Kuroko no Basket. First of all, I had no previous liking to basketball, so when my friend suggested this anime to me, I turned it down. With some pestering, I finally watched it and wow...\r\nHigh school sports and borderline super powers, Kuroko no Basket has to now be one of my favorite animes. A series that consistently sticks to its story from the first episode to the last. I'm writing this review after finishing the 3rd season, so I hope to dodgeas much spoiler material I can but give you enough to watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts where high school basketball team, Seirin, recruit some new players including 2 prodigies: Kagami Taiga and Tetsuya Kuroko. As you would expect, it revolves around this team playing basketball while facing numerous challenges along the way. The biggest challenge - the members of the generation of miracles. Beware, these guys play basketball at a whole new level of the game with skills that could be called super powers, Kuroko no Basket has to be the king of exaggeration when it comes to basketball abilities. Along with the game, the story (being a shonen anime) is also about friendship and overcoming obstacles through the power of it. For me, it has the perfect blend of drama, comedy, and action. The sort that is suitable for all ages and whether or not you're a fan of basketball.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are very good, from the vibrant colors to the angles used to show the game. I personally think the art style is perfect for this show and thankfully, it remains the same throughout the 3 seasons. The sound effects and soundtracks also compliment the visuals. You have the typical basketball sounds (bounces, net swishes, sneaker screeches etc.) and the BGM that suits the situation perfectly, immersing you into the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThere is so much diversity when it comes to characters. There are multiple teams you will come to know and most of them have a character or two you will become familiar with. The generation of miracles stand out from the rest in terms of uniqueness, but that doesn't overshadow the others. Each of these characters have a distinctive look to them, as well as personality and traits. Even when it comes down to playing styles! Of all the animes that I have seen, this one has to offer the largest variety of characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that taken in, I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 seasons. The first episode set the tone and I couldn't stop watching until I had finished the 2nd season (the 3rd wasn't released yet) and for the sake of keeping the momentum going between episodes, I let the 3rd season finish because I couldn't bear waiting another week to see what happens next. It was one of those ones I just wanted to watch as much as I could in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nI rated this season an overall of 10, purely because the concept was so unique and I was taken back by how entertaining they made basketball. I also questioned how long could they keep it up, I mean \"how interesting can basketball REALLY be\"? Well, they managed to keep it fresh through to the end and I would give it a collected rating of 9/10. That being somewhere in the better half of 9 too.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR - If you're looking for an easy to watch, entertaining shonen anime with great characters and a strong story line, then look no further. You don't even have to have extensive knowledge or be a fan of basketball to enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\nReviewers message: This is my second review, I really hope this helps! Though I wrote exactly what came to mind, I know there are ways to improve my reviews, so feedback would be appreciated very much :) Thank you!",

            "content": "Kuroko no Basuke is a great anime, worth watching 100%. Honestly, for someone who never liked sports anime, I enjoyed it thoroughly as it had this mix of shounen with sports. It was pretty intense, the viewer constantly getting into it because of the non-stop action and those sick (in a good way) techniques the characters used. Compared to a normal basketball game, it was relatively more vivid and vibrant, without losing the realistic parts of the actual sport. \r\nAs for the story line, in one word; amazing. On one hand lays the outstanding plot on the other, the deeper meaning, friendship and teamwork, akait wasn't just a bunch of good-looking guys playing basketball, fan servicing to the fullest. Compared to other anime I've watched, this one has the least fan service so far. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great, it gave the characters a breath of reality. The music, which is always important, was a thumbs-up too, not only because it was nice but also because the right track popped up on the right moment, accompanying and enhancing it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were unique in their own ways, each and every one of them having a serious side, sometimes even scary but they never lost a chance to act goofy and silly. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I liked this anime very much and I enjoyed watching it, because it was very interesting and the plot was evolving in a short period of time, however it wasn't overwhelming and disappointing. They took an all-time classic sport like basketball and turned it into a something like an actual fight of skills and spirit. Magnificent job. And the skills each character had was unique, the story never repeating itself like it happens in many anime/manga. For all these reasons mentioned above, the total points this anime gets from me are 9.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, I hope it was helpful.",

            "content": "Before I get started, let me say that this review is definitely subject to change. Mainly due to that fact that I had to voice my opinion on a really enjoyable anime, I'm writing this before the series is over. I know, writing a review on a series before it's finished reviewing is taboo; however I really feel that this anime needs more recognition. Mainly, I'm here to help those people who can't decide on whether they should watch this anime or not. Trust me, you not going to get  an accurate feel for what you should expect from this anime after just readingthe synopsis. \\n\\n\r\nJust so you know, I'm not a big basketball fan. If I had to decide, I'd say I don't like basketball. I rarely even watch a game and find little to no enjoyment from playing the sport. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying this anime. For those of you who have watched \"Hikaru no Go\" or \"Prince of Tennis\", you already know that you don't necessarily have to understand an anime to enjoy it. This is even more true in sports anime; in fact, it might even be more enjoyable because you can learn a little while having fun.\\n\\n\r\n To say the least, your going to have a lot of fun watching this anime. Heck, I might have had the most fun watching this anime out of all the series I  have watched, mainly because I thought it was the perfect length for a sports anime. A lot of times you'll notice that sports anime are very long; which a lot of the time makes them very tedious. For me, a prime example would have to be Prince of Tennis. To cut a long story short, it's too long. Spanning 178 episodes, you can already see what I mean. Sure, being over 100 episodes long has worked well for several popular series, and in fact, most of them are still running. Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, and Inuyasha are several of the mainstream anime that span over 100 episodes, and most of them are still immensely popular. So why doesn't it work for series like Prince of Tennis? Because they're sports anime. And one thing you'll notice after watching sports anime is repetition, and lots of it. I mean, how could there not be? There are only 2 ways a sports anime will end, in a win or a loss. I've yet to see a tie, and hell, I've never even seen a loss. Sure, you can change the way they accomplish their goal, but the end result is the same. Even if you change the methods, you're still limited in a sports anime. There are only so many different ways to change the methods. More true than in almost any other sport, basketball is honestly not that flashy. To get around a defender, it usually doesn't require immense ball handling skills, but usually comes down to speed in the end. Which is where I get into my next point.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen a lot of reviews done by (I assume) basketball players ranting on and on about how \"unrealistic\" this show is. And yes, I do agree with them, a lot of this stuff is unrealistic. But no, I do not agree with them on their opinion that this downgrades the quality of this show; mainly because of how awesome some of the stuff they did was. Without this aspect of sports anime, no one would watch them. Every sports anime is over exaggerated. Do you want to watch someone practice something to only watch them miss over and over again? No. That's why it's over exaggerated. Sure, no one can make every basket they shoot. No one. Sure, the idea of running by moving your arms and legs at the same time in sync is completely ridiculous, but that's okay. You want to know why? Because it's fun. Because it's interesting. And because it makes for one hell of an enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\n Let me just say that the art in this show is really good, if not amazing. You're really going to get sucked in by the awesome effects done to the dunking and passing in this anime. Even the characters always looked crisp and ready to go, which is what usually lacks in sports anime. Mainly while trying to emphasis the background elements that help emphasis the importance of a dunk or 3 pointer, the writers forget that they also have a character there. This usually leaves the characters looking a little... well, dumb. Sure, some of it is a little unrealistic, but who can't deal with a little exaggeration?\\n\\n\r\nI kind of brushed up on it earlier, but you're going to have a lot of fun watching this anime. Why? Let me tell you. First, the synopsis is complete rubbish. Possibly one of the worst I've ever read. Let me clear a few things up for you before we start. Kagami is the main character and has just returned from America and is disappointed at the difference in the skill level between America and Japan. He decides to join his schools basketball team and eventually hears about \"the generation of miracles.\" He becomes excited when he learns that one of his teammates, Kuroko, was a starter for the same team as the Generation of Miracles. He finally gets the chance to play him, but figure out that he actually sucks! Very disappointed, he continues to go to practice. Finally they play a little practice game between the upperclassmen and he figures out that Kuroko is a MASTER at passing. He realizes that they can go far together and realizes at the same time that the Generation of Miracles is, in fact, strong. Loving nothing more than a challenge, Kagami and Kuroko lead their team to the top.\\n\\n\r\nFun. That's all this anime is, is fun. If you're in an \"anime slump\", as I call them, and can't seem to find an anime you can finish without getting bored, then this anime is definitely for you. Having been in a slump until just the other day, I can tell you for certain that this is the perfect remedy for a slump. Even if you're not in a slump and are just looking for a fun anime that is somewhat mainstream but still a overall great show, look no further, because your knight in shining armor is here. You may have noticed that my overall is only a mere 8, but that's only because I haven't seen the end yet. As I said before, this review is subject to change. Heck, if this show pulls a gold bar out of its ass, it might even get a 10. Sure, that's not perfect on any scale but that would mean that this is a damn good anime. Not enough can I emphasize the fact that you should not drop this anime simply because it focuses on basketball. I've been guilty of this mistake and I can tell you now that I fully regret my actions. Even if you absolutely hate basketball, don't put this show off without giving it a try. If you do, you'll simply be wasting a chance at watching 25 episodes of pure enjoyment.",

            "content": "Kuroko no Basket is a tough one for me. \r\nIt's the first sports anime i have ever watched. I had always avoided sport anime because I felt they were too unrealistic. \r\nI'd heard a lot about it and finally decided to try something new. After finishing the first season I felt that it was ok but not the amazing show many people made it out to be. \r\nStory: the story overall I gave a 5. It's pretty much about some guy named Taiga Kagami trying to beat \"the generation of miracles\". In this aspect it played out like an unoriginal shonen anime. This was totallyfine as i wan't necessarily expecting the most well written story coming into it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was really good. I gave it an 8. The animation for various players as they moved around the court was pretty good and added a lot of excitement to the action. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I gave it a 7. Not much to say. I found the music enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This was the shows weakest point. Giving it a 3 was probably a bit nice. It would have gotten worse if it weren't for the personality of Kuroko. The characters are all so bland. Theres little to no back story given beyond \"this person used to play with the generation of miracles\" or \"this person grew up in America\". Kagami was your typical headstrong main character who wants to be the best. The worst part about the characters overall was their lack of basketball skills in general. THE MAIN CHARACTER SUCKS AT BASKETBALL! And no it's not like one of those \"oh i'll improve and become the best\"  Kuroko just sucks...but that's the point. It was so stupid. Why make him the main character if he's going to do nothing but pass. He literally doesn't even dribble the ball. Not once. He just does tap passes. It's painful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6. It's your typical shonen anime with a basketball twist. If you like shonen you'll like it. If not stay away. Nothing else to say. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: it was fair. Not good but not bad. Thankfully it wasnt so mediocre it didnt stand out at all. It's watchable. Definitely way over-hyped though.  If you like basketball, shonen anime, and have some time to kill this is your show. Turn it on while doing homework or surfing the internet. It's got 51 total episodes to give you plenty of background noise while working on other things.",

However the part I loved the most was all the different types of characters. Being part of a team means having to play with many different types of people and this show exposes many different archetypes to the viewers. The most obvious one being the 2 main characters (Kuroko and Kagami being total opposites). If you ever played basketball, that should just one more reason to watch this great anime.",

            "content": "A friendship driven sport series executed superbly, and a great setting to match. The supernatural element makes Kuroko no Basket exciting, intense, and loads of fun. What sets this series apart from the other basketball series is the focus on five extraordinary individuals in their respective teams.\r\nSport genres tend to have very strong characters developments. The wide range of personalities in this series is both inspiring and entertaining. Character developments are good, underdogs working hard and doing their best to achieve a dream hits everyone\u2019s soft spot.\r\nKagami is your \u201ceverything is possible\u201d hero. He carries the series and the viewers\u2019 hopes. The partnership of Kagamiand Kuroko grows throughout, but with obstacles in between; you will see happy times as well as sad times. Personality-wise, Kuroko doesn\u2019t shine. Yet, when he is on screen, the viewers are made to expect something unusual to happen in a comical manner, or if on the basketball court, some sort of impressive display. Kagami and Kuroko bring out the best of each other both on and off the basketball court; if they were lone characters in separate series, both would have been incomplete. The biggest character developments lie in the \u201cmiracle generation\u201d members. We see different sides to their personalities. Their skills develop and their behaviours change; viewers will love them, hate them, and possibly love them again. The support players in the top teams are great supports. They don\u2019t steal the show, but are entertaining enough on their own; everyone has their own goals and pride. Character interactions are realistically captured, often humorous. Every player from the \u201cMiracle Generation\u201d has an exclusive past, and a strong will. They all want to be the best, work hard to achieve what they think they rightfully deserve. It is a battle of kings. There are good uses of flashbacks revealing some past of \u201cThe Miracle Generation\u201d, to thrill the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nExaggerated facial expressions and narrow eyes make many characters look very similar but in different coloured wigs. Some of Kagami\u2019s behaviours remind me much of Sakuragi from Slam Dunk. Basketball movements are fluid. Like all other basketball series, the camera angles show us different perspectives, but also like the others, lots of screen time has characters standing still, listening to their thoughts/dialogues, and camera focusing on the bench, away from the actual game. Also, slow motions galore. Recycled basketball moves and situations were never nice to look at, and some humour was a bit dry. The art might feel slightly outdated on first sight, but it works and does grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are great. The basketball nettings, dribbles, and feet frictions against the polished floors are well done. Background soundtracks are varied, lots of techno during games to get viewers high. Seiyuu have no problem to convey different moods of the characters in the appropriate situations.\\n\\n\r\nThe main strengths of this show are its action scenes on the court, the suspense and thrill of each basket, and the risk of losing. But the other main themes certainly don\u2019t lag behind, that is the team bonding, friendship, and trust. The players from the \u201cGeneration of Miracles\u201d are ridiculously strong, they can do inhuman actions on a basketball court, making each and every one of them feared and sought after by every college team in the country. Not all the players of \u201cGeneration of Miracles\u201d were shown at the same time. Each character was fed to the viewer gradually, each individual is a new obstacle to conquer, and knowing there are stronger opponents after each wall helps build up the excitement and wonderment.\\n\\n\r\nThe action will light a fire in your heart; it doesn\u2019t wait for you, they are blink and miss. This is the pace you can expect from the series. Some sequences will make you want to rewind and watch again, not necessarily because you missed them the first time, but because they were awesome and needs to be re-watched to believe.\\n\\n\r\nAs a feel good sport series, some results might be predictable. But if who wins is perceivable, might as well make the way it approaches that prominent final score as extravagant as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this if you like Slam Dunk.\\n\\n",

I'd say Kuroko no Basuke has more of a supernatural aspect of basketball, where as Slam Dunk's there were alot of episodes focusing on fundamentals. This is isn't a bad thing actually it's what make this anime stand out.\r\nStory~9\r\nThe anime isn't finished so I can't say how it's going to sway my opinion on how good the story is, but for now from what I've watched it's been great. I like the fact that the story has a fast pace is never bores youas the story progresses you'll always be on your feet wondering what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nArt~ 8 \\n\r\nThe characters are made pretty well actually. Very lively looking settings and characters nothing is ever dull.\\n\\n\r\nSound~7\\n\r\nWell not the best or the worst, but hey we came for the story right I mean I've watched alot of animes where it had a great sound track, but the story lacked like Guilty Crown I find that in the end the story will sway your overall score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~9\\n\r\nThis is another aspect where Kuroko no Basuke excels. I like how all characters have a certain ability where the are good at. I expected there to be a team where everyone is great at all aspects, but the charcters in this anime are balanced. Kuroko is a passer/pg and Kagami is an inside man plays the post game. Sure there abilities aren't realistic, but it sure is fun to watch them pass the ball like it's a beam of energy and dunk from the free throw line. Besides thier skills the characters also have thier certain personalities, Kuroko is a passive/agressive person mostly all nice until something that makes him snap makes him mad. Kagami is more of an aggressive type of person who doesn't like to loose who's spirit can never be crushed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~10\\n\r\nHonestly I love this anime it's so awesome well, I play basketball a lot so that's the reason, even so I'd recommend this to anyone like I said earlier it's not the typical sports anime it's more supernatural than anything, well regardless if you're a sports fan or a person who likes action you'll fall in love with this anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Among all the middle schools and high schools there are in Japan, there is one said to have an unbelievably strong Basketball team unlike any other before them, Teiko middle school's \"Generation of Miracles\", the next all stars of the Basketball sport, each one gifted in a different area of the sport, although there has said to have only been five members, there was also a rumored \"phantom sixth\"...\r\nKuroko's Basketball is an ingenious series that divulges into the sport of Basketball itself, explaining its inner workings and how the characters of the series take the sport to almost superhuman degrees, one could say akin tohow battle themed series develop over the courses of their respective sagas...\\n\\n\r\nThe main themes of Kuroko's Basketball are teamwork, a person's love for a sport they are good at and the drive to surpass those with great talent and skill, Kuroko's Basketball focuses on a young man named Tetsuya Kuroko who is in actuality the rumored phantom sixth of Teiko middle school's legendary Basketball team, the Generation of Miracles.\\n\\n\r\nUpon graduating from middle school, each of the six members belonging to the miracles went to a different high school each, in order to be able to meet one another, as rivals on the court with Kuroko being no exception.\\n\\n\r\nIt is when Kuroko applies for the Seirin high school's Basketball team that his story truly begins, as he learns to befriend a certain teammate of his named Taiga Kagami and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas Kuroko is bland and doesn't stand out, Kagami is hyperactive and takes center stage on Seirin's team, as its new ace but its only through his interactions with Kuroko that both Kagami and Kuroko together learn to work, as a team alongside their other new teammates, as they take on many challengers wanting to prove both their skill and worth on the court.\\n\\n\r\nLearning and growing through each match they face, its not too long before Serin's Basketball team comes to odds and heads to heads with the teams that the other Generation of Miracles members decided to join, through successes and errors, Seirin now takes on the miracles themselves in order to prove they themselves the best, however, its not so easy, as simply just stating it, in order to beat their rivals, they are going to have to take their current levels in Basketball to extremes, especially against the opponents they are facing:\\n\\n\r\nRyota Kise of Kaijo, Shintaro Midorima of Shutoku, Daiki Aomine of Too, Atsushi Murasakibara of Yosen and finally last but especially not least, Seijuro Akashi of Rakuzan.\\n\\n\r\nThese 5 are considered the Generation of Miracles, the best of the best...of the best and Kagami has now made it his mission to defeat all 5 of them, wanting to gain worthy challenges from worthy adversaries...\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kuroko while he too wishes to defeat the miracles, it appears that there is something more then meets the eye...either way, Kuroko, Kagami and the rest of Seirin's Basketball team are determined to reach the top and will defeat all opposition along the way, that is the will behind their strength that is the key to victory.\\n\\n\r\nKuroko's Basketball teaches one about their love for sport, the reasons why they started playing it and why they continue doing so, it also teaches one about how a person can over time because of one reason or another lose that love that got them into their favorite sport and then start seeing said sport, as more of a chore or obligation to uphold...\\n\\n\r\nIn one sense of the term, Kuroko's Basketball could definitely almost be viewed, as a battle Manga/Anime series using sport, as its central theme and \"means of fighting\", including how the series has many rivals the protagonists have to go up against before reaching the very end.\\n\\n\r\nUtmost praise goes towards the strong characterization Kuroko's Basketball has, namely towards its central characters-Kuroko, Kagami and the Generation of Miracles, each of them having different ambitions to one another that keeps them going and moving forwards towards what lies ahead for them.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the majority of the series focused on Basketball, there are comedy moments that could make viewers laugh out loud and if it can even be considered romance, there are very small showings of potential shippings between certain characters in the series.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall deserve high praise, a lot of detail and work went into the characters that make up most of Kuroko's Basketball's success, \"a battle Anime outside of a battle Anime\", that is probably the best way to describe this series, it never fails in its showings of official Basketball games between rivals to get adrenaline pumping when you pour yourself into the series and feel like your a part of it, rooting for the team you want to win badly, upon watching this series, that's how i know the characters feel in those win or lose moments, trying to get the very last score right at the very end, i can certainly promise you now, Kuroko's Basketball is certainly an entertaining watch and it might just surprise you, its a probability and possibility at best but still, again...it might just surprise you.\\n\\n\r\nHere's hoping this Review was helpful in any way, Kuroko's Basketball is definitely a good way to start an interest in Basketball itself.",

            "content": "I finished this anime in about a day, if that tells you anything. \r\nI'm going to start off with the negatives first since there are so few. Firstly, the openings and endings weren't as strong as they could've been, in my opinion. The first opening in particular was good, but after that, it was pretty average. The art was also slightly above average, but nothing too special. Although, some of the shots can look pretty awesome. Other than that, I can't really say much that can be improved with this anime. It isn't so brilliant that I'll be thinking about it when I go tosleep (as I have done with anime like Haikyuu!! and Free!), but I also can't rate it anything under a 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe good parts of this anime can be found all over. First of all, the storytelling is fairly solid. Not a lot of holes can be found in a given character's motive or drive. The characters themselves are very well written and voiced, making it difficult to not love them. Even if you don't fall head over heels for them somehow or if they're a character that you're meant to hate, you'll still enjoy watching them because they are so dynamic. I think more than anything else, the characters are what really excel in this anime. The make it shine.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned a few anime earlier in this review, and if you're interested in those anime, you'll probably like this one. It may not have as much of an impact as those others, but I imagine you'll have a hard time giving it an average ranking, too.",

All the characters are cliches and eventhe ones who aren't, make themselves into bs cliches. My favorite character is a dog that occasionally appears and it is cute. the dog is the reason I am rating the characters as a (3/10) instead of a 1 or 2. Also made enjoyment go from 2 to a (3/10), same for overall, which rated as a (2/10). The story is there I guess but there no tension. All the show is are basketball games, which makes sense for a basketball show but it means ZERO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. people get better because they will themselves to, not because of a training camp or anything.

I started watching the Kuroko in my 2nd year of college, Yes I am from India and I did Engineering. I watched all the 50 episodes in the week that time. So yes, this is a great anime to watch.\r\nI don't watch much anime (only watched DEATH NOTE, NARUTO), I don't have any idea why Kuruko is not so popular as other anime. But I believe once you start watching it, it be gone more interesting and interesting. \r\nMain character here is Kuroko, with verylow physical strength and body. But only reason he plays basket is because of his love for basketball. That's the whole point of this series, to tell people do what you want and do a lot and lots of practice to achieve it. I believe in raw talent but if you work hard you can surpass the raw talent.\\n\\n\r\nIts not center about single characters, there are more strong character in the anime, kuroko is all about team work and friendship. \\n\\n\r\npoint is: \"We support each other thats why we are a team\".\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m not a fan of most sports, nor do I partake in anything of that nature. I\u2019m like the main character from Hyouka, I prefer to conserve energy rather than spend it unnecessarily. So for someone like me to like a sports show it has to be special in some way. If I was to add one specific series to the title of Kuroko no Basket to emphasize how different it is from actual basketball I would call it Dragonball Z no Basket.\r\nStory\r\nIt\u2019s what you come to expect of a sports anime, there is no overlying plot other than winning. The protagonists want to winand the antagonists are an obstacle obstructing this goal. It\u2019s not something so original like the characters playing basketball and whichever team loses, forfeits their lives. So the only real thing that drags Kuroko no Basket down from being a topnotch anime is the overlying plot just because of how generic it is. They explain all basketball terms in a way that it sounds a bit ridiculous at times, it feels like I\u2019m watching someone explain a magical power in some action/adventure anime but it\u2019s a sport. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAll four the openings for both seasons are great, I listened to them every time. The first ending was very memorable for me as I can recall it right now and I watched the series four months ago, the other endings were somewhat good but I usually skipped them to start the next episode because I\u2019m a binge watcher. All voices fit the characters well and no one has a voice that makes me cringe, so that\u2019s a plus.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nMain Antagonists and Protagonists have very distinct character designs in the way that their hair color seems to be modeled after the power rangers. Everyone else for the most part has the hair color you would picture an average Japanese high school student to have, and then you\u2019ve got the pink and green hair? Character designs are nice to look at and the animation is done very well, though the second season does bring out some of the greatest animation I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist who the show is named (Kuroko) after is quite unique for a sports anime, because he actually sucks at sports. It\u2019s nice to see someone go outside the box for once and make a protagonist who doesn\u2019t excel at the particular focus of the show. The other protagonist Kagami is your typical hotshot sports player, nothing special he does develop throughout the show into more of a team player but we all see that coming. But this show gives the majority of their side characters plenty of screen time and the antagonists do get a decent amount of development and don\u2019t stay one dimensional sports super stars.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThis show is freaking hilarious, I never thought a sports anime could manage to be this funny. The jokes are so well done I wonder if the script writer is a comedian. The basketball games which are the majority of the anime, are very entertaining and since they are the majority of the anime I wasn\u2019t ever bored. You don\u2019t need to know anything about basketball because this anime will explain all the concepts to make it sound animey.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s good, not the best but in my opinion a very solid series. I\u2019m not a fan of sports anime so I just can\u2019t rate this very high, but that\u2019s just me and my non-sporty self. \\n",

            "content": "\"What makes an anime great and fun to watch is its uniqueness and unexpectedness and this goes to show that Japan can or cannot fail to amuse me.\"\r\n                   Before I gather my conclusions and opinions about this show, I will give you my first impressions on Kuroko no Basket. This show aired in our country and I wasn't interested because I thought it was some dumb copy-cat show and it just made a Slam-Dunk imitation. Basketball is a serious sport and it shouldn't be wasted on stupidityand I thought it was only about handsome men and their show-off skills to seduce girls or something. My friends wanted me to watch it because it is informative and a good show. I, on the other hand, couldn't bring myself to watch this piece of crap and I don't want to witness this unworthy impersonating anime. Alas, it was Christmas Break and I was thirsty and hungry for some anime.. and as funny as its sounds, my hatred turned into curiosity.  \\n\\n\r\n                   For starters, an anime could be realistic and unrealistic but this one has both. People could say that a show is a show unless its hypothetical  and people would be mad about this anime because it is not like the basketball matches we see on NBA and other basketball programs, It has some sort of twists and turns. I can't imagine myself trying to watch this, at first .. okay a blue-haired guy and a tall, masculine red haired guy joining forces to be the best in Japan.. that sound simple but their journey on how to get there is simply exquisite and reasonably awesome. Anything can happen and even if the story is quite simple for the reason that the main character wants to be the best basketball player/team  in Japan and so on this is actually the same story as the other top rated anime have. Naruto : he wants to be the best ninja in japan. Yakitate Japan: the best bread or make the national bread in Japan. Soul Eater: to become the death scythe of grim reaper. They all have different goals and every main character has those stories but the path to get to that aim is very exciting and I'm sure you guys will enjoy this show as much as the other popular animes out there. Last, don't give that unrealistic bullshit around here, these basketball players will blow your mind and in anime, anything can happen so shut your freakin' mouth and watch this.\\n\\n\r\n                        The drawing is pretty good. It is in HD, it is modern and I think I saw this art somewhere but this one is outstanding. The hair colors are different which is easier to see which character is playing, talking or being pointed at. the artist made a good job in creating distinct hair styles and colors.\\n\\n\r\n                        The sound is outstanding, I can't help but feel that athletic mood when I hear the music and the OST has that dash of rock, melody, a bit of piano?(was that piano?) and so on. There were suspense soundtracks which nailed every scene. The anime is pretty lively so expect that the music may give you that adrenaline rush kind of feeling.\\n\\n\r\n                        Characters were very good. There were incredible personalities which I've seen in every character. Kuroko is a bit light headed, calm, and emotionless sometimes. Kagami is really hot-headed, will-spirited, scary, tough and competitive guy. Sometimes I feel like there were yaoi scenes and they really make a good couple :D. Well, that's the only hint I can give you guys because you need to watch more of it to know the surprises and stories behind each player and character.\\n\\n\r\n                         I had this good feeling when watching this show, feeling of enjoyment, excitement, greatness, and my expressions were indescribable. ecchi moments were actually uncomfortable but you know.. it's Japan they like those stuff so I think I can handle those.... Ecchi moments. Every game has many surprises and I believe that people can have good feedback about this show.\\n\\n\r\n                        Overall this anime is good. You can watch it during your past time and continue to live that experience. Watching this anime not only gave me entertainment but it linked me to have trust, friendship and hope. Sometimes we only watch anime in order to have something to watch or to enjoy but little did we know there are lessons behind these shows. I know I'm being corny but believe me.. this show is that good. \\n",

            "content": "I'm not a big fan of sport animes but one thing is sure I do like very much basketball. The reason i started to watch Kuroko No Basket was because my friends were arguing many times about this anime and how comic it is. Sure there are things the are impossible to do in basket like send the presence to somewhere else or even make unseeing blocks/cuts. But the physics of the anime are very simliar to real life. Like some people say that is impossible to make those Midorima throws or even those Kuroko full court passes. One thing is sure...You couldnt be morewrong. It is possible to make those throws and passes, not like them for sure it acquires more tecnique and strength. I played nacional basketball on my country and my old teammate who were a base always could make me a full court pass when i was alone counter attacking. Another teammate i had could score half court many times. Just for the record we only lose one game with that strategy, it was very efficient. But hey!! Its an anime ;D! Its supposed to show us things we liked to do in real life if it was possible...And its because that surprises and uncapable things that grabs us on the sit to watch them. Criticize its easy...When you are capable of doing better you can say whatever you want ;). If you dont like just drop it and forget it. People who like an anime will never like your bad criticism so just shut your mouth xD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND KUROKO NO BASKET!",

To me this anime doesn't even come close.\r\n I really hate the unrealistic part of it but what I hate most is that even when it's unrealistic their \"special moves\" are really lacking. If you think about it, most of the moves are about the disappearance of the ball or of a person in front of the person playing against them, but everyone watching also see them disappearing from the court! Also, a lot of times you see someone thinking of something and people wouldalways answer as if they heard it. \\n\\n\r\nI've seen a lot of sports anime that I liked which were also unrealistic but this one is just too lacking. The humor wasn't that good either.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I really liked was that girls in this anime are strong for once. The Japanese really love the weak female character that is just too annoying, but it was a surprise to see that all of the female characters were strong in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nThe initial idea of the MC being great at passing is new and unique. It just wasn't executed well.",

            "content": "Kuroko no Basket, a shounen sports anime. \r\nIt's a very hyped up anime and I can see why is that so. Many recommendation from friends, many facebook pages of this anime and it's ranking here compelled me to check it out. I had high expectations of this sports anime while watching it and I must say, I was not disappointed. It gives the exact feeling and atmosphere a sports anime should have.\r\nThe fast paced action and drive pumps you up while watching this anime. Even though it's all about sports, that's not what happens all the time. Side arcs are really fun to watch andthe comedy is pretty nice. I'm glad I started this anime and plan to watch it till the end. So, let's get down with the review;\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10:\\n\r\nThe Generation of Miracles, a group of 6 legendary middle school students who excel at basketball and each one of them graduates from middle school and goes to play for his own high school. \\n\r\nKagami Taiga, a high school student from America is a first year student at Seiren High and joins the basketball club alongwith Kuroko Tetsuya. Practice, games, wins and losses are all part of the story. Kagami is determined to beat every one of the Generation of Miracles and therefore, teams up with Kuroko and the Seiren High Basketball club to win the Inter-High Championship.\\n\r\nThis season concentrates on 4 of the GoM and the Inter High Title. It is as you would expect from a shounen anime; facing strong opponents, getting backed into a corner and then suddenly coming out of top. Though, it is quite as expected, the games take really quick turns and one can't help but stay excited during the games.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10:\\n\r\nThe characters, especially the players each have their own unique ability. The GoM are especially well made. Each having his own personality and ability. Can't really say I hate any of them since all of them are awesome in their own aspects. And some girls in the series freshen things up otherwise it would've been too plain.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe art is really good for this anime, no doubt. The reason I gave it a 7 because of the shadow lines under the chins and faces. When you look at them closely, the characters look pretty strange, like aliens or something. Once seen, it's hard to unsee. I remember looking at the characters strange because of those shadows. But if you overlook that and take it for the effect it is meant to give, it isn't that bad. Apart from that, the art is really good. All characters are pretty well designed and you can't complain that it had bad art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nNothing special, nothing bad. The opening or ending weren't worth listening to everytime and weren't so bad that you would regret listening to them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nThe games got me excited, the comedy made me laugh, the characters were good to see, everything was enjoyable. The games are by far the most enjoyable aspect(duh). The fast paced games get your blood pumping. Quick change of flow and awesome techniques leave you amazed. It was definitely an enjoyable watch and I was able to complete the first season in one day without getting bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is well worth it's reputation and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch some fast paced, hyper anime that gets your blood pumping alongwith some laughs.",

But really, Kuroko no basket is an entertaining anime that will always have you wondering what will happen next.  It's not like most sports anime because this one has mother fukking super powers.  This just adds to the excitement like when Kuroko kamme hamme has the ball down the court and it kills someone.  This anime also has great animation overall.  The shading will seem a bit strange when youstart with the thick black lines, but you will get used to it.  This anime isn't going to make you think about philosophies of humanity or something like Parasyte attempts to do.  This anime gets right down to the damn point. Basketball.  Super powers.

It has many different players with their own interesting pasts and cool styles of play.  The styles, while absolutely are unrealistic, serve to make this show extremely interesting to see what style ultimately prevails over another. \r\nThe beginning of the show definitely made this concept clear, and definitely caught my attention, but the middle of the show started to become a little too formulaic for my liking.  However, after a certain event occurs (no spoilers here)the final part of the season (the last 7 episodes or so) were phenomenal.  I unsure in the middle if i wanted to continue on to the second season and continue on with Seirin High School as they go to the winter tournament, but after that ending I can absolutely say I will be watching it in the future... probably while I'm at school.  Can't wait.\\n\\n\r\nSentence:  Also, this show is really funny at times.",

            "content": "You like basketball? You like anime? If you like the following, then damn sure you will like this anime, a lot.\r\nUsually, all sports anime have one thing in common with all of their stories, and that is to be the best in that sport. This anime is one of the many other anime that have done really well sticking to its story. Even if there was a filler, it was because that parts of the story may have been needed to be explained. There isn't a lot of dragging,  but I am annoyed at the fact that one quarter of a match is 1or more episodes. If you watch and play basketball, like I do, then you would be surprised at what the players can do. Some of them can shoot from the backcourt, some having the ability to fly up in the air or maybe copying an opponent's move without practicing it. Yes it sounds crazy, but if you were watching a basketball anime, you'd like to see something unexpected. If you don't like watching superhuman powers, then you might as well just watch an NBA game. Also, if you know the rules of basketball, then you would be angry at screaming at a player that does a travel and it isn't called.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the art style in the anime gets progressively better each season. The animation is quite smooth but it gets progressively smoother and smoother, with more abilities being revealed from each character. The colours of their hair may seem unnatural, but hey, this is anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was probably one of the main factors in this anime and the reason why this anime succeeded. The soundtracks that play actually engage your emotions and give you goosebumps. I was shaking because of how epic a match was! I also liked most of the OP and ED. It was really catchy for me.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, there weren't any characters that I disliked at all, even if they were an antigonist. Each character was very unique and had their own unique abilities. The GoM were introduced as a scary and overpowered, but once they are defeated, they show their weak or good side, making them likeable. The character development in the anime wasn't too rushed. If they wanted to train their abilities, it isn't just a POOF and here is a godly power where you stop time and block every shot. They work hard and have a hardworking ability. Also, this anime shows that the protagonist always wins in some situations.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. A cousin of mine showed me this anime and since that day, I was really addicted to this anime. I would be shaking if there was an epic scene in anime. This anime also made me go back to playing basketball, so thanks Kuroko.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10. There are a lot of cliff hangers in the anime, but that's more of a reason to continue watching. Would I re-watch this? Yes, I would love to.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kuroko no basket is a sport anime. It may seem boring to watch an anime about a sport if you do not like sports, but at the same time it's not only about the sport itself. It has a great focus on the bonding between the players of each team and it also teaches a lesson, to never give up.\r\nThe above phrase describes the whole anime pretty well. The characters want something, they have a gold which they want to complete together and, truth be told, that's the only way to do it. There is trust amongst them and they each believe in each otheras well. \\n\\n\r\nEven when everything seem lost, even when they do lose, they always manages to move forward. They cry, and they get disappointed but, they also have been through a lot, and not only at the current time. They have a history, and they carry a lot. All those things are what makes them take another step forward. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the sport funs, Kuroko no basket may seem more fictional than realistic but, it's not such a bad thing. Because it shows all the great moments of basket in every game, it's more interesting and you get hooked easier. It's intense, the andrenaline is seriously high -and I am not talking about the players'- and there is always the desire for more. \\n\\n\r\nWhile watching season 1, it's expected to gradually consider the possibility that it cannot go further, that it cannot be better. Well, IT CAN. It always manages to become more awesome, it always manages to go one level up. You see something and you say that's it, that move can't become better, that one player doesn't have a move to defeat the other's player team, this whole thing is over. But, there is always more. Even if one team cannot win, the players always improve. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, the main team is one, Seirin, but it also shows the other teams. It shows their hopes, their ways, their practices... You end up not being able to take one side but with contradicting feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime seriously worths the time spending to watch it, even reading the manga. All three seasons are especialy good. They are epic -and I am not exagerrating-.",

Then be sure to add this anime into your list of faves.\r\nI've read the manga and I can say that the anime is doing good. Or more over I'm starting to love it more than the manga.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nWell the anime is still sticking with the manga so I'm really happy with that. \r\nThe first episode will immediately grab your heart away. It's unique on its own. Will remind you of Slam Dunk because ofthe setting and comedy. But nope. Even though they have the same element which is Basketball, they still have different storyline.  And I think the way they play the game is much realistic compared to Slam Dunk. No slow motion movements or reminiscing about the past when they're about to shoot the ball or something.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't believe that the animation of this anime is uber awesome. Yes! The character (Especially Kuroko and Kise) looks totally awesome and cool! The art of the manga is really nice already.. but the animation of this anime is just really good. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAwesome opening and ending songs. Even the background musics are really good. You can really feel the \"heat\" of the game.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI love all the characters. The protagonist, Kuroko, is not your typical \"hero\" in the anime. Even Kagami. These two are really made for each other. Putting aside my fangirlness, I didn't mean it in a yaoi way. What I mean is, their tandem is really good.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has a \"personality\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI totally enjoy it even though I've only watched 4 episodes so far. Well I've read the manga, but still watching it is much more awesome. Since I totally enjoy watching sports anime than reading it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really great. The comedy, no sappy romance, thrilling sensation.. really worth watching it~\\n",

The generation of miracles are really special as expected (although 2 of them were shown in the very late episode 25)\\n\r\nThe others of Seirin made my day, they have such sense of humor, and they are kind of interesting for supporting roles.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt never stressed me. Some serious/ story scenes are really enjoyable.\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nMust watch the next seasons to decide the whole thing.\\n\r\nMy notes of keen-on-rewatch episodes (these are just not my most favorite ones though):\\n\r\n- ep 17: Nice match: Kagami vs Aonomi. Turns out it's a big twist in ep 18\\n\r\n- ep 21 & 22: a little rest (no match, more comedy-like) and character developments, kind of.",

Basketball being more intense than combat, how is it even possible? Well this anime did it. Although there is no combat in this anime, this has a lot of action!\\n\\n\r\nStory - Tall red head Japanese guy comes back from America, joins Japanese school and joins their basketball team. What people didn't know was his rising potential. His goals are to defeat the 5 greatest basketball players in Japanese high school basketball known as the \"Generation of Miracles\" Long story short, he teams up with their invisible 6th member to take them down as an amazing team duo. \\n\r\nGreat story, very unique, very well explained.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Nice art, looks good, very modern. They made the animation look great during plays, sweat, the jumps, the throws, the passes. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Realistic basket ball noises with a bit of anime extra sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - We got a bunch of characters with their own unique abilities, generation of miracles all have their own hair color which is a nice look.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Definitely enjoyable, the more the story progresses the more intense it gets. This anime is doing it right. Outside of a person's dislike for basketball, I see no reason anyone would dislike this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10",

            "content": "\"Why should I watch this if I'm not even into basketball?\" is what I thought when people recommended this anime to me.\r\nThe only anime about sports that I had ever seen sucked (in my opinion of course) and I wasn't sure if this was something for me. But I gave it a try and was everything but disappointed.\r\nPlot & Episodes\r\nLet's get started with how the animeis built. The story revolves around the basketballteam from Seirin High School. Freshmen Kagami and Kuroko both decided to join the team and display their unique basketball skills. As a team, they try to make it to the Inter-High competition,which is a championship with the country's best teams. Not a very uncommon plot seeing that this is a sports anime. What makes the story worth it is the characters and the development of these characters.\\n\r\nMost of the episodes are built around a basketball game, be it 'official' ones or practice games. Throughout these episodes, you get to know (a few of) the members of 'The Generation of Miracles': kids that used to play for the superior Teiko Middle School team, but went their separate ways after Middel School (Kuroko was one of them; the phantom sixth member).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters & Development\\n\r\nAs I said, one thing that makes the anime worth it are the characters. They might seem typically shonen at first: bright hair colors, stereotype personalities and done-before characteristics. I, however, have the feeling that the characters are this, and much more. For example, Kagami might have that stereotypical \"never quit, I will win\"-agressive-style attitude that we've all seen before, and Midorima is the cool-glasses-guy who acts stuck up and knows best, but the way they behave and their actions beg to difference. The characters manage to capture my attention because they are unpredictable in their stereotype (if such a thing even makes sense... just watch the anime and you'll know what I mean). \\n\\n\r\nVisual & Sound\\n\r\nThese were, so to say, OK. Not outstanding, but not distracting either. I do think they could have done more with the visuals. Especially considering the moves the characters make, I think they could have made it far more spectacular visually. The camera-perspective the anime takes up could also be improved. You often get the same perspective, while they could have made it far more interesting if they swtiched up perspectives and introduced new ones more.\\n\\n\r\nTheme\\n\r\nThis is a thing where the anime in my opinion excells. The theme seems to be basketball or sports, but I specifically think it's team sports. \\n\r\nLet me start with saying that, even if you don't know the rules and regulations of basketball: no problem. The anime doesn't explicitly explain any, but you will understand more of it along the way.\\n\r\nThis brings me to the struggles, feelings, thoughts, worries and problems the characters encounter, although a lot of the moves and actions made during games are very unrealistic for a couple of high school kids, are so so recognizable. I myself don't play basketball, but I'm a vivid field hockey player. Take for exemple [this might be a spoiler] Kuroko who tells Kagami that he used to hate basketball back at Teiko. How much it hurts to hate something you love and what it's like when your opponents lose the will to play, wich is the case with Aomine. When lose the will to do something you like most. These aren't superficial worries, but a legit form of sports psychology. I myself had the exact same experience: I transfered to a team where I started to hate hockey. I didn't want to train or play and it made me afraid to go to the training. The fear and/or hate might be irrational at some point, but it's there: One thing this anime does especially well is tackle actual problems everybody can encounter while playing a team sport (or maybe even in individual sports, but I wouldn't know since I don't play that ^^\"). This anime has actually helped me look at my own life differently. I wouldn't go as far as say it's life changing or anything, but I'm sure I'll start tomorrow's game with another mindset and with 'The Basketball which Kuroko Plays' in the back of my head.",

Still, I'm giving this serie high numbers, even outstanding ones. Well that is easily explained. Kuroko no Basket is pretty much like Prince of Tennis, if you think about it. It's about a sport, but still.. it kind of is not. The characters tend to have superhuman reflexes, flexibility, speed, \"ultimate moves\" excetera. But that, my friends, is why it makes a good anime serie. \r\nThe way how this series art is made, is just outrageously beautiful. When shit goes down, you really feel itgoin' down. Everything is in ultimate combination with each other - Art, sound, characters. Which ofcourse gives it a high enjoyment rate. \\n\\n\r\nKuroko no Basket is much more high-paced and unrealistic than real basketball, which makes it actually fun. A guy can throw a ball in from the other side of the court, other one can dunk from half a court excetera. And they execute it in such a marvelous, goosebumps giving way, it is just beautiful. The characters are really well made, and they are all unique in the way they play, the way they feel, and the way they act. Getting to know more characters almost every episode, and none of them are dull or hastily made. \\n\\n\r\nMany words put into few, if you enjoy fast paced, sports anime with \"special moves\", this anime is definitely for you. Even if you hate basketball - Like I do. Did. \\n\\n\r\nOn purpose I chose not to disclose anything related to characters, their relations or how they are connected to each other, to prevent spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment rating is a strong 9.",

            "content": "Who would watch an anime about sports, when you can go outside and play sports?  I hear that lame reasoning all the time and after witnessing my first sports anime, I have to politely disagree with that statement.  Simply put, Kuroko no Basket is the pure embodiment of hype.  The buzzer beater moments are in another world and abilities are so crazily awesome that they come off as likable and awe-inspiring.\r\nKuroko no Basket gives me such a passion for basketball, that it almost makes me want to play the game IRL.  I know that sounds crazy.  An anime fan wantingto play basketball?  However, all it takes to put down that dream and to shoot it back down into the depths of my teenage mind is to recall how hard I got destroyed in a 1v1 of basketball with my friend.  I mean he just threw the ball between my legs and went behind me.  It felt like a Generation of Miracles player wrecking an average player.  My friend does not even play basketball sigh.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Kuroko no Basket's story is pretty good.  It seems what anime would produce out of a sports series.  We have these chosen gods of basketball and yet there's this one underdog among them.  He will be our protagonist.  In season 1, a large portion of the story is this summer tournament.  The team of Seirin featuring our protagonist, Kuroko, and a super tall red-haired center, Kagami, must attempt to surpass regionals and enter the Inter-High, where they will face teams all over Japan.  This sounds like standard affair, yet, the storylines of the characters and their ambitions enrich the storyline.\\n\r\nThe story itself is not the best, but the characters definitely push it up there.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is flourishing with a variety of bizarre characters.  Kuroko is an interesting protagonist that is very likable and charismatic.  His quiet tendencies and surprising shenanigans appearing out of nowhere never seem to get old.  Kagami as another main character proves to be weaker than Kuroko.  A problem with his character is that we never know his backstory or history.  The viewer only knows that he played basketball in America.  What else about him can make him a more compelling character?\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is flourishing with likeable characters as well.  The Generation of Miracles players are super badass and you want to see every single one of them completely destroy people.  The team that the main characters are on has some nice personalities too.  The captain is decent.  Overall, solid characters that could use some backstory.  I mean a supporting character (a Generation of Miracles member) has more description and childhood knowledge than our main characters!  What's up with that?!\\n\\n\r\nI'll put Art and Sound together because they are both around the same: very good.  The art is generally solid.  In and out of games characters look good, but not exceptional.  I wouldn't say that they just \"get the job done\" with animation.  It's definitely a level higher than that because they are no remarkable errors within it.  There is never a moment of inconsistency.  Sound is also great.  Granrodeo makes some amazing OPs and the EDs are better than expected.  The OPs help cement pure hype in the viewers with its electrifying guitar rifts and passionate vocals.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is where Kuroko no Basket shines.  The heat of the games and the stakes of them increase tenfold every time.  Each match becomes more exciting as both sides break out new aces and new tricks up their sleeves.  The swift passes of Kuroko and the epic skills of Aomine (character later in the second half) make for some exhilarating moments.  I mean if you really get into it, you might have some basketball tendencies.  I joke with my friends when we throw an object and it lands unexpectedly in the right place.  We then say \"Anywhere in the court man!\" a reference to Kuroko no Basket.\\n\\n\r\nProblems I have with Kuroko no Basket are as follows:\\n\r\n-Weak first half, Kuroko no Basket takes a while to get going to its fullest potential.  There is also not enough exposition for the training for their first tournament.  Without all of the practice montages, the games at the beginning felt less impactful than they could have been.  Once it gets going, the anime improves drastically, but I can't ignore that fault.\\n\r\n-Main characters needing more backstory, I'm really curious on how Kuroko enters the basketball scene or how Kagami is treated in America as a Japanese player.  How did their experiences shape who they are? (lame ass high school topic right there)\\n\r\n-SOMETIMES too much talking in between hype moments, look.  I'm watching anime and I can handle some surrealism.  However, sometimes Kuroko no Basket takes it a bit too far.  I kinda facepalm when a ten second conversation passes over one single jump battle.  I mean just slam it or defend it already!  I like knowing the thoughts of the characters in the heat of the moment, but it can drag on and on, detracting from the hype.\\n\r\n-Weak comedy first half, for some reason, the comedy was pretty mediocre at the beginning.  As the characters grew on me and I knew about them a bit better, the comedy was a lot better and worked on me.\\n\r\n-Sometimes a bit predictable, don't want to spoil what happens, but how games turn out can grow stale and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nA nitpick that others have, that doesn't apply here:\\n\r\nIt's too fake!  The powers are too broken, BOOHOO!  Anime can be a great place for imagination to go wild.  It's great that the creators are letting their brains rack up these crazy ideas to entertain the viewer.  Anime is where anything can be put to life.  Unlike real life videos, they do not have the boundaries created by equipment, physics laws, etc. Let Kuroko no Basket blow you away.  If you accept how crazy it can become, how overpowered some characters appear to be, how over the top, a high school basketball game can be, watch it!  You will definitely be pumping your hands in the air at a three pointer or a crazy play!",

            "content": "Honestly, when I first heard of Kuroko no Basket, I had no intentions of watching it whatsoever since I wasn't a major sports fan. And I'm not saying that I hate sports; I actually like to play basketball, football, & bandminton. But I wasn't a hard-core fan about it and watching an anime show about sports seemed boring to me. But when I watched the first episode, I was hooked! I literally couldn't stopped watching!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThere was nothing really special or unique about the story line. It was actually pretty decent and very original. It's basically about a high school basketball team trying to beatthe 'Generation of Miracles', which are pro high school basketball players that each has it's own ability. There are no twists or turns in the plot which will surprise you or keep you guessing what will happen next, but it is absolutely very entertaining. It has good comedy and the pace is not too slow nor is it too fast. The only thing that will bother the heck out of you though will be the introduction that plays every time in the beginning of the episode and it won't stop until like half-way through the series. I actually memorized the lines of it to be honest. That's how repetitive it was.\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was alright; it was nothing major or magnificent. The characters aren't drawn skinny-looking though like what you will see in most animes, they were drawn muscular and large, but it's not a bad thing, I quite like it.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music was AMAZING! Of course it wasn't the best that I've heard, but the soundtracks that they used were really good. Every opening song and ending song they played were nice and it fit the anime very well.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the main key point in Kuroko no Basket. They were all just very reasonable and unique. It can be hard to pick a favorite character to be honest since they were pretty much likable. But in my opinion, Kuroko was my favorite character ^~^ hehe. Anyhow, I really like the fact that each individual had their own different ability that they specialize at; that makes the character even more complex. They all had their strengths and weaknesses; and they also had their very own reason why they started to play basketball.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAll in all, Kuroko no Basket is a very enjoyable anime that anyone should consider watching whether they like sports or hate it. The stunts that they do in the basketball games may seem impossible to do and it should've never been done in a real-life game, but hey, it's anime and it also puts more intensity and 'action' into the show. Kuroko no Basket is in my top ten now, so give it a shot! :)\\n",

As a basketball player, I can say that the series doesn't actually possess \"basketball education\" but it makes us think to mimic those moves in the court just for fun. As an Anime lover the story is interesting. Overall, in spite of the impossibility of their moves, we can get fun just by following the story. Who knows, maybe a person can actually mimic it perfectly just by watching the show.",

            "content": "Sports and I are something that does not really belong together, like Code Geass and a second season. I have no real interest in any sport, so usually I stay away from most sports anime. Most of them follow the generic path of a certain team playing a certain sport, the team wining most of their games and losing a couple of them. To all extents and purposes \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d follows this exact pattern, but had one nice twist to it that made it worth some wild.\r\n\u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d follows personality devoid Kuroko and his rag-tag team of high school misfits as they try and beatother high schools, some of them having players from the \u201cGeneration of Miracles,\u201d a former middle school basketball team with exceptional players, but for some reason most say that there were only five members of the \u201cGeneration of Miracles,\u201d even though Kuroko was one of the members also apparently. I mean, every time we meet another member of the \u201cGeneration of Miracles\u201d they completely acknowledge that Kuroko is an amazing player, so why the misconception?\\n\\n\r\nWell apparently the reason for this misconception is that Kuroko has the presence of a blank sheet of paper. Literally, players on the court will completely forget that Kuroko is even playing because of his lack of presence. Another thing that could make Kuroko forgettable is the fact that he is terrible at basketball. For a title like \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d one would expect Kuroko to be front in center, making three pointers while jumping 50 feet in the air. But in the first episode the anime explains quite clearly how much Kuroko sucks at the sport. In fact the best player on the team is no good delinquent Taiga Kagami, who sports red hair to show the audience how angry he is all the time because red equals GRRRRR I\u2019M ANGRY! The series then follows Kuroko and Kagami who team up, with Kagami having actual talent with Kuroko being able to pass the ball to him with nobody else noticing. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d is nothing to gawk at, I mean once you see the team win one game you\u2019ve pretty much seen them win them all. The only interesting point to the show that I found was the fact that the main character is not technically the star of the anime. Kuroko has to help out all the other players on the team, a value that is little explored in a lot of sports anime, and fits well of a game like basketball. It made it interesting at times to see how the team would use Kuroko to effectively beat the other team, imploring a sense of strategy. Only problem is that after the first couple of games the only real thing Kuroko does is pass the ball quickly and soon the effect of \u201cWhoa who saw that guy coming,\u201d gets old soon. Also after Kuroko\u2019s team gets their ass handed to them in episode 18, the series comes to a complete halt with boring training episodes and watching other teams play. It\u2019s an incredibly anti-climactic ending to a series, one that is banking on the fact that there will be a second season. (At the time of this review a second season will be premiering in October.)\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Kuroko is about as interesting as the plain piece of paper I mentioned earlier in the review, having no real motivation, personality, interesting backstory. All we know about him is that he played on the \u201cGeneration of Miracles,\u201d making for a bland main character.  Kagami is pretty much in the same boat as Kuroko; only his main personality trait is being mad and angry. The two characters have nearly no chemistry, making for an uninteresting paring that should be the heart of the series. Interestingly enough the show tries to explore the relationships of Kuroko and the other members of the \u201cGeneration of Miracles.\u201d Most of it boils down to in the end either a player liking Kuroko or hating him because of his school choice. There also seems to be a bigger focus on the \u201cGeneration of Miracle,\u201d then there is Kuroko\u2019s team, with the last big game of the series involving two different members of the \u201cGeneration of Miracles.\u201d With more of a focus on the \u201cGeneration of Miracles\u201d the main team in question becomes less interesting as the series progresses. Oddly also the series only features three of the five members of the \u201cGeneration of Miracles,\u201d holding out the last two for the second season. All I\u2019ve got to say about that is they better be gods at basketball considering how one of the members introduced, Daiki Aomine, can literally score upwards of 60 points in one half. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d is fluid, with attention to detail during the games themselves. Most games are nicely animated, making every game at least somewhat enjoyable to watch. Character designs for the main characters have different color hair, to represent their personalities and to differ them up from all the other players that look exactly like them. On Kuroko\u2019s team there was several times where I forgot which player was who because nearly all of them looked identical. Not that it terribly matters; the only real people who the show focuses on are Kuroko and Kagami.\\n\r\nThe two openings for the show are serviceable, being able to hype one up for the show, while the first ending I thought was great. Seriously, I thought the first ending is one of the best ending songs I\u2019;ve heard in a while being catchy and a nice way to end an episode. Most anime series now a days sick any random song at the end (see Kuroko\u2019s Basketball\u2019s second ending), but the music they picked for the first ending was great in my opinion. Most background music was nice, making the games quite intense at time. All in all nothing that stood out (except of course for that great ending). \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, ones enjoyment of \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d depends on how much they enjoy most sports anime. Coming from someone who cannot stand sports, I found \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d enjoyable at times. The nice little twist the premise adds, the animation and the first opening makes \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d stand out a little bit from other sports anime, but besides for that the show is generic in nearly all other categories. I do plan on watching the second season and am hoping that the show is able to fix the character problems plaguing the story (i.e. focus more on Kuroko\u2019s team, work on better chemistry, give more motivation\u2019s, etc.), for if they can fix that they would have a real winner.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \u201cKuroko\u2019s Basketball\u201d is taking some steps in the right direction with a focus on the whole team, but sloppy character development hold the series back from being truly fun.\\n",

Iwatobi Swim Club and loved it but told myself that it would be the only sports anime I would watch, I thought it just wasnt my thing. When Free ended I missed it a lot but didnt want to rewatch it. My tumblr dashboard was filled with Kuroko No Basket and I said to myself, I guess I could watch the first episode. I watched the first episode and instantly fell in love. \r\nThis anime is very similar to Free in many ways so if you liked thatthen you should give KnB a try! The story is interesting, somewhat supernatural you could argue, in that the Generation of Miracles have \"special basketball powers\". There is a lot of conflict that makes for great cliffhangers and emotion. However, due to the supernatural aspects, this anime isnt very true to the game of basketball. I really do enjoy basketball but I dont know much about it but, this anime overexaggerates a lot about the sport. Personally, I love the artwork in this anime (not gonna lie, I have a huge crush on Kuroko) and the voice actors are great, they fit their characters really well. Speaking of characters, every character in this anime is very unique. In basketball, they all have their own styles and ways of the game but come together to play in amazing ways. They also have different personalities that make for an awesome story. \\n\r\nI could have probably rated this a bit less than a ten overall, however, I was so amazed byt the fact that I was completely dragged into this anime. I went from refusing to watch it to not wanting to stop watching it. This anime is most definitely becoming one of my favorites.",

            "content": "Before deciding to watch Kuroko no Basket, I was very hesitant. I had heard both negative and positive feedback about the series, and since I am a tough critic when it comes to sports anime, I ended up putting it off. However, after giving the first episode a try I was instantly hooked. \r\nThe thing that really strikes me in the anime is the main protagonist. Characters are the usually the most critical part of an anime for me, and I was very surprised. Typically, the main character in a sports/shounen anime is always determined to be the \"ace\" or the best. However, that isnot the case in Kuroko no Basket. Kuroko, who is a short and weak first year tries out for the Seirin basketball team. As the \"phantom man\" and sixth member of the five generation of miracles, Kuroko is relatively unknown. Unlike most sports anime, the main protagonist is supporting the deuteragonist, Kagami, in Kagami's to become the best in Japan. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime mainly focuses on the relationship between Kuroko and Kagami and how they develop together (along with the rest of the Seirin team). Throughout the episodes, the development in all characters are very prominent. The interactions with each other, (and other teams) are very enjoyable and engaging. Each character is individualised, and has a unique set of characteristics. The players on Serien all have skills and abilities that help to influence and compliment the skills of other players on the team. By working together, they improve not only their own basketball style, but the others as well. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, unlike anime several other basketball anime, Kuroko no Basket has some unrealistic features, such as skills. (ex. Kuroko's \"vanishing drive\" or Akashi's \"emperor eye\") Although, this makes the anime interesting. The games are more intense, and watching the characters develop and gain those skills is very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nFor a sports anime, Kuroko no Basket has very good art. The animation is very fluid, however it isn't a masterpiece. Taking the anime's budget into consideration, the animation is terrific. The art adds on to the overall watching experience, and the style is very good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that Kuroko no Basket is a great show. As a basketball player myself, I can see how some people view the show as \"unrealistic\" however, the skills are based on actual moves used by professional players. (ex Kagami's meteor jam was based on a slam dunk initiated by leaping over the free throw line) I think that most shounen fans would be very pleased by Kuroko no Basket.",

            "content": "Basketball is a game which is one of the only games in the worlds that utilizes your whole bodies performance, An anime made by looking at basketball players and there abilities is on the the best. There are typically very few animes in the worlds which are based on sports, most of the animes would either be some kind of science fiction stuff or things that can not really occur in the real world but considering an anime like this it's a good change once in a while. I myself am a basketball fan and love NBA and i am still practicing to become goodat basketball, so i started watching this anime by the recommendation from some people that it will help you in learning basket ball and trust me it was, at the time of writing this (2016/03/01) there is the second and third season released as well, I will be moving onto watching them as well. \\n\\n\r\nComing onto the actual breakdown of the anime \\n\\n\r\nThe story is based on 6 basketball players who each have a unique skill of there own, they are known as the five prodigies, they apparently split up after middle school and they all went to different high school's, and the story begins when they each face each other in a match, the matches are sometimes really unpredictable like you have no idea who will win, this anime will definitely keep you guessing till the end which school will win ( I am not going to spoil the anime, so make sure to watch it and understand it by yourself) \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound system of the anime is really great, i must say the lighting effects and the sound of the shoes creaking on the stadium floor makes it feel like you really are watching an NBA match except for the fact that its anime, the designs have also been dealt with really nice, they made the anime look really humane as possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, are nothing special actually it just shows how each character is working really hard to achieve what they want, the most important thing that this anime teaches you is team work, if you work as a team you will always have a better chance at winning(This will be explained later on) and also to trust your team mates always, the characters try to follow up this rules and most schools that are in the anime actually really do this.  I am really inspired by the character Kagami and his personality, he really made me understood that not anything is impossible, and as the old saying is there \"if there is a will there is a way\" \\n\\n\r\nOverall my enjoyment is a solid 10/10, but i do wish the story was structured in a little more better way but then again it will hardly make a difference, go for it and trust me you will not regret watching this anime if you are a basketball fan and if you really need motivation to move on forward \\n\\n\r\nP.S. :- Not sure about this but many girls love this as it has hot guys (data collected according to girls) so then girls make sure to watch this if you love Hot Guys",

Kuroko no basket gets straight into the action from the first episode, its a fast paced anime that still keeps you wanting more after each episode.\r\nOn top of that Kuroko no Basket truly has some of the best characters that I've seen. Whether it is the intense Kagami, the quiet and hidden Kuroko, or any of the Generation of Miracles introduced in the firstseason, Kuroko no Basket has every kind of personality that you could possibly think of. The evolution of each team is truly amazing, but not as amazing as the evolution of the players themselves. This anime focuses on not only the team growing and becoming stronger, but the players themselves as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo, don\u2019t be like me and judge it just by the fact that a sports anime may not be your forte. Even if you don\u2019t like watching basketball, give Kuroko no Basket a shot. You never know, it might just become your favorite anime. :3",

But yeah sure, if you want some of REALISTIC basketball just watch NBA games not anime. This anime make a lot things more interesting by1 episode to another episode, with that sort of mysterious Main character i am sure that he is have a OP talent but Production I.G want to make it very special (i think they will show it at season 2 therefore the main character need more skill to beat that villain).\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is i think is okay, well i dont have much expectation to anime in 2012 xD.\\n\\n\r\nThe character! oh well the character is good, but there is something that i dont understand like why tetsu must repeat his moves after he know that his moves is not working anymore? its make tetsu looks dumb, if he want to beat  that aomine really bad, he should be more creative, i dont really like this part.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story 9/10:\r\nThe plot is very simple: beat the best teams in the country. As a basketball player and fan, I feel like this anime\u2019s plot captures the concept of having fun competing. What I enjoy most about Kuroko No Basuke is that it has what people clicked to see: basketball. It doesn\u2019t pad out its run time by trying to shove exposition in our face, instead we mostly are getting prepped for the next game to be played. Episodes that allow us to cool off from the action in between games are entertaining because the utilize the colorfulness of the cast. Otherwise, action is 70%of this show with a little exposition here and there which suits a high paced sports anime like this very well. It gives us what we came for, explosive action with a little bit of time in between to get to know the characters. The only issue I have with the plot is that there are a few deus ex machinas sprinkled around. While they\u2019re not huge or even unique, they can be annoying since they characters can suddenly do things that they couldn\u2019t before. The main characters are simply athletic high schoolers so the fact that they can suddenly surpass their physical limits, if only for a moment, is completely contrived\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe art works for the series. Unlike other shonen, there isn\u2019t a lot of emphasis on special effects so the animation is pretty simple. The characters are drawn with adequate detail and their uniforms look like they could be actual basketball gear. The CGI hoop is a little trippy but the ball goes through it organically.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nThis is admittedly my favorite part of the show, the music is wonderfully done. During games the amazing soundtrack is used to flesh out the drama of the moment. Episodes where the characters are getting into wacky shenanigans are made genuine by the music playing in the background. Emotional moments have even more weight to them and cleverly placed songs from the ost can make standing around talking seem like the heaviest, coolest thing happening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Kuroko No Basuke don\u2019t feel like they have a specific role in the show. Of course they fit into certain archetypes but their personality doesn\u2019t rely on this to define their personality. Over the course of the season we see many characters mature and grow. Of course, this mostly relates to Kuroko, Kagami, and all the other first year main characters. However, it also allows us to gain insight on the cast that support them. Also, we see the characters grow and interact in the context of a basketball anime. Their major points of character development revolve around matches and their aftermath. None of the characters truly feel static and we see most of them mature in some fashion as we see them play more basketball. However, the strength of the characters is the fact that none of Seirin\u2019s opponents as presented as evil, they\u2019re simply players Seirin has to defeat. Although ideology may clash between Kuroko, Kagami, and the GOM, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is still a basketball anime. This detail captures the diversity yet uniformity of sports: everyone has a different motivation for playing but the end result is to win.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to find a show that not only fits a niche, but works well within that niche rather than trying to expand it in an attempt to feign profoundness. This anime is one of those rare types that makes you fall in love with a simple and straightforward premise. Its fast paced and always manages to keep you entertained which is what I liked to see in an anime about a sport as dynamic as basketball.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10:\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a well crafted joyride. It fulfills the need for action while also giving us colorful characters. However, I  refrained from giving it a 10/10 because of one reason: the context and the delivery. People that watch and play basketball on a regular basis understand that this show heavily romanticizes the sport rather than faithfully portraying it. Of course, the appeal of these flashy dunks, passes, and blocks is also what brings the audience. Despite this, the show offers very little to teach viewers to appreciate basketball. I would have loved KNB even more had the show made an attempt to get the reader in love with real basketball while still enjoying the action. However, the plot is so straightforward that it never feels like we grow alongside the story, we\u2019re just watching NBA games with nothing but crazy dunks, passes, three pointers, and blocks alongside interesting characters. Despite this, the show possesses exceptional ability to entertain and I would recommend it to anyone.",

Different skills will be displayed, along with different belief because of the talent they have. Among those students, five stand out and was called Generations of Miracles. They are the prodigies in basketball on their place, and was scattered on different school after they graduated. One student, respected by the five members, entered a newly created school and is destined to meet another guy whom will help him to make the five prodigies realize that the way of their basketball is wrong. The series will show different plays,struggles to improve, and how the team with the combination of two students win the battle they prepared to take. \\n\\n\r\nKuroko No Basket Anime Review\\n\r\nBy: Tadatoshi Fujimaki\\n\r\nApril 15, 2019\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 10\\n\\n\r\nSports Anime genre have only one path to take, tournaments. Participating individually or by teaming up, it is the most common plot that exist. While this is not a unique one, it will be the author's capability how he manage to capture the interest of the viewer and excite them. This series focuses on students who love playing basketball. At first, I am really not interested on watching this anime. It is kind of absurd to think of a basketball story with extraordinary skills. But after trying it out, it made me realize that the plot of the story is great. I love the simplicity of it. The main reason of why the series moves forward and how it affects every branches of the story. Unrealistic as it may seem, the lesson is still there. The creator successfully stress out the core value when playing basketball. What also made me hook on this series is the directness of every plays all of the basketball teams have. Each play only last for an average of 5 to 6 episodes. Flashbacks are there but its only on a really minimum basis. You can enjoy watching all of the plays without so much cliffhanging and annoying side stories of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt is already a known that almost all of the characters on this series are super cool. It is the reason why most of the girl watched it, I think. Aside from that fact, the development of the characters can totally be seen along the story. The changes and realization they made make them more of a human. Though not skillfully speaking. Since there are so many characters, giving all of them the spotlight is hard. And that's whats amazing. The creator successfully introduce a past where most of the characters belong. That way, it won't be hard tackling each of the characters past and it gives the story more time in other scenarios that needs to be displayed. I love how the story never depend on the back story of the characters so much that it will take too much time to explain it. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation: 10\\n\\n\r\nPerfect. My phone is full of Kises' picture. Yes, every character is so handsome but it is not only this. The animation of the story is really great. Parts where the characters show dribbling, passing, shooting or even guarding their opponents is really detailed. I love how they show the movements of the characters playing on the court, as well as their expression depending on the feeling they have. Should I also mention the voices? Yes, theirs are really cool and perfectly matches the looks of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI am not really a fan of basketball. I do not hate it, but I do not also like it. This is the first anime basketball which got me hooked. Due to so much enjoyment watching it, I've finished it in a more faster time than the other series I tried. Every episode will make you want more, more plays, more actions on the court, more characters to encounter with. It is really exciting, and fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnding: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the best route to take for an ending on this series. The main goal of Kuroko has been met after winning the nationals with his team. But no, the story did not really move forward just because they had to win. It is because he had to bring back his loss previously. He had to bring back all of the people precious to him and he did. Fixing things that is broken and making them realize the most important thing when doing the thing they love. I am content with the ending of this series. It is simple, yet it will made you realize something important.",

            "content": "A great anime for people who don't really know much about or follow basketball. Still a good one for those who do\r\nPositive: This anime is a lot more accessible than I initially thought it would be for being about a specific sport. The characters are interesting and unique and the pace of their development is great. They manage to inject a shounen kind of element into a team sport is pretty cool as well. I think most people would find it enjoyable.\r\nNegative: If you know anything about basketball and physics, especially the rules of the game you are going to have a hard time suspendingyour disbelief and you are going to need to do it constantly. I don't mean the obviously exaggerated stuff, like kurokos misdirection and lazer passes or that a bunch of 6 foot 1 kids that are 14-15 years old can dunk like nba stars or how they all seem to make almost every shot they take. No, I mean stuff like the impossibility of a high-arc full-court standing pull-up jumper that Midorima can make every time, the allowance of clear double dribbles and traveling (I'm looking at you, Aomine) or how absolutely no other basketball rules are enforced besides contact during the shot (would somebody PLEASE call defensive 3 seconds on Murasakibara!). As a huge basketball fan and daily player I found myself at times screaming at my TV lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you won't be too off-put by the negatives the positives make this anime something you will enjoy and it's definitely one you should give a shot anyways, despite the negatives. I'd give it a 7.7 if they allowed a more specific score. The fact they find ways to give every game an interesting and unique aspect/challenge is undeniably impressive and the characters and their development is nicely done as well",

            "content": "Here we have an awesome anime about ninjas playing basket.... wait, no.... well yes.... \r\nThat is, Kuroko no Basket has been widely criticised for the lack of a real depiction of the basketball play. So let's clarify this point from the begining: the truth is that the abilities of all the characters are actually very exagerated and at some points it really feels like you are watching Naruto characters playing a match. So yes, if you are looking for a realistic representation of basketball, this anime might make you laugh hard or even cry at some points, even though the approach that lies behind these\"unrealistic skills\" is kind of well formulated all the same...\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, if you just enjoy stories about team game, endeavor, friendship and personal development, this anime is well worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best aspects of Kuroko no Basket is by far its ability to embody the \"Let your actions speak for you\" concept. The story revolves around Kuroko, a nice boy with a weird skill. Kuroko and his new high-school basketball team have to play against his former team-mates in a number of matches. Each of these opponents has a different personality, different skills and different background to be developed in various arcs thoughout the 3 seasons (not too deeply though). In each encounter, Kuroko's basket style and philosophy affects the percetion these characters have about themselves and the way they relate with the sport, helping them to grow. In my opinion, this and only this, is what makes Kuroko no Basket such an ejoyable story. \\n\\n\r\nAlong the way we meet this fairly charismatic bunch of characters which have pretty well elaborated personalities and it's easy to sympathise with all of them, which becomes a good thing and a bad thing at once. It is a bad thing because during the games it is rather difficult to take sides, since you come to like them all, but it's also a good thing since it makes it the more interesting and it makes you thrill no matter who wins. In addition the seiyuu cast is great and they do all an amazing job performing the particularities of each character. \\n\\n\r\nBesides, this anime has an interesting soundtrack with highly enjoyable  openings and endings (special mention to ending 2 of 2nd season) as well as awesome character songs performed by the various voice actors, which is not strictly part of the series, but I highly recommend.",

It is quite suitable for a Shounen/Sports anime. Very nicely done :) \r\nSound: 10/10\r\nThe sound effects and etc. aren't as overly excessive or annoying like some action type Shounen orsports/shounen and in fact it was quite nice~ there I gave it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done, I must say. *Patting author of the manga tat has been turned in to anime on the back*.

I came for the guys and stayed for the plot.\r\nStory7: It's what it says in the title, it's about basket ball; not really much else, but the games get really intense, like you expect that they will win every time but, yeah. \r\nArt 8: A lot of the guys are good looking, what can I say?\r\nSound 5: Eh\r\nCharacter 7: Minimal back story for most characters. Kuroko, the protagonist, is a bit plain really. He acts invisible buthas blue hair. Blue hair. \\n\r\nMidorima needs more air time.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: I watched the first season in about 3 days, which is quick considering school. Even though sports isn't really a genre of anime I watch, this was just a light anime to watch with quite a bit of humour. \\n\r\nOverall 8: I recommend.",

It also shows reasoing for my opinion and so that you see what I think of this anime.\r\nThis is a great series. FAR from being as good as the legendary Slamdunk but still nonetheless very entertaining. The animation is though, hands down better (that is a given). The starting couple of episodes are very.. well random because they pull out random concepts into a series where the characters are JUST basketball players and not supermen. \r\nDue to that I diddrop it at episode 15. The games espeically had not even nearly as much tension and drama as Slamdunk and the unusual concepts and shots were too much. A lot of things about it were bad and the story had a lot of flaws. Why Kuroko decides to help Kagami become the best in the world is beyond the logic of me or anyone else on this planet. Not to mention, the character interactions were very bland and basic. But I decided to stick with it for a bit more and after Daiki came in it started to become better. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you have already read (the manga is better than the anime) Slamdunk then you might find this to be bad but if you haven't then this is a series you will very much enjoy.",

No problem, bro. 2 meters? That's HUGE! We're all dwarves now! Oh no! Also, Kuroko is suddendly as tall as a child. What. No, seriously. My ex was two meters tall. It's tall, yes, but it's not even close to as ginormous as this series at times makes it be. What was this, Attack on Basketball? \r\nBESIDES that I cannot believe I've just spent.. what, eight hours, watching basketball? I've never watched a real match in my life, butthis was just interesting. I literally had to get popcorn just to get in the mood and yell at the screen as the matches went on. I was actually with the series the whole time and genuinely wanted to know what would happen next. The characters were so good too. I especially think Kuroko is the funniest thing this world has ever been blessed with. I really want him to surprise someone while they're in the toilet or something. His quiet and stabbing lines got me every. Single. Time. I think I almost cried from laughter a few times.\\n\\n\r\nThere wouldn't be a series if something didn't irritate me about it. Kagami. Great character, driven and has a very nice power-balance compared to the others. But.\\n\r\nHis eyebrows.\\n\r\nHoly Jesus, why? Every time they zoomed on his face I wanted to get little scissors and cut the annoying, completely unnecessary little spike from his eyebrows. Just. Shimmy the lil scissors in there and quickly snap it. Or take a knife and gently scrape them off. I'm literally fantasizing about it right now. I get that it adds character, but it just. I can't. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I'm going to watch the second season. And desperately continue pretending to ignore those brows that have become my arch nemesis.",

            "content": "Kuroko No Basket, a show that introduces to us the means in character development.  We are introduced to a young, and silent boy named Kuroko.  Amongst the 5 peers on his middle school basketball team, he becomes what fans recognize him as, \"a shadow\".  The players on his team, who can later be recognized as, \"The Generation of Miracles\", learn the talent they have, which enables them to surpass anyone in Tokyo.  Knowing of their true, and talented skills, they separate to become even greater at basketball when they are divided into different high schools.  As Kuroko is left tobe known as, \"the phantom sixth player\", he is determined to make a name for himself amongst those who pushed him aside.  He later joins a basketball team called, \"Seirin\", which we can later recognize as the protagonist team in the storyline.  As we cheer on Kuroko, and the team Seirin, along with characters we learn to love, such as Kagami, Junpei, & Kiyoshi (along with others on Team Seirin as well), we learn just how each and every character has true purpose, and potential, in order to conquer and overcome the obstacles that they must face against the un-defeated Generation of Miracles.  The show not only shows battles against other teams, but it shows battles against themselves, which gives this story such amazing focus on character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself is absolutely fantastic.  It's a high guarantee that if you watch an anime, most of the time it tends to focus off of each and every character they introduce.  Most animes lack this, for when it comes to storyline, chances are the story itself will forget one or two characters in the process.  Kuroko No Basket gives each and every character a significant purpose; this element in the story telling is a key to making a successful anime.  We feel for each and every protagonist, and even when you wouldn't think so, it gives us feelings for antagonists as well.  The story and plot is outstanding, proving it's not just \"some typical high school anime with a sports team\".  It truly has meaning, and I am proud to say this is one of my favorites of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, hope to make some more reviews soon!\\n\\n\r\nryoukaz overall rating: 10/10",

Easily the most fucking hype sports anime to air since Prince of Tennis, which set the bar pretty high considering its amazing sound track and batshit insane characters. \r\nThe animation in Kuroko no Basket is nothing short of flawless, and it has a music score that's even better - both of which combine to make the basketball games incredibly badass. Seriously, wait till episode 17... Jesus Christ. Aomine Daiki, man, Aomine Daiki. Nearly shat myself when he started playing. \r\nIf I had any complaints with this anime, it would be that the protagonist is sometimes infuriatingly weak, which makes him seem outof place as the hero of a shounen anime. But hey, that's part of the premise, so I guess it can't really be helped. So yea, go watch this shit. You'll be hooked, fosho.",

That's why at first.  I was hesitant to watch Kuroko no basuke. However, I don't regret watching it because it is one of the best animes I have had the pleasure to see. The story is interesting yet simple to grasp.True, there are moments when the powers of the players were kind of unrealistic but it only made the matches more intense. It is close to mesince I am a high school student as well. What is more, after watching it I actually considered joining the basketball club... (unfortunately I am too short :D) The characters are entertaining since there is every type of personality. What I like the most is that the two protagonists are very different. The antagonists are super cool! The art is good, although there were a few moments when I wished it was a little bit better. The music, by Granrodeo is perfectly chosen, I dare to say. The endings are just as good given the fact that I couldn't resist watching even them. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are a few things that I didn't like. I watched a whole season of 25 episodes and yet I am still wondering what is the exact reason behind Kuroko's decision to join Seirin. What is more, I would have liked it better if more of the Generation of miracles were introduced properly. Although now I have more reasons to look forward to season two. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kuroko no basuke is a good choice if you want to watch an anime that is both serious and funny. It has all you need: art, music, story, and, of course, super cool characters!",

Manu ginobili also played for spurs basketball team...\r\nLINK [COMPARISON BTN KUROKO AND GINOBILI] ->> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG3O5ZxDfNA\r\nNow lets focus on what this anime excels at and in wat it doesnt... \r\nSports animes are always fun to watch and it even boosts up themoral and physical abilities of a person too... kuroko's basketball was aimed at 3 things->\\n\\n\r\n1> to provide entertinment to audiences [ a sure thing]\\n\r\n2>to give boost to sports genre animes in japan and all over the world...\\n\r\n3> to popularize the  basketball sports and seduce japanese youths towards this game ... yes baseball and football is popular in japan and basketball has a very less share of popularity compared to the lion share of other two..\\n\\n\r\nLets see the merits and demerits of the anime....\\n\\n\r\ncoming on to the merit list first...\\n\r\n1> it will surely give u goosbumps and will force u to jump out of ur seats at many crucial moments,even it will force u to bite nails during the crucial deciding times\\n\r\n2> loved the 1st op and ed  tracks of the anime..\\n\r\n      op track -> \"Can Do\" by GRANRODEO\\n\r\n      ed track->\"Start it right away\" by Hyadain\\n\r\n3>animation is a treat to the eye.. well defined and stylish colorful animated movemesnts for kuroko's passes and the color intensifying looks for the 5 prodigies and kagami taiga..\\n\r\n4> character detailing is awesome... kuroko is perfectly drawn depicting his mild, silent and low profile  nature... others are drawn too depicting their behavioral and individual characteristics..\\n\r\n5>soundtrack is simple yet boosts up the anime during serious times as well as exciting times...\\n\r\n6>story build up is gud, depicting the the prodigies, their separation and them joining different clubs to achieve higher and higher in life.. kagami taiga is also well described...his entry is damn exciting one though..the basics of basketball and different shots and movements are well described and  are well executed visually too\\n\\n\r\nNow coming on to the demerit part ~~\\n\r\n1>start is lil slow and boring...the momentum gain is awesome and will never allow u to move away from it though.\\n\r\n2> i dont know why 1st op and ed are ditched and bought in high pitched and high bass op and ed ones ..thoseare really bad with bad pronounciation too :D\\n\r\n3>not a lot is described about the backdrop of the prodigies and kagami too...a brief description would have been better imo..\\n\r\n4> many guys even argue the moves in the anime are inhuman...yes to some exent...but many moves,passes and basket styles are real too... and lil inhuman part is added to it to make it take the audience experience to a next level... because if u want true moves and styles better tune into a sports channel to watch nba...but this anime surely gives more excitement than a nba match...bcz a little inhuman abilities not only adds style but excitement and astonishment too..\\n\\n\r\nDemerits are not that much..anime is a cliffhanger one at times and u just cant wait till the next ones...and the stylish movements are well executed and is a tr8 to the visual experience of the individual...\\n\\n\\n\r\nDis anime in my opinion is surely a tr8 for sports anime lovers and even a boost for excelling of sports based genre in japan...\\n\r\nWatch dis and get amazed by the dunks, passes, crossovers and 3 pointer ;)\\n\r\nHAVE A FUN RIDE PEEPS!!!!\\n\r\nBasketball Rocks!!!\\n",

            "content": "This anime was in my \"planning to watch\" list for a while and I finally decided to check it out.\r\nSTORY: well, the main plot has been already written, so I won't repeat it. I like sports anime and I've honestly enjoyed this. Of course it is a bit unrealistic: high school basket players doing incredible shots, extreme jumps and faster than light passages? Sure, why not! But in an anime, anything can happen...\r\nThe story is exciting, you just wanna watch episode after episode (I watched it all in 2 days): there are moments when the characters are under so much pressure (happens often considering thenumber of games they have to play in such a short time), but there are also hilarious moments (Kuroko's ability to be 'invisible' spurs interesting reactions; the coach and her attempts with cooking, etc...).\\n\r\nThis anime shows that (a) it's important to enjoy something with your friends, (b) team work makes you achieve great things, (c) friendships and relationships in general should be based on trust, (d) always do your best and, even if you lose, make a step forward to become a better person (and player).\\n\\n\r\nART: well, I've seen better, but it's not really bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: the OP and ED were good, didn't pay much attention to the music during scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: oh boy, where to start? the Generation of Miracles is made of... 'extreme' and 'out of this world' guys; the Seirin Basketball Club is a mix of weird and interesting characters; and then there's Kuroko... The good thing is that, through the story, we see all of them develop and grow up: they improve, relationships change, even the always-almost-invisible Kuroko manages to start showing a different side of himself.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I loved it. This anime got me hooked since episode 1. I've read several comments and other reviews, where the most common criticism was \"it's too unrealistic\" and \"there's too much room for fanservice moments\". Honestly, this is an anime, some of the characters are described as \"miracles\", of course there would be things out of the ordinary. But that didn't stop me from enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I honestly recommend it, even to people who are not sports fans. It is funny, there's lot of action, there are sad moments and hilarious situations. Bonus point because there are only a very very few hints about romance (which is good IMO because it's really not important here and it wold have probably turned the anime into something not so enjoyable).\\n\\n\r\nThe only down thing about this anime is that the story isn't finished yet (the manga is still ongoing), so there is so much more that is waiting to be shown (which makes me hope for a new season? as soon as more manga chapters come out)",

I'll tell you why.\r\nAt first I had a lot of doubts for this anime. \"Hmm..nah..sports? But I hate basketball! But I'm not a big fan of sports anime! There's no way I'd like this!\"  Ah how wrong I was. I've kept an eye at these series for half a year ,but why didn't I watch it? Because I'm a stupid ,stubborn \"genious\" ,maybe? Ah well.. I hit a dead end so I decided \"Why not? Let'sgive it a shot.\". MAN WAS I SURPRISED! I fell in love with this anime from the first episode to last and I couldn't controll myself so I started the manga too! Anyway if you have any doubts about this anime..CAST.THEM.ASIDE! Now for the actual review. xD\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the main character Kuroko Tetsuya also known as the \" Phantom Sixth Member\" of the well known \"Generation of Miracles\". The Generation of Miracles are Kuroko's ex-team in middle school and the story follows their lives in High School where they all split up and try to beat eachother. Kuroko's main goal is to make Kagami Taiga (The other main character) the No 1 player in Japan and defeat The Generation of Miracles. The story is really good I honestly can not give it less than 10 out of 10 and how the matches they play give me this awesome feeling like watching some epic shounen fight really impressed me! \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt  8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow I give the art an 8 out of 10 ,because personally ,I'm not a big fan of that kind of art ,but it really in this anime, IT'S EPIC. The way they made the fights. The passes. Their eyes in one of those pressured moment. Sugoi! Good job I.G! \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't say anything about the sound except that it's epic and I can't get enough of it. My favourites are Opening 1 and Ending 2 ,but the others are amazing as well! I listen to the soundtrack every day ,even now while writing this review. >.",

            "content": "First of all, I think this show is mildly overrated. Secondly, im going to review this anime in comparison to Slam Dunk and I'm doing it this way for two reasons. 1: because this is my review, so I'll put it together however I want And 2: because if you don't like Kuroko no Basket, I'm pretty sure you will like Slam Dunk vice-versa.\r\nKuroko no Basket is an uninspired and bland anime that hides its flaws in its beautiful art and seemless animations. It's a classic \"battle shounen\" disguised as a sports anime where all the characters are unstoppable superheroes fighting in a gigantic 3season tournament arc. Rather than having a logical story that flowed well, the writer seemed to always rely on crazy plot devices to drive the story forward. To be honest, I dont mind when the characters are a little unrealistic with the unique abilites like Ippo's extremely over exaggerated dempsey roll or the Tezuka Zone from The Prince of Tennis but KnB takes it to the level of where it's hard to suspend my disbelief. \\n\r\nThere were way too many times when I watched a scene and then said something like, \u201cOh, that could never actually happen in basketball.\u201d But the problem isn't that its unrealistic, it's that its not believable. For example: take a show like Psycho Pass or Ergo Proxy. These anime are both crazy and unrealistic sci-fi shows but when I sit down and watch either of them, the writing makes it feel real and believable rather than thinking about how unrealistic it obviously is.\\n\r\n  Even though Slam Dunk is a little goofy and older, the story is immersive and makes you feel connected. The characters are well developed and relatable even though it's filled with cliched tropes. Its a little generic in some ways but it still feels very genuine and heartfelt. \\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I feel like there's always a different show to watch depending on your mindset and KnB could do it for you. However, if you love sports anime and want to watch a timeless show that will stay in your soul forever- Slam Dunk will sate your craving especially if you don't mind some older animations. \\n",

            "content": "My problem with Kuroko no Basket is something that seems prevalent in some other sports anime; over dramatics. That is to say that there seem to be a lot of over dramatic points in the anime that happen a lot during each basketball match.  \r\nThere are literally multiple scenes in which the characters face some sort of obstacle and say \"Oh my God, what are we gonna do!\" and then this obstacle is overcome. These obstacles often revolve around someone being taller that the other players, or jumping higher, or moving faster. These obstacles are always overcome by simply having one of the maincharacters suddenly be able to jump higher or move faster. There is little thought to how they can overcome these problems. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't happen so often in each basketball game and the simplicity of basketball does not help this. Perhaps if these moments were explored in better ways you could make the game more entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst of the over-dramatics are the numerous points in which they make a big deal about the other team scoring having more points than them; usually only 2 or 4 points ahead. They make such a big deal about this and take the time to dramatically show how bad all of the characters are feeling each time. I don't know much about basket ball but i do know that they often score 50 points or more in each match so this makes it rather annoying to see the momentum of the game stop because the other team is ahead by 2 points. It's hard to get invested in a sports anime that takes every opportunity to make the smallest things more dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is quite good but it does make it quite hard to distinguish between the good teams and the really good teams. This distinctions is not done so well in this anime, which means that whenever they need to show that a team or player is really good it always ends up with them looking like they have superpowers. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is fine but most of the characters are quite forgettable, which is not something you should have in an anime about a team sport, especially one with only 5 players.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yes I am Biased But to hell with that !!\r\nI was playing Basketball since I was in a nutsack So naturally when this came out I was fangirling ( yes Boys can fangirl)!! Okay , so it can be a little ridiculous But hey Its an anime so just enjoy ( This shit better than crack!!!!)\r\nNow for the review\r\nStory\r\nThere was once an epic team of junior high kids that never lost called The Generation of Miracles.  People only recognize the 5 starts but there was one mystery member the team themselves respected.  That one mystery member is Tetsuya Kuroko, who everyone thinks isinvisible even though he's been standing in front of them the entire time.  Along the way he meets Kagami Taiga who's this big tough guy.  In order to win, they must go through each member of the GoM.  The plot makes you fully invest in your emotions.  It's full of laughs and heart-pounding drama.  The show totally mixes that well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nIt's absolutely great.  The art style is really amazing.  One nice touch that I didn't nottice until late was that each member of the GoM have matching hair color and eye color according to their names.  The way they play is amazing.  Their movements were memorizing and just makes you wish you could do it as well.  If I were to be a bit picky it's this weird little thing that they can run full speed for like a minute and only be half way down the court.  It should take less 10 seconds to go end to end.  Other than that nothing bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nLove the openings.  It's full of energy that gets you pumped!  It's what you expect and want to hear in a actiony sports anime.  Every character's voice matches perfectly to their personality.  Kuroko's voice is slow and monotone that it hypnotizes you like the way he plays.  Kagami's voice is loud, strong, and boistrous like him dunking the crap out of people.  Some sound bits I love is the ball going through the hoop.  As a basketball player as well, nothing sounds better than the ball going through nothing but net.  The dunking does sound a bit exagerrated but that's the show in general\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOne sign of a good sports anime is that although there's a main character, the entire team gets practically equal time to shine.  While watching, it just wasn't about Kuroko.  Everyone on his team from the bench players to the starters had a good level of importance.  All their personalities are very likeable.  As for the GoM, although they're the main antagonists (villians is a bit too much to call them) they still have quirks you'd just love.  Kise is a feminine heart-throb with some childish wonder.  Midorima is a superstitious bookworm.  Aomine is the awesome badass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for some epic basketball action, here you go.  It's difficult to talk about Kuroko no Basuke and not talk about something like Slam Dunk.  Slam Dunk preferred great story telling while KnB preferred awesome action.  It's pretty even.  However, Kuroko no Basuke is less realistic because some of the things that're done are just physically impossible.  It's an anime, though!  Of course there should be some awesome weird powers and stuff.  I definitely recommend this show to anyone in general.\\n\\n\r\nCollapse\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nstory\\n\r\n 10/10\\n\r\nanimation\\n\r\n 10/10\\n\r\nsound\\n\r\n 10/10\\n\r\ncharacters\\n\r\n 10/10\\n\r\noverall",

            "content": "Objectively this is a 7 at best. Subjectively, it's a 8 FOR ME. And here's why.\r\nI couldn't remember the last time I watched a sports anime but was attracted to the Bleach-esque art style. I wanted an anime that didn't take itself too seriously and was fun to watch. That's definitely what I got. Every time I watched an episode, I considered whether I should watch just one more.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe storyline is interesting with great dynamics everywhere. You have a main character duo who are polar opposites but bond together to achieve their dreams. You have the \"generation of miracles\" who all have different stylesand teach the main characters new things as they attempt to overcome them. The main character's motivation is well positioned going against conventional advice to form his own style. With such a great set up, we are left with the question - how will he and his partner in crime overcome all of these circumstances? The story progresses well with awesome pacing (you know its awesome when the end credits catch you by surprise). And the basketball games were EPIC. Watching characters reveal new abilities felt great and brought an intensity that I didn't think was possible in sport animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour too is just up my alley with over the top reactions that are pure fun to watch. Kuroko's placid response to everything, Kagami's bullish, thick headed approach and a female coach whose brutal coaching regime complements her failed attempts to be lady-like in awkward moments. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10 - I personally thought it was a perfect fit but obviously not \"perfection\"\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10 The soundtrack helped create a tense and well suited atmosphere for games that went to the edge.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10 - Consider them a duo, and what I like about Kuroko in particular his lack of personality brings out the best in everyone around him. Don't misintepret his lack of expression for a negative. As it makes for great humour.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10 - I loved it. Epic, intense and competitive. Loving the energy of this.\\n\\n\r\nYou will surprised every time Kagami and Kuroko overcome a near impossible battle and the logic behind the main players' techniques are great to observe while not being overpowered like in a lot of shounen cases. The main duo also don't win all the time nor are they overpowered and every time they exert themselves there's always a \"catch\". These things are important for me who don't want my suspension of disbelief to be stretched soooo far. It becomes very clear how far Kuroko & co have come and have to go, going into Season 2. And that's what I want to see in season 2, more progression. And the development of the other team mates who are mere side characters this season is much needed to build on a great foundation.\\n\\n",

            "content": "[This review is about the whole anime, seasons 1-3]\r\nKUROKO NO BASKET is an epic sports anime I\u2019d definitely recommend to everybody who is into the genre (sports and shonen surely isn\u2019t for everybody) and is looking for a well-realized, fully rounded and visually appealing anime. Next to enthralling matches there is plenty of comedy to light up the mood; the anime had me laughing a lot, especially the later seasons.\r\nI found myself to be quite a fan of sports anime, especially after I watched this one. I discovered it through recommendations of friends, and when looking what to watch next after Free!.\r\nSUMMARY\r\nKuroko Tetsuya, 16, isquite a success story when it comes down to playing basketball - in middle school he used to be the famous Generation of Miracles\u2019 mysterious phantom 6th man. Now, attending Seirin High School, he joins a new basketball club and soon becomes a valuable member, together with Kagami Taiga, 16, whose style of playing basketball couldn\u2019t be any more different from Kuroko\u2019s. One at a time, team Seirin proves itself in matches against Japan\u2019s strongest basketball players, while hoping to reach their goal of winning the elite Winter Cup.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 8\\n\r\nI will not lie - the story of Kuroko and his teammates is definitely not the most original. Without spoiling too much, it is easily forseeable who will be the winning team by the end of the 3rd Season, as is mostly the case with sports anime. While I myself did enjoy the story, I also understand the criticism concerning it and do agree that it is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. But when watching KnB, the fun is more in the \u2018how\u2019 when it comes down to winning matches, and the suspense does not fall short during the games.\\n\r\nThe main focus is definitely on the players\u2019 unique and well tought out abilities and distinct styles of playing basketball. While some abilities might seem clich\u00e9 at first (e.g. Copy Cat, predicting the future, etc.), they turn out to prove themselves highly interesting when applied to basketball, are nicely explained, and to me seem logical while being supernatural at the same time. My favorite ones turned out to be Reo Mibuchi\u2019s and Daiki Aomine\u2019s (of course) as they simply impressed me the most, but I also liked Kuroko\u2019s style because I have never heard of anything comparable before.\\n\r\nIN GENERAL - do not expect to be provided with a super original story, but instead focus on the anime\u2019s plenty of other qualities.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 10\\n\r\nThis is the place where, to me, KnB\u2019s greatest strength lies. The main characters, Kuroko and Kagami, have interesting backstories and are relatable even though one might not be a 16-year-old basketball player (as I myself am not, either). I quickly got into their weird friendship which is developing nicely as the story progresses, and definitely found myself rooting for their self-made teamplay strategies to work out.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters do not fall short in this anime, either. In almost every anime I watch, find myself liking the secondary characters more than the actual heroes, and with KnB it is no different - the entire Seirin team won me over within the first season and did not disappoint me once the entire anime. I like their dynamic, friendship and humor.\\n\r\nThe other teams\u2019 stories and abilities are equally, if not even more, captivating - every team has their ace (mostly a player from the Generation of Miracles or the Uncrowned Kings) who receives the most attention, but also the supporters get the right amount of spotlight. Many secondary characters have a fully realized backstory which is being introduced and resolved during the progression of the anime; as is often the case in Shonen anime, they all deal in some way with friendship issues. Most touching to me were Kiyoshi Teppei\u2019s and Seijuuro Akashi\u2019s storylines.\\n\r\nAs for the character design, I couldn\u2019t have been any more pleased. I\u2019m guilty of adoring Shonen/Seinen anime with as many handsome male and female characters as possible, I just can\u2019t help it. What I found very helpful was the fact that each and every one of the players displayed a distinct feature that made it easy to distinguish them even in the height of the games (e.g. bushy eyebrows, high stockings, etc.). Furthermore, I enjoyed their themes (colors with the GoM, plants for the Uncrowned Kings, etc.) and, of course, their matching hair colors, which might not appeal to everybody as it may come across as predictable (\u00e0 la spot-the-main-character).\\n\r\nMy only criticism is that the illustrator is always very heavy on the shadows (e.g. below the chin), but this is just a minor point on my quite positive list.\\n\r\nIN GENERAL - If you appreciate well-rounded main and secondary characters, interesting backstories and handsome young high school students, this anime is worth giving a try.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure not everybody will agree with me on the artstyle and animation of this anime. Judging from what I\u2019ve heard of friends that have watched it, the opinions greatly differ. I personally had close to no complaints at all, especially with regard to the 3rd season that aired in 2015 and is technically more advanced than the others. The animation is fluid, generally well done and manages to keep up with the pace of the matches. The artstyle itself I find to be beautiful and totally cute at times. It supports very well the humor and overall mood of the anime. I would describe it as bright, colorful and electronic.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - 9\\n\r\nThe music of KnB is, like the artstyle and animation as well, absolutely suitable for the anime. It is fast-paced, exciting and quite epic at times; I always like it when the main characters have their own distinct music theme, which was the case in KnB (I especially was drawn to Aomine\u2019s). The genre most frequently used for the soundtracks is techno/electronic, which I think is appropriate, refreshing, and it also works well with the animation and images; however, it might not meet everyone\u2019s taste.\\n\r\nAbout the openings - I appreciated pretty much all of them, even though I don\u2019t think they\u2019re worth raving about as musical pieces in themselves. I\u2019d rate them average regarding the large discourse of anime openings. I considered the fact that mostly songs of the same band (GRANRODEO) were used as openings successful, as the band\u2019s style is mood-setting and highly suitable for the anime.\\n\r\nHowever, the song I adore most is Lantana by OLDCODEX, which is the overall 7th ending theme of KnB (or the 3rd of Season 3). I\u2019d recommend listening to it in case you\u2019re into some lovely, melancholy J-Pop.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9\\n\r\nAs you can probably guess by now, Kuroko no Basket (and especially the 3rd Season) is one of my favorite anime. There is hardly a thing that I didn\u2019t like about it, but I am certainly not oblivious to the fact that sports anime to begin with, and KnB itself, are not made for everybody. So far I\u2019ve only heard strong opinions about it - people either love it to bits or absolutely hate it, which might be due to the fact that its style, art and music are rather distinct. I for one have watched Kuroko no Basket three times by now as well as all OVA\u2019s and movies, read the anime, and am not tired of it yet. To the contrary. I\u2019m absolutely excited for the KnB Movie Extra Game which is to air in 2017.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has really paved my way into the realm of sports anime (even though I\u2019ve seen some before) and also got me re-interested in basketball as a form of sport. I learned quite a lot about the technique and rules, which I found rather interesting. I recommend it to everyone who hasn\u2019t seen it yet - no matter if you\u2019re into sports or not - it\u2019s definitely worth checking it out.\\n\\n\r\nSHORT SUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nPROS:                                               CONS:\\n\r\n+ Engaging characters                  - Predictable story\\n\r\n+ Humor / comic relief\\n\r\n+ Interesting character abilities\\n\r\n+ Suspense\\n\r\n+ Artstyle / Animation",

I enjoyed the characters a lot, especially Kuroko (he's so cute), and I liked how the characters interacted with eachother like a family (I like those kind of things). The story was ok, but I was really into their Shutoku match, that really got me hyped up. I started to lose interest when it came down to the end because...\r\nSPOILER ALERT\r\nmy gut told me that they were going to lose and that sorta took away from the experience.\r\nThe openings and endings were pretty good, they were all catchy but I like the first ending the most. The art was prettygood also, the style is unique and they had lots of details in the movement and their jerseys.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this anime was in between 7 and 8 but I'll give it an 8. I wanted to try out more sports anime ever since I watched Haikyuu!! (TOTALLY RECOMMEND) and this was my first choice. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto Season 2!",

Even if you don't enjoy basketball you will love this it's a basketball anime with it's twist and turns. many might compare it to Slam Dunk but I wouldn't it's completely different in my opinion. I mean come on just because their both about basketball doesn't mean it's the same. A great anime to watch if you like Kuroko's Basketball is the Big Windup. It's also about aboy who has a special talent in sports even though it may not seen that SPECIAL.",

            "content": "Time to put some critic to this anime. I know that an anime who was only aired 2 episodes can't be judged fairly yet, but this is just a reflection of what has happened in those two episodes, and I will throw in a speculation about this show.\r\nWithout further ado,read further!\r\nStory:\r\n''Prodigy'' Have you ever encountered this word in an anime? Maybe two? Oh who am I kidding, you are hearing this in pretty much every action/sports shounen. And thus we have the same here.\r\nThe story explains itself by talking about a former Basketball team, the team of Teikou Middle School. The regulars of this teamwere prodigy's, and they demolished every other team in a competition, and thus they were named: ''Generation of Miracles''.  When they graduated, the 5 prodigy players went to different schools. There were rumors of the sixth player, yes a fact few known is that a sixth player existed and thus he received the nickname; ''The phantom player''\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where our protagonist kicks in. Kuroko, a freshman now attending Seirin High is the phantom player everyone talked about, and he joins the basketball. But he is not the only surprise, a player named Kagami also joins the team.  Kagami is a talented player who spend most of his childhood in the US, and learnt basketball ''from the core''. Together the two of them make a promise to beat Kuroko's teammates.\\n\\n\r\nA pretty simple plot we have thus far, and nothing really special has happened yet.\\n\\n\r\n Art: \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, and more detailed then most sports animes. Production I.G. did their best, and you can see it from the way they animated it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED soundtracks are good for this anime. They fit in well, and its a kind of rocky Japanese themed song. The OST's so far has been constributing well tot he feeling off the moment, so I am really satisfied with the music score so far. Hyadain sure did a good job so far.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSo far,t he characters aren't having any depth. We only know something about Kuroko and Kagami so far, but the rest of the team remains blanco. I had expected something more from the second episode, like providing more background. But since is this only the second episode, we can't say anythign conclusive yet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo far this has been a good anime. It started nicely, but I began it losing its quality a bit in the second episode. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

As we progress through the anime the anticipation of the next \"Generation of Miracles\" member or even the next play keeps you on the right onthe edge of your seat. We are taken through the ups and downs of a newly formed team as well as the dynamics of team chemistry as opposed to individual play. The traits of every member are revealed slowly throughout, some brief, some with decent back story. \\n\r\nEach match becomes more intense and let me just say, that the level of \"epic-ness\" achieved in the final few episodes was some TTGL level stuff.\\n\\n\r\nHope everyone enjoys it as much as I do and hope you might even be inspired to take up basketball because of it.\\n",

Let me say, Kuroko's Basketball definitely rivals a lot of action anime, and is just as intense in its vaguely similar and unique type of \"action.\"  Therefore, if you like action and fighting... watch it, just give it a try...\r\nThere's nothing complex with the story, it's cleanly cut.  Just a group of high schoolers looking to become the best in Japan, though it shows some intricacy time to time with back story, motivations, and determination.  There's nothing too differentwith the character archetypes but the synergy the anime forms between them makes for really inspiring and funny moments that'll make you feel good.  I would also like to point out that there is really no villain in this anime with a few exceptions, which is really unique in that no evil villain is needed to progress the anime. \\n\\n\r\nPlot elements aside, a main strength of the anime is probably its action.  If you like swords, fighting, magic all that stuff you'll definitely be interested in the \"action\" scenes in Kuroko's basketball.  Though its not actual fighting, the intensity and flare in which the scenes convey are really entertaining and amazing making you forget the reality that you are watching a basketball anime.  There's not much else to say besides the fact the the action is really good.\\n\\n\r\nMy motivations for watching this anime are the intense basketball match scenes, watching the characters progress as players and become stronger while staying determined, and the occasional comic relief and montage episodes that build up to the heart of the story and action.  Watch it, then watch the second season, because the animation definitely gets vamped up and things get more hyped.\\n\\n",

The first season was definitely amazing. But the second season is lowering the anime from masterpiece to just great. The reason for this is because it is a serious disappointment. The picture quality, although still good, is a far cry from that of the first season. The action, story plot and background music are seriously lacking and I hate how they decided to add unneededgags and provocative parts. It sucks. The show never needed these things and the addition is just ruining the atmosphere. There may still be time to improve the second season to be as great as the first but as it is there will probably not be a second season. My ratings are just of the first season.",

            "content": "Special abilities + Shounen + Super Saiyan Power + Sports = Kuroko no Basuke\r\nI think this series is criticised quite a lot due to its unrealistic nature but honestly it is a shounen anime what else due you expect to see, some diligently hard working players that have no flames coming out of their bodies, That's impossible for this series.\r\nStory: 8 - The Generation of Miracles were five legendary players that played basketball together in the Teiko middle school Basketball Team. But there was a rumour about a phantom 6th player that the five respected. Taiga Kagami came to Seirin High School after returning backfrom America. In the basketball team he meets Tetsuya Kuroko who has a very weak pressence. Kagami is shocked to find that Kuroko is in fact really bad at Baskeball. But Kuroko's weak-pressence lets him pass the ball around without the other team noticing him, and he's none other than the sixth member of the Miracle Generation. Kuroko makes a pact with Kagami to defeat the other members of the Miracle Generation that have now parted ways. And its battle time. Its more or less a typical shounen with sports but it's enjoyable which makes it nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 - The was pleasing and the motion was swift which made it even easier to watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 - The did create a mood and tense up the atmosphere but I wouldn't make an effort to listen to it again which make the soundtrack more or less  satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 - The characters were done nicely as they contrasted each other especially Kagami and Kuroko who've been portrayed as the light and shadow but despite being the opposite of each other they'll still stay together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - Though it was a bit typical and predictable but it's a fun watch that can be adjusted to our sights easily. This series is recommended to anyone but especially those who like shounen or sports anime.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who liked: Slam Dunk,Prince of Tennis,Eyeshield 21,Haikyuu!,Hoop Days,Chihayafuru,Hajime no Ippo and Diamond no Ace will like this series due to similarities in the way sports is portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 - Overall I liked this series and I think if you don't mind the unrealism then you'd enjoy this series a lot.",

I may need therapy to get over this series. \r\nStory: The story revolves around Seirin High school's basketball team becoming the best in Japan. It isn't a very complicated plot line but its very fun and each episode ends in a cliff hanger. In all honesty I watched this entire series over a 2 day period, I just couldn't get enough!\r\nArt: I don't like watching animes with art that is atlow qualities and this was not low quality art in the least. It was very well put together and crisp.\\n\r\nSound: The opening and closing songs can bring tears to my eyes. They sounded good and the series as a whole makes me want to cry(in a good way.) The background music at intense times blended so well with what was going on. An amazing job. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It was nice how we were introduced to the generation of miracles at a slow rate. It really kept me wondering who they were and they were all so likable. I ship this anime way too hard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: MASTERPIECE. Of all the animes I have seen this one is making me sorta speechless. It has taken over my life, and has probably ruined it as well. (Good animes just do that too you.) When the second series ends I won't be leaving my house for awhile.",

            "content": "To give some context, I will be completely honest: I am no sports anime fan, and I watched this because I saw the Anime recommendations of Free! (Yes, that fanservice swimming anime.)\r\nNow that I got that out of the way, I will proceed with my review.\r\nI was very exceptical of KnB from the start; \"This is just a childish sports anime\" I said, but after getting my hands on it, I gave it a chance, because there must be a reason for it's popularity, right?\r\nSuffice to say, I was blown away.\r\nWhere do I start?\r\nLet's start with the story: Kuroko is the Phantom Sixth Man ofthe Generation of Miracles, a bunch of basketball prodigies. He graduates and enters to Seirin High, where he meets Kagami, a tall american guy who is very talented at Basketball, and they bow to be the best players in Japan. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, this may seem boring to most people who aren't interested in sports. But as we learn the backstories and motivations, you will start to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most \"shonen\" element of the series are the skills used in the matches, such as a team using martial arts movements, Kuroko's ninja passes, a coach that can accurately predict all the movements of the opposing team, and even a guy that can do full court shots. And while some may dislike this, I think it makes the anime more interesting and more accessible to people that aren't basketball fans, such as myself.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, I was clapping and cheering as if I was watching a real match. I've never been a sports fan, but I grew highly attached to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAh, the characters. They are, in my opinion, what make the series so enjoyable. They're all likeable, even (or should I say, especially) the foes. They all have their own motivations, unique personalities and development. The focus on the series are Kagami and the Generation of Miracles (at least 4/6 of them, the other 2 appear in the next season and the 22.5 Tip Off OVA).\\n\\n\r\nOn the sound, I can give this a 10 with confidence. I never skipped any of the Openings or endings, and the music for the matches was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fluid. Just by looking at Aomine's matches, you can see they went into great detail with the Animation. I didn't give this a 10 because it was lacking, but because it wasn't KyoAni's level.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series through and through, and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. I cannot recommend it enough.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. If you're looking for slash shipping, there's plenty of material here too.",

See, even before watching the anime this guy was invisible.\r\nStory:9/10\r\nI really do enjoy competitive Anime, but my problem is that the story is quite overused. A weak team, becomes a strong team. But this is more than this. We are introduced to the Generation of Miracles! Basketball Prodigies, and the Phantom sixth man Kuroko. The journey is outstanding, it really deserved a 10/10 but I had to deduct a point because I felt that the outcome was predictable.But other than that I loved this anime. And the creation of an invisible basketball plaer, Kuroko, someone with no presence. Who knew your weakness could become your strength??\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is clean and crisp despite an anime from 2012. I was impressed, all the basketball matches looked realistic with a hint of supernatural. It was like each player on Seirin had superpowers.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\\n\r\nA Hardcore OST to suit a hardcore anime. The music had me holding my breath in places and cheering them on in places. Flawless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. You know almost everyone from every team in this anime. Little is left out. My only problem was there was NO character depth of Kuroko and Kagami, the two MAIN CHARACTERS, and now being in the second season there still is not enough depth. Kuroko was a member of the Generation of miracles, yet his experiences with them are hardly shown and all we know about his experiences are the little snapshots of when Kuroko tells Kagami about each character. This was disappointed as it felt Kuroko wasn't much a part of the Generation of miracles, and it sounds more like he heard of them rather than him playing with them at one point.",

I also am not a fan of watching sports in general. But when I watched Kuroko No basket i couldn't stop. I have rewatched it multiple times (4 to be exact)\r\nSo starting with characters, I just love all the characters. Sure i know that it isn't as realistic and true, but they do an amazing job making it seem real and true and possible. Also even thought the plot may be simple; beat all the teams in Japan,theres way more than that. The characters each have their own backgrounds, problems, and varying degrees of enthusiasm, but thats what makes it great. the games are very detailed and well animated, and for someone who didn't understand basket ball, i so do now. Its not boring as it might seem, but interesting as there is a lot of character development and moments. And theres a lot of action and some comedy thrown in there. The theme of teamwork and Kuroko's take on basketball and how a real team should play. The music and animation is on point and very compelling. the story, the sound, the characters, the feel of the game... very well done. So even if you aren't a fan, you should totally check this out... It may be simple as a plot but overall its is Great!",

            "content": "There's a few things Kuroko no Basket really do that pisses me off. I binged this in a day, and the anime started off very strong, but ended up seemingly poorly executed. \r\nLet's start with the major pros:\r\nThe comedic relief, probably the best part of the show, it has a lot of running gags through their characters and use comedy to lighten the mood, without this, the anime would probably completely have flopped and I would have failed to watched the entire season.\r\nThe animation is good, after having watched slam dunk it's nice to see some better animating of dribling, shooting and dunking.\r\nThe music andsound was well used to set the mood and get you hyped when important events har happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe cons:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I have never felt more disconnected from the characters than in this anime. More  or less the whole team Kuroko plays on get's no character development and are just pale and boring. We learn more or less nothing about them, and the bench is even worse. We know nothing of his fellow 1st years and they are never really seen playing. I knew more about the starters on the enemy teams than I did about the bench of the team that I was following for 25 episodes. The miracle generation was almost a shitty joke. On the court they're shitty characters because they are overpowered and in theory impossible to beat, so seeing Kuroko and his team beating them felt meaningless because it was just stupid. Out of the court, they were actually well written characters with good development, aside from Aomine who just doesn't change throughout the season. Kuroko and Kagami do not have much character development either, but it was still enough for me to let it slide.\\n\r\nThe worst character in this whole season was without a doubt Momoi, I have no idea why she was there, why she was written like she was. She was a meaningless character to me. She was introduced as Kuroko's love interest, but they had no development, no real back story and I still have no idea what the point was of writing her character. Was it so they could at just a little character to the strategist of Touou? I have no idea, maybe it was so they could have a big boobed girl run around for some fan service. It's truly one of the most pointless characters I have seen in an anime. There was no reason what so ever in the first season that she was written like that. \\n\\n\r\nThe basketball itself started out interesting, the concept of Kuroko was amazing because he had very large limits. It made him a little boring but it was interesting to see how he would progress his basketball through practice and games in the season. The problem started after Kise with Midorima. Without spoiling let's just say that Midorima is beyond a little unrealistic, watching him play was just stupid, it's like he has super hero powers and it just falls short because it's so ridiculous, I truly wish they would just have made him highly skilled and not a god/super hero. Kise wasn't that bad in the first game you see him, but the last game you see him play is also just boring and stupid. He also turns into a god/super hero. The only one who's actually just (so far) a VERY highly skilled individual is Aomine, unfortunately he's the least likeable character cause he gets no character development\\n\\n\r\nThe anime ended up falling short for me, it was average and worth a watch if you have noting else, but when there is so much more anime that has way better writing whether sport anime or not I find it foolish to sit down and watch this. I would recommend skipping this unless you just want to watch \"cute\" guys making stupid plays.",

It follows several high school basketball teams. Several prodigies have been born in the Tokyo area and have been named The Generation Of Miracles. In the first season 4 members are revealed in detail. Kise Ryota who can copy any move after seeing it once. Midorima Shintaro a long range sniper. Aomine Diaki who is just a straight up beast. The main team is Seirin which is a new school but did quite well in their first year.They get even more talent with first years Kagami Taiga who can jump out the gym and Kuroko Tetsuya the phantom six man of The Generation Of Miracles. The other two members of The Genration Of Miracles, Akashi Seijuro and Murasakibara Atsushi are not really seen much in the first season. The characters are all very different but all share a serious desire for victory. The characters look very cool as well. I seriously recomend this anime if you are even a mild basketball fan but people who don't really enjoy basketball can get into it too. There are also many comic aspects in this anime. All in all a seriously entertaining watch.",

            "content": "I have to say, this was one of the most unpredictable anime I have enjoyed watching for quite awhile now.\r\nOf all the 50+ series that I have watched, I have never watched a sport anime. Kuroko no Basket is the very first anime I have seen and from the start of episode one until where I am, I cannot stop watching it.\r\nI'm very surprised. This was not what I have expected it. The way they show you how to play basketball just really caught my attention. They way they lure you in on one of the best games you can imagine, you really cannot turnit away.\\n\\n\r\nI love the sound, the personality of the characters, the humor, the art, everything is just so awesome.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommended it to anybody, just anybody. It's not just for people who loves sports. I'm a heavy anime watcher for romance/yaoi/action but this is just another type of anime I love to see.\\n\\n\r\nI love the opposite personality of the main character Kuroko and the other guy (who I forgot his name OTL||...SORRY). \\n\\n\r\nI have not watched half of the anime yet so I'm not sure what will be in store for me, but I just got to say this is very enjoyable and I would love another one of these sport animes :).",

            "content": "Kuroko no Basket is a highly anticipated, highly loved and controversial anime, about basketball. I was rather curious when watching, but my expectations are paid. This anime makes its position in my heart as one of my all-time favorite.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nKuroko no Basket has 'underdogs to winners' plot often used and recycled in anime, with Seirin as a young basketball team aiming to win the national basketball championship. Yet I still find this anime exciting thanks to its fine writing and flow. Each character has something to contribute to the story, not just the sake of being there. The events and matches flow nicely, feels realisticand not forced. They also balance between the highly adrenaline-pumping matches with some daily life happenings. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nBishounen, bishounen with muscles everywhere.. ok let me get back on track.\\n\r\nI like how they make the background for Kuroko no Basket, it is highly detailed. Even the audiences are not just some random blobs. The colors are bright and cheerful, at times gloomy, suitable with the mood of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are quite clean and sharp but with personality. I like how they keep the shadings used in the manga for the anime. It gives more energy and feels manly. The animation is fluid, especially in Aomine's movements when playing and the super skills. Close up shots are not just stills with their mouth moving, but along with small gestures we often do in real life (like blinking, shrug) which is very detailed. The matches are exciting, especially with angles that make the best use of composition and the effects. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are catchy and fun. Openings are performed by GRANDRODEO (the vocalist being the seiyuu of Himuro) while endings by OLDCODEX (the seiyuu of Takao is a part of the band). The songs are very iconic, pumping your excitement.\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs are cool as well, combining rock electric guitar with some other tunes. While there are no specific theme for the show, I find myself enjoying it and can recall several matches when I heard the song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are likable and easy to recognize - especially Kuroko, Kagami and Generation of Miracles with their colorful hairs, also Seirin team members with their personalities and screen time. Many people thought this show is yaoi but the characters are straight!!\\n\\n\r\nI love the character development and bond with each other, how they joke around, get annoyed yet still supporting each other and work together to win. The bond in Seirin team is especially strong, making me root and cheer for them from my seat, then scream with joy and punch my fist to the air when they win a match. The Generation of Miracles at first I thought are very overpowered, but the backstory provided makes me admire their passion for basketball. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI find this anime is really engaging, making you want to watch and watch and watch until finish. Episodes are cut in the right places as cliffhangers makes you squirm and ended up playing the next episode. I cannot stop myself from watching, I ended up doing marathon until the end. \\n\\n\r\nI am not really fan of basketball as a sport, I can play but just decent, I don't really watch real life games like NBA and such. However, watching Kuroko no Basket makes me pumped up and want to play! That is how much I enjoy it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile Kuroko no Basket has some impossible basketball powers like The Zone, Aomine's formless shoot, etc. and may not be realistic to sport fans, I suggest: don't let it hinder you from watching. It is too fun to be missed. I end up reading the manga until now because I'm too curious how the story will progress.\\n\\n\r\nI have also finished the season 2, waiting for the 3rd season!",

Could not stop reading! the entire story just kept you on edge and you feel the excitement welling up inside.\r\nWith that i was hoping the anime wouldn't disappoint and ruin a great title. and it didn't. From the very first episode, almost everything was perfect. The art, action and sound. and I cannot emphasize how much the bgm played a major part in creating the atmosphere whether its excitement, seriousness etc. Credit to the director and sound director.  It is so awesomeand you can feel the adrenaline while watching, i can't remember the last time i felt that when watching an anime. \\n\r\nOn a little downside, i felt the comedy was lacking. It had much more of an impact in the manga. Could've been better in showing Kagami's emotions and reactions.\\n\\n\r\n-minor spoiler?-\\n\r\nStory wise, i'm not crazy over the kuroko disappearing act thou. Thinking that its a supposedly a realistic sports genre, and within a basketball court.. i cant see how a player can 'disppear'/ lose focus on a mark. But oh well thats anime i guess, someone needs to be outstanding. Besides that i love the story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - its an awesomeeeee anime and i'm not missing any episode for anything. I really hope the anime can keep going and produce a 2nd season in the future.\\n",

I thought that was it for my enjoyment of sports anime with a 'heart', but after picking up \"Kuroko no Basuke\", my faith in this genre has been restored to the utmost!\r\nTo be sure, it does have moments of athletic incredibility, but like many successful sports shonen, it does take the time to dissect each thought process and game execution for the watcher to absorb.\r\nNot sure why it has gained the dissapproval of some anime/manga fans but that attention has given this series even more life imo.\r\nEnjoy!",

It's because it's just a standard manga about sports. Sometimes the protagonist's have to win, so that's what makes the story kinda easy to predict. I was going to give it a 6, but when I think about it again, the story has different elements from Slam Dunk or Dear Boys. Actually, I'm not into sports manga or anime.\r\nArt - 10\r\nHonestly. The art is AWESOME. I have nothing more to say.\r\nSound - 8\r\nThe OSTs are standard, butthey do have a certain spark in it which makes you love it. I especially love the music when Kuroko first shows his ability.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nThis is the very reason of why I watch this anime. The development of the characters are the BEST ones I've ever seen so far. You rarely seen characters like Kuroko.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. Even though the genre is not my favorite, but I REALLY like this. The running gags are enough to make me laugh it loud, and Kuroko's straightforwardness is the main point :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nI recommend you to watch this anime. Sure there are flaws, but overall, I like this anime. This anime even encourages me to play basketball again.\\n\\n\r\nJust watch and you'll understand.",

In which the protagonist (kuroko) wants to have a team play basketball which he is not experience in Middle School (Teiko). Well, as the story progress. We saw the progresses of every member of Seirin as well as the former team mates of Kuroko changes their beliefs and they realized that Basketball is more fun than before. Though Murasakibara(Yosen) and Akashi(Rakuzan) didn't fully appeared in this season. It's very exciting to see the players growth episode by episode and also I want to see Kuroko, Kagamiand others to play at Winter Cup. I hope the producer of this makes a Season 2..\\n\\n\r\nThe art (anime) was great compared on the manga though I'm very thankful for the mangaka who created it.. (salute!). The sounds are great too. the timing etc. especially if they played on tournaments, practice etc. It makes more exciting. The OSTs are great also. When you hear the first to opening. It serves as a refresher, it makes people to watch more from start to finish. Granrodeo are great band. There unique JROCK band. kudos!..\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are great as I mentioned earlier on their growth. And lastly it has a sense that people may laugh. The humors are great specially when the coach cooks food.. haha.. totemo tanoshii.. :)\\n\\n\r\nWell, If people ask me.. This is like the new Slam Dunk. It is like the oldies experience excitement watching Slam Dunk from those days. Well I also loved Slam Dunk (Hisashi Mitsui #14 of course!). but Kuroko no Basuke is also a great ones.. :) \\n\\n\r\nPlease make Season 2 for this one.. Onegaishimasu!.. :)",

            "content": "About the STORY\r\nThe key plot is different from the usual that makes the edge of the series from others. There are also nice explorations on different basketball techniques. It is educational and something that you only get on sports series. It is all nice that the storyline has quite fast pacing but it\u2019s hurting the story of the series. There is not much story or drama on it because of the extremely fast pacing of the storyline. \r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nThe thing about sports series is there will always be quite the number of characters. There are lots of interesting characters to choose from. Of course,it is given that in sports series there would be arrogant opponents that give more thrill in the story. But, if the fast pacing of the storyline is hurting the story itself, the characters\u2019 development is even more affected. There is almost no time for characters to be explored. \\n\\n\r\nAbout KUROKO TETSUYA\\n\r\nOne of the original in the series is the protagonist\u2019s character which indeed quite rare for a sports series. It\u2019s really ironic that it is given that protagonists should stand out from the rest of the characters but what if the protagonist\u2019s role in the first place is not to stand out. It\u2019s a first and can be challenging as well but the writer still manage to justify the protagonist role even if it\u2019s primary feature is not to have a presence. The funniest thing is that even with the titular name, Kuroko is almost not exactly the protagonist himself. The center of the plot in the series is more on Kagami. The series features more of the amazing abilities of Kagami. Hence, their tandem is made. Opposite attract; one is expressionless and the other is so expressive, one is cool/calm and the other is hot-headed, one is small and then other is huge. It also just so happens that they are blue and red which is known to be always paired with each other. The light and shadow thing is really perfect to describe these two.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe basketball games are made thrilling and as different as possible. It\u2019s animated nicely with the incorporation of latest graphics. It\u2019s almost believable which basketball fans would still appreciate. The character designs are also well made.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite ironic that the first thing that I like about the series is the fast pacing of the storyline and it just so happens to be what is lacking with Slamdunk which is my only concern with it. However, if Slamdunk was extremely slow with lots of flashbacks, this time it\u2019s extremely fast. You would be surprise that within one episode there\u2019s actually two consecutive important games. There is countless uniqueness in the series which really makes it a refreshing anime experience. With the huge amount of animes of today, even a slight originality in a series always gets my attention immediately. I also like that the series is trying to convey the true meaning of teamwork. It is definitely important in almost all sports particularly in basketball.\\n",

He is very hard to find because he lacks presence, he is very straight forward, unlike Taiga Kagami who is very decieving and he is a character who usually gets worked up easily. \nThis anime is excellent in graphics because even if you don't realize it they are seamlessly done. \nThe sound was good but it could have been better given more time, the characters tend to have you on your feet through out this anime. \nAnd in my opinion it is probably the best sport animeI have seen so far. The games tend to be exaggerated through emotion but very well done. I applaud this anime and I apologise for this review being so short, but if you want to get hooked on a fantastic anime this is it.",

            "content": "Anime Review #1 - Kuroko No Basket\r\nBy cBuny\r\nI was never a Sport fan, so I didn't bother watching any Sport genre anime. But this anime was surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch that when I decided to watch I couldn't stop. ( Unfortunately there was only 25 episodes so I finished in 2 days :| )\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nStory is very simple and similar to other Sport anime. It is about a team aiming for the top. There are plot-twists here and there, but the most important thing is that even how simple it is, it is still unique :)\r\nArt - 9/10\r\nIf you are a basketballfan, you will see how unrealistic this anime is ( Even if your're not like me you will still notice ). But I realize it is for the best. The unrealistic and flashy art is the key to the enjoyment I was talking about. Without this colorful and exaggerated art, I wouldn't even bother with this anime. So you could say it is the reason why non-sport fans like me are watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nOne word, AMAZING. When they play, the music keeps me hyper and the noises are just simply fantastic. The sounds made me nervous but excited at the same time. Truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nEven this anime, there are so many unique characters. Each character has a special skill or power and different look. Important characters have bright, colorful hair colors, including the Generation of Miracles, Kagami, Kuroko, and the girl with Pink hair ( forgot her name ). When I watched this I wanted to find out all the different skills they have so I keep on watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nI couldn't stop watching and finished this in 2 days. I really really enjoy this anime and when I got to the last episode I gave Sport anime a try ( Now watching Prince of Tennis ). I will definitely re-watch this Season while waiting for Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nRecommend for everyone even if you don't like Sport. Give this a try and you will find out how exciting and entertaining this anime really is. I think Kuroko no Basket is my #1 Sport anime.",

            "content": "Almost every single sports anime share one same thing: incredible, extraordinary and impossible plays in middle of the game, the kind which you can't recreate in real life even if you tried; the only people that might actually do what is done here by some kids or teenagers are those who are in Guiness' Records. So you can't ask an anime of this type to be realistic in tearms of plays and stuff like that, the only thing that must feel real is the characters and what they go through, and at that Kuroko no Basuket does a wonderful job at that.\r\nI toyed a loton wherever I gave it a 9 or a 10, but in the end the 9 is because sometimes the animes spends too much time explaining what we already know, but that doesn't make it any less great.\\n\r\nWe're in a world in which Japan is forming wonderful baketball players in high school; there's a bunch of guys who went to the same school and were called \"The generation of miracles\" because they were unbeatable. Among them there is Kuroko, who seems pretty useless at first, but he is the best at passing and stealing. What I like the best of this idea is that usually the protagonist of a sports anime is so strong that he can actually beat a team by himself; Kuroko can't, instead he makes his team stronger. Basketball is a game played by a team after all, so choosing a lead that actually focus on drawing out the potential of the rest of his teammates is refreshing. The concept is great and the plot revolves (as any other sport anime) in winning tournaments. It's pretty straight forward, but not any less entertaining. Kuroko no basket doesn't need plot twist, only the intensity that each game bring. And why are they so intense? Because of the characters.\\n\r\nOne thing Kuroko no basket has done right is developing fully realized characters; none of them is flat, all of them have some kind of background that is consistent with their personalities and so they feel more real, we grow to like each of them (and even hate some) and that makes everything dead serious. If you watch a NBA match and your team wins you feel pumped inside and you feel gloom if they lose; the same thing happens here, you have a team you really like and you start feeling the intensity because you want them to succeed, and everything becomes more real even while there are plays that seem oddly unrealistic, but that only makes it more fun! And I think while other sports anime are known for going over the top, Kuroko no basket never goes there, because the lead doesn't have the ability to show off, not even Kagami becomes bothersome as we're quickly shown that the rest of the team is fairly skilled too and so the anime makes good use of not only the 2 leads, but also the supporting characters as well, creating a great and necessary balance.\\n\r\nIn the end, it's an anime that you can easily get into, that you'll most likely enjoy and get hooked. And even while the final episode leave us halfway through the series (or so), there's a second season announced! So don't hold back thinking that it won't have a proper ending, enjoy it because in the world of sports animes Kuroko no basket is at the top.",

            "content": "If you asked my friends and family, what\u2019s my favorite hobby? What do I like to do more than anything else? Then they\u2019ll tell you \u201cbasketball\u201d without a doubt. It\u2019s true, for as long that I remember I have been in love with basketball and I\u2019ve been playing it for 16 years. So, when a friend told me, \u201chey, there\u2019s this awesome anime about basketball, you should totally check it out.\u201d I was excited. Until I watched it.\r\nThis is my review of \u201cKuroko No Basket\u201d a 2011 anime directed by Shunsuke Tada and produced by studio IG. It is an adaptation of the manga bythe same name written by Tadatoshi Fujimaki. Lets see if this show is an airball or a slam dunk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nKuroko No Basket is about Kuroko and Taiga Kagami as they both strive to become the best high-school basketball players in japan, Taiga the star and Kuroko, the darkness that makes the star shine even brighter. This darkness is a key attribute of Kuroko, because even on the court defending plays forget he\u2019s even there, paired with his great passing ability makes him a great point guard that sets up Taiga well. Taiga is a dominate athlete who throws down massive dunks every game and is a great defender to boot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style, like the music is plain, it\u2019s not bad but not good either it just gets the job done. My biggest problem with Kuroko no basket, is the basketball. I do like the character\u2019s as Kuroko can be funny at times and they really play as if every game is their last.\\n\\n\r\nKuroko No Basket falls apart as soon as it hits the hardwood. There are so many things that just plain wrong. My biggest issue are the camera angles that they chose to use during the games, the field of view is so narrow that at most you can see 2-3 plays at one time. Compare that to any television broadcast of a college or professional game where all ten players are visible unless they\u2019re transitioning from offense to defense. This narrow field of view also makes it impossible to see what going on and where the players are at on the court. What\u2019s more infuriating is that none, absolutely none of the teams in this anime run any set plays. No off-ball screens, no pick and rolls, no motion and no zone press, there\u2019s just nothing but players dribbling the ball for 30 seconds at a time. Now I understand that most of the problems during the basketball scenes are due to limited animation budgets and time to create these scenes. But I can\u2019t look past the lack of plays, I can\u2019t look past the lack of help defenders and it absolutely kills me when a player takes five dribbles from the three-point line to the basket and they\u2019re not even in the paint yet. The dunks have no impact due to not having any sound effects and far to often the players take off with incorrect footwork distracting me from something that should be awesome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of missed opportunities in Kuroko no basket. It would be awesome if teams in the anime mimicked similar styles and plays from actual teams and players. I think it would be awesome to see a team replicate a \u201chorns\u201d set from the Clippers or a Spanish pick and roll like the Rockets run, it would make all the games more fun for fans of NBA basketball.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think Kuroko no basket is a bad show. I feel like it will be enjoyable to many people, but It just doesn\u2019t do it for me. Younger basketball fans would absolutely love this show. But there\u2019s too many problems that distract me from enjoying this show, thus I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone that takes basketball seriously.\\n",

            "content": "So this is gonna be my first and last review, since I'm not into stuff like that, but i just had to write one for this show, since all the ones I've read don't actually tackle the main issue the anime has - it has almost no connection to basketball whatsoever.\r\nKuroko no Basket's a decent to very good anime, It basically feels like the most average anime out there to me. And by that, what i mean is, It has so many of those anime clich\u00e9s. A fiery tall (even though the dude's 190cm which is actually barely tall enough to make a basketball team)dude teams up with a passive regular guy with a mysterious back story. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? The anime itself does nothing new, which doesn't necessarily makes it bad, but It's a fair warning to those who're looking for new and interesting animes to watch. This isn't the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, i'll dig in to the biggest problem with the anime that i had. The basketball aspect of it. That was supposed to be the thing that separates it from the other ones, that brings some ingenuity to the show. It doesn't. As a huge basketball fan, and a guy who plays it on the regular, I was immensely disappointed. While watching the show, I couldn't shake the feeling that the creators didn't even try to research what basketball is, how it's played and why it's such a beautiful game. Nobody expected Japanese anime creators to be that familiar with it in the first place, but this was just beyond disappointing. The anime could've been about 10 teens playing dice against eachother and it would've still been exactly the same.\\n\r\nAnd I promise I'm not being too harsh, I'm not gonna bash on them for repeating the exact same dunk 30 times in the season, or a variety of 3 passes and 2 shots, I get it, a fast paced sport isn't that easy to animate and they didn't want that to be the focal point in the first place.\\n\r\nBut come on. In one episode, the protagonist team faces off against a team that's supposed to have the best defense in Tokyo. Apperently they use some sort of martial art training to be that good at it, which is beyond reasonable, but that's not even the main issue. The team is literally doing the worst thing you can on defense - They're overcommiting to their man. Why's that? How does a team beat 5 excelent defenders that stick to you like glue? Well, there's this really simple thing in basketball, called a \"screen\". I'm not gonna go into any depth to explain what it is, but i promise you, you can't watch an actual basketball game and not see it happen at least 10 times. It's as old as basic as a lay-up.\\n\r\nAnd again, there are dozens of even worse situations in the show, which obviously come up from the creators lack of basketball knowledge. Another great example would be that Kagami, their tallest guy and center, obviously isn't their center. So the floor spacing makes absolutely no sense. And this is all a consequence of the creators lack of knowledge to what a post-up is. There are 0 post-ups in the show. Again, watch a basketball game. There won't be less then 10 post-ups, i promise.\\n\r\nAnd, this next example I want to talk about is just beyond me. I don't even know what the hell the creators were doing. In a LOT of the scenes where they're playing a game, and one of the team is on the offense, there's literally an offensive player behind that halfcourt line. Sometimes there's even two. There's two dudes, in a basketball game, just chilling in the backcourt, while the star of the team is handling the ball, even though he's usually the center and has no business of doing that, as the clocks ticking down ( although there's no 24 sec clock in the show either, sometimes the offensive play lasts for about a min or so). Id be shocked if there was ever a case of that happening, or if it ever happens in an actual basketball game.\\n\r\nThere's times where the player scores/makes a defensive play, or whatever, and the players just forget that they're on the court playing basketball. By that i mean, they get into deep conversations and such for again, a minute or so, destroying the entire flow of the game.\\n\\n\r\nI want to finish by saying that the characters are alright, the plots not enjoyable even though it's insanely unoriginal, the animation is nice (expect when they're playing basketball, which one would think should've been their main focus), so it's not a bad show. Just stay away from it if you're searching for a show about basketball. Or even if you'd like a show where basketballs a small part of it. This has got nothing to with it, other then the general clich\u00e9s that apply to all sports (teamwork beats talent, never give up, work hard and you'll be rewarded etc.).\\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you don't care about basketball, and just want a decent anime with familiar content within it, give it a go, it's a pretty decent anime by those standards.\\n\\n\r\nOverall grade: Average (5/10)\\n",

I had a lot of fun with this anime not just from the games but from the overall story. The ending game was fantastic and got me pumped for more. A lot of the times, it does feel less like basketball and more like Dragonball z, especially nearthe end, but this isn't an anime to criticize for realism. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Level: 8/10",

The intense friendship the characters have is very sweet and both the drawing style and plot will fascinate you.\r\nI really recommend watching KuroBase to everyone and hope there will be a second season soon.",

And if you are looking for a technical and innovate anime... forget about it.\r\nThe premise is interesting and causes a little curiosity for the viewer... but there are some ridiculous and obvious moments, besides there are predictable characters and situations.\r\nBUT, the anime IS VERY FUN. This is the kind of anime that you watch just for distraction... because technically you will not find anything diferente from the average.\r\nI need to admit that i will see the other seasons because it is a really fun anime (and ithink that you'll have fun even if you're not a basketball fan). That was my impression about Kuroko no Basket!  \\n",

            "content": "So let me begin with saying a little about myself. I am in no way connected with basketball, in fact I am normally not that interested in sports. At least that is what I was until I watched this anime. Now this is definetly a sports genre and something that sounds really tough to make interesting. The story is really, really good. I am really impressed with what the mangaka has had to offer. The flow of the whole thing is really good. There places where everything may feel a little rushed but not in major parts. The art is quite good but Iam a little disappointed since there weren't that many specticular views. I mean when you think of basketball you can always do a more interesting point of view here and there. Don't misunderstand me I like the style of the art it's the animators that haven't done that perfection. I am hoping that in the second season we will se a higher quality. The sound is well really good. The first opening is something that I have put in my own playlist. And well when someone plays basketball you really feel like you are part of the game.\\n\r\n Now the characters, oh god the characters. Everyone is so different, everyone has a style, everyone is special. Dear god I can't stress out how good they were made. Individals is what I like seeing in Shonen anime and is what many other like too. They are the base of everything. Art and story can be improved but characters can not be changed that dramatically. Even though this anime doesn't need much improvement to reach perfection. \\n\r\n Needless to say enjoyment was 10/10.",

I watched the first season when it originally came out and the show just seems very dull. I've tried rewatching this show 3 times already, each time hoping to get into it, but it's just not interesting. \r\nGreat if you like male eyecandy and fanservice, but other than that, it seems very bland. The characters were alright, the story was fine, the art is really good, but overall i just felt bored by every episode. It feels like a chore to watch. Kind of like a \"cookie cutter\"show. Not sure if i'm missing something or not. (Plus the \"super powers\" they give these people are ridiculous for a sports anime, but I didn't let that bother me at all, it was a cool concept I guess).\\n\\n\r\nI'd say give this show a chance, if you dont like the first 3 episodes or so, just drop it. It's not worth your time if you aren't into it.  \\n\\n\r\nCheers! ^^",
