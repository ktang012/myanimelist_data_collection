            "content": "Sangatsu no Lion's first five minutes contain a scene I might characterise as one of the best in animation. A boy listlessly wakens, drinking out of necessity, dressing out of obligation, and leaving his sterile apartment out of confusion, an existence so fragile it could perish with the wind. He doesn't say anything. He doesn't tell people about his problems. He just moves on with his life. \r\nAt first I did not understand why this scene had such an impact on me. I thought it could have been the beautiful music, or perhaps the captivating artwork so characteristic of Shaft. That wasn't it. What overwhelmedme was how illustrative it was of human life. \\n\\n\r\nPeople often describe their favourite pieces of fiction with vague terms such as \"brilliant\" or \"life-changing\". Sangatsu no Lion is not life-changing, least not in the sense of it developing for me a different personality, or in creating new passions. What it did, rather, is give me the tools to better understand myself and, more importantly, why I am here. And that is the greatest answer of all.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Sangatsu no Lion is powerful would be an understatement. There are numerous moments, much like the opening scene, that do much with little. Most things are left implicit and unsaid. A simple, everyday conversation between family, about what their plans could be for the next day, or a brief conversation about one's quiet hometown can contain more weight and characterisation than a series might in its entire duration. Sangatsu no Lion is as well masterfully-produced, a technical triumph, Shaft's greatest accomplishment. \\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is at its surface an anime about shogi, but at its core a coming-of-age story of overcoming depression. Rei, the series' protagonist, is a deeply and inherently flawed being. He is timid - incapable of speaking his mind or getting his feelings across - and unhappy with his role in life. Many characters do not understand why he is this way, and indeed, for someone so gifted at shogi-- enough as to turn it into a career from a young age-- and blessed by such having such a kind family care for him, it is easy to be envious and to question why someone in his position could ever feel unsatisfied. He is still in his teens, after all, so it could merely be an irrational fit of teenage angst. And so they think, and so they patronise him.\\n\\n\r\nThere is more to Rei than the people around him give credit for. He never had a real family, nor even a youth, hence why he goes to school in an aimless search of one. He has nothing he can relate to but shogi. Even shogi brings him pain, as his thirst for victory ends only with him driving the loser to disappointment and despair. He needs to feed on other people's happiness to give meaning to his own existence, as without shogi, he will have nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't meant to instil feelings of pity in the viewer. Rei's problems, while significant and real, aren't much different from what everyone else in his world is dealing with. His eventual mentor, Shimada, struggles with a fear of disappointing others and with a chronic sickness that disrupts his ability to play shogi. Even Hinata, the carefree, younger-sister figure to Rei is dealing with issues of love and an anxiety of growing up. Rei's journey is not just about recognising and facing his own problems, but also in understanding that pain is a normal part of life, and something that everyone deals with. All one can do is to take it with stride.  \\n\\n\r\nRei's eventual breakdown is one of the story's most notable moments. I have read complaints of the scene being too dramatic, or that it took too long for Rei to get there. I feel that was the point. Simply being told \"no, you are wrong\" does not do anything to help fix a person's issues. Rei has already been told his entire life that he is wrong. It is through being kicked down, made a fool of, and, yes, breaking down completely that humans are able to grow the most. We are resilient creatures, and respond to failure with success. Rei is not meant to be entirely likeable to the viewer. He's just a dude and he has his limits, much like anyone else. He is meant to be human rather than an embodiment of all things cool and attractive, and I suppose it is this distinction that is bothersome to certain viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe scene where Shimada chats with Rei about Yamagata, his hometown, represents a lot of what makes the anime so special. The conversation is only 90 seconds long, and yet it encapsulates Rei's growth as a person. It culminates in his one simple quip back to Shimada, that even something dull is still \"something\". Rei has by this point become capable of standing his ground and arguing back, and of framing the world more positively. It is easy to not notice these things because Rei's evolution is not sudden or obvious. That is precisely what makes it great, and is why it feels so real. It is only in the small details do we notice change.\\n\\n\r\nMany aspects of Shaft's production are experimental in nature, and that definitely shows through in this case. While some of their other works, such as the Monogatari series, got a bit too focused on style rather than content (to the extent of being pompous or even pretentious, I would argue), the direction and artwork of Sangatsu no Lion is artful and stylish while still managing to keep genuine. The tenth episode's shogi match is one of the more prominent examples of this, where a thunderous orchestral piece plays as the two furiously and silently challenge one another. It doesn't require dialogue, as the visual and audio cues do more than enough to demonstrate who is winning and losing, and how much stress they are undergoing. There is even a scene that more closely resembles theatre, with jazzy beats playing while Smith slowly (very, very slowly) eats breakfast. Some may feel this is unnecessary, but I am of the opinion that it provided a wealth of character to someone who we really had not seen or understood much of by that point in the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a bit remarkable just how reminiscent the anime is of life in Tokyo. I feel that those who have never been here are missing quite a bit, as its depiction does well to make the world the characters live in feel real and relateable. It was actually a bit surreal in my case, as Rei goes to train stations, bridges and other areas that I have personally been to, and visits Sendagi at one point in the series: the quiet little neighbourhood in which I live. He even wears the exact same black coat that I bought at a local Uniqlo some months ago. So, understandably, I think, the anime has been a fairly personal experience for me. It's nothing short of stunning how much effort Shaft has put into making the setting feel like a real place where real people live. It is not a portrayal of Tokyo - it is Tokyo. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Sangatsu no Lion is without doubt some of the best that has been in anime. Most of the more heavy-hitting tracks are used sparingly, often only in one specific scene for a specific purpose, and accomplish said purpose with power and with triumph. In some scenes, such as the Yamagata talk, the first time \"Sayonara Bystander\" began playing, or the end of the twelfth episode when Rei promises to Momo to win, the music was effective enough to make my eyes water a bit. That isn't a reaction I normally have towards music.\\n\\n\r\nOne could argue that there is a bit too much comedy in the anime. And, certainly, if you are looking only for serious storytelling from start to finish, you may end up feeling somewhat alienated by the end. I might have preferred a bit less comedy, too, as the light-hearted scenes, while enjoyable (especially with how adorable Hinata is), are not quite as exciting as all the other pieces. But I can still appreciate its existence, as it would be disingenuous to remove it altogether and to pretend as if there are no happy moments in the characters' lives. Seeing Rei grow to accept the Kawamoto sisters is quite heartwarming, too. They care about him, even if he may not always care about himself, and by the end, they help him to find more meaning in life than shogi.\\n\\n\r\nIt's true that Sangatsu no Lion does not have much conclusion. Most of the problems the characters are dealing with are still an ongoing struggle by the end, and Rei is far from becoming a master of shogi as most anime protagonists typically would. Part of this can be attributed to logistical issues, such as a limited production budget and the fact that the manga is still ongoing. I don't think this creates an inherent flaw with the anime, however, as Sangatsu no Lion isn't really in need of an ending. There's no plot with a specific starting point and ending point-- it is rather a moment in time, a piece of Rei's life and those of the people around him. His depression persists, and he remains an imperfect and flawed person, even if he now has friends and family by his side. He's still searching. He's still running. Perhaps that will change by the end of the second season or the manga. Maybe it won't. And that would be completely fine. I don't believe there is anyone, even on their deathbed, who has ever been complete as a person. We start imperfect, and we end imperfect, gradually, yet surely, evolving, unchanging.\\n\\n\r\nWith most reviews, I feel compelled to discuss the anime in a mechanical way. \"The animation was nice\", \"the characters were developed well\", \"the plot was inconsistent\". It is because most anime feel crafted, like a specimen of sorts to be examined. How is this piece? How is that piece? Sangatsu no Lion never felt that way for me. It's bigger. It feels more real. And so I can't help but write something more personal, too. \\n\\n\r\nIs Sangatsu no Lion better than Honey & Clover? Maybe. Is it the best anime of the past decade? Perhaps. More than that? Could be. It is difficult right now to answer with complete certainty these questions I have been posing myself. Time is the best judgement, I feel. But I can say, without question or hesitation, that Sangatsu no Lion is the only anime since Touch that has had such a profound and visceral impact on me. And Touch was the best anime I had ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is a statement that unhappiness is OK. Being depressed, unsatisfied or stressed does not make you weak - it makes you human. And so I find it appropriate to close with a quote from Hinata:\\n\\n\r\n\"So what do you say at a time like this?\"\\n\\n\r\n\"You say to do your best.\"",

            "content": "My opinion:\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve always found reviewing slice of life series to be difficult and unpleasant, doing it is just tedious.\r\nIn recent years the anime production standards have steadily dropped culminating with the winter 2017 season which is filled with generic otaku-targeted shows, and thus 3-gatsu no Lion distinguished itself by having a more \u201cserious\u201d tone and being better, compared to the vast number of shitty series that aired at the same time.\r\nI usually avoid watching slice of life because, in most cases, the story is nothing special and the pacing is slow, leaving me unsatisfied and on the brink of falling asleep infront of the screen. Unfortunately that perfectly applies to 3-gatsu no Lion\u2019s case.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion revolves around Rei Kiriyama and his everyday life, portraying Rei\u2019s struggles with his past as well as the difficulties he encounters as a professional Shogi player. \\n\\n\r\nWith the show being part of the SoL genre, one can anticipate the story being dull with a fundamentally slow pacing that gradually tests your patience for the duration of the 22 episodes, and that it does.\\n\r\nThe story is simple, not original or engaging in any particular way, it holds no hidden messages or deep meanings and develops at a pace so slow that sometimes makes you doze-off in front of the screen. Well, to be honest, the show does hold a few \"hidden messages\" about family, life and such.\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s plot just plods along, inducing a comatose state that is very difficult to recover from.\\n\\n\r\nTo my pleasant surprise, 3-gatsu no Lion contains some drama as well as comedy having a few entertaining and gripping moments, covering and merging multiple tones, alternating introspective and dark scenes with lively and funny moments, features which helped progress the story in a more fluid way while the show did a fairly decent job explaining the Shogi game in a way that anyone can understand.\\n\r\nThe short flashbacks to Rei\u2019s past were some of the very few things I liked about the execution of this show, execution that was tedious except for a few exceptions to the rule.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough 3-gatsu no Lion is a character-focused show I was not impressed with its performance in this category, not even in the slightest.\\n\r\nThe characters are decently built also being decently developed but at the same time they are stagnant and ultimately feel bland. I personally did not find the characters to be likeable or relatable to nor particularly deep or intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nRei Kiriyama is a 17-year-old boy who had a harsh childhood during which he faced many difficulties and sad moments. The difficulties he experienced as a child traumatized him and drove him to become an introvert who spends most of his time alone, studying Shogi, game which is his \u201cpassion\u201d. \\n\r\nBy meeting the Kawamoto family, the changes in Rei\u2019s behavior and personality are put into motion, he slowly meets and starts to interact with more people while exploring his own emotions and getting to better know himself.\\n\r\nRei\u2019s parents passed away due to a car accident when he was just a child, leaving him alone in a world he did not know or fully understand. After the loss of his family, Rei secluded himself in the Shogi game, considering he had nothing left aside from that game. No relatives were willing to care for him but fortunately, one of his father\u2019s close friends was kind enough to welcome Rei in his home and treat him like part of the family, but in that man\u2019s home Rei will continue to face difficulties and sadness, being resented by the other two children. \\n\r\nWhile trying to escape from that pressure, Rei decides to live alone in Tokyo and work as a professional Shogi player in order to pay for his expenses. \\n\r\nAs the story develops so does Rei's character.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko Kouda, Rei\u2019s older adoptive sister, is a self-centered and egoistic young woman who has no real worries other than her relationship with Gotou (the bad guy), a married older man who also happens to be a professional Shogi player. \\n\r\nKyouko has no issues standing and watching Rei getting beaten by Gotou and when in need of help she has no issues going to Rei\u2019s house looking for help like nothing ever happened. She is described as a \u201cwitch\u201d by Momo, the youngest of the 3 Kawamoto sisters.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation and art are beautiful as well as the color palette which is very nice, featuring colors according to the tone each scene employs and clearly conveying the feelings and emotions the moment carries.\\n\r\nThe character design could have been done better and there are some minor flaws in the animation but other than that I have nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending themes are great, arousing and inducing a certain mindset for the viewer to have as well as setting the mood for the show.\\n\r\nThe OST is very good, working in tandem with the animation and perfectly conveying the emotions each scene carries. \\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job interpreting the characters, I particularly liked the 3 sisters\u2019 voices and also the voice of the pets.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nI\u2019ve always said \u201cWhy watch slice of life when you can go out and do the real thing?\u201d.\\n\r\nWatching 3-gatsu no Lion was a fairly bad watching experience, the show being very dull but having some entertaining moments to maybe remember.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.4/10\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is a show that I found difficult to finish and that made me constantly feel like I was wasting my time. I would not recommend watching this show unless you are a fan of the slice of life genre or you want to fall asleep.",

            "content": "3-Gatsu was originally an anime I started watching because I love Shaft's other animes, but a few episodes in I started watching to follow along on Rei's journey. \r\n8/10 Story:\r\nThe story resonates with me a lot. It's like a combination of figuring out life in the present and how to deal with your past at the same time. The story is more than just about shogi, it's more about the player. How he decides what pieces to use, what pieces to move, and try and overcome his next opponent/obstacle. It also applies to his life. He has his new family which currently guards him andhis past (pieces he lost) which keep coming back to attack him. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Art:\\n\r\nThis is pretty self explanatory. The art is unique and defines each situation perfectly. You can properly see how everyone is feeling in each scene. It's powerful and really makes you think back when you were hurt but then got through it thanks to a loved one. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Sound:\\n\r\nThe opening/endings always seemed to tell Rei's story just by listening to it. Everything was made well to fit the mood. It wasn't forced like laugh tracks from 90s comedies but I knew when to smile, be sad, and root for them thanks to the sound. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 Character:\\n\r\nAs far from how much I like their characters, It's pretty much 10/10. The only reason it's an 8 is because some of the characters got underdeveloped in comparison to the main few. I love them all as characters from their realism, supportiveness, and silliness. Even the characters we know little about, I wanna know more about them cus they seem interesting. Rei's sister, Rei's future opponents, and pretty much everyones past. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 Enjoyment:\\n\r\n3-Gatsu was that one anime I kept coming back to weekly. It was at times heartbreaking, heartrelieving, and at times very intense. I enjoyed the characters and the story that came with them, but at some points it was a little slow. I enjoyed it overall, and was happy as fk when they announced season 2 coming soon.  \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Overall:\\n\r\nAnother one of Shaft's animes that I actually liked. Hope you give this anime a chance because everything about it is relatable and enjoyable at the same time. \\n\\n",

It's like you are reading a book. And in this case, a very good one. The experiences come fast and furious for the main character, but the center of his universe is definitely 'shogi'. Also, you don't have to be a shogi expert to watch this although it has a 'game' tag on it. You will love how the story goes from silent to being dramatic, and from that to being so comedic. One time you will be crying,and then the next thing you know you've been laughing along with the character's dialogues. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10] - I've watched a fair amount of anime, and I speak for everyone when I say that this kind of art style is very unique. The way how every scenes were drawn into perfection, and how it can easily change your feelings toward the story make this anime one of a kind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10] - The opening and ending songs were performed by BUMP OF CHICKEN.

            "content": "[Reupload]\r\nFor starters, this anime could be close to a masterpiece. Why you ask? Well I'll tell you. It's animated by Shaft, who are known for extreme narrative and story abnormalities. Now that may sound bad, but the story so far has been directed beautifully. The way the story dives into the sadness of our MC's past really tugs on the heartstrings, but at the same time his current life is filled with happy moments that are heartwarming. The mix of drama and slice of life can get confusing or even annoying but I think that's just what makes this show really good.\r\nWhat is important tonote is that while having a main character such as Rei Kiriyama, a tragic backstory is nothing original. One might find that cliche or distasteful; however the mystery of his past as well as the growth of Rei as a person is what makes you feel the emotion the director is trying to impose.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't have to like or know anything about shogi to enjoy this anime. And trust me, there is more to this show than just shogi. Rei's everyday life is incorporated with happy slice of life scenes featuring the Kawamoto sisters (Akari, Hinata, and Momo). They help Rei understand the beauty behind life, and not just the struggles of it. Besides the story, the art is outrageous and surreal, but not realistic. Don't let that throw you off, because it still captures the moments of emotion in detail. The OP and ED are sung by BUMP OF CHICKEN (who are a very good band), and both songs are aesthetically pleasing and catchy. The characters and atmosphere make this show enjoyable as well and make you feel a part of the story. The OST helps with this, as it's vivid and picturesque.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, give this anime a chance. You might find something you'll enjoy a lot.

            "content": "The way 3-gatsu no Lion (March comes like a lion) is written is like a poetic adventure. Only thing is, the main protagonist is in his own story and we (the audience) gets to see what they experience. From that experience, the main protagonist Rei tackles through obstacles in his life, building relationships, and growing as a person. Adapted by the manga of the same name, this is a show that really takes slice of life to a unique perspective.\r\nThe creator of the series is Chica Umino. Some people may recognize her work such as Honey and Clover. As such, character designs represented in thisshow may feel familiar. However, 3-gatsu no Lion stands out on its own as we are introduced to Rei Kiriyama, a young man known for his professional shogi talent. Rei may seem like a successful person at first glance but deep down, he suffers from many personal issues. The show explores those issues in ways that really makes us curious not just about his life but how society, relationships, and a career can influence a person.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first few episodes, it\u2019s clear that Rei has talent when it comes to shogi. People even label him as a prodigy with a unique gift. Yet, Rei feels isolated in society as his real parents no longer exists in his world. However, fortune does smile on him as he meets Akari, Momo, and Hina, three sisters with gentle hearts that welcomes him as their own family. I have to admit, those very first few episodes gave me a realistic impression of Rei\u2019s character. There are those in our world where a prodigy can feel so alone. The expectations from their peers, coaches, and fans really put them on the edge when they deal with competition against rivals. For Rei, it seems even worse because of his unsociable personality and the fact that he has a strained relationship with his adoptive parents. On a professional level, his career hasn\u2019t really bloomed in his adolescence years. Sound something similar? Once in a while, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve heard similar stories in the news before too. Viewers coming into this show should really expect to see why Rei feels the way he views society and how he adapts to make his life better for himself.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of memorable moments in this show but perhaps one of the most influential is how Rei develops relationship with the people he meets. He\u2019s not an outgoing person and most of the time, he seems to keep to himself. This is evidenced by the cynical thoughts and narratives he voices in his head. Often times or not, Rei has trust issues towards others because of his past. The show cleverly does a good job at storytelling as we see glimpses of his past in multi-chapter arcs. Rei\u2019s personality is strongly influenced by his past that carries into the present. Fortunately, not everything is gloom and doom because Akari, Momo, and Hina brightens up Rei\u2019s life. They are like the light of his dark tunnel and we see how they are able to give him affection and treat him like a real family. Their influence in the show changes Rei as he realizes that he can trust certain people. Rei also becomes more aware of how being together with people is better than being alone. That\u2019s really what makes the storytelling and character of this show intriguing. We see the mistakes that Rei makes and life lessons he learns from. Rei\u2019s confidence grows and he begins to develop meaningful relationship with others. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the Kawamoto sisters, the show also offers a colorful cast of other characters. One of the most noticeable is Kyoko, the daughter of Rei\u2019s shogi teacher. Throughout the show, we learn the negative influence she has on him. The way this show expresses human emotions is most evident when Kyoko and Rei are in the same segments. To name a few, we got jealousy, hate, pity, among others. The way Kyoko taunts Rei can also get uncomforting to watch with her snarky attitude. What\u2019s important though is to understand her role in the show. It\u2019s not to just to make viewers despise her but also how Rei\u2019s negative side is often bought out in the worst way because of her influence. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the series also has a colorful cast of characters on the professional shogi scene. Rei\u2019s self-proclaimed rival Nikadou brings in many of the comical moments between them. Kai Shimada, a man in the late 30s, also has influence on Rei as he learns quite a bit from him throughout the show. Masamune Goto, a man that has a very complicated relationship with Rei\u2019s father stands out as a seemingly main obstacle in Rei\u2019s life. From this series, Rei experiences different feelings when it comes to facing off against his rivals. The in-depth narratives accompanied by the inner thoughts from his shogi matches gives us even a better insight of Rei on the competitive scene. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I am not an expert on shogi but it\u2019s fair to say that 3-gatsu no Lion knows its content when it comes to game perspective. While the show heavily involves psychology in those shogi matches, there\u2019s also strategy that is narrated and presented. Colorful imagery is also added to make the matches look larger than life. Even though the show can feel very melancholic, it still has many moments where it can draw an audience\u2019s laughter. The shogi matches, character relationships, and even non-human characters such as Kawamoto\u2019s cats are just a few examples. In fact, the show seems to not forget any character throughout its recourse. Unfortunately, this 2-cour adaptation is simply not enough to cover everything. The manga is still ongoing and as faithful as this is adaptation is, there\u2019s still plenty that are left uncovered. Perhaps another season can explore more options but in a span of 22 episodes, that\u2019s not really happening.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Shaft, it\u2019s pretty recognizable that 3-gatsu no Lion has its style. While Shaft\u2019s iconic head tilts aren\u2019t the main factors when it comes to art direction, it\u2019s still very Akiyuki Shinobish. Inspirations are drawn from the flashy segments, dialogue usage, and background imagery are just a few to name. It feels experimental at times while demonstrating a superior feel of realism. One thing I was really impressed by is how almost every camera shot focused on Rei reveals his feelings. Character designs are influential by the author\u2019s works and very faithfully adapted from the manga. That being said, Shaft\u2019s art style may not be for everyone but for 3-gatsu no Lion, it hits the nail in the coffin. \\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion may not be a show about music but even its soundtrack works effectively thanks to the talent of its production staff. The melancholic atmosphere is well choreographed with cleverly timed OST. The theme songs very well fits with the show\u2019s themes. In particularl, Bump of Chicken\u2019s OP song \u201cAnswer\u201d really bought out the psychology of the show. However, I think the biggest praise should be given to Rei\u2019s voice actor, Kengo Kawanishi. The way he voices Rei makes him feel very believable especially during powerful moments. Voicing a character like Rei honestly feels difficult but he pulls it off without trouble. Finally, the show\u2019s narratives remains strong throughout the show. Rather than relying on a narrator, it doe the storytelling itself with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nWatching 3-gatsu no Lion feels very different compared to some of the other shows I\u2019ve watched in relating to exploring the growth of a prodigy. It not only has heavy characterization but the psychology of the show gives a unique feeling of its storytelling. The relationship building and realism really gives slice of life more than just every day adventures. Because for circumstances, every day is a challenge for Rei as he takes on himself. Whether it\u2019s in life or on the competitive shogi scene, we can see how Rei develops as a person. I can\u2019t safely recommend this show to everyone however. It\u2019s definitely a show that isn\u2019t for anyone\u2019s taste and for manga readers, you may feel slightly disappointed by what\u2019s still left out in the dark. Yet in the end, 3-gatsu no Lion is able to breathe life with its powerful direction and a story of compelling melodrama. \\n",

            "content": "Ever since Akiyuki Shinbo joined as director in 2005, Shaft has been on a rampage, pushing its avant grade cinematography (and head tilts) to the limits. And now that they've made a name for themselves (and the fact that they're all out of source material on the monogatari series), they have started to calm down. Compared to last year's Owarimonogatari (and the subsequent Kizumonogatari movies this year), they have a Slice of Life entry this fall season by the name of San-gatsu no Lion (or March comes in like a Lion). Based on a well received ongoing manga, the story revolves around Kiriyama Rei, ahigh schooler and a pro shogi player, living an independent life in a rather empty part of town. Having lived through a mountain of trouble as a child and not-so-good experiences at his foster family, the repressed emotions and lack of \"love\" (if you will) has made him depressed and lonely inside. The only thing he has left is his career as a shogi player, which, sadly, started with a lie. So, a life (and mental sanity maybe?) built on such a feeble foundation can only last so long. And so it all starts to crumble and he starts going into a downward spiral.\\n\\n\r\nBut fear not, all is not lost yet. Enter the three Kawamoto sisters. Having gone through some rough times themselves, they had one another to lean on, and so they live their modest lives full of happiness and laughter with the occasional sad reminiscing. And thankfully, they drag our protagonist into it, and it acts as a sliver of hope in his life. His interactions with them and the subtle changes they cause in his personality seem to be the main focus of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow, there are a few things to watch out for, if you're thinking of picking this up.\\n\r\nNumber one is the drama, the kind of drama where there are lots of tragic flashbacks and broken, damaged characters. If you find characters wallowing in depression appalling, this might not be your cup of tea. Though I would say that the creators have put a lot of effort in Rei's backstory as it feels \"legit\" and in-sync with his character.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, is the game of Shogi. They say shogi is like chess, except that it's not (well it is, in essence, a strategy game). Compared to the 16 pieces per player in Chess, Shogi has 20 pieces; there is no queen, and two new pieces - silver general and gold general are in play. Even the board is different (its a 9x9 instead of an 8x8). Point is, if you don't know shogi, parts of the show involving it - like the surprised look on players when the opponent makes an interesting move (a shot of the board with all the pieces, a move, and cut to character's face), or analogies/metaphors relating to our main characters life, will probably make little to no sense (or won't have the desired effect).\\n\\n\r\nNumber three is Shaft. Now, I already said that they're trying to calm down, and they are, I mean, 5 episodes without a head tilt (Shinbo must be screaming in frustration, good thing Kenjirou is in charge), but, it's still Shaft. And I've seen some people complain about the artstyle. Thankfully, it all isn't as erratic as the monogatari series and I am fine with it. Heck I love how they keep the contrast when switching perspectives from the depressed MC to the cheerful sisters (love the color palette too, and the opening).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion. I like where this is going. I like that the main character is \"damaged\" damaged and not just damaged for plot's sake, his backstory really gets me. And I am interested in how far down he is going to fall before he gets over his past or if the past is going to come back to haunt him, either way, he will face it and that's what I'm looking forward to. Also, this is Shaft and I have hope that they aren't going to mess this up. But if they do, I'll update this.",

            "content": "tl:dr Sangatsu no Lion is a completely pointless series, revolving around a few more than flat characters.\r\nI'll try to be as spoiler free as possible while pointing out what I think worked and what not.\r\nStory: 3\r\nIn a few words, the story in Sangatsu no Lion is \"playing shogi\". For as much as I would like to say that it talks about a kid growing, fighting his fears, learning how to relate to other people, eventually understanding how to live one's life, all of this is just barely touched, focusing more on \"what if I moved the pawn in A7 instead of B2?\". In 22 episodes,absolutely nothing relevant happens. No epiphanies, no events, no change, or if something happens, it's brushed off in an incredibly simplistic way. \\n\r\nWe could think that since this is a Slice of Life, it reflects reality as it is, and oh, it does it perfectly. But please don't tell me that your usual, every day, routine lives are worth a series. Mine, is not.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nFor as much as I love shaft, the style here is pretty different from their usual. The colour palette, the watercolour-ish style, the animation itself were really pleasant to watch, as they give a warm vibe when it's needed, but doesn't work so well in the more \"cold\" scenes. Also, the classic shaft antics recur here as well, and maybe, they weren't so needed. What really bothers me here is the character design. From the beginning to the end of the series, the characters lose more and more punchiness and details, starting from a very specific character design (those mouths, really?) ending with a generic character from any other series of the last decade.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nNot much to say here\\n\r\nOTs and EDs are not so bad, but also not memorable. I finished the series half an hour ago and I already forgot what they sound like. Same goes for the background sounds and music. About the voices, the cast is galactic, it worked pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nLet's say you try to give an honest vote to your completely normal neighbour, or the guy that used to seat on the left corner in your classroom. That would be pretty hard, I imagine. The same goes here. The characters are completely normal people, but instead of having those many hues a normal person would have, they are just parodies of their \"IRL\" counterparts.\\n\r\nThe MC is the usual \"kind of problematic\" character. Introvert, social issues, no friends, focused only on shogi. You keep watching him doing nothing, saying a lot of \"I will whatever\", then going back doing nothing. Just stupidly thinking about shogi. So much to forget to drink for days! Can you imagine that? \\n\r\nThe female cast is the \"obliviously-incredibly-good-and-sweet-girl-that-oh-so-love-to-help-you-for-whatever-reason-and-obviously-loves-sweets\". As too often, the women in Sangatsu are put in the kitchen or related domestic areas, and those are the only moments in which you see them. Since it's a shogi anime, you could think there are also female shogi players, but no, the only one that you can see doesn't play anymore. \\n\r\nIs the rest of the cast worth mentioning? the fat but passionate kiddo, the cold and invincible player, the mentor, the blonde with weird haircut guy?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/ Overall 4\\n\r\nI think I said everything I had to, with very bad grammar and vocabulary, tho, but since this anime has been so hyped up, I could not shut it\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion fails on every front. It fails in narrating a story, even a slice of the story, introducing elements that will be lost in the next scene, breaking tragedy or tension with out of place comedy, but still failing with both of them. It fails with its characters, with too good or too bad people that could exist in other genres, or using cliched characters that, as usual, follow the flow with no question asked. It also fails with the art, lowering the quality episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there are a lot of way better anime out there. go see them. \\n\\n",

            "content": "3-gatsu no Lion is adapted from Umino Chika\u2019s (also known for Hachimitsu to Clover) award winning manga of the same name. Some people tend to be worried when they hear that studio Shaft is going to be adapting anything, but Shaft perfectly adapted the already great manga of 3-gatsu no Lion in a very creative way, as they usually do. \r\n3-gatsu no Lion tells a story about a boy that tries to find a place where he belongs and is accepted, a story that consists of many different parts, each of which can stir up many different kinds of emotions, and when all of themcome together, they make this amazing series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story that 3-gatsu no Lion tells is that of Rei Kiriyama, a 17-year-old boy who has faced many troubles and sadness despite his young age. His losing his family when he was still a child and even facing problems while living with his adoptive family, have caused him many traumas and insecurities and made his personality reclusive. While trying to find a way to escape from that pressure, he decides to live alone, in Tokyo, but how is he going to make it on his own? The only thing that Rei is talented at and can depend on is shogi, since he is one of the few people who became professional players while in middle school. But even like that, Rei sometimes faces pressure from the shogi community, he can\u2019t take proper care of himself and doesn\u2019t have any friends.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s when he meets the Kawamoto sisters, who are determined to take care of Rei and make him feel less lonely with their hospitality.\\n\r\nAs he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally, he slowly meets and interacts with more people, from the shogi community, school or his family, and gets to understand his own complex emotions.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is more of a slice of life/drama series with some comedy, but there is focus on shogi, too, which also helps the story progress and the characters develop. Although shogi is one of the basic elements of the anime, it\u2019s really not necessary to know anything about it and understand exactly how they are playing in order to know what\u2019s going on and enjoy the matches. Everything you need to know is told by the characters, through the great description of their feelings and thoughts during the matches.\\n\r\nThe narration is simply amazing, the more you watch and listen to the characters talking, the more you are getting drawn in this wonderful story. The way the characters describe how they feel, the troubles they are facing, the dialogues and interactions between them, all seem extremely realistic and even relatable, you can understand exactly what they are going through just by hearing them talking. And as they are thinking through the monologues and they interact with each other, their feelings gradually change, which offers great development to the story and the characters.\\n\r\nIt certainly looks like a simple and slow paced story but it can be serious and dramatic, but also very heartwarming and with more lighthearted moments, each of these parts is perfectly handled.\\n\r\nAs for the adaptation, studio Shaft did a remarkable job and remained completely faithful to the source material, following the chapters and the dialogues exactly as they should.\\n\\n\r\nThe best and main part of 3-gatsu no Lion and what makes it as great as it is, is definitely the characters and their development. \\n\r\nThe main character of this story may be Rei, but all of the characters receive the necessary amount of focus. They are all amazingly fleshed out, deep, they feel realistic and have unique and interesting personalities. Even the ones that you would consider characters with a mean personality, are enjoyable to watch, you can sympathize with them and they have a reason behind their actions. \\n\r\nAll of them get gradually developed and more of their backstory, personality, thoughts and feelings are continuously revealed.\\n\r\nThe character with the greatest and most obvious growth is, of course, Rei, who keeps changing throughout the whole series, but the other character's growth is also impressive.\\n\r\nThe relationships between the characters also feel very human and watching their interactions is always enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art and animation, it\u2019s obvious that Shaft did an astonishing job. They used the unique art style of Umino Chica without changing anything and added their own special, creative touches as they usually do. The result was aesthetically beautiful, with nice and unique character designs, detailed backgrounds and great cinematography. \\n\r\nThe expressions of the characters are great and perfectly used in both the serious and the funny scenes.\\n\r\nThere are also many metaphorical scenes with great symbolism, that depict the characters' thoughts and emotions in a very creative way.\\n\r\nThe color palette is also very nice and the colors are used correctly according to what each scene wants to show. They can go from really dark colors that show up when the characters are anxious, tense or depressed, to brighter and cuter ones for the more lighthearted scenes. The shift of the colors really adds to the whole experience and makes us understand better how the characters feel at that moment, especially when it comes to the serious and dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in 3-gatsu no Lion is great, it always fits the scenes perfectly and helps them convey their overall feeling better.\\n\r\nThe first OP and ED, \u201cAnswer\u201d and \u201cFighter\u201d by BUMP OF CHICKEN, are truly beautiful. It\u2019s nice how they used \u201cFighter\u201d as the ED song, since it was the song used for the first collaboration between the band and the author, a short music video of 3-gatsu no Lion.\\n\r\nThe second OP, \"Sayonara Bystander\u201d by YUKI, and ED, \"orion\" by Kenshi Yonezu, are also pretty nice and fit the anime.\\n\r\nEven the shogi song, \"Nyaa Shougi Ondo\u201d by the sisters\u2019 VAs (Kana Hanazawa, Ai Kayano and Misaki Kuno), was pretty cute and offered some information about shogi.\\n\r\nAnother nice detail is the cute sound effects and the animals\u2019 little dialogues, which are pretty funny.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job and managed to convey the characters\u2019 feelings perfectly. \\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion may look like a very simple story, with no really extraordinary elements. But the way it manages to handle and describe all the complex, but human feelings and thoughts of the characters so naturally and perfectly, is what makes 3-gatsu no Lion a masterpiece. The many different situations that the anime depicts, the dramatic ones or the heartwarming ones will definitely stir up your emotions and tug at your heartstrings. \\n\r\nIt may not be an anime that pleases everyone\u2019s tastes, but it is definitely unique, realistic, refreshing and worth dedicating some of your time to watch it.",

            "content": "Note: I will try my best to keep the review unbiased.\r\nStory:\r\nSangatsu no Lion is about a genius shogi player known as Kiriyama Rei. Kiriyama is suffering from social anxiety and maybe depression. There is nothing new about stories depicting a main character suffering from psychological problems but it feels fresh when it's placed in a competitive game setting. Unlike most sports anime series who continually shows a character's love for the sport and their live revolving as a sport, Sangatsu shows the otherwise. Shogi is only a backdrop for Kiriyama, he continues to move on life as he uses Shogi as a means for living.\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf I could sum it up in one word it would be, serene. Lively, light-hearted moments are portrayed in vibrant pastel distinguished with Shaft's style of character animation. Monologues and dream-like sequences are placed in cool colors with a refreshing placement of blacks. These contrasting palettes gives off a very emotional feel like we're Kiriyama himself. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs seems very similar with Umino Chika's other series, Honey and Clover. There is nothing unique, nor eye popping in these. It just feels, at home. Normal. The cats are very well characterized, I give them that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nSo far, the soft music accentuates the backgrounds with a few exceptions like that edm shogi-fight which honestly sounded off. Apart from the acoustic guitar and piano music, I think the OP and ED stands out the most. Bump of Chicken brilliantly voiced out emotions out of the songs. It sounded deep with a sense of choking but it lets you breathe out during the chorus. \\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms about the voice actors. Nothing feels off and I heard some familiar seiyuus. I do however love the cat's voices, it definitely feels comedic and adorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characterization so far portrays Kiriyama, we already communicate with him through his monologues. We are also shown a variety of other characters which do not fall into the normal character tropes. We look into the other characters like Kiriyama's self proclaimed rival, Harunobu. He was initially shown as a lively comedic character and yet his background made him a person who will tolerate anything just for the sake of the game. It was humanizing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sangatsu no Lion has an involving drama between characters accompanied with a beautiful art and calming sound. It's currently running as the best series this season.",

            "content": "Hate slow-paced anime? Then this isn\u2019t for you. Hate generic sub-characters? Then this isn\u2019t for you. Hate heavy narration? Then this isn't for you. Hate when an anime spends a good portion of its time depicting a board game that you don\u2019t understand? Then this isn\u2019t for you. Have a short attention span and don\u2019t like slow-paced series? Then this anime is definitely not for you!\r\nNonetheless, I genuinely LOVE March Comes in Like a Lion!! So what about this series makes me love it despite rating it a 7 and being Debby Downer? Easy: the main character, the art, and the heavy narration.\r\nCharacters: Rei isprobably one of my favorite character that has come into fictional existence over the past few years. He is different from all the melancholic male characters out there. Yes, he does mope around and feels sorry for himself, but he doesn\u2019t whine nor does he have an undesirable urge to play victim and guilt trip all those that are around him. He is this unique quality character that is not found in stories that often. His growth does not happen immediately. It\u2019s a very slow process. It\u2019s the people around him, the small mundane things, and the ruminating thoughts he has that allows him to grow. His ability to come to terms with his circumstance and his attempt to widen his perspective is a breath of fresh air for me. He really embodies an insecure 17 year old who is trying to become an adult. Observing Rei grow makes this whole series worth watching. He is a wonderful example of creating a slice-of-life/coming of age character. Furthermore, as a viewer who overanalyzes everything and is stuck in my own thoughts while living a monotonous life, Rei\u2019s (and his \u201cmentors\u201d) numerous insightful quotes are always worth reflecting upon. \\n\r\n So what about the other characters? First and foremost, most of the characters are mainly there to highlight the story of Rei. So the fact that Rei\u2019s development is incredibly slow means that other character growth are undeniably slow. It\u2019s so slow that unfortunately they are only seen as the typical stock characters. I\u2019m only going to discuss the three sisters (Akari, Hinata and Momo), and Rei\u2019s actual \u201csister\u201d (Kyouko) to make my point, but the other side characters have similar problems.  \\n\r\nLike Rei, Rei\u2019s \"sister\u201d is also the melancholic type. However, the difference between these siblings are noticeable. She is the \u201cwoe unto me\u201d type with a Kurt Cobain flare (more like the obnoxious Sasuke Uchiha from  Naruto). The femme fatale, the woman who comes to ignite the flame to the series. Anytime she brings herself into Rei\u2019s life, drama is inevitable. To add the chaotic-ness of her personality, there also seems to be some uncomfortable (\u201csexual\u201d) tension amongst Rei and her; this point could hopefully be proven void later on, but as a viewer it does create a natural curiosity to keep wanting to know what had happened to both of them prior to Rei\u2019s current living situation. \\n\r\nAs for the three sisters, they are the exact opposite of Rei and Kyouko. They are introduced at the very beginning of the series, and they are there to radiate love and happiness to Rei\u2019s black and white existence.  Together, the sisters represent the warmth and compassion that a family unit could be filled with. However, the main concern I have with these ladies is that even though March Comes in Like a Lion is half way done, they are not even slightly fleshed out. Momo, the youngest sister, is basically there to be cute. Nothing else. Just to be cute. Akari is the typical sweet female character. She is considered to be beautiful, gentle, mild-tempered, and extremely maternal: the epithet of \u201cperfection\u201d. Hinata is probably the sister that stands out the most which is quite the irony, because in reality she is so normal that she wouldn\u2019t stand out at all. She\u2019s not too cute. She\u2019s not too perfect. She is just an average girl. The problem I have with these 3 sister is not that they are stock characters, but they have so much to offer and it is not being showcased. There are subtle hints and moments that makes it obvious that their life is not as simplistic as it appears. They have a gloomy history and they have struggled a lot. It is unfortunate that this is a slow-paced anime because their potential as characters is obvious. Although there is no doubt in my mind that this series will do these sisters justice and gradually mold and shape them, I find it a little sad that many viewers will only see them as just shallow/uncreative archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is possibly my favorite part of March Comes in Like a Lion (Studio Shaft is remarkable). It honestly feels like I am watching a book because this series manages to wonderfully combine heavy narration (which I usually tend to dislike) with divine imagery.  As I mentioned a thousand times already, this is a very slow- paced anime. However, even when nothing is happening the art is able to speak volumes. \\n\r\nI am an impatient human being and I lose interest easily. So when the show focuses on a shogi match (which I have difficulty fathoming), the one thing that keeps my attention asides the dialogue is the art. For instance, while the characters are playing shogi, they are consistently drinking liquid. Water and liquid is something that is always brought up in the art throughout each episode, and this does not surprise me. Water is able to give life and hydrate the body, but at the same time it is able to drown and suffocate a person\u2019s soul. The artistic style can be observed and reflected on for days if one wanted to understand the atmosphere and tone of the story.\\n\\n\r\n Rei and the art are probably the key reasons one should watch this series. Although this anime does feel boring, that does not mean it is awful. The story is executed in such a way that character development and growth feels realistic. Again, this is not a series for people who need to be stimulated with action/philosophical scenes every few minutes. Nonetheless, the writing and concept of March Come in Like a Lion is so well thought-out that I actually would recommend people to watch this series even if they may drop it after a few episodes in. The only suggestion I can give a person who is interested in wanting to view a slow-paced series but is unable to focus, is to watch it with another person so the uneventful section of the show can feel somewhat less intolerable.\\n\\n\r\n(On another completely irrelevant note: the creators of this series really love cats; there are so many annoying cats in this show)",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe pawns were my friends, the knights my family, and the queen my lover. For I was king.\r\nWhen it came to chess, I was the best. In my corner of the world, anyway. I lived the sport as much as I could. Winning school tournaments, going to summer camps to learn new skills. Squaring off against multiple opponents simultaneously. Practicing with a plastic travel set and a versus timer and a book on named openings. For a while, chess was my calling. A passion that neither bishop nor rook could squander.\r\nToday, that\u2019s no longer thecase. Writing, programming, and other -ing\u2019s have replaced what was once my kingly domain. But, even today, having not played chess for years, I know that I could go back to that board. See the same familiar pieces. And they would invite me back with open arms (if they had arms, anyway).\\n\\n\r\nBecause, just as 3-gatsu no Lion would claim, what we experience never really leaves us \u2013 and that there\u2019s always someone waiting to lend a loving hand.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu centers on a young man named Rei Kiriyama. As only the fifth shogi player to become a professional while still in middle school, the prodigy engages in hard-fought battles in this sport of the mind. However, his most daunting battlefield occurs off the board. In a place simply called \u201clife.\u201d But thanks to Akari, Hinata, and Momo, three kindhearted sisters in his neighborhood who have taken him under their wings, Rei survives onward, fending off \u201cattacks\u201d all around him.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to outside sources and information about the series in its current state, this season of 3-gatsu is merely the first of many. In what is meant to be a very long, very articulate journey (should the original author, SHAFT, and the anime gods will it). Thus, these introductory twenty-two episodes have the honor of setting up its story for the audience. What it entails, where it plans to go, and why any of it matters at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd like a shogi board primed for an upcoming match, 3-gatsu sets up said story with expert ease.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take too long to understand that shogi in and of itself makes for an important plot element for this anime. This sport forms the crux of many of the events and becomes the driving force behind Rei\u2019s actions. It\u2019s essentially Japanese chess except it includes a few extra pieces (the lance, the golden general, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing extensive, 3-gatsu teaches the audience about these different pieces and the overall structure, letting the audience have a better grasp of this plot element on a technical level. And it does what it can to vary up the depicted matches. Quietness, sweltering heat, hyper-focus. While the board and the pieces never change, each match has a certain air about it that keeps them from falling prey to stagnation.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, shogi is not the most thrilling of sports to watch. There\u2019s no \u201caction\u201d besides the players picking up and placing their pieces. Moves often require many, many minutes of thinking. The environment calls for very little fanfare.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, like most sports anime (and, indeed, most sports stories), shogi isn\u2019t necessarily all about the spectacle. Rather, it\u2019s a catalyst, a vehicle that allows 3-gatsu to carry its grander, more thoughtful ideas forward.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts by viewing shogi in a thematic sense. Yes, it\u2019s just a bunch of wood carvings with Japanese words etched into them. But, in the larger context of the story, it means so much more.\\n\\n\r\nShogi is a singular sport; the player can only rely on himself or herself. In a way, it\u2019s rather lonely, almost isolated. Yet it\u2019s also a dual (and duel) sport. Someone else takes the other side of the board, forcing two minds, two ideals, and two people to clash. In a broader sense, shogi requires a winner and a loser (which is almost always the case based on the rules). Each player can only control his or her own pieces, meaning they themselves command their fate. And the game\u2019s rooted tradition and strict etiquette mask the tumultuous feelings harbored within.\\n\\n\r\nAs described, and considering the context of 3-gatsu, shogi is a metaphor for life itself. Individuals act on their own and interact with others, controlling what they themselves say and do. They \u201cwin\u201d and they \u201close\u201d all the time. They don\u2019t always reveal how they feel, for emotions aren\u2019t the simplest to explain.\\n\\n\r\nThe parallels here are important because, outside of shogi, where 3-gatsu truly matters, life and what it encompasses takes precedence on a thematic and narrative level.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, one of the anime\u2019s most pronounced characteristics is its tonal range. The story will often swing back and forth between extremely heartwarming and utterly crestfallen, raising and lowering the audience\u2019s emotions without remorse. It can be slightly jarring at times, but this dichotomy speaks to life\u2019s own emotional rollercoaster. How happiness and sadness are closer than one may believe.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, both sides of the spectrum elevate 3-gatsu\u2019s plot points and explore its vital themes. On the happy end, Akari, Hinata, and Momo\u2019s nostalgic, loving home is Rei\u2019s \u201ckotatsu.\u201d They implore the importance of togetherness. That a belly full of food, a few good laughs, and a company of loved ones is all it takes to warm the soul. On the sad end, Rei\u2019s barren apartment with an equally lonely lifestyle stresses reality\u2019s gloomier corner. While tough to stomach, depression is a formidable foe that cannot always be cured with a touching smile (let alone a silver general).\\n\\n\r\nTo reach these ends and continue its exploration on life, the show fills its space with even more thematic exploration. It focuses on family \u2013 Akari and the girls, Rei\u2019s deceased family, his foster family \u2013 to highlight how such close bonds both heal and harm. It emphasizes certain mindsets like having no regrets and refusing to lose. It talks about self-worth and the challenges people face in their own lives.\\n\\n\r\nYet the most intriguing thematic element (besides shogi) is its most prevalent feature: water. For Rei, water symbolizes so many of his darker thoughts: suffocation, obstruction, restriction. But it also symbolizes what could possibly be: refreshing, buoyant, sustainable.\\n\\n\r\nIn one scene, a thunderous storm hearkens harsh ocean waves that drown his mind. Then, in another scene, he\u2019ll take a swig from his plastic bottle at home to quench his thirst. Indeed, water is a constant in Rei\u2019s life. A duality that, once again, plays to the anime\u2019s strengths through its thematic connections to life and its clear, precise presence.\\n\\n\r\nAll this thematic discussion hasn\u2019t even elaborated on 3-gatsu\u2019s main plot points and story beats.\\n\\n\r\nPart of what grounds the show\u2019s story is how much Rei loses. Despite his prodigy status, his losses up the realism of his current situation while readying him for his eventual climb later. They also put into perspective where he is at in his life and the strength of his numerous opponents.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has its memorable scenes. More specifically, Rei\u2019s breakdown in episode ten explodes out the emotions he has been keeping trapped inside himself. He basically yells at the world for making him think everything is always his fault, and that giving up or giving in is not an option for him or anyone. As Nikaidou would put it, Rei \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to lose\u201d \u2013 in every sense of the phrase.\\n\\n\r\nAnd extra narrative facets keep the story progressing. Foreshadowing with the top shogi player as the beast to beat. A subplot involving Kyouko\u2019s jerkwad \u201cboyfriend.\u201d Rei\u2019s decision to stay away from Akari, Hinata, and Momo\u2019s home for much of the second half of the season is not only seen but felt. The creation of the shogi club at Rei\u2019s school makes for an optimistic finale moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nEven after all this analyzing, 3-gatsu presents even more to its audience. Effective comedy. Interesting dialogue. Purposeful chapter structure. Simply put, as the introductory portion to this story, the anime roars like a ferocious lion preparing for what will unfold.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching 3-gatsu, its actual animation soars during scenes where it overexaggerates the Kawamoto sisters\u2019 actions or forms a fantastical aside. (Shogi remains quite the stationary sport.) But it\u2019s the impressive artistry and the technical finesse that allow this show to reach ever higher heights.\\n\\n\r\nAbove anything else, the anime loves its visual metaphors. From a pair of balloons floating upwards through the sky to gallons of water submerging Rei as he sits on the steps leading to the school rooftop, 3-gatsu constantly creates thoughtful, engaging scenes. They not only bolster the ideas of the show but also provide the audience with yet another thematic layer to think about.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has tons of flair, too. A first-person perspective obfuscated by strands of hair. Shifts in camera angles, like a top-down view of Akari as her cats whirl around her. Multiple styles shifted between seamlessly: rough, quirky, sharp, involved. The sheer amount of techniques employed, the obvious attention to cinematography, and the risks taken with its vast variance turn this slice-of-life drama into both an outstandingly diverse and an artistically worthwhile endeavor.\\n\\n\r\nTo go even further, 3-gatsu also focuses intently on the overall look and feel of the visuals themselves. Color choices reach across the rainbow, sparking lots of contrast between its melancholic mood (blues, greys, blacks) and its sweet serenity (oranges, yellows, pinks). A noticeably soft approach ushers in a calm setting while still carrying its weighty, solemn baggage. And its backgrounds \u2013 from inside the sisters\u2019 home to the imaginative moments \u2013 persist as a constant example of the anime\u2019s artistic integrity.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one cannot ignore the designs of the characters, for they evoke the same sense of wonder that the rest of the visuals deliver. Generally, they\u2019re rather unique in their facial details: lines fill out their eyes, their mouths are slightly thicker than normal, their gazes often exude a gentle aura.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, Akari\u2019s ponytail draped over her shoulder, her purple-colored eyes, small hairpin, cardigan sweaters, usual apron, and ample assets paint her as the womanly goddess she is. Hinata\u2019s long twin-tailed hair, her smaller physique, girly outfits, and sincere smile captures her energy and kindness. Momo\u2019s short, light-orange hair and wide eyes highlight her cute and childish status that much more.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also Rei with his frazzled black hair, green eyes, glasses, white buttoned-up shirt, and jeans that give him a nerdy, quiet look that fits his character all too well. The girls\u2019 grandpa\u2019s squareness. Smith\u2019s tall, Western vibe. Kyouko\u2019s brown overcoat and devilish beauty. Nikaidou\u2019s rotund shape and Shimada\u2019s lanky frame. The characters\u2019 designs are interesting and attractive and different.\\n\\n\r\nExactly like the rest of 3-gatsu\u2019s artistry.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIn 3-gatsu, the characters exemplify their respective roles: the main protagonist, the supporting cast, and so on. But they represent much more than just what a literary definition could ascribe. In fact, they continue the exploration of the anime\u2019s themes through thoughtful ideas and progression of their own.\\n\\n\r\nAs the star of this tale, Rei Kiriyama doesn\u2019t lead the most eventful of lives. He wakes up each day without anybody around. He puts on his clothes and munches on some convenience-store food before making the long walk and the sad train ride to his local shogi hall. He plays a couple of games in relative silence. Then he goes back home. To a desolate, no-drapes apartment where he practices the sport by himself \u2013 which is arguably one of the loneliest activities imaginable \u2013 in the middle of his wide-open room. Only to fall asleep, wake up, and go through the whole process ad infinitum.\\n\\n\r\nLoneliness characterizes Rei to a depressing degree. From him eating his cold lunch by himself to sitting outside on the cold concrete as the wind howls about him, Rei is often alone. Sometimes of his own choosing, sometimes because it can\u2019t be helped. But this void follows him nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it always has. The true beginning of Rei\u2019s loneliness starts with the tragic death of his parents and his little sister in a freak car accident. Having lost those held most dear to him, he doesn\u2019t know what to do. So, he latches onto shogi \u2013 to keep his thoughts focused and to numb the pain in his heart.\\n\\n\r\nRei describes his relationship with \u201cthe god of shogi\u201d as an \u201cugly lie.\u201d That he only agreed to like the sport so he could survive. Indeed, in lying, Rei\u2019s father\u2019s friend Kouda takes Rei in as a foster child.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the young boy, loneliness just won\u2019t let go. Rei\u2019s presence in his foster family tears them apart. As Kouda favors the prodigy player, his other kids suffer. His son Ayumu regresses into seclusion, and Kyouko succumbs to rebellion and seethes with rage. Rage that she takes out on Rei through physical abuse.\\n\\n\r\nThis form of abuse is new to Rei, but abuse in general is not. For, as a school student, he has often been ignored or neglected by others, enduring mental abuse without really knowing it. Their bullying stops Rei from reaching out to anyone except for the ants on the ground. Even more loneliness for the lonely protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nRei, realizing what he (inadvertently) does to his new family, separates himself from them, choosing the path of a professional shogi player to keep his unluckiness from spreading. Sadly, despite his quick rise in the shogi world, Rei hits a block of sorts. With expectations of his future set high, and people (outwardly or not) questioning his abilities, loneliness further tightens around him.\\n\\n\r\nUp to now, Rei is a \u201cliar.\u201d A \u201chome-wrecker.\u201d A \u201closer.\u201d His situation is practically unfair and wholly unbearable. However, a wholesome, miraculous light in his life keeps him going: the Kawamoto sisters.\\n\\n\r\nAcross a couple of bridges and down a few roads, Akari, Hinata, and Momo accept Rei as one of their own. They brighten the atmosphere with delicious food, energetic actions, and cuteness galore. Through their personalities, nostalgia permeates the air. Warmth radiates outward. Kindness envelops everything.\\n\\n\r\nRei may not word it exactly this way, but, for him, their home is heaven on Earth. It\u2019s one of the only places where he can truly feel at ease. Where his loneliness must wait at the door and his happiness grows to levels he never thought possible.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s all thanks to the girls themselves. Beginning with Akari, she dotes on Rei as much as she can. She saves him from his \u201cfriends\u201d and their \u201cdrinking game.\u201d She leads the charge in curing his cold. She speaks earnestly with him about matters. She directly invites him over or slyly involves him in other ways to get him active.\\n\\n\r\nAkari\u2019s thoughtfulness cannot be understated. She looks after her two little sisters by herself. She works at her grandpa\u2019s shop and her aunt\u2019s lounge. She remains emotionally strong despite the pain they have experienced in their own lives. And that\u2019s not even the half of it. Akari is not only the best supporting character in 3-gatsu but also one of the best in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nHinata doesn\u2019t earn the same accolades, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t without her own incredibly supportive nature. She is genuinely glad to see more sides of Rei\u2019s personality. She thinks about how he\u2019s doing when he\u2019s not around. She overcomes \u201cboundaries\u201d like giving him food in front of and inquiring about Kyouko. Hinata\u2019s heartwarming relationship with Rei proves that she cares deeply about him \u2013 more so than he may realize.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Momo supports in her own way, too. She\u2019s a toddler, so she understandably can\u2019t do much. But, as she views Rei as her older brother and dances excitedly whenever he arrives, she subconsciously gives him a sense of responsibility and self-esteem that nobody can replicate.\\n\\n\r\nAkari, Hinata, and Momo are amazing supporters. So much so, in fact, that they even know when not to support. While the second half of the season contains less of these three than one would prefer, them giving Rei space argues for the fact that, sometimes, it\u2019s best to let a person focus on what he or she needs to so that they, too, can help themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not easy to do, though. Despite the girls caring for him, and despite his determination, Rei still struggles. He experiences agony. Arrogance. Anger. Just as the people in his life influence him, he affects himself through the actions and thoughts he takes. That is, loneliness cannot always be blamed on everyone else. It\u2019s also up to that person to do something about it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Rei does just that. He divulges his feelings to Yuusuke about going back to school and not wanting to run away. He reaffirms why he played shogi in the first place when he remembers the games that had his father really thinking hard. He agrees to forming the joint shogi-science club at his school to earn him a new set of friends.\\n\\n\r\nJust as things start to look a bit brighter, Kyouko injects herself into Rei\u2019s life. Now an adult, Kyouko preys on Rei. She isn\u2019t laughably maniacal or in possession of some mega power. Instead, she simply uses her words. To spite, to hurt, and to poison her foster brother.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko\u2019s manipulation, her uncomfortably forward physicality makes their relationship an abusive yet striking one. She loves him to death and despises his guts. She hates her father, she fell for a man one too many years her senior, and she is beyond selfish. As Momo would put it, she\u2019s a \u201cwitch\u201d \u2013 but also somebody in desperate need of support. Altogether, her complicated thoughts and her complex feelings turn her into one of the best \u201cvillains\u201d to grace the medium in a long while.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Rei, despite her abuse and their unique relationship, he wants to help his foster sister. And it\u2019s this reversal of roles, where he can be there for someone who is lonely, that ultimately gets at 3-gatsu\u2019s most important theme.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, Akari, Hinata, and Momo support Rei however they can. But they aren\u2019t the only ones who do so. Nikaidou is Rei\u2019s rival, motivator, and friend. Takashi may not always have tact, but he sincerely guides Rei as both a teacher and as an adult. His foster father calls him on his cell phone multiple times when he isn\u2019t responding. Shimada mentors Rei in the art of shogi, shows him what it means to persevere, teaches him what matters most when all is said and done, and gives him the chance to finally be relied on.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, there is always someone nearby who cares. Rei has lost. He has been bullied. He has been hurt. But he has never truly been alone. For, all around him, from the Kawamoto sisters to the man who \u201ccracked open his skull,\u201d people in Rei\u2019s life love him in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nThis sentiment applies to the audience, making it the biggest takeaway from this first season. Life can be cruel, mean, and unfair. Yet, despite the problems people face and the seemingly insurmountable terrors they confront, there\u2019s always someone nearby who cares.\\n\\n\r\nSure, it may not be people as perfect as Akari, Hinata, and Momo. But maybe it\u2019s a close parent or a significant other or a friend that hasn\u2019t been spoken to in years. No matter the case, someone is out there. Right now. Ready and willing to replace that loneliness with support of their own.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nJust as 3-gatsu\u2019s story, art, and characters demonstrate their power, the music and the sound that surrounds the entire experience does the same.\\n\\n\r\nIts opening tracks, \u201cAnswer\u201d and \u201cSayonara Bystander,\u201d fill the air with optimistic tones, rhyming lyricism, strong vocal work, catchy instrumentation, and various emotions. They create a set of powerful songs which capture the anime\u2019s drive to tell a tale that\u2019s both thoughtful and real. Their ability to not only kick off each episode with the right mood in mind but also invoke a sense of longing in the audience stands as a testament to their overwhelming strength.\\n\\n\r\nIts ending tracks have a similar level of strength but go down different routes. The first ED, \u201cFighter,\u201d embodies its title with a determined beat, sincere singing, and an empowering background choir. In comparison, the second ED, \u201corion,\u201d incorporates hip-hop, distinct snapping, and smooth harmonizing to uplift the audience with grounded delivery. Together, they represent the show\u2019s grander sense of hope and perseverance against the odds and the adversity that life so regularly throws into the mix.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing with the spirit of the show, 3-gatsu\u2019s original soundtrack implements music that strikes at the heart of its own ideals. In one track, crystal rings loudly to chill the air and to hallow out the atmosphere. In another track, zippy xylophone playing and a pronounced tuba reflect the infectious happiness of the Kawamoto sisters. In other tracks, piano moves effortlessly from soft and melancholic to fun and free as the mood shifts accordingly. Combined with acoustic guitars, marching drums, grating sounds, and a whole host of other instrumental work, the OST dares anyone to denounce its craftsmanship.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting performances likewise stand tall. Ai Kayano as Akari uses a mature and loving voice that brings calm and comfort in droves. Kana Hanazawa as Hinata ups the silliness levels with her boisterous tone. Misaki Kuno\u2019s cheerful way of speaking directly equates to the toddler\u2019s cute behavior. Kengo Kawanishi as Rei narrates his loneliness well while also ranging in his emotions throughout the season. And Nobuhiko Okamoto as Nikaidou yells and motivates with care and without end.\\n\\n\r\nTwo special side-shout-outs go to Ms. Kayano, Ms. Hanazawa, and Ms. Kuno. First for voicing the cats. 3-gatsuverbalizing the cats\u2019 inner thoughts was unexpected and hilarious, the three leading women making it so. Second, and speaking of cats, the anime\u2019s special ending track \u201cNyaa Shougi Ondo\u201d also deserves props. It was cool to see the creators go out of their way to (some extent) teach the sport of shogi to the audience. Even more impressive was making it into a song, using a cat motif, and having the women once again contribute with singing of their own (and few \u201cnyaa\u201d lyrics).\\n\\n\r\nNone of these musical pieces and performances mention the show\u2019s attention to other sound-effects. The clack of a placed shogi piece. A growing-ever-louder grandfather clock. The plunging of water. The anime goes everywhere with its metaphors, comedy, and emotions, and the included sound-effects always keep up, rounding out this aural experience in fantastic fashion.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIn my introduction, I wrote about my chess-dweeb era. It\u2019s something that I will cherish forever. Practicing with my dad on the couch while we watched television together. Defeating my fifth-grade teacher for the first time. Laughing with my friends about the dumb moves we made. I rarely, if ever, pick up a pawn nowadays, but chess will always be a part of me no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nChess and shogi aren\u2019t technically the same, but the show got me thinking about these precious memories of mine. Yet my connection to this anime goes deeper.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t lost my family. I\u2019ve never been abused or bullied either. Meaning, I cannot claim that my situation in life has been anything like Rei\u2019s. But I can empathize with his emotions \u2013 because I\u2019ve been there. I know what it feels like to be put on a pedestal only to let everyone down. To succumb to loneliness. To not seek guidance out of misplaced fear and shame when those around me clearly want to help.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m saving the details of my own life-altering story for a more momentous moment. Suffice it to say, though, I connect with this show beyond just the sport it depicts. And it makes me so gosh darn happy to see how, wrapped around my personal connection to this tale, the anime does almost everything right that it possibly could.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy makes me laugh a ton. Akari tapping her hands on the table back at Hinata. Hinata magically and hurriedly floating through the air and out the door. Momo asking Rei if he\u2019s her older brother or not. If it isn\u2019t already apparent, I adore the Kawamoto sisters.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama sucks me in. Kyouko\u2019s manipulation. Takashi\u2019s wise words. Rei\u2019s troubled life. I became so interested in what was going on that I took half a day off from work just so that I could finish the remainder of the season because I couldn\u2019t put it down.\\n\\n\r\nThe content itself means a lot to me. Purposeful themes treated with respect. All the creativity behind its visual direction. The strong writing throughout. Altogether, it\u2019s an anime that appeals to my critiquing mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, while I\u2019ve already slightly talked about her already, let it be known: I have the biggest crush on Akari. Beautiful. Motherly. Kind. Thoughtful. Sincere. Attractive. Mature. Strong. She\u2019s nothing short of angelic, and she has become one of my favorite characters of all-time without any shred of doubt.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this crush extends to the entire project here, for I love this anime. It\u2019s the kind of show that only comes around once in a while. An anime that represents what this medium is and demonstrates what it can do. And I\u2019m grateful to have had the opportunity to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, there\u2019s not much else I can write down. Which means there\u2019s really only one thing left: give it the highest honors possible.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion proves its outstanding worth in this medium through extreme execution. A thematically heavy story. Wonderful artistry. A host of awesome characters. Superb sound choices. A wealth of entertaining moments. Like any king, it has everything and then some.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s only the opening.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, as a thematically rich start to this journey, the tale explores life\u2019s duality of happiness and sadness through shogi, nuanced narrative elements, and purposeful plot points while delivering a meaningful and expressive slice-of-life drama\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, visual metaphors, impressive variance in artistry, and lovely character designs both engage the audience and bolster the themes therein\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Rei\u2019s unfortunate abuse and struggles expound on the concept of loneliness, the Kawamoto sisters define supporting characters, smart writing crafts Kyouko into a stellar \u201cantagonist,\u201d and a heartfelt theme on there always being someone nearby who cares solidifies the cast\u2019s incredible strength\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, a set of powerful OPs and EDs, an emotional OST, strong VA performances, and extra additions elevate the experience even further\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, personally relatable, downright entertaining, and Akari is beyond angelic\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10",

            "content": "Once upon a time, I fell in love with a show named Honey and Clover. Because of that love, I decided to check out other works by the author behind it (Umino Chica). This led me to discover 3gatsu no Lion. A story about shogi didn\u2019t seem really appealing, but I dove right into it nevertheless. Then bam, the feels train struck again and I loved it. I said to myself \u201cI wonder if this will get an anime adaptation just like the author\u2019s previous work.\u201d I waited patiently for a long time with the hope of the manga being turned into an animated masterpiece.And it did happen, I felt really happy about it. However, the adaptation managed to surprise me in so many ways despite having an initial idea what to expect from it, especially since Shaft was going to be the studio to adapt it. It was not the animated masterpiece I expected it to be, but still one of the best shows to have come out in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\n3gatsu no Lion offers a unique approach when it comes to blending elements from both slice-of-life and sports. First of all, shogi is presented as a professional thing. Most stories that revolve around sports are usually in school setting where they compete with other schools. In the world of 3gatsu, overhyped high school boys are replaced with composed adults. Arenas and courts packed with people are replaced with tatami rooms with only the limited presence of observers. There are actual stakes involved, since defeat can mean a threat to their career, their source of income. Simply attempting to be successful in shogi because you have the passion is not enough. The story makes that known as there are no plot devices or any other bullshit that can turn the tide during the match. A self-proclaimed shogi genius because he beats every person in his town can be just another hopeless brat when thrown into a pit of professionals. There are no shortcuts, convenience is subjective. Each move made on the shogi board is carefully planned and calculated like their life depends on it. A feeling of heaviness in every touch of a shogi piece, like a sense of burden channeled through every part of the player\u2019s body. Enduring and outsmarting the enemy is the key, as a single match can consume up an entire day. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the sense of competition prevails throughout the show, it is not always associated with intensity. The narrative is easy-going and introspective. The consistent monologues often remind me of Honey and Clover, very reflective and poignant. It conveys well what goes inside a character\u2019s mind: doubts, anxieties, hope, resolve, basically almost the entire spectrum of human emotions. The atmosphere emulated by the show can go from heartwarming funny moments amplified by Shaft\u2019s eccentric execution to serious dread especially during official matches. Outside shogi matches, the story focuses on the daily lives of the shogi players. We get a glimpse of their situation and then come to understand how and why they ended up choosing shogi as a profession. Take shogi away and everything will change. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now we get to the main character, Kiriyama Rei. He is seen as the next big storm in the world of shogi as past trends report that every professional who debut in middle-school always become the next master. In reality, he struggles like your average shogi player. His name is well-known, but he still has a long way to go by climbing up the ranks. What makes him interesting as a character is because of his troubled past that always try to come back at him when he tries to move forward. Even though he doesn\u2019t want to gain sympathy from others, his frail persona always gets him unexpected help. He acts timid and indecisive at times but can also act the opposite when push comes to shove. His character development is subtle throughout the story, further reinforced with his reflective internal monologues.  Sure, other shows have main characters like Rei but what they usually miss is having a well-grounded character background that makes us understand why that character acts that way. By that, I don\u2019t mean having a tragic past and then go on a full pity show on others when you feel being cornered and act unreasonable. Rei is quite different, he can act like your typical teenager that is undergoing an angst phase but he tries to be mature which is the result of him always being surrounded by adults. Even though he miserably fails at some occasions, it is the story\u2019s attempt to show that he is still a kid and can act na\u00efve. He has limited interaction to kids his age because he immerses himself with shogi, thus always being seen as a weirdo. There is always an underlying explanation to aspects of his character. Its fine saying you don\u2019t like him for who he is but at least you have to recognize that the show perfectly justifies it. It could be borderline victimization but there is an attempt to break out the victim role.\\n\\n\r\nThe presence of the Kawamoto household is possibly the best representation of the show\u2019s slice-of-life element. I feel like if they are omitted from the story, it wouldn\u2019t be the same. Sure, sometimes they get too much screen time which mostly consists of them drooling over sweets but I see it as like an ice-breaker from the overwhelming seriousness of the show most of the time. They also serve as a bridge for Rei to act just like an ordinary human once in a while. He can get hungry just like any other person. He can also display concern and worry over trivial things. He can feel like being part of a family, in which he copes up with his feelings about his experience with his foster family. There are also other people who help with respect to Rei's development as a character like his teacher Hayashida who assists him in his life as a student, despite having the option not to go to school and focus only in shogi. Even fellow shogi players like Nikaidou is relevant to his development as the sense of rivalry makes him evaluate his self-worth. This part of the show is just in equal footing with shogi in terms of relevance to the development of the story and its characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor my final thoughts on this show adaptation-wise, I think Shaft did a great job with it. Like I said in my introduction, it wasn\u2019t the animated masterpiece I expected it to be. It took a while for me to really vibe with what Shaft is trying to do with it, but it really manages to capture the essence of the show. I always envisioned the 3gatsu adaptation as really bleak, with hints of heartwarming moments, but Shaft managed to adapt it into something colorful and artistic. How it executes various scenes that incorporate symbolism with Rei\u2019s almost lifeless narration is beautiful. I can\u2019t forget in the first episode in which Rei did a shogi match with his foster father. The brilliance of how Rei\u2019s past is flashed every time a shogi piece moves was so emotional for me. If there is one major criticism I have with the show though, it would be how it transitions serious scenes with downright slapstick chibi comedy. It\u2019s kind of off-putting at times, but it\u2019s not bothersome enough to ruin the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, even without my slight bias for it as a fan of the manga, it is still a show worth checking out especially if you love slice-of-life. I could\u2019ve given it a higher score, but it\u2019s not yet there in terms of development. I\u2019m glad this is going to get another season and hope more people discover this gem I\u2019ve cherished for a long time.\\n",

            "content": "SHAFT previously installed a pretentious series that suffers from a massive diagnosis of what I like to call dialogue schizophrenia, making a guy with ahoge hair look cool while he continually sexually assaulting lolis; it reigned in unlimited amounts of money, yatta yatta (muting the preface point with that because this studio is the bane of my existence).\r\n\t\u2022 Still riding on the Bakemonogatari cash cow, I'm sure that they realized that adapting one of Chika Umeno's works (the mangka behind Honey & Clover), along with adding the overzealous, overly angular, dialogue heavy monologuing with a sexually ambiguous, teenage misfit boy that this would be aself-defining hit among narcissistic, Tumblr fags. I'm 100% sure that they weren't blind to their potential viewers.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I mean, they surely didn't know that the internet would fill Reddit forums with social justice powered, too deep for you conversations and people would GIFing the overly artsy and talkative moments, right? Let me clarify this for those you who didn't know, just because something is pretentious and artsy DOES NOT mean that it has any substance! The package is often different than the contents. Just imagine if A-1 had directed this instead of SHAFT.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I thought it was high-budget trash, quite frankly. If you want to see tons of money put into in-your-face conveyances of depression while watching a rather privileged orphan whine to himself in exagerrated monologues while he\u2019s allegorically drowning, than this is the series for you! This show is the primary example of what we you would call \"victim culture,\" which I absolutely hate about modern day society. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I say privileged, because the unrealistic degree of how nice people are to him is uncanny. I understand people being nice to someone because their mother, father, and little sister died. And somehow, to make it more dramatic, they show Rei, the main character, looking at their corpses in the morgue? Who let's a child look at their family's bodies like that?\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb But, back to my point about the weird way every single character bends over backwards to make Rei happy, no seriously. EVERY time Rei is depressed: his teacher, a family that takes him in like their own, and a rich kid that he beat in shogi either talk about how great he is, or give him back pats.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I've seen this before, I mean MC privilege is a dilemma prevalent in anime. It frustrated me, because it was like a self-insert fan-fiction or like Tommy Wiseau from The Room with side characters that I like to call \u201ctwo-dimensional-encouragement-puppets.\u201d But it frustrated me more, on top of everything, that main character still angsts dramatically with internal monologues. Many people on the interwebs even find this little shit \"relatable\" or \"likable\". One of his angsts were that his adoptive father loved him more than his two ACTUAL kids (***MC privilege***), so his step-sister was violent and made, what seems like consensual, sexual advances at him.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I know that realistic teenagers like to wallow in their own sadness, and feel alone and alienated, but is this something that should praised? No. This is why teenagers are often made fun of. The main character is such a genius at shogi that it is stated in the show that he makes more than his HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. What does he have to complain about? \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb He has:\\n\r\n\u2022  A professional shogi career.\\n\r\n\u2022 Unanimous accolades from everyone, except his bipolar step-sister.\\n\r\n\u2022 A family who unconditionally loves him and takes care of him, even though he's not related to them by blood.\\n\r\n\u2022  Friends and a school teacher that go out of their way to cheer him up.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb As someone who was adopted, I would have killed to have my life laid out so cleanly in front of me. Where are these all of these allusions to suicide and self-hate even coming from? People complained about the melodrama in Your Lie in April, but at least there was a character that was dying from a disease, that, you know, had a reason to angst or freak out. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb The banality of this series is astounding, Rei loses a shogi match and doesn't eat for days and more allegorical drowning. I get that he's a child genius, bordering on Asperger's, perhaps? Who knows? The series doesn't really clarify what the hell is wrong with him. It got better toward the end of the series, because it focuses on other characters like Kai Shimada (he has Kaiki Deishuu's voice actor) that made it bearable. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb This anime could be categorized along with the Monogatari with how absurd it is. I mean, there's angst then talking cats, depression metaphor then cute girls making food and talking about cute stuff. SHAFT treats you like you're some kind of intellectual when they go into the 3deep5me fucking dialogues\u30fcthat the main character has with himself. He's like one of those goths that writes poetry by candlelight.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb Overall, the visuals are pretty and music can be enjoyable at times, except when they insert precocious French music in episodes for no real reason. This series is what it would look like if a hack art student had gallons of money to dump into a project like SHAFT, who not-so-secretly embodies the spirit of an avant-garde student that lives in Calabasas, CA.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I give it a 2/10, though barely that. I nearly dropped this garbage because of how silly and immature it was. I felt like putting my head into a cheese grinder after every episode. You would need a bidet and a degree in licking assholes to enjoy this show.",

            "content": "Overall rating [9.2]\r\nStory [9.1] \r\nThis show starts extremely slow. It looks like it is going to go nowhere and the description saying that this show is about shogi doesn't help it one bit. But then comes the actual story which is great. It blends the shogi with the drama in a way that doesn't seem forced and fits into the story. It honestly made me think about the characters as persons but we will get to that later.\r\nArt and Animation [8.8]\r\nThe art of the source material got adapted great into animation. It leads into an almost perfect mix if not being for some hiccups inthe quality in some later episodes. The art is great but the problem is that still shots get used too often. Don\u00b4t get me wrong still shots can greatly improve some scenes but it just gets used too much to the point that at later episodes it gets you out of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8.5]\\n\r\nBoth of the openings are incredible. BUMP CHICKEN and YUKI did a great job with their respective songs \"Answer\" and \"Sayonara Bystander.\" Personally, I prefer \"Sayonara Bystander\" as a song but the animation doesn\u00b4t mix properly. \"Answer\" while not having the same emotional impact as \"Sayonara Bystander\" it is still a great freaking song that gets you hyped and the animation fully supports it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9.7]\\n\r\nThese are some of the greatest supporting characters of the last year. The sisters are incredible by making the story much easier to handle while not falling into a forgettable category. My favorite character goes to the middle sister Hinata since I actually see her as a fully developed character with motivations and dreams. The best part about the sisters is that their lives do not revolve around the main character which is a problem most animes suffer from. The problem with the cast is the main character and his family. They never seemed like actual people and especially the sister seemed too cruel and psychotic to be taken seriously. I honestly cannot see myself encountering any of these people anywhere in the world and that is the part that doesn't sell me completely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9.0]\\n\r\nThis is a great series that hooked me up from start to finish the problem is some of the passing. The beginning was a bit slow and some of the later halves of the show took away some of the enjoyment since they took me out of the experience. Aside from that, I think that the series was a great adaptation of the source material having read it myself. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nI would recommend this series to anyone that is ready to experience something more than your usual circle of things you want to watch. This is a perfect passageway to people who want to expand their horizons and see the beauty in life. This is why my overall rating is a 9.2.\\n\\n\r\nHope you found this review useful\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so I would appreciate if you could gic\u00a1ve me any feedback regarding my writing style and things that I could improve on.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Talking about Chika Umino's work is hard because her writing is something that always hits me very strongly. The way she describes mental illness, anxiety and youth problems is something absolutely touching and sometimes agonizing because, at least for me, is really relatable. Honey & Clover is my all time favorite manga, but this time, 3-gatsu animation is somehow a different kind of Chika's work. Relief happens less often and the excruciating feeling of drowning in negative feelings is more constant. Episode six was hard to watch non-stop. Maybe because now it's a story mainly about sadness, loneliness and depression. And that is actually somethingimpressive. Even though I don't really understand nor think about Shogi as an interesting sport/game.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) is my favorite part, just like in H&C. Her style is so cute <3 I love the details of the eyes, the cute animals, and now, the TALKING animals! Oh gosh, so much cuteness for my heart to handle.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) is simple, yet quite pretty. I barely noticed the background soundtrack - and I always do it strictly! Guess the story steals all the atenttion from it. Also, the dubbing is awesome! The voices of the characters fit perfectly, especially the female voices - that are also very cute.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu is about Rei's pain, most of the time, and this end up building our point of view about the rest of the story and the other characters (9/10) in a very strict way - probably because all the narration of the history until now was made by the protagonist only. But all of the characters are unique in their own way and full of characteristics that hold our affection with the passage of time. And these characteristics are so real that it's hard not to feel close to them somehow.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10) is amazing and yet kinda hard to go along with. The pace is purposely slow - and that makes it sometimes really deep and tense. Still, that is a perfect way to demonstrate how depression works, it's a perfect way to show to the viewers how hard is to feel anguished like that, how difficult it is to have a mind so full of thoughts and fears like this. I was positively surprised by this story that deals so well on the subject of psychological illnesses in a such intense and emotional way. After being so disappointed with various Japanese anime/manga that treat mental illnesses as banal or irrelevant things, watching 3-gatsu was somehow inspiring. I saw myself in various problems that Rei had, I could feel in my skin how scary some moments he spent were. And a show that creates empathy towards this issue is fantastic and without a doubt deserves all the credits. \\n\\n\r\nProbably not everyone will like or even truly understand it, but I think it was worth the time for all those who have been teenagers without friends at school, and didn't know how to express their feelings or had family problems/losses. \\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu is a story about trusting others, discovering your own strength and weaknesses, about letting it go and moving on.\\n\\n\r\nI'm very glad I'm having the chance to follow this series and I can bet some will like it as much as I do. And I really hoping for an emotional and very happy ending full of tears, just like Chika did in Honey & Clover.",

The story is gripping because of the gravity and emotions of the thoughts and feelings behind it, while also coupled with unexpected hilarious scenes that lighten it up enough to not feel overbearing. \r\nYou should not expect something action filled or a driving narrative from this anime, because that is not what it's trying to be. Instead, it focusses on the inner thought processes of various characters, though mostly Rei. It's very slow paced and can seem depressing at times, but luckily, just at the moments when things seem to gettoo heavy, there will be a funny moment to relieve the viewer of the tension.\\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review might contain spoilers on the anime \"Sangatsu no Lion\". Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nSangatsu no Lion, a jewel that did not make much noise\r\nWith the pace of current anime production it is impossible to see all the series. For that reason, some series only have a modest success, while others take all the fame. It is the case of Sangatsu no Lion, a jewel that went a little unnoticed.\r\nI must confess that when it premiered, I saw the first episodes and then I leftit there, parked. It was released in the fall of 2016 with Yuri !!! on Ice, Drifters, the third season of Haikyuu !!, Keijo !!!!, Bungou Stray Dogs season two, Occultic, Nine, Ajin 2nd season, Hibike! Euphonium season two, Shuumatsu no Izetta and Trickster, among others.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nHowever, of that group, Sangatsu no Lion is the least obvious at first sight. It was one of two series produced by Shaft that season, best known for Monogatari Series, Madoka and Nisekoi, so I already had the credentials to take a look.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the manga of Umino Chika had been awarded with the Cultural Prize Osamu Tezuka in 2014, a more than respectable endorsement. But what attraction can a melancholic anime have on a boy who plays Shogi?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Sangatsu no Lion?\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is the story of Rei Kirishima, a professional shogi player - Japanese chess - who is only 17 years old. Orphan from very small, after the death in an accident of his parents and younger sister, ended up under the care of the best friend and rival in the shogi of his father. But although his new adoptive father treated him with affection and respect, he could not help but feel the loneliness after losing his family. Especially when in his new home he lived with the two biological children of the house, who resented him for receiving the attention of his father, being a talented player.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a real family, or friends, his attitude towards life is negative and frankly depressing. So much so that he is unable to see that in fact if he has friends, even if they are few. This begins to change when he meets the sisters Kawamoto, Akari, Hinata and Momo, who give some family warmth to their cold existence. In the course of the 22 episodes we meet her adoptive sister, the troubled Kyouko Koda. The girl serves as the \"villain\" of the story, but despite that has a link with Rei, although it is a very twisted.\\n\\n\r\nThey also introduce us to their rival / best friend, Harunobu Nikaid\u014d, a young chubby and precarious health that, unlike our protagonist, has a passionate and positive attitude. The other great support of Kirishima is his teacher Takashi Hayashida, the only one in his school who knows that he is a professional shogi player. In addition, as the series progresses, Kai Shimada is introduced, a talented player who has not been able to reach the top due to the existence of Touji Souya. This one seems a reflection of Kirishima, but not much is known about him yet. Except that it generates admiration in Rei and that he is a genius of shogi.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime of contrasts\\n\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is definitely an anime series full of contrasts, between light and dark, with Rei Kiriyama in the middle, trying to get his place in life. The shogi is his lifeline and he clings to it with force, but that makes him lose his perspective. His way of seeing the same game that has guaranteed his survival in more than one way, isolates the world. But that is something that only happens in his mind, that is blinded and does not realize that he is not alone, neither in the Shogi nor in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told slowly, almost parsimoniously. When Rei is alone, the feeling of isolation and loneliness is palpable. It is clear that depression overwhelms him. But the Kawamoto sisters are his oasis, they are, as he very well puts it later in history, his kotatsu. When Akari, Hinata and Momo are on screen, everything is energy, color, happiness. Life is vibrant, sweet and warm.\\n\\n\r\nEven art mutates to fit the light and shadows in Rei's life. The music, full of beautiful notes, evokes nostalgia. If any weakness has this series, is that its pace is not suitable for everyone. It is not the kind of anime that we see to entertain us, it is one of those that make us reflect, look inside. Depression is a problem and this story of daily life has nothing new to say about it. Its purpose is another, it is to show us the joy of living even in the midst of a seemingly miserable life. It is to show us the evolution of a character that is maturing both in the Shogi and in life.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the rhythm is slow and the tortuous exposition of Rei's life becomes too reiterative, which is a bit less.\\n\\n\r\nAnother conflictive issue is how the series concludes. His final is open, just at the beginning of a new semester at Rei High School and a new season of Shogi. In the middle we are presented with a flashback of Rei's childhood, which serves to contrast between the child he was and the man in which he begins to develop. It lets us see that the Shogi already knows not the ticket to save his life, but to live it. As a conclusion it is perhaps unsatisfactory, but fortunately it already has a new season airing until this day of January, 2018. So we can continue to see how the story unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, the end of Sangatsu no Lion subtracts one more point from this anime. However, I can not stop recommending it, because it is a jewel. And I look forward to write about the continuation.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion presents the evils of depression and isolation in a way full of art. An art that mutates in light when its protagonist feels closely the love of three orphan sisters, like him. Its excessively contemplative rhythm and its open ending detract from this excellent anime.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n",

It's pretty darn good visuals, and its detailed, giving the main character, Rei, a generally grim face most the time, most befitting his character.\r\nTransitions from scenes are good, and I'm finding myself like the art style more and more each episode. Also the OP is pretty good and the ED\r\nSound: Well, the sound is pretty good. The OP is good, and the ED is good.The music hasn't really stuck out to me much. The sound effects are pretty good. Overall their good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well, each character is done extremely well, yes even the grandpa and Momo (especially momo) Regardless they are all very well done. Each has their own uniqueness to them, making me crave even more next week.\\n\\n\r\nStory: It's brilliant! Each character deals with their trials differently, and it is very entertaining to see how they deal with it. Furthermore it is extremely interesting to see Rei become closer to the three sisters as the story progresses! The story is equally balanced among all the characters, with of course Rei being the main.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm enjoying each episode each week. I genuinely am hoping for specific things to happen, and it is fun to see it all play out!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you try March Comes In Like A Lion out for yourself, and form your own opinion.",

            "content": "Sangatsu no Lion's first five minutes contain a scene I might characterise as one of the best in animation. A boy listlessly wakens, drinking out of necessity, dressing out of obligation, and leaving his sterile apartment out of confusion, an existence so fragile it could perish with the wind. He doesn't say anything. He doesn't tell people about his problems. He just moves on with his life. \r\nAt first I did not understand why this scene had such an impact on me. I thought it could have been the beautiful music, or perhaps the captivating artwork so characteristic of Shaft. That wasn't it. What overwhelmedme was how illustrative it was of human life. \\n\\n\r\nPeople often describe their favourite pieces of fiction with vague terms such as \"brilliant\" or \"life-changing\". Sangatsu no Lion is not life-changing, least not in the sense of it developing for me a different personality, or in creating new passions. What it did, rather, is give me the tools to better understand myself and, more importantly, why I am here. And that is the greatest answer of all.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Sangatsu no Lion is powerful would be an understatement. There are numerous moments, much like the opening scene, that do much with little. Most things are left implicit and unsaid. A simple, everyday conversation between family, about what their plans could be for the next day, or a brief conversation about one's quiet hometown can contain more weight and characterisation than a series might in its entire duration. Sangatsu no Lion is as well masterfully-produced, a technical triumph, Shaft's greatest accomplishment. \\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is at its surface an anime about shogi, but at its core a coming-of-age story of overcoming depression. Rei, the series' protagonist, is a deeply and inherently flawed being. He is timid - incapable of speaking his mind or getting his feelings across - and unhappy with his role in life. Many characters do not understand why he is this way, and indeed, for someone so gifted at shogi-- enough as to turn it into a career from a young age-- and blessed by such having such a kind family care for him, it is easy to be envious and to question why someone in his position could ever feel unsatisfied. He is still in his teens, after all, so it could merely be an irrational fit of teenage angst. And so they think, and so they patronise him.\\n\\n\r\nThere is more to Rei than the people around him give credit for. He never had a real family, nor even a youth, hence why he goes to school in an aimless search of one. He has nothing he can relate to but shogi. Even shogi brings him pain, as his thirst for victory ends only with him driving the loser to disappointment and despair. He needs to feed on other people's happiness to give meaning to his own existence, as without shogi, he will have nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't meant to instil feelings of pity in the viewer. Rei's problems, while significant and real, aren't much different from what everyone else in his world is dealing with. His eventual mentor, Shimada, struggles with a fear of disappointing others and with a chronic sickness that disrupts his ability to play shogi. Even Hinata, the carefree, younger-sister figure to Rei is dealing with issues of love and an anxiety of growing up. Rei's journey is not just about recognising and facing his own problems, but also in understanding that pain is a normal part of life, and something that everyone deals with. All one can do is to take it with stride.  \\n\\n\r\nRei's eventual breakdown is one of the story's most notable moments. I have read complaints of the scene being too dramatic, or that it took too long for Rei to get there. I feel that was the point. Simply being told \"no, you are wrong\" does not do anything to help fix a person's issues. Rei has already been told his entire life that he is wrong. It is through being kicked down, made a fool of, and, yes, breaking down completely that humans are able to grow the most. We are resilient creatures, and respond to failure with success. Rei is not meant to be entirely likeable to the viewer. He's just a dude and he has his limits, much like anyone else. He is meant to be human rather than an embodiment of all things cool and attractive, and I suppose it is this distinction that is bothersome to certain viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe scene where Shimada chats with Rei about Yamagata, his hometown, represents a lot of what makes the anime so special. The conversation is only 90 seconds long, and yet it encapsulates Rei's growth as a person. It culminates in his one simple quip back to Shimada, that even something dull is still \"something\". Rei has by this point become capable of standing his ground and arguing back, and of framing the world more positively. It is easy to not notice these things because Rei's evolution is not sudden or obvious. That is precisely what makes it great, and is why it feels so real. It is only in the small details do we notice change.\\n\\n\r\nMany aspects of Shaft's production are experimental in nature, and that definitely shows through in this case. While some of their other works, such as the Monogatari series, got a bit too focused on style rather than content (to the extent of being pompous or even pretentious, I would argue), the direction and artwork of Sangatsu no Lion is artful and stylish while still managing to keep genuine. The tenth episode's shogi match is one of the more prominent examples of this, where a thunderous orchestral piece plays as the two furiously and silently challenge one another. It doesn't require dialogue, as the visual and audio cues do more than enough to demonstrate who is winning and losing, and how much stress they are undergoing. There is even a scene that more closely resembles theatre, with jazzy beats playing while Smith slowly (very, very slowly) eats breakfast. Some may feel this is unnecessary, but I am of the opinion that it provided a wealth of character to someone who we really had not seen or understood much of by that point in the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a bit remarkable just how reminiscent the anime is of life in Tokyo. I feel that those who have never been here are missing quite a bit, as its depiction does well to make the world the characters live in feel real and relateable. It was actually a bit surreal in my case, as Rei goes to train stations, bridges and other areas that I have personally been to, and visits Sendagi at one point in the series: the quiet little neighbourhood in which I live. He even wears the exact same black coat that I bought at a local Uniqlo some months ago. So, understandably, I think, the anime has been a fairly personal experience for me. It's nothing short of stunning how much effort Shaft has put into making the setting feel like a real place where real people live. It is not a portrayal of Tokyo - it is Tokyo. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Sangatsu no Lion is without doubt some of the best that has been in anime. Most of the more heavy-hitting tracks are used sparingly, often only in one specific scene for a specific purpose, and accomplish said purpose with power and with triumph. In some scenes, such as the Yamagata talk, the first time \"Sayonara Bystander\" began playing, or the end of the twelfth episode when Rei promises to Momo to win, the music was effective enough to make my eyes water a bit. That isn't a reaction I normally have towards music.\\n\\n\r\nOne could argue that there is a bit too much comedy in the anime. And, certainly, if you are looking only for serious storytelling from start to finish, you may end up feeling somewhat alienated by the end. I might have preferred a bit less comedy, too, as the light-hearted scenes, while enjoyable (especially with how adorable Hinata is), are not quite as exciting as all the other pieces. But I can still appreciate its existence, as it would be disingenuous to remove it altogether and to pretend as if there are no happy moments in the characters' lives. Seeing Rei grow to accept the Kawamoto sisters is quite heartwarming, too. They care about him, even if he may not always care about himself, and by the end, they help him to find more meaning in life than shogi.\\n\\n\r\nIt's true that Sangatsu no Lion does not have much conclusion. Most of the problems the characters are dealing with are still an ongoing struggle by the end, and Rei is far from becoming a master of shogi as most anime protagonists typically would. Part of this can be attributed to logistical issues, such as a limited production budget and the fact that the manga is still ongoing. I don't think this creates an inherent flaw with the anime, however, as Sangatsu no Lion isn't really in need of an ending. There's no plot with a specific starting point and ending point-- it is rather a moment in time, a piece of Rei's life and those of the people around him. His depression persists, and he remains an imperfect and flawed person, even if he now has friends and family by his side. He's still searching. He's still running. Perhaps that will change by the end of the second season or the manga. Maybe it won't. And that would be completely fine. I don't believe there is anyone, even on their deathbed, who has ever been complete as a person. We start imperfect, and we end imperfect, gradually, yet surely, evolving, unchanging.\\n\\n\r\nWith most reviews, I feel compelled to discuss the anime in a mechanical way. \"The animation was nice\", \"the characters were developed well\", \"the plot was inconsistent\". It is because most anime feel crafted, like a specimen of sorts to be examined. How is this piece? How is that piece? Sangatsu no Lion never felt that way for me. It's bigger. It feels more real. And so I can't help but write something more personal, too. \\n\\n\r\nIs Sangatsu no Lion better than Honey & Clover? Maybe. Is it the best anime of the past decade? Perhaps. More than that? Could be. It is difficult right now to answer with complete certainty these questions I have been posing myself. Time is the best judgement, I feel. But I can say, without question or hesitation, that Sangatsu no Lion is the only anime since Touch that has had such a profound and visceral impact on me. And Touch was the best anime I had ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is a statement that unhappiness is OK. Being depressed, unsatisfied or stressed does not make you weak - it makes you human. And so I find it appropriate to close with a quote from Hinata:\\n\\n\r\n\"So what do you say at a time like this?\"\\n\\n\r\n\"You say to do your best.\"",

            "content": "My opinion:\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve always found reviewing slice of life series to be difficult and unpleasant, doing it is just tedious.\r\nIn recent years the anime production standards have steadily dropped culminating with the winter 2017 season which is filled with generic otaku-targeted shows, and thus 3-gatsu no Lion distinguished itself by having a more \u201cserious\u201d tone and being better, compared to the vast number of shitty series that aired at the same time.\r\nI usually avoid watching slice of life because, in most cases, the story is nothing special and the pacing is slow, leaving me unsatisfied and on the brink of falling asleep infront of the screen. Unfortunately that perfectly applies to 3-gatsu no Lion\u2019s case.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion revolves around Rei Kiriyama and his everyday life, portraying Rei\u2019s struggles with his past as well as the difficulties he encounters as a professional Shogi player. \\n\\n\r\nWith the show being part of the SoL genre, one can anticipate the story being dull with a fundamentally slow pacing that gradually tests your patience for the duration of the 22 episodes, and that it does.\\n\r\nThe story is simple, not original or engaging in any particular way, it holds no hidden messages or deep meanings and develops at a pace so slow that sometimes makes you doze-off in front of the screen. Well, to be honest, the show does hold a few \"hidden messages\" about family, life and such.\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s plot just plods along, inducing a comatose state that is very difficult to recover from.\\n\\n\r\nTo my pleasant surprise, 3-gatsu no Lion contains some drama as well as comedy having a few entertaining and gripping moments, covering and merging multiple tones, alternating introspective and dark scenes with lively and funny moments, features which helped progress the story in a more fluid way while the show did a fairly decent job explaining the Shogi game in a way that anyone can understand.\\n\r\nThe short flashbacks to Rei\u2019s past were some of the very few things I liked about the execution of this show, execution that was tedious except for a few exceptions to the rule.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough 3-gatsu no Lion is a character-focused show I was not impressed with its performance in this category, not even in the slightest.\\n\r\nThe characters are decently built also being decently developed but at the same time they are stagnant and ultimately feel bland. I personally did not find the characters to be likeable or relatable to nor particularly deep or intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nRei Kiriyama is a 17-year-old boy who had a harsh childhood during which he faced many difficulties and sad moments. The difficulties he experienced as a child traumatized him and drove him to become an introvert who spends most of his time alone, studying Shogi, game which is his \u201cpassion\u201d. \\n\r\nBy meeting the Kawamoto family, the changes in Rei\u2019s behavior and personality are put into motion, he slowly meets and starts to interact with more people while exploring his own emotions and getting to better know himself.\\n\r\nRei\u2019s parents passed away due to a car accident when he was just a child, leaving him alone in a world he did not know or fully understand. After the loss of his family, Rei secluded himself in the Shogi game, considering he had nothing left aside from that game. No relatives were willing to care for him but fortunately, one of his father\u2019s close friends was kind enough to welcome Rei in his home and treat him like part of the family, but in that man\u2019s home Rei will continue to face difficulties and sadness, being resented by the other two children. \\n\r\nWhile trying to escape from that pressure, Rei decides to live alone in Tokyo and work as a professional Shogi player in order to pay for his expenses. \\n\r\nAs the story develops so does Rei's character.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko Kouda, Rei\u2019s older adoptive sister, is a self-centered and egoistic young woman who has no real worries other than her relationship with Gotou (the bad guy), a married older man who also happens to be a professional Shogi player. \\n\r\nKyouko has no issues standing and watching Rei getting beaten by Gotou and when in need of help she has no issues going to Rei\u2019s house looking for help like nothing ever happened. She is described as a \u201cwitch\u201d by Momo, the youngest of the 3 Kawamoto sisters.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation and art are beautiful as well as the color palette which is very nice, featuring colors according to the tone each scene employs and clearly conveying the feelings and emotions the moment carries.\\n\r\nThe character design could have been done better and there are some minor flaws in the animation but other than that I have nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending themes are great, arousing and inducing a certain mindset for the viewer to have as well as setting the mood for the show.\\n\r\nThe OST is very good, working in tandem with the animation and perfectly conveying the emotions each scene carries. \\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job interpreting the characters, I particularly liked the 3 sisters\u2019 voices and also the voice of the pets.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nI\u2019ve always said \u201cWhy watch slice of life when you can go out and do the real thing?\u201d.\\n\r\nWatching 3-gatsu no Lion was a fairly bad watching experience, the show being very dull but having some entertaining moments to maybe remember.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.4/10\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is a show that I found difficult to finish and that made me constantly feel like I was wasting my time. I would not recommend watching this show unless you are a fan of the slice of life genre or you want to fall asleep.",

            "content": "3-Gatsu was originally an anime I started watching because I love Shaft's other animes, but a few episodes in I started watching to follow along on Rei's journey. \r\n8/10 Story:\r\nThe story resonates with me a lot. It's like a combination of figuring out life in the present and how to deal with your past at the same time. The story is more than just about shogi, it's more about the player. How he decides what pieces to use, what pieces to move, and try and overcome his next opponent/obstacle. It also applies to his life. He has his new family which currently guards him andhis past (pieces he lost) which keep coming back to attack him. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Art:\\n\r\nThis is pretty self explanatory. The art is unique and defines each situation perfectly. You can properly see how everyone is feeling in each scene. It's powerful and really makes you think back when you were hurt but then got through it thanks to a loved one. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Sound:\\n\r\nThe opening/endings always seemed to tell Rei's story just by listening to it. Everything was made well to fit the mood. It wasn't forced like laugh tracks from 90s comedies but I knew when to smile, be sad, and root for them thanks to the sound. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 Character:\\n\r\nAs far from how much I like their characters, It's pretty much 10/10. The only reason it's an 8 is because some of the characters got underdeveloped in comparison to the main few. I love them all as characters from their realism, supportiveness, and silliness. Even the characters we know little about, I wanna know more about them cus they seem interesting. Rei's sister, Rei's future opponents, and pretty much everyones past. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 Enjoyment:\\n\r\n3-Gatsu was that one anime I kept coming back to weekly. It was at times heartbreaking, heartrelieving, and at times very intense. I enjoyed the characters and the story that came with them, but at some points it was a little slow. I enjoyed it overall, and was happy as fk when they announced season 2 coming soon.  \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Overall:\\n\r\nAnother one of Shaft's animes that I actually liked. Hope you give this anime a chance because everything about it is relatable and enjoyable at the same time. \\n\\n",

It's like you are reading a book. And in this case, a very good one. The experiences come fast and furious for the main character, but the center of his universe is definitely 'shogi'. Also, you don't have to be a shogi expert to watch this although it has a 'game' tag on it. You will love how the story goes from silent to being dramatic, and from that to being so comedic. One time you will be crying,and then the next thing you know you've been laughing along with the character's dialogues. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10] - I've watched a fair amount of anime, and I speak for everyone when I say that this kind of art style is very unique. The way how every scenes were drawn into perfection, and how it can easily change your feelings toward the story make this anime one of a kind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10] - The opening and ending songs were performed by BUMP OF CHICKEN. So you can expect for it to be good. The soundtracks for every scene are on point. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10] - Although the main character has a deep background.

            "content": "[Reupload]\r\nFor starters, this anime could be close to a masterpiece. Why you ask? Well I'll tell you. It's animated by Shaft, who are known for extreme narrative and story abnormalities. Now that may sound bad, but the story so far has been directed beautifully. The way the story dives into the sadness of our MC's past really tugs on the heartstrings, but at the same time his current life is filled with happy moments that are heartwarming. The mix of drama and slice of life can get confusing or even annoying but I think that's just what makes this show really good.\r\nWhat is important tonote is that while having a main character such as Rei Kiriyama, a tragic backstory is nothing original. One might find that cliche or distasteful; however the mystery of his past as well as the growth of Rei as a person is what makes you feel the emotion the director is trying to impose.\\n\\n\r\nYou don't have to like or know anything about shogi to enjoy this anime. And trust me, there is more to this show than just shogi. Rei's everyday life is incorporated with happy slice of life scenes featuring the Kawamoto sisters (Akari, Hinata, and Momo). They help Rei understand the beauty behind life, and not just the struggles of it. Besides the story, the art is outrageous and surreal, but not realistic. Don't let that throw you off, because it still captures the moments of emotion in detail. The OP and ED are sung by BUMP OF CHICKEN (who are a very good band), and both songs are aesthetically pleasing and catchy. The characters and atmosphere make this show enjoyable as well and make you feel a part of the story. The OST helps with this, as it's vivid and picturesque.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, give this anime a chance. You might find something you'll enjoy a lot.

            "content": "The way 3-gatsu no Lion (March comes like a lion) is written is like a poetic adventure. Only thing is, the main protagonist is in his own story and we (the audience) gets to see what they experience. From that experience, the main protagonist Rei tackles through obstacles in his life, building relationships, and growing as a person. Adapted by the manga of the same name, this is a show that really takes slice of life to a unique perspective.\r\nThe creator of the series is Chica Umino. Some people may recognize her work such as Honey and Clover. As such, character designs represented in thisshow may feel familiar. However, 3-gatsu no Lion stands out on its own as we are introduced to Rei Kiriyama, a young man known for his professional shogi talent. Rei may seem like a successful person at first glance but deep down, he suffers from many personal issues. The show explores those issues in ways that really makes us curious not just about his life but how society, relationships, and a career can influence a person.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first few episodes, it\u2019s clear that Rei has talent when it comes to shogi. People even label him as a prodigy with a unique gift. Yet, Rei feels isolated in society as his real parents no longer exists in his world. However, fortune does smile on him as he meets Akari, Momo, and Hina, three sisters with gentle hearts that welcomes him as their own family. I have to admit, those very first few episodes gave me a realistic impression of Rei\u2019s character. There are those in our world where a prodigy can feel so alone. The expectations from their peers, coaches, and fans really put them on the edge when they deal with competition against rivals. For Rei, it seems even worse because of his unsociable personality and the fact that he has a strained relationship with his adoptive parents. On a professional level, his career hasn\u2019t really bloomed in his adolescence years. Sound something similar? Once in a while, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve heard similar stories in the news before too. Viewers coming into this show should really expect to see why Rei feels the way he views society and how he adapts to make his life better for himself.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of memorable moments in this show but perhaps one of the most influential is how Rei develops relationship with the people he meets. He\u2019s not an outgoing person and most of the time, he seems to keep to himself. This is evidenced by the cynical thoughts and narratives he voices in his head. Often times or not, Rei has trust issues towards others because of his past. The show cleverly does a good job at storytelling as we see glimpses of his past in multi-chapter arcs. Rei\u2019s personality is strongly influenced by his past that carries into the present. Fortunately, not everything is gloom and doom because Akari, Momo, and Hina brightens up Rei\u2019s life. They are like the light of his dark tunnel and we see how they are able to give him affection and treat him like a real family. Their influence in the show changes Rei as he realizes that he can trust certain people. Rei also becomes more aware of how being together with people is better than being alone. That\u2019s really what makes the storytelling and character of this show intriguing. We see the mistakes that Rei makes and life lessons he learns from. Rei\u2019s confidence grows and he begins to develop meaningful relationship with others. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the Kawamoto sisters, the show also offers a colorful cast of other characters. One of the most noticeable is Kyoko, the daughter of Rei\u2019s shogi teacher. Throughout the show, we learn the negative influence she has on him. The way this show expresses human emotions is most evident when Kyoko and Rei are in the same segments. To name a few, we got jealousy, hate, pity, among others. The way Kyoko taunts Rei can also get uncomforting to watch with her snarky attitude. What\u2019s important though is to understand her role in the show. It\u2019s not to just to make viewers despise her but also how Rei\u2019s negative side is often bought out in the worst way because of her influence. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the series also has a colorful cast of characters on the professional shogi scene. Rei\u2019s self-proclaimed rival Nikadou brings in many of the comical moments between them. Kai Shimada, a man in the late 30s, also has influence on Rei as he learns quite a bit from him throughout the show. Masamune Goto, a man that has a very complicated relationship with Rei\u2019s father stands out as a seemingly main obstacle in Rei\u2019s life. From this series, Rei experiences different feelings when it comes to facing off against his rivals. The in-depth narratives accompanied by the inner thoughts from his shogi matches gives us even a better insight of Rei on the competitive scene. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I am not an expert on shogi but it\u2019s fair to say that 3-gatsu no Lion knows its content when it comes to game perspective. While the show heavily involves psychology in those shogi matches, there\u2019s also strategy that is narrated and presented. Colorful imagery is also added to make the matches look larger than life. Even though the show can feel very melancholic, it still has many moments where it can draw an audience\u2019s laughter. The shogi matches, character relationships, and even non-human characters such as Kawamoto\u2019s cats are just a few examples. In fact, the show seems to not forget any character throughout its recourse. Unfortunately, this 2-cour adaptation is simply not enough to cover everything. The manga is still ongoing and as faithful as this is adaptation is, there\u2019s still plenty that are left uncovered. Perhaps another season can explore more options but in a span of 22 episodes, that\u2019s not really happening.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Shaft, it\u2019s pretty recognizable that 3-gatsu no Lion has its style. While Shaft\u2019s iconic head tilts aren\u2019t the main factors when it comes to art direction, it\u2019s still very Akiyuki Shinobish. Inspirations are drawn from the flashy segments, dialogue usage, and background imagery are just a few to name. It feels experimental at times while demonstrating a superior feel of realism. One thing I was really impressed by is how almost every camera shot focused on Rei reveals his feelings. Character designs are influential by the author\u2019s works and very faithfully adapted from the manga. That being said, Shaft\u2019s art style may not be for everyone but for 3-gatsu no Lion, it hits the nail in the coffin. \\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion may not be a show about music but even its soundtrack works effectively thanks to the talent of its production staff. The melancholic atmosphere is well choreographed with cleverly timed OST. The theme songs very well fits with the show\u2019s themes. In particularl, Bump of Chicken\u2019s OP song \u201cAnswer\u201d really bought out the psychology of the show. However, I think the biggest praise should be given to Rei\u2019s voice actor, Kengo Kawanishi. The way he voices Rei makes him feel very believable especially during powerful moments. Voicing a character like Rei honestly feels difficult but he pulls it off without trouble. Finally, the show\u2019s narratives remains strong throughout the show. Rather than relying on a narrator, it doe the storytelling itself with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nWatching 3-gatsu no Lion feels very different compared to some of the other shows I\u2019ve watched in relating to exploring the growth of a prodigy. It not only has heavy characterization but the psychology of the show gives a unique feeling of its storytelling. The relationship building and realism really gives slice of life more than just every day adventures. Because for circumstances, every day is a challenge for Rei as he takes on himself. Whether it\u2019s in life or on the competitive shogi scene, we can see how Rei develops as a person. I can\u2019t safely recommend this show to everyone however. It\u2019s definitely a show that isn\u2019t for anyone\u2019s taste and for manga readers, you may feel slightly disappointed by what\u2019s still left out in the dark. Yet in the end, 3-gatsu no Lion is able to breathe life with its powerful direction and a story of compelling melodrama. \\n",

            "content": "Ever since Akiyuki Shinbo joined as director in 2005, Shaft has been on a rampage, pushing its avant grade cinematography (and head tilts) to the limits. And now that they've made a name for themselves (and the fact that they're all out of source material on the monogatari series), they have started to calm down. Compared to last year's Owarimonogatari (and the subsequent Kizumonogatari movies this year), they have a Slice of Life entry this fall season by the name of San-gatsu no Lion (or March comes in like a Lion). Based on a well received ongoing manga, the story revolves around Kiriyama Rei, ahigh schooler and a pro shogi player, living an independent life in a rather empty part of town. Having lived through a mountain of trouble as a child and not-so-good experiences at his foster family, the repressed emotions and lack of \"love\" (if you will) has made him depressed and lonely inside. The only thing he has left is his career as a shogi player, which, sadly, started with a lie. So, a life (and mental sanity maybe?) built on such a feeble foundation can only last so long. And so it all starts to crumble and he starts going into a downward spiral.\\n\\n\r\nBut fear not, all is not lost yet. Enter the three Kawamoto sisters. Having gone through some rough times themselves, they had one another to lean on, and so they live their modest lives full of happiness and laughter with the occasional sad reminiscing. And thankfully, they drag our protagonist into it, and it acts as a sliver of hope in his life. His interactions with them and the subtle changes they cause in his personality seem to be the main focus of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow, there are a few things to watch out for, if you're thinking of picking this up.\\n\r\nNumber one is the drama, the kind of drama where there are lots of tragic flashbacks and broken, damaged characters. If you find characters wallowing in depression appalling, this might not be your cup of tea. Though I would say that the creators have put a lot of effort in Rei's backstory as it feels \"legit\" and in-sync with his character.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, is the game of Shogi. They say shogi is like chess, except that it's not (well it is, in essence, a strategy game). Compared to the 16 pieces per player in Chess, Shogi has 20 pieces; there is no queen, and two new pieces - silver general and gold general are in play. Even the board is different (its a 9x9 instead of an 8x8). Point is, if you don't know shogi, parts of the show involving it - like the surprised look on players when the opponent makes an interesting move (a shot of the board with all the pieces, a move, and cut to character's face), or analogies/metaphors relating to our main characters life, will probably make little to no sense (or won't have the desired effect).\\n\\n\r\nNumber three is Shaft. Now, I already said that they're trying to calm down, and they are, I mean, 5 episodes without a head tilt (Shinbo must be screaming in frustration, good thing Kenjirou is in charge), but, it's still Shaft. And I've seen some people complain about the artstyle. Thankfully, it all isn't as erratic as the monogatari series and I am fine with it. Heck I love how they keep the contrast when switching perspectives from the depressed MC to the cheerful sisters (love the color palette too, and the opening).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion. I like where this is going. I like that the main character is \"damaged\" damaged and not just damaged for plot's sake, his backstory really gets me. And I am interested in how far down he is going to fall before he gets over his past or if the past is going to come back to haunt him, either way, he will face it and that's what I'm looking forward to. Also, this is Shaft and I have hope that they aren't going to mess this up. But if they do, I'll update this.",

            "content": "tl:dr Sangatsu no Lion is a completely pointless series, revolving around a few more than flat characters.\r\nI'll try to be as spoiler free as possible while pointing out what I think worked and what not.\r\nStory: 3\r\nIn a few words, the story in Sangatsu no Lion is \"playing shogi\". For as much as I would like to say that it talks about a kid growing, fighting his fears, learning how to relate to other people, eventually understanding how to live one's life, all of this is just barely touched, focusing more on \"what if I moved the pawn in A7 instead of B2?\". In 22 episodes,absolutely nothing relevant happens. No epiphanies, no events, no change, or if something happens, it's brushed off in an incredibly simplistic way. \\n\r\nWe could think that since this is a Slice of Life, it reflects reality as it is, and oh, it does it perfectly. But please don't tell me that your usual, every day, routine lives are worth a series. Mine, is not.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nFor as much as I love shaft, the style here is pretty different from their usual. The colour palette, the watercolour-ish style, the animation itself were really pleasant to watch, as they give a warm vibe when it's needed, but doesn't work so well in the more \"cold\" scenes. Also, the classic shaft antics recur here as well, and maybe, they weren't so needed. What really bothers me here is the character design. From the beginning to the end of the series, the characters lose more and more punchiness and details, starting from a very specific character design (those mouths, really?) ending with a generic character from any other series of the last decade.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nNot much to say here\\n\r\nOTs and EDs are not so bad, but also not memorable. I finished the series half an hour ago and I already forgot what they sound like. Same goes for the background sounds and music. About the voices, the cast is galactic, it worked pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nLet's say you try to give an honest vote to your completely normal neighbour, or the guy that used to seat on the left corner in your classroom. That would be pretty hard, I imagine. The same goes here. The characters are completely normal people, but instead of having those many hues a normal person would have, they are just parodies of their \"IRL\" counterparts.\\n\r\nThe MC is the usual \"kind of problematic\" character. Introvert, social issues, no friends, focused only on shogi. You keep watching him doing nothing, saying a lot of \"I will whatever\", then going back doing nothing. Just stupidly thinking about shogi. So much to forget to drink for days! Can you imagine that? \\n\r\nThe female cast is the \"obliviously-incredibly-good-and-sweet-girl-that-oh-so-love-to-help-you-for-whatever-reason-and-obviously-loves-sweets\". As too often, the women in Sangatsu are put in the kitchen or related domestic areas, and those are the only moments in which you see them. Since it's a shogi anime, you could think there are also female shogi players, but no, the only one that you can see doesn't play anymore. \\n\r\nIs the rest of the cast worth mentioning? the fat but passionate kiddo, the cold and invincible player, the mentor, the blonde with weird haircut guy?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/ Overall 4\\n\r\nI think I said everything I had to, with very bad grammar and vocabulary, tho, but since this anime has been so hyped up, I could not shut it\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion fails on every front. It fails in narrating a story, even a slice of the story, introducing elements that will be lost in the next scene, breaking tragedy or tension with out of place comedy, but still failing with both of them. It fails with its characters, with too good or too bad people that could exist in other genres, or using cliched characters that, as usual, follow the flow with no question asked. It also fails with the art, lowering the quality episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there are a lot of way better anime out there. go see them. \\n\\n",

            "content": "3-gatsu no Lion is adapted from Umino Chika\u2019s (also known for Hachimitsu to Clover) award winning manga of the same name. Some people tend to be worried when they hear that studio Shaft is going to be adapting anything, but Shaft perfectly adapted the already great manga of 3-gatsu no Lion in a very creative way, as they usually do. \r\n3-gatsu no Lion tells a story about a boy that tries to find a place where he belongs and is accepted, a story that consists of many different parts, each of which can stir up many different kinds of emotions, and when all of themcome together, they make this amazing series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story that 3-gatsu no Lion tells is that of Rei Kiriyama, a 17-year-old boy who has faced many troubles and sadness despite his young age. His losing his family when he was still a child and even facing problems while living with his adoptive family, have caused him many traumas and insecurities and made his personality reclusive. While trying to find a way to escape from that pressure, he decides to live alone, in Tokyo, but how is he going to make it on his own? The only thing that Rei is talented at and can depend on is shogi, since he is one of the few people who became professional players while in middle school. But even like that, Rei sometimes faces pressure from the shogi community, he can\u2019t take proper care of himself and doesn\u2019t have any friends.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s when he meets the Kawamoto sisters, who are determined to take care of Rei and make him feel less lonely with their hospitality.\\n\r\nAs he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally, he slowly meets and interacts with more people, from the shogi community, school or his family, and gets to understand his own complex emotions.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is more of a slice of life/drama series with some comedy, but there is focus on shogi, too, which also helps the story progress and the characters develop. Although shogi is one of the basic elements of the anime, it\u2019s really not necessary to know anything about it and understand exactly how they are playing in order to know what\u2019s going on and enjoy the matches. Everything you need to know is told by the characters, through the great description of their feelings and thoughts during the matches.\\n\r\nThe narration is simply amazing, the more you watch and listen to the characters talking, the more you are getting drawn in this wonderful story. The way the characters describe how they feel, the troubles they are facing, the dialogues and interactions between them, all seem extremely realistic and even relatable, you can understand exactly what they are going through just by hearing them talking. And as they are thinking through the monologues and they interact with each other, their feelings gradually change, which offers great development to the story and the characters.\\n\r\nIt certainly looks like a simple and slow paced story but it can be serious and dramatic, but also very heartwarming and with more lighthearted moments, each of these parts is perfectly handled.\\n\r\nAs for the adaptation, studio Shaft did a remarkable job and remained completely faithful to the source material, following the chapters and the dialogues exactly as they should.\\n\\n\r\nThe best and main part of 3-gatsu no Lion and what makes it as great as it is, is definitely the characters and their development. \\n\r\nThe main character of this story may be Rei, but all of the characters receive the necessary amount of focus. They are all amazingly fleshed out, deep, they feel realistic and have unique and interesting personalities. Even the ones that you would consider characters with a mean personality, are enjoyable to watch, you can sympathize with them and they have a reason behind their actions. \\n\r\nAll of them get gradually developed and more of their backstory, personality, thoughts and feelings are continuously revealed.\\n\r\nThe character with the greatest and most obvious growth is, of course, Rei, who keeps changing throughout the whole series, but the other character's growth is also impressive.\\n\r\nThe relationships between the characters also feel very human and watching their interactions is always enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art and animation, it\u2019s obvious that Shaft did an astonishing job. They used the unique art style of Umino Chica without changing anything and added their own special, creative touches as they usually do. The result was aesthetically beautiful, with nice and unique character designs, detailed backgrounds and great cinematography. \\n\r\nThe expressions of the characters are great and perfectly used in both the serious and the funny scenes.\\n\r\nThere are also many metaphorical scenes with great symbolism, that depict the characters' thoughts and emotions in a very creative way.\\n\r\nThe color palette is also very nice and the colors are used correctly according to what each scene wants to show. They can go from really dark colors that show up when the characters are anxious, tense or depressed, to brighter and cuter ones for the more lighthearted scenes. The shift of the colors really adds to the whole experience and makes us understand better how the characters feel at that moment, especially when it comes to the serious and dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in 3-gatsu no Lion is great, it always fits the scenes perfectly and helps them convey their overall feeling better.\\n\r\nThe first OP and ED, \u201cAnswer\u201d and \u201cFighter\u201d by BUMP OF CHICKEN, are truly beautiful. It\u2019s nice how they used \u201cFighter\u201d as the ED song, since it was the song used for the first collaboration between the band and the author, a short music video of 3-gatsu no Lion.\\n\r\nThe second OP, \"Sayonara Bystander\u201d by YUKI, and ED, \"orion\" by Kenshi Yonezu, are also pretty nice and fit the anime.\\n\r\nEven the shogi song, \"Nyaa Shougi Ondo\u201d by the sisters\u2019 VAs (Kana Hanazawa, Ai Kayano and Misaki Kuno), was pretty cute and offered some information about shogi.\\n\r\nAnother nice detail is the cute sound effects and the animals\u2019 little dialogues, which are pretty funny.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job and managed to convey the characters\u2019 feelings perfectly. \\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion may look like a very simple story, with no really extraordinary elements. But the way it manages to handle and describe all the complex, but human feelings and thoughts of the characters so naturally and perfectly, is what makes 3-gatsu no Lion a masterpiece. The many different situations that the anime depicts, the dramatic ones or the heartwarming ones will definitely stir up your emotions and tug at your heartstrings. \\n\r\nIt may not be an anime that pleases everyone\u2019s tastes, but it is definitely unique, realistic, refreshing and worth dedicating some of your time to watch it.",

            "content": "Note: I will try my best to keep the review unbiased.\r\nStory:\r\nSangatsu no Lion is about a genius shogi player known as Kiriyama Rei. Kiriyama is suffering from social anxiety and maybe depression. There is nothing new about stories depicting a main character suffering from psychological problems but it feels fresh when it's placed in a competitive game setting. Unlike most sports anime series who continually shows a character's love for the sport and their live revolving as a sport, Sangatsu shows the otherwise. Shogi is only a backdrop for Kiriyama, he continues to move on life as he uses Shogi as a means for living.\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIf I could sum it up in one word it would be, serene. Lively, light-hearted moments are portrayed in vibrant pastel distinguished with Shaft's style of character animation. Monologues and dream-like sequences are placed in cool colors with a refreshing placement of blacks. These contrasting palettes gives off a very emotional feel like we're Kiriyama himself. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs seems very similar with Umino Chika's other series, Honey and Clover. There is nothing unique, nor eye popping in these. It just feels, at home. Normal. The cats are very well characterized, I give them that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nSo far, the soft music accentuates the backgrounds with a few exceptions like that edm shogi-fight which honestly sounded off. Apart from the acoustic guitar and piano music, I think the OP and ED stands out the most. Bump of Chicken brilliantly voiced out emotions out of the songs. It sounded deep with a sense of choking but it lets you breathe out during the chorus. \\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms about the voice actors. Nothing feels off and I heard some familiar seiyuus. I do however love the cat's voices, it definitely feels comedic and adorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characterization so far portrays Kiriyama, we already communicate with him through his monologues. We are also shown a variety of other characters which do not fall into the normal character tropes. We look into the other characters like Kiriyama's self proclaimed rival, Harunobu. He was initially shown as a lively comedic character and yet his background made him a person who will tolerate anything just for the sake of the game. It was humanizing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sangatsu no Lion has an involving drama between characters accompanied with a beautiful art and calming sound. It's currently running as the best series this season.",

Hate when an anime spends a good portion of its time depicting a board game that you don\u2019t understand? Then this isn\u2019t for you. Have a short attention span and don\u2019t like slow-paced series? Then this anime is definitely not for you!\r\nNonetheless, I genuinely LOVE March Comes in Like a Lion!! So what about this series makes me love it despite rating it a 7 and being Debby Downer? Easy: the main character, the art, and the heavy narration.\r\nCharacters: Rei isprobably one of my favorite character that has come into fictional existence over the past few years. He is different from all the melancholic male characters out there. Yes, he does mope around and feels sorry for himself, but he doesn\u2019t whine nor does he have an undesirable urge to play victim and guilt trip all those that are around him. He is this unique quality character that is not found in stories that often. His growth does not happen immediately. It\u2019s a very slow process. It\u2019s the people around him, the small mundane things, and the ruminating thoughts he has that allows him to grow. His ability to come to terms with his circumstance and his attempt to widen his perspective is a breath of fresh air for me. He really embodies an insecure 17 year old who is trying to become an adult. Observing Rei grow makes this whole series worth watching. He is a wonderful example of creating a slice-of-life/coming of age character. Furthermore, as a viewer who overanalyzes everything and is stuck in my own thoughts while living a monotonous life, Rei\u2019s (and his \u201cmentors\u201d) numerous insightful quotes are always worth reflecting upon. \\n\r\n So what about the other characters? First and foremost, most of the characters are mainly there to highlight the story of Rei. So the fact that Rei\u2019s development is incredibly slow means that other character growth are undeniably slow. It\u2019s so slow that unfortunately they are only seen as the typical stock characters. I\u2019m only going to discuss the three sisters (Akari, Hinata and Momo), and Rei\u2019s actual \u201csister\u201d (Kyouko) to make my point, but the other side characters have similar problems.  \\n\r\nLike Rei, Rei\u2019s \"sister\u201d is also the melancholic type. However, the difference between these siblings are noticeable. She is the \u201cwoe unto me\u201d type with a Kurt Cobain flare (more like the obnoxious Sasuke Uchiha from  Naruto). The femme fatale, the woman who comes to ignite the flame to the series. Anytime she brings herself into Rei\u2019s life, drama is inevitable. To add the chaotic-ness of her personality, there also seems to be some uncomfortable (\u201csexual\u201d) tension amongst Rei and her; this point could hopefully be proven void later on, but as a viewer it does create a natural curiosity to keep wanting to know what had happened to both of them prior to Rei\u2019s current living situation. \\n\r\nAs for the three sisters, they are the exact opposite of Rei and Kyouko. They are introduced at the very beginning of the series, and they are there to radiate love and happiness to Rei\u2019s black and white existence.  Together, the sisters represent the warmth and compassion that a family unit could be filled with. However, the main concern I have with these ladies is that even though March Comes in Like a Lion is half way done, they are not even slightly fleshed out. Momo, the youngest sister, is basically there to be cute. Nothing else. Just to be cute. Akari is the typical sweet female character. She is considered to be beautiful, gentle, mild-tempered, and extremely maternal: the epithet of \u201cperfection\u201d. Hinata is probably the sister that stands out the most which is quite the irony, because in reality she is so normal that she wouldn\u2019t stand out at all. She\u2019s not too cute. She\u2019s not too perfect. She is just an average girl. The problem I have with these 3 sister is not that they are stock characters, but they have so much to offer and it is not being showcased. There are subtle hints and moments that makes it obvious that their life is not as simplistic as it appears. They have a gloomy history and they have struggled a lot. It is unfortunate that this is a slow-paced anime because their potential as characters is obvious. Although there is no doubt in my mind that this series will do these sisters justice and gradually mold and shape them, I find it a little sad that many viewers will only see them as just shallow/uncreative archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is possibly my favorite part of March Comes in Like a Lion (Studio Shaft is remarkable). It honestly feels like I am watching a book because this series manages to wonderfully combine heavy narration (which I usually tend to dislike) with divine imagery.  As I mentioned a thousand times already, this is a very slow- paced anime. However, even when nothing is happening the art is able to speak volumes. \\n\r\nI am an impatient human being and I lose interest easily. So when the show focuses on a shogi match (which I have difficulty fathoming), the one thing that keeps my attention asides the dialogue is the art. For instance, while the characters are playing shogi, they are consistently drinking liquid. Water and liquid is something that is always brought up in the art throughout each episode, and this does not surprise me. Water is able to give life and hydrate the body, but at the same time it is able to drown and suffocate a person\u2019s soul. The artistic style can be observed and reflected on for days if one wanted to understand the atmosphere and tone of the story.\\n\\n\r\n Rei and the art are probably the key reasons one should watch this series. Although this anime does feel boring, that does not mean it is awful. The story is executed in such a way that character development and growth feels realistic. Again, this is not a series for people who need to be stimulated with action/philosophical scenes every few minutes. Nonetheless, the writing and concept of March Come in Like a Lion is so well thought-out that I actually would recommend people to watch this series even if they may drop it after a few episodes in. The only suggestion I can give a person who is interested in wanting to view a slow-paced series but is unable to focus, is to watch it with another person so the uneventful section of the show can feel somewhat less intolerable.\\n\\n\r\n(On another completely irrelevant note: the creators of this series really love cats; there are so many annoying cats in this show)",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe pawns were my friends, the knights my family, and the queen my lover. For I was king.\r\nWhen it came to chess, I was the best. In my corner of the world, anyway. I lived the sport as much as I could. Winning school tournaments, going to summer camps to learn new skills. Squaring off against multiple opponents simultaneously. Practicing with a plastic travel set and a versus timer and a book on named openings. For a while, chess was my calling. A passion that neither bishop nor rook could squander.\r\nToday, that\u2019s no longer thecase. Writing, programming, and other -ing\u2019s have replaced what was once my kingly domain. But, even today, having not played chess for years, I know that I could go back to that board. See the same familiar pieces. And they would invite me back with open arms (if they had arms, anyway).\\n\\n\r\nBecause, just as 3-gatsu no Lion would claim, what we experience never really leaves us \u2013 and that there\u2019s always someone waiting to lend a loving hand.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu centers on a young man named Rei Kiriyama. As only the fifth shogi player to become a professional while still in middle school, the prodigy engages in hard-fought battles in this sport of the mind. However, his most daunting battlefield occurs off the board. In a place simply called \u201clife.\u201d But thanks to Akari, Hinata, and Momo, three kindhearted sisters in his neighborhood who have taken him under their wings, Rei survives onward, fending off \u201cattacks\u201d all around him.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to outside sources and information about the series in its current state, this season of 3-gatsu is merely the first of many. In what is meant to be a very long, very articulate journey (should the original author, SHAFT, and the anime gods will it). Thus, these introductory twenty-two episodes have the honor of setting up its story for the audience. What it entails, where it plans to go, and why any of it matters at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd like a shogi board primed for an upcoming match, 3-gatsu sets up said story with expert ease.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take too long to understand that shogi in and of itself makes for an important plot element for this anime. This sport forms the crux of many of the events and becomes the driving force behind Rei\u2019s actions. It\u2019s essentially Japanese chess except it includes a few extra pieces (the lance, the golden general, etc.).\\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing extensive, 3-gatsu teaches the audience about these different pieces and the overall structure, letting the audience have a better grasp of this plot element on a technical level. And it does what it can to vary up the depicted matches. Quietness, sweltering heat, hyper-focus. While the board and the pieces never change, each match has a certain air about it that keeps them from falling prey to stagnation.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, shogi is not the most thrilling of sports to watch. There\u2019s no \u201caction\u201d besides the players picking up and placing their pieces. Moves often require many, many minutes of thinking. The environment calls for very little fanfare.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, like most sports anime (and, indeed, most sports stories), shogi isn\u2019t necessarily all about the spectacle. Rather, it\u2019s a catalyst, a vehicle that allows 3-gatsu to carry its grander, more thoughtful ideas forward.\\n\\n\r\nIt starts by viewing shogi in a thematic sense. Yes, it\u2019s just a bunch of wood carvings with Japanese words etched into them. But, in the larger context of the story, it means so much more.\\n\\n\r\nShogi is a singular sport; the player can only rely on himself or herself. In a way, it\u2019s rather lonely, almost isolated. Yet it\u2019s also a dual (and duel) sport. Someone else takes the other side of the board, forcing two minds, two ideals, and two people to clash. In a broader sense, shogi requires a winner and a loser (which is almost always the case based on the rules). Each player can only control his or her own pieces, meaning they themselves command their fate. And the game\u2019s rooted tradition and strict etiquette mask the tumultuous feelings harbored within.\\n\\n\r\nAs described, and considering the context of 3-gatsu, shogi is a metaphor for life itself. Individuals act on their own and interact with others, controlling what they themselves say and do. They \u201cwin\u201d and they \u201close\u201d all the time. They don\u2019t always reveal how they feel, for emotions aren\u2019t the simplest to explain.\\n\\n\r\nThe parallels here are important because, outside of shogi, where 3-gatsu truly matters, life and what it encompasses takes precedence on a thematic and narrative level.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, one of the anime\u2019s most pronounced characteristics is its tonal range. The story will often swing back and forth between extremely heartwarming and utterly crestfallen, raising and lowering the audience\u2019s emotions without remorse. It can be slightly jarring at times, but this dichotomy speaks to life\u2019s own emotional rollercoaster. How happiness and sadness are closer than one may believe.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, both sides of the spectrum elevate 3-gatsu\u2019s plot points and explore its vital themes. On the happy end, Akari, Hinata, and Momo\u2019s nostalgic, loving home is Rei\u2019s \u201ckotatsu.\u201d They implore the importance of togetherness. That a belly full of food, a few good laughs, and a company of loved ones is all it takes to warm the soul. On the sad end, Rei\u2019s barren apartment with an equally lonely lifestyle stresses reality\u2019s gloomier corner. While tough to stomach, depression is a formidable foe that cannot always be cured with a touching smile (let alone a silver general).\\n\\n\r\nTo reach these ends and continue its exploration on life, the show fills its space with even more thematic exploration. It focuses on family \u2013 Akari and the girls, Rei\u2019s deceased family, his foster family \u2013 to highlight how such close bonds both heal and harm. It emphasizes certain mindsets like having no regrets and refusing to lose. It talks about self-worth and the challenges people face in their own lives.\\n\\n\r\nYet the most intriguing thematic element (besides shogi) is its most prevalent feature: water. For Rei, water symbolizes so many of his darker thoughts: suffocation, obstruction, restriction. But it also symbolizes what could possibly be: refreshing, buoyant, sustainable.\\n\\n\r\nIn one scene, a thunderous storm hearkens harsh ocean waves that drown his mind. Then, in another scene, he\u2019ll take a swig from his plastic bottle at home to quench his thirst. Indeed, water is a constant in Rei\u2019s life. A duality that, once again, plays to the anime\u2019s strengths through its thematic connections to life and its clear, precise presence.\\n\\n\r\nAll this thematic discussion hasn\u2019t even elaborated on 3-gatsu\u2019s main plot points and story beats.\\n\\n\r\nPart of what grounds the show\u2019s story is how much Rei loses. Despite his prodigy status, his losses up the realism of his current situation while readying him for his eventual climb later. They also put into perspective where he is at in his life and the strength of his numerous opponents.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has its memorable scenes. More specifically, Rei\u2019s breakdown in episode ten explodes out the emotions he has been keeping trapped inside himself. He basically yells at the world for making him think everything is always his fault, and that giving up or giving in is not an option for him or anyone. As Nikaidou would put it, Rei \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to lose\u201d \u2013 in every sense of the phrase.\\n\\n\r\nAnd extra narrative facets keep the story progressing. Foreshadowing with the top shogi player as the beast to beat. A subplot involving Kyouko\u2019s jerkwad \u201cboyfriend.\u201d Rei\u2019s decision to stay away from Akari, Hinata, and Momo\u2019s home for much of the second half of the season is not only seen but felt. The creation of the shogi club at Rei\u2019s school makes for an optimistic finale moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nEven after all this analyzing, 3-gatsu presents even more to its audience. Effective comedy. Interesting dialogue. Purposeful chapter structure. Simply put, as the introductory portion to this story, the anime roars like a ferocious lion preparing for what will unfold.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching 3-gatsu, its actual animation soars during scenes where it overexaggerates the Kawamoto sisters\u2019 actions or forms a fantastical aside. (Shogi remains quite the stationary sport.) But it\u2019s the impressive artistry and the technical finesse that allow this show to reach ever higher heights.\\n\\n\r\nAbove anything else, the anime loves its visual metaphors. From a pair of balloons floating upwards through the sky to gallons of water submerging Rei as he sits on the steps leading to the school rooftop, 3-gatsu constantly creates thoughtful, engaging scenes. They not only bolster the ideas of the show but also provide the audience with yet another thematic layer to think about.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has tons of flair, too. A first-person perspective obfuscated by strands of hair. Shifts in camera angles, like a top-down view of Akari as her cats whirl around her. Multiple styles shifted between seamlessly: rough, quirky, sharp, involved. The sheer amount of techniques employed, the obvious attention to cinematography, and the risks taken with its vast variance turn this slice-of-life drama into both an outstandingly diverse and an artistically worthwhile endeavor.\\n\\n\r\nTo go even further, 3-gatsu also focuses intently on the overall look and feel of the visuals themselves. Color choices reach across the rainbow, sparking lots of contrast between its melancholic mood (blues, greys, blacks) and its sweet serenity (oranges, yellows, pinks). A noticeably soft approach ushers in a calm setting while still carrying its weighty, solemn baggage. And its backgrounds \u2013 from inside the sisters\u2019 home to the imaginative moments \u2013 persist as a constant example of the anime\u2019s artistic integrity.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one cannot ignore the designs of the characters, for they evoke the same sense of wonder that the rest of the visuals deliver. Generally, they\u2019re rather unique in their facial details: lines fill out their eyes, their mouths are slightly thicker than normal, their gazes often exude a gentle aura.\\n\\n\r\nIndividually, Akari\u2019s ponytail draped over her shoulder, her purple-colored eyes, small hairpin, cardigan sweaters, usual apron, and ample assets paint her as the womanly goddess she is. Hinata\u2019s long twin-tailed hair, her smaller physique, girly outfits, and sincere smile captures her energy and kindness. Momo\u2019s short, light-orange hair and wide eyes highlight her cute and childish status that much more.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also Rei with his frazzled black hair, green eyes, glasses, white buttoned-up shirt, and jeans that give him a nerdy, quiet look that fits his character all too well. The girls\u2019 grandpa\u2019s squareness. Smith\u2019s tall, Western vibe. Kyouko\u2019s brown overcoat and devilish beauty. Nikaidou\u2019s rotund shape and Shimada\u2019s lanky frame. The characters\u2019 designs are interesting and attractive and different.\\n\\n\r\nExactly like the rest of 3-gatsu\u2019s artistry.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIn 3-gatsu, the characters exemplify their respective roles: the main protagonist, the supporting cast, and so on. But they represent much more than just what a literary definition could ascribe. In fact, they continue the exploration of the anime\u2019s themes through thoughtful ideas and progression of their own.\\n\\n\r\nAs the star of this tale, Rei Kiriyama doesn\u2019t lead the most eventful of lives. He wakes up each day without anybody around. He puts on his clothes and munches on some convenience-store food before making the long walk and the sad train ride to his local shogi hall. He plays a couple of games in relative silence. Then he goes back home. To a desolate, no-drapes apartment where he practices the sport by himself \u2013 which is arguably one of the loneliest activities imaginable \u2013 in the middle of his wide-open room. Only to fall asleep, wake up, and go through the whole process ad infinitum.\\n\\n\r\nLoneliness characterizes Rei to a depressing degree. From him eating his cold lunch by himself to sitting outside on the cold concrete as the wind howls about him, Rei is often alone. Sometimes of his own choosing, sometimes because it can\u2019t be helped. But this void follows him nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it always has. The true beginning of Rei\u2019s loneliness starts with the tragic death of his parents and his little sister in a freak car accident. Having lost those held most dear to him, he doesn\u2019t know what to do. So, he latches onto shogi \u2013 to keep his thoughts focused and to numb the pain in his heart.\\n\\n\r\nRei describes his relationship with \u201cthe god of shogi\u201d as an \u201cugly lie.\u201d That he only agreed to like the sport so he could survive. Indeed, in lying, Rei\u2019s father\u2019s friend Kouda takes Rei in as a foster child.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the young boy, loneliness just won\u2019t let go. Rei\u2019s presence in his foster family tears them apart. As Kouda favors the prodigy player, his other kids suffer. His son Ayumu regresses into seclusion, and Kyouko succumbs to rebellion and seethes with rage. Rage that she takes out on Rei through physical abuse.\\n\\n\r\nThis form of abuse is new to Rei, but abuse in general is not. For, as a school student, he has often been ignored or neglected by others, enduring mental abuse without really knowing it. Their bullying stops Rei from reaching out to anyone except for the ants on the ground. Even more loneliness for the lonely protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nRei, realizing what he (inadvertently) does to his new family, separates himself from them, choosing the path of a professional shogi player to keep his unluckiness from spreading. Sadly, despite his quick rise in the shogi world, Rei hits a block of sorts. With expectations of his future set high, and people (outwardly or not) questioning his abilities, loneliness further tightens around him.\\n\\n\r\nUp to now, Rei is a \u201cliar.\u201d A \u201chome-wrecker.\u201d A \u201closer.\u201d His situation is practically unfair and wholly unbearable. However, a wholesome, miraculous light in his life keeps him going: the Kawamoto sisters.\\n\\n\r\nAcross a couple of bridges and down a few roads, Akari, Hinata, and Momo accept Rei as one of their own. They brighten the atmosphere with delicious food, energetic actions, and cuteness galore. Through their personalities, nostalgia permeates the air. Warmth radiates outward. Kindness envelops everything.\\n\\n\r\nRei may not word it exactly this way, but, for him, their home is heaven on Earth. It\u2019s one of the only places where he can truly feel at ease. Where his loneliness must wait at the door and his happiness grows to levels he never thought possible.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s all thanks to the girls themselves. Beginning with Akari, she dotes on Rei as much as she can. She saves him from his \u201cfriends\u201d and their \u201cdrinking game.\u201d She leads the charge in curing his cold. She speaks earnestly with him about matters. She directly invites him over or slyly involves him in other ways to get him active.\\n\\n\r\nAkari\u2019s thoughtfulness cannot be understated. She looks after her two little sisters by herself. She works at her grandpa\u2019s shop and her aunt\u2019s lounge. She remains emotionally strong despite the pain they have experienced in their own lives. And that\u2019s not even the half of it. Akari is not only the best supporting character in 3-gatsu but also one of the best in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nHinata doesn\u2019t earn the same accolades, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t without her own incredibly supportive nature. She is genuinely glad to see more sides of Rei\u2019s personality. She thinks about how he\u2019s doing when he\u2019s not around. She overcomes \u201cboundaries\u201d like giving him food in front of and inquiring about Kyouko. Hinata\u2019s heartwarming relationship with Rei proves that she cares deeply about him \u2013 more so than he may realize.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Momo supports in her own way, too. She\u2019s a toddler, so she understandably can\u2019t do much. But, as she views Rei as her older brother and dances excitedly whenever he arrives, she subconsciously gives him a sense of responsibility and self-esteem that nobody can replicate.\\n\\n\r\nAkari, Hinata, and Momo are amazing supporters. So much so, in fact, that they even know when not to support. While the second half of the season contains less of these three than one would prefer, them giving Rei space argues for the fact that, sometimes, it\u2019s best to let a person focus on what he or she needs to so that they, too, can help themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not easy to do, though. Despite the girls caring for him, and despite his determination, Rei still struggles. He experiences agony. Arrogance. Anger. Just as the people in his life influence him, he affects himself through the actions and thoughts he takes. That is, loneliness cannot always be blamed on everyone else. It\u2019s also up to that person to do something about it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Rei does just that. He divulges his feelings to Yuusuke about going back to school and not wanting to run away. He reaffirms why he played shogi in the first place when he remembers the games that had his father really thinking hard. He agrees to forming the joint shogi-science club at his school to earn him a new set of friends.\\n\\n\r\nJust as things start to look a bit brighter, Kyouko injects herself into Rei\u2019s life. Now an adult, Kyouko preys on Rei. She isn\u2019t laughably maniacal or in possession of some mega power. Instead, she simply uses her words. To spite, to hurt, and to poison her foster brother.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko\u2019s manipulation, her uncomfortably forward physicality makes their relationship an abusive yet striking one. She loves him to death and despises his guts. She hates her father, she fell for a man one too many years her senior, and she is beyond selfish. As Momo would put it, she\u2019s a \u201cwitch\u201d \u2013 but also somebody in desperate need of support. Altogether, her complicated thoughts and her complex feelings turn her into one of the best \u201cvillains\u201d to grace the medium in a long while.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Rei, despite her abuse and their unique relationship, he wants to help his foster sister. And it\u2019s this reversal of roles, where he can be there for someone who is lonely, that ultimately gets at 3-gatsu\u2019s most important theme.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, Akari, Hinata, and Momo support Rei however they can. But they aren\u2019t the only ones who do so. Nikaidou is Rei\u2019s rival, motivator, and friend. Takashi may not always have tact, but he sincerely guides Rei as both a teacher and as an adult. His foster father calls him on his cell phone multiple times when he isn\u2019t responding. Shimada mentors Rei in the art of shogi, shows him what it means to persevere, teaches him what matters most when all is said and done, and gives him the chance to finally be relied on.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, there is always someone nearby who cares. Rei has lost. He has been bullied. He has been hurt. But he has never truly been alone. For, all around him, from the Kawamoto sisters to the man who \u201ccracked open his skull,\u201d people in Rei\u2019s life love him in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nThis sentiment applies to the audience, making it the biggest takeaway from this first season. Life can be cruel, mean, and unfair. Yet, despite the problems people face and the seemingly insurmountable terrors they confront, there\u2019s always someone nearby who cares.\\n\\n\r\nSure, it may not be people as perfect as Akari, Hinata, and Momo. But maybe it\u2019s a close parent or a significant other or a friend that hasn\u2019t been spoken to in years. No matter the case, someone is out there. Right now. Ready and willing to replace that loneliness with support of their own.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nJust as 3-gatsu\u2019s story, art, and characters demonstrate their power, the music and the sound that surrounds the entire experience does the same.\\n\\n\r\nIts opening tracks, \u201cAnswer\u201d and \u201cSayonara Bystander,\u201d fill the air with optimistic tones, rhyming lyricism, strong vocal work, catchy instrumentation, and various emotions. They create a set of powerful songs which capture the anime\u2019s drive to tell a tale that\u2019s both thoughtful and real. Their ability to not only kick off each episode with the right mood in mind but also invoke a sense of longing in the audience stands as a testament to their overwhelming strength.\\n\\n\r\nIts ending tracks have a similar level of strength but go down different routes. The first ED, \u201cFighter,\u201d embodies its title with a determined beat, sincere singing, and an empowering background choir. In comparison, the second ED, \u201corion,\u201d incorporates hip-hop, distinct snapping, and smooth harmonizing to uplift the audience with grounded delivery. Together, they represent the show\u2019s grander sense of hope and perseverance against the odds and the adversity that life so regularly throws into the mix.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing with the spirit of the show, 3-gatsu\u2019s original soundtrack implements music that strikes at the heart of its own ideals. In one track, crystal rings loudly to chill the air and to hallow out the atmosphere. In another track, zippy xylophone playing and a pronounced tuba reflect the infectious happiness of the Kawamoto sisters. In other tracks, piano moves effortlessly from soft and melancholic to fun and free as the mood shifts accordingly. Combined with acoustic guitars, marching drums, grating sounds, and a whole host of other instrumental work, the OST dares anyone to denounce its craftsmanship.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting performances likewise stand tall. Ai Kayano as Akari uses a mature and loving voice that brings calm and comfort in droves. Kana Hanazawa as Hinata ups the silliness levels with her boisterous tone. Misaki Kuno\u2019s cheerful way of speaking directly equates to the toddler\u2019s cute behavior. Kengo Kawanishi as Rei narrates his loneliness well while also ranging in his emotions throughout the season. And Nobuhiko Okamoto as Nikaidou yells and motivates with care and without end.\\n\\n\r\nTwo special side-shout-outs go to Ms. Kayano, Ms. Hanazawa, and Ms. Kuno. First for voicing the cats. 3-gatsuverbalizing the cats\u2019 inner thoughts was unexpected and hilarious, the three leading women making it so. Second, and speaking of cats, the anime\u2019s special ending track \u201cNyaa Shougi Ondo\u201d also deserves props. It was cool to see the creators go out of their way to (some extent) teach the sport of shogi to the audience. Even more impressive was making it into a song, using a cat motif, and having the women once again contribute with singing of their own (and few \u201cnyaa\u201d lyrics).\\n\\n\r\nNone of these musical pieces and performances mention the show\u2019s attention to other sound-effects. The clack of a placed shogi piece. A growing-ever-louder grandfather clock. The plunging of water. The anime goes everywhere with its metaphors, comedy, and emotions, and the included sound-effects always keep up, rounding out this aural experience in fantastic fashion.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIn my introduction, I wrote about my chess-dweeb era. It\u2019s something that I will cherish forever. Practicing with my dad on the couch while we watched television together. Defeating my fifth-grade teacher for the first time. Laughing with my friends about the dumb moves we made. I rarely, if ever, pick up a pawn nowadays, but chess will always be a part of me no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nChess and shogi aren\u2019t technically the same, but the show got me thinking about these precious memories of mine. Yet my connection to this anime goes deeper.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t lost my family. I\u2019ve never been abused or bullied either. Meaning, I cannot claim that my situation in life has been anything like Rei\u2019s. But I can empathize with his emotions \u2013 because I\u2019ve been there. I know what it feels like to be put on a pedestal only to let everyone down. To succumb to loneliness. To not seek guidance out of misplaced fear and shame when those around me clearly want to help.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m saving the details of my own life-altering story for a more momentous moment. Suffice it to say, though, I connect with this show beyond just the sport it depicts. And it makes me so gosh darn happy to see how, wrapped around my personal connection to this tale, the anime does almost everything right that it possibly could.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy makes me laugh a ton. Akari tapping her hands on the table back at Hinata. Hinata magically and hurriedly floating through the air and out the door. Momo asking Rei if he\u2019s her older brother or not. If it isn\u2019t already apparent, I adore the Kawamoto sisters.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama sucks me in. Kyouko\u2019s manipulation. Takashi\u2019s wise words. Rei\u2019s troubled life. I became so interested in what was going on that I took half a day off from work just so that I could finish the remainder of the season because I couldn\u2019t put it down.\\n\\n\r\nThe content itself means a lot to me. Purposeful themes treated with respect. All the creativity behind its visual direction. The strong writing throughout. Altogether, it\u2019s an anime that appeals to my critiquing mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, while I\u2019ve already slightly talked about her already, let it be known: I have the biggest crush on Akari. Beautiful. Motherly. Kind. Thoughtful. Sincere. Attractive. Mature. Strong. She\u2019s nothing short of angelic, and she has become one of my favorite characters of all-time without any shred of doubt.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this crush extends to the entire project here, for I love this anime. It\u2019s the kind of show that only comes around once in a while. An anime that represents what this medium is and demonstrates what it can do. And I\u2019m grateful to have had the opportunity to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, there\u2019s not much else I can write down. Which means there\u2019s really only one thing left: give it the highest honors possible.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion proves its outstanding worth in this medium through extreme execution. A thematically heavy story. Wonderful artistry. A host of awesome characters. Superb sound choices. A wealth of entertaining moments. Like any king, it has everything and then some.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s only the opening.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, as a thematically rich start to this journey, the tale explores life\u2019s duality of happiness and sadness through shogi, nuanced narrative elements, and purposeful plot points while delivering a meaningful and expressive slice-of-life drama\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, visual metaphors, impressive variance in artistry, and lovely character designs both engage the audience and bolster the themes therein\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Rei\u2019s unfortunate abuse and struggles expound on the concept of loneliness, the Kawamoto sisters define supporting characters, smart writing crafts Kyouko into a stellar \u201cantagonist,\u201d and a heartfelt theme on there always being someone nearby who cares solidifies the cast\u2019s incredible strength\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, a set of powerful OPs and EDs, an emotional OST, strong VA performances, and extra additions elevate the experience even further\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, personally relatable, downright entertaining, and Akari is beyond angelic\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 10/10",

            "content": "Once upon a time, I fell in love with a show named Honey and Clover. Because of that love, I decided to check out other works by the author behind it (Umino Chica). This led me to discover 3gatsu no Lion. A story about shogi didn\u2019t seem really appealing, but I dove right into it nevertheless. Then bam, the feels train struck again and I loved it. I said to myself \u201cI wonder if this will get an anime adaptation just like the author\u2019s previous work.\u201d I waited patiently for a long time with the hope of the manga being turned into an animated masterpiece.And it did happen, I felt really happy about it. However, the adaptation managed to surprise me in so many ways despite having an initial idea what to expect from it, especially since Shaft was going to be the studio to adapt it. It was not the animated masterpiece I expected it to be, but still one of the best shows to have come out in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\n3gatsu no Lion offers a unique approach when it comes to blending elements from both slice-of-life and sports. First of all, shogi is presented as a professional thing. Most stories that revolve around sports are usually in school setting where they compete with other schools. In the world of 3gatsu, overhyped high school boys are replaced with composed adults. Arenas and courts packed with people are replaced with tatami rooms with only the limited presence of observers. There are actual stakes involved, since defeat can mean a threat to their career, their source of income. Simply attempting to be successful in shogi because you have the passion is not enough. The story makes that known as there are no plot devices or any other bullshit that can turn the tide during the match. A self-proclaimed shogi genius because he beats every person in his town can be just another hopeless brat when thrown into a pit of professionals. There are no shortcuts, convenience is subjective. Each move made on the shogi board is carefully planned and calculated like their life depends on it. A feeling of heaviness in every touch of a shogi piece, like a sense of burden channeled through every part of the player\u2019s body. Enduring and outsmarting the enemy is the key, as a single match can consume up an entire day. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the sense of competition prevails throughout the show, it is not always associated with intensity. The narrative is easy-going and introspective. The consistent monologues often remind me of Honey and Clover, very reflective and poignant. It conveys well what goes inside a character\u2019s mind: doubts, anxieties, hope, resolve, basically almost the entire spectrum of human emotions. The atmosphere emulated by the show can go from heartwarming funny moments amplified by Shaft\u2019s eccentric execution to serious dread especially during official matches. Outside shogi matches, the story focuses on the daily lives of the shogi players. We get a glimpse of their situation and then come to understand how and why they ended up choosing shogi as a profession. Take shogi away and everything will change. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now we get to the main character, Kiriyama Rei. He is seen as the next big storm in the world of shogi as past trends report that every professional who debut in middle-school always become the next master. In reality, he struggles like your average shogi player. His name is well-known, but he still has a long way to go by climbing up the ranks. What makes him interesting as a character is because of his troubled past that always try to come back at him when he tries to move forward. Even though he doesn\u2019t want to gain sympathy from others, his frail persona always gets him unexpected help. He acts timid and indecisive at times but can also act the opposite when push comes to shove. His character development is subtle throughout the story, further reinforced with his reflective internal monologues.  Sure, other shows have main characters like Rei but what they usually miss is having a well-grounded character background that makes us understand why that character acts that way. By that, I don\u2019t mean having a tragic past and then go on a full pity show on others when you feel being cornered and act unreasonable. Rei is quite different, he can act like your typical teenager that is undergoing an angst phase but he tries to be mature which is the result of him always being surrounded by adults. Even though he miserably fails at some occasions, it is the story\u2019s attempt to show that he is still a kid and can act na\u00efve. He has limited interaction to kids his age because he immerses himself with shogi, thus always being seen as a weirdo. There is always an underlying explanation to aspects of his character. Its fine saying you don\u2019t like him for who he is but at least you have to recognize that the show perfectly justifies it. It could be borderline victimization but there is an attempt to break out the victim role.\\n\\n\r\nThe presence of the Kawamoto household is possibly the best representation of the show\u2019s slice-of-life element. I feel like if they are omitted from the story, it wouldn\u2019t be the same. Sure, sometimes they get too much screen time which mostly consists of them drooling over sweets but I see it as like an ice-breaker from the overwhelming seriousness of the show most of the time. They also serve as a bridge for Rei to act just like an ordinary human once in a while. He can get hungry just like any other person. He can also display concern and worry over trivial things. He can feel like being part of a family, in which he copes up with his feelings about his experience with his foster family. There are also other people who help with respect to Rei's development as a character like his teacher Hayashida who assists him in his life as a student, despite having the option not to go to school and focus only in shogi. Even fellow shogi players like Nikaidou is relevant to his development as the sense of rivalry makes him evaluate his self-worth. This part of the show is just in equal footing with shogi in terms of relevance to the development of the story and its characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor my final thoughts on this show adaptation-wise, I think Shaft did a great job with it. Like I said in my introduction, it wasn\u2019t the animated masterpiece I expected it to be. It took a while for me to really vibe with what Shaft is trying to do with it, but it really manages to capture the essence of the show. I always envisioned the 3gatsu adaptation as really bleak, with hints of heartwarming moments, but Shaft managed to adapt it into something colorful and artistic. How it executes various scenes that incorporate symbolism with Rei\u2019s almost lifeless narration is beautiful. I can\u2019t forget in the first episode in which Rei did a shogi match with his foster father. The brilliance of how Rei\u2019s past is flashed every time a shogi piece moves was so emotional for me. If there is one major criticism I have with the show though, it would be how it transitions serious scenes with downright slapstick chibi comedy. It\u2019s kind of off-putting at times, but it\u2019s not bothersome enough to ruin the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, even without my slight bias for it as a fan of the manga, it is still a show worth checking out especially if you love slice-of-life. I could\u2019ve given it a higher score, but it\u2019s not yet there in terms of development. I\u2019m glad this is going to get another season and hope more people discover this gem I\u2019ve cherished for a long time.\\n",

            "content": "SHAFT previously installed a pretentious series that suffers from a massive diagnosis of what I like to call dialogue schizophrenia, making a guy with ahoge hair look cool while he continually sexually assaulting lolis; it reigned in unlimited amounts of money, yatta yatta (muting the preface point with that because this studio is the bane of my existence).\r\n\t\u2022 Still riding on the Bakemonogatari cash cow, I'm sure that they realized that adapting one of Chika Umeno's works (the mangka behind Honey & Clover), along with adding the overzealous, overly angular, dialogue heavy monologuing with a sexually ambiguous, teenage misfit boy that this would be aself-defining hit among narcissistic, Tumblr fags. I'm 100% sure that they weren't blind to their potential viewers.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I mean, they surely didn't know that the internet would fill Reddit forums with social justice powered, too deep for you conversations and people would GIFing the overly artsy and talkative moments, right? Let me clarify this for those you who didn't know, just because something is pretentious and artsy DOES NOT mean that it has any substance! The package is often different than the contents. Just imagine if A-1 had directed this instead of SHAFT.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I thought it was high-budget trash, quite frankly. If you want to see tons of money put into in-your-face conveyances of depression while watching a rather privileged orphan whine to himself in exagerrated monologues while he\u2019s allegorically drowning, than this is the series for you! This show is the primary example of what we you would call \"victim culture,\" which I absolutely hate about modern day society. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I say privileged, because the unrealistic degree of how nice people are to him is uncanny. I understand people being nice to someone because their mother, father, and little sister died. And somehow, to make it more dramatic, they show Rei, the main character, looking at their corpses in the morgue? Who let's a child look at their family's bodies like that?\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb But, back to my point about the weird way every single character bends over backwards to make Rei happy, no seriously. EVERY time Rei is depressed: his teacher, a family that takes him in like their own, and a rich kid that he beat in shogi either talk about how great he is, or give him back pats.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I've seen this before, I mean MC privilege is a dilemma prevalent in anime. It frustrated me, because it was like a self-insert fan-fiction or like Tommy Wiseau from The Room with side characters that I like to call \u201ctwo-dimensional-encouragement-puppets.\u201d But it frustrated me more, on top of everything, that main character still angsts dramatically with internal monologues. Many people on the interwebs even find this little shit \"relatable\" or \"likable\". One of his angsts were that his adoptive father loved him more than his two ACTUAL kids (***MC privilege***), so his step-sister was violent and made, what seems like consensual, sexual advances at him.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I know that realistic teenagers like to wallow in their own sadness, and feel alone and alienated, but is this something that should praised? No. This is why teenagers are often made fun of. The main character is such a genius at shogi that it is stated in the show that he makes more than his HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. What does he have to complain about? \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb He has:\\n\r\n\u2022  A professional shogi career.\\n\r\n\u2022 Unanimous accolades from everyone, except his bipolar step-sister.\\n\r\n\u2022 A family who unconditionally loves him and takes care of him, even though he's not related to them by blood.\\n\r\n\u2022  Friends and a school teacher that go out of their way to cheer him up.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb As someone who was adopted, I would have killed to have my life laid out so cleanly in front of me. Where are these all of these allusions to suicide and self-hate even coming from? People complained about the melodrama in Your Lie in April, but at least there was a character that was dying from a disease, that, you know, had a reason to angst or freak out. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb The banality of this series is astounding, Rei loses a shogi match and doesn't eat for days and more allegorical drowning. I get that he's a child genius, bordering on Asperger's, perhaps? Who knows? The series doesn't really clarify what the hell is wrong with him. It got better toward the end of the series, because it focuses on other characters like Kai Shimada (he has Kaiki Deishuu's voice actor) that made it bearable. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb This anime could be categorized along with the Monogatari with how absurd it is. I mean, there's angst then talking cats, depression metaphor then cute girls making food and talking about cute stuff. SHAFT treats you like you're some kind of intellectual when they go into the 3deep5me fucking dialogues\u30fcthat the main character has with himself. He's like one of those goths that writes poetry by candlelight.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb Overall, the visuals are pretty and music can be enjoyable at times, except when they insert precocious French music in episodes for no real reason. This series is what it would look like if a hack art student had gallons of money to dump into a project like SHAFT, who not-so-secretly embodies the spirit of an avant-garde student that lives in Calabasas, CA.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I give it a 2/10, though barely that. I nearly dropped this garbage because of how silly and immature it was. I felt like putting my head into a cheese grinder after every episode. You would need a bidet and a degree in licking assholes to enjoy this show.",

            "content": "Overall rating [9.2]\r\nStory [9.1] \r\nThis show starts extremely slow. It looks like it is going to go nowhere and the description saying that this show is about shogi doesn't help it one bit. But then comes the actual story which is great. It blends the shogi with the drama in a way that doesn't seem forced and fits into the story. It honestly made me think about the characters as persons but we will get to that later.\r\nArt and Animation [8.8]\r\nThe art of the source material got adapted great into animation. It leads into an almost perfect mix if not being for some hiccups inthe quality in some later episodes. The art is great but the problem is that still shots get used too often. Don\u00b4t get me wrong still shots can greatly improve some scenes but it just gets used too much to the point that at later episodes it gets you out of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8.5]\\n\r\nBoth of the openings are incredible. BUMP CHICKEN and YUKI did a great job with their respective songs \"Answer\" and \"Sayonara Bystander.\" Personally, I prefer \"Sayonara Bystander\" as a song but the animation doesn\u00b4t mix properly. \"Answer\" while not having the same emotional impact as \"Sayonara Bystander\" it is still a great freaking song that gets you hyped and the animation fully supports it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9.7]\\n\r\nThese are some of the greatest supporting characters of the last year. The sisters are incredible by making the story much easier to handle while not falling into a forgettable category. My favorite character goes to the middle sister Hinata since I actually see her as a fully developed character with motivations and dreams. The best part about the sisters is that their lives do not revolve around the main character which is a problem most animes suffer from. The problem with the cast is the main character and his family. They never seemed like actual people and especially the sister seemed too cruel and psychotic to be taken seriously. I honestly cannot see myself encountering any of these people anywhere in the world and that is the part that doesn't sell me completely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9.0]\\n\r\nThis is a great series that hooked me up from start to finish the problem is some of the passing. The beginning was a bit slow and some of the later halves of the show took away some of the enjoyment since they took me out of the experience. Aside from that, I think that the series was a great adaptation of the source material having read it myself. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nI would recommend this series to anyone that is ready to experience something more than your usual circle of things you want to watch. This is a perfect passageway to people who want to expand their horizons and see the beauty in life. This is why my overall rating is a 9.2.\\n\\n\r\nHope you found this review useful\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so I would appreciate if you could gic\u00a1ve me any feedback regarding my writing style and things that I could improve on.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Talking about Chika Umino's work is hard because her writing is something that always hits me very strongly. The way she describes mental illness, anxiety and youth problems is something absolutely touching and sometimes agonizing because, at least for me, is really relatable. Honey & Clover is my all time favorite manga, but this time, 3-gatsu animation is somehow a different kind of Chika's work. Relief happens less often and the excruciating feeling of drowning in negative feelings is more constant. Episode six was hard to watch non-stop. Maybe because now it's a story mainly about sadness, loneliness and depression. And that is actually somethingimpressive. Even though I don't really understand nor think about Shogi as an interesting sport/game.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) is my favorite part, just like in H&C. Her style is so cute <3 I love the details of the eyes, the cute animals, and now, the TALKING animals! Oh gosh, so much cuteness for my heart to handle.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) is simple, yet quite pretty. I barely noticed the background soundtrack - and I always do it strictly! Guess the story steals all the atenttion from it. Also, the dubbing is awesome! The voices of the characters fit perfectly, especially the female voices - that are also very cute.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu is about Rei's pain, most of the time, and this end up building our point of view about the rest of the story and the other characters (9/10) in a very strict way - probably because all the narration of the history until now was made by the protagonist only. But all of the characters are unique in their own way and full of characteristics that hold our affection with the passage of time. And these characteristics are so real that it's hard not to feel close to them somehow.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10) is amazing and yet kinda hard to go along with. The pace is purposely slow - and that makes it sometimes really deep and tense. Still, that is a perfect way to demonstrate how depression works, it's a perfect way to show to the viewers how hard is to feel anguished like that, how difficult it is to have a mind so full of thoughts and fears like this. I was positively surprised by this story that deals so well on the subject of psychological illnesses in a such intense and emotional way. After being so disappointed with various Japanese anime/manga that treat mental illnesses as banal or irrelevant things, watching 3-gatsu was somehow inspiring. I saw myself in various problems that Rei had, I could feel in my skin how scary some moments he spent were. And a show that creates empathy towards this issue is fantastic and without a doubt deserves all the credits. \\n\\n\r\nProbably not everyone will like or even truly understand it, but I think it was worth the time for all those who have been teenagers without friends at school, and didn't know how to express their feelings or had family problems/losses. \\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu is a story about trusting others, discovering your own strength and weaknesses, about letting it go and moving on.\\n\\n\r\nI'm very glad I'm having the chance to follow this series and I can bet some will like it as much as I do. And I really hoping for an emotional and very happy ending full of tears, just like Chika did in Honey & Clover.",

The story is gripping because of the gravity and emotions of the thoughts and feelings behind it, while also coupled with unexpected hilarious scenes that lighten it up enough to not feel overbearing. \r\nYou should not expect something action filled or a driving narrative from this anime, because that is not what it's trying to be. Instead, it focusses on the inner thought processes of various characters, though mostly Rei. It's very slow paced and can seem depressing at times, but luckily, just at the moments when things seem to gettoo heavy, there will be a funny moment to relieve the viewer of the tension.\\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review might contain spoilers on the anime \"Sangatsu no Lion\". Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nSangatsu no Lion, a jewel that did not make much noise\r\nWith the pace of current anime production it is impossible to see all the series. For that reason, some series only have a modest success, while others take all the fame. It is the case of Sangatsu no Lion, a jewel that went a little unnoticed.\r\nI must confess that when it premiered, I saw the first episodes and then I leftit there, parked. It was released in the fall of 2016 with Yuri !!! on Ice, Drifters, the third season of Haikyuu !!, Keijo !!!!, Bungou Stray Dogs season two, Occultic, Nine, Ajin 2nd season, Hibike! Euphonium season two, Shuumatsu no Izetta and Trickster, among others.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nHowever, of that group, Sangatsu no Lion is the least obvious at first sight. It was one of two series produced by Shaft that season, best known for Monogatari Series, Madoka and Nisekoi, so I already had the credentials to take a look.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the manga of Umino Chika had been awarded with the Cultural Prize Osamu Tezuka in 2014, a more than respectable endorsement. But what attraction can a melancholic anime have on a boy who plays Shogi?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Sangatsu no Lion?\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is the story of Rei Kirishima, a professional shogi player - Japanese chess - who is only 17 years old. Orphan from very small, after the death in an accident of his parents and younger sister, ended up under the care of the best friend and rival in the shogi of his father. But although his new adoptive father treated him with affection and respect, he could not help but feel the loneliness after losing his family. Especially when in his new home he lived with the two biological children of the house, who resented him for receiving the attention of his father, being a talented player.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a real family, or friends, his attitude towards life is negative and frankly depressing. So much so that he is unable to see that in fact if he has friends, even if they are few. This begins to change when he meets the sisters Kawamoto, Akari, Hinata and Momo, who give some family warmth to their cold existence. In the course of the 22 episodes we meet her adoptive sister, the troubled Kyouko Koda. The girl serves as the \"villain\" of the story, but despite that has a link with Rei, although it is a very twisted.\\n\\n\r\nThey also introduce us to their rival / best friend, Harunobu Nikaid\u014d, a young chubby and precarious health that, unlike our protagonist, has a passionate and positive attitude. The other great support of Kirishima is his teacher Takashi Hayashida, the only one in his school who knows that he is a professional shogi player. In addition, as the series progresses, Kai Shimada is introduced, a talented player who has not been able to reach the top due to the existence of Touji Souya. This one seems a reflection of Kirishima, but not much is known about him yet. Except that it generates admiration in Rei and that he is a genius of shogi.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime of contrasts\\n\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is definitely an anime series full of contrasts, between light and dark, with Rei Kiriyama in the middle, trying to get his place in life. The shogi is his lifeline and he clings to it with force, but that makes him lose his perspective. His way of seeing the same game that has guaranteed his survival in more than one way, isolates the world. But that is something that only happens in his mind, that is blinded and does not realize that he is not alone, neither in the Shogi nor in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told slowly, almost parsimoniously. When Rei is alone, the feeling of isolation and loneliness is palpable. It is clear that depression overwhelms him. But the Kawamoto sisters are his oasis, they are, as he very well puts it later in history, his kotatsu. When Akari, Hinata and Momo are on screen, everything is energy, color, happiness. Life is vibrant, sweet and warm.\\n\\n\r\nEven art mutates to fit the light and shadows in Rei's life. The music, full of beautiful notes, evokes nostalgia. If any weakness has this series, is that its pace is not suitable for everyone. It is not the kind of anime that we see to entertain us, it is one of those that make us reflect, look inside. Depression is a problem and this story of daily life has nothing new to say about it. Its purpose is another, it is to show us the joy of living even in the midst of a seemingly miserable life. It is to show us the evolution of a character that is maturing both in the Shogi and in life.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the rhythm is slow and the tortuous exposition of Rei's life becomes too reiterative, which is a bit less.\\n\\n\r\nAnother conflictive issue is how the series concludes. His final is open, just at the beginning of a new semester at Rei High School and a new season of Shogi. In the middle we are presented with a flashback of Rei's childhood, which serves to contrast between the child he was and the man in which he begins to develop. It lets us see that the Shogi already knows not the ticket to save his life, but to live it. As a conclusion it is perhaps unsatisfactory, but fortunately it already has a new season airing until this day of January, 2018. So we can continue to see how the story unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, the end of Sangatsu no Lion subtracts one more point from this anime. However, I can not stop recommending it, because it is a jewel. And I look forward to write about the continuation.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion presents the evils of depression and isolation in a way full of art. An art that mutates in light when its protagonist feels closely the love of three orphan sisters, like him. Its excessively contemplative rhythm and its open ending detract from this excellent anime.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n",

It's pretty darn good visuals, and its detailed, giving the main character, Rei, a generally grim face most the time, most befitting his character.\r\nTransitions from scenes are good, and I'm finding myself like the art style more and more each episode. Also the OP is pretty good and the ED\r\nSound: Well, the sound is pretty good. The OP is good, and the ED is good.The music hasn't really stuck out to me much. The sound effects are pretty good.

Each has their own uniqueness to them, making me crave even more next week.\\n\\n\r\nStory: It's brilliant! Each character deals with their trials differently, and it is very entertaining to see how they deal with it. Furthermore it is extremely interesting to see Rei become closer to the three sisters as the story progresses! The story is equally balanced among all the characters, with of course Rei being the main.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm enjoying each episode each week. I genuinely am hoping for specific things to happen, and it is fun to see it all play out!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you try March Comes In Like A Lion out for yourself, and form your own opinion.",

            "content": "March comes like a Lion has an interesting history.  Despite being a Shaft show and having garnered relatively high praise for having an amazing opening episode that paved the way the story would play out, it didn't seem like anyone was really watching the show while everyone turned their heads towards different things.  It really was a shame that this show never got the attention that it deserved, because it truly is an amazing watch.\r\nStory: We start with Kiriyama Rei, a professional shogi player who barely attends high school, make his way to the shogi hall to play his routine matches.  Quietly,he sits as he plays a game until his opponent admits defeat and leaves without saying a word.  He makes his way to the three sisters that live in a house on the other side of the river and utters the first of his lines in the series.\\n\\n\r\nA dense, twenty-two episode journey, 3-gatsu's story is wrapped around Rei and his journey to break out of the shell that he has spent around eleven years in and open himself to the world around him. Utilizing Shaft's (or particularly Shinbou's) style of visual storytelling, each episode is filled to the brim with each of our characters' stories and gives us insight to the personal struggles they live with, or the trials that they've overcome through the use of visual metaphors and internal narrative in order to convey the feelings and emotions that are pasted on-screen.  While I personally don't find the style of Akiyuki Shinbou to fit a lot of things, 3-gatsu is one of those exceptions where I find his style to work VERY well and would work pretty poorly without it.  \\n\\n\r\nAt its core, 3-gatsu is a character-based show that spends the lion's share of its runtime with character development and interaction.  It has this slow but consistent build-up from the start of episode one to the last episode that builds up how its characters change over time, culminating into a something that can only be described as beautiful.  But every rose has its thorns.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show is very dense with content and really wants to give us the story of everyone they introduce, but given the time constraints and just how dense the story feels, many if not all of the stories feel incomplete.  Not only that, but the story feels like its running off of the tracks in the latter half of the series by shifting to a completely new character and having Rei take a backseat in the background.  While the quality of the series during this period was still consistent, I couldn't help but feel a little cheated due to the fact that the series at this time wasn't about Rei, and I feel like this period of time created a gap between his story and the audience that almost makes him feel less important despite being the main character.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but the show has comedic moments that hurt the series sometimes.  While the comedy that the show exhibits does coincide with the situation that they're placed in, a lot of it clashes with the seriousness of the situation before it, thus creating this VERY jarring shift in tone that I personally wasn't a big fan of seeing.  It kind of erased the seriousness of the situation and I wished they could've handled it better so that every profound statement that Rei was saying wasn't followed up by some crazy shenanigan from the crazy cast of characters that were following behind him.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, the show managed to pull off a fitting ending to the series that backtracks and shows the emotional journey that the audience went on while seeing Rei grow out of his shell and ride into the light away from the darkness that he secluded himself in.  The ending provides a look into the fruits of his labor and is honestly one of the most satisfying endings I've seen in a while.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great pacing with a dense, investable story\\n\r\n+ Lots and lots of character development \\n\r\n+ Satisfying, cumulative ending\\n\r\n-  Comedic timing hurt more than help\\n\r\n-  Second half makes the show fall off a bit\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Characters act as the most important aspect of a slice of life drama, as without them, the story has no way to push itself forward, and if done poorly, will give the audience no reason to bother rooting for the characters since they'll have no attachment to them.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, Kiriyama Rei, our main protagonist.  A professional shogi player in high school with a relatively high ranking, Rei first comes off as an introverted recluse who doesn't seem to want to associate with anyone.  As the series unfolds, the story behind those glasses comes forth and we get to see more of what lies beyond that unhappy and silent exterior.  A good portion of the series is split between Rei's development in the present time as he becomes accustomed to the people that have forced themselves into his life and backstory where we learn more about how the young man known as Kiriyama Rei came into being.  Both aspects help make Rei's story feel real and impactful and turn him into a character that feels very much like a real person.  While we do see a lot of the former, the latter leaves a lot to be desired.  I feel like the backstory of Rei in certain aspects could've been handled better.  The story on how he met the three sisters didn't feel like it had that much detail, and his relationship with someone who beat him up in the past feels like it could've used some attention.  I feel like these are both story aspects that could've been looked upon, but weren't used simply because they ran out of time, which is a real shame.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the three sisters of Akari, Hinata, and Momo.  The three sisters had a lot of potential at the start of the series as they helped crack Rei's shell at the beginning of the series, and seemed to have their own story to tell as a sort of sub-journey that we could go on.  But sadly, this never came to fruition.  As the series goes on, the three sisters are used less and less, and by the time the second half shows up, they're barely in the series anymore and replaced with other characters.  I say this because the series synopsis heavily advertises the three sisters, yet they don't feel as important as they're let on to be.  Which again, is a real shame because they seemed like they had the potential to give us an interesting story to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI also want to bring attention to Shimada Kai, the character who I would argue is the protagonist of the series in the second half of the series.  Kai takes the spotlight due to the shift in story arc that the series has in the second half, thus bringing his own story and struggles into the grand scheme of things.  His development plays a lot like Rei's, where we're given the struggles he has both in the present day and when he was younger through backstory in internal narrative.  His story is a lot shorter than Rei's, but feels a lot more complete.  My only complaint with Kai is the fact that to accommodate his story, Rei had to be shelved off to the side that I occasionally forgot at times that this show was supposed to be about Rei because of how hard and drastic of a shift it was.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond them, the cast is filled with varying characters with varying degrees of importance.  A few have their own stories to tell, with some feeling more complete like Nikaidou's, while others feel lacking and I really feel like could use more detail like Kyouko and Gotou's.  Mostly I complain about these holes in their story because I feel like the time constraint with such a dense story forced the cutting of some of its parts, making it feel incomplete.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Rei's development\\n\r\n+ General character development for the majority of the cast\\n\r\n-  Backstories felt incomplete\\n\r\n-  The three sisters feel very underwhelming/underused\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Produced by Shaft, 3-gatsu comes out of the gate with a handdrawn artstyle with rough linework and muted colors similar to that of another show the company has made, Madoka Magica.  As such, the show's art lends itself to be a flexible style that lets it effortlessly flow into serious scenes or comedic scenes without any sort of shift in its art.  \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the visual storytelling that 3-gatsu showcases creates stunningly animated metaphors that, alongside the easy flexibility that the art has, adds to the visual experience that 3-gatsu executes.  And since this is a Shinbou show, yes, there are headtilts, yes there are closeups, and yes there are the general shinbouisms that persist throughout the series.  (Wouldn't be a Shaft show otherwise)  Despite that fact, they don't actually use them that much throughout the series, so if you're not a fan of them like me, then goo news, there's not much of that to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique, flexible artsyle\\n\r\n+ Stunning visual metaphors\\n\r\n+ Not too many shinbouisms  (And yes, I consider this a good thing)\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The show has two OP and ED tracks as per usual for a show spanning 2 cours.  The first half has the tracks \"Answer\" and \"Fighter\", both by Bump of Chicken, while the second half has \"Sayonara Bystander\" by Yuki and \"Orion\" by Kenshi Yonezu where the tracks by Bump of Chicken and Yuki are done in emotional rock while the last ed is done in emotional piano with some synthesization.  \\n\\n\r\nAll four of these tracks reflect Rei's struggle with clawing his way forward out of the hole he put himself in, and with the visuals that they're complimented with, that metaphor becomes all the more clear.  That being said, I find the tracks by Bump of Chicken to be the most memorable if not the only tracks worth remembering.  I say that mostly because the tracks in the second half don't stick out to me all that much, and the style of music that Bump of Chicken just fits the series so well that the two feel intertwined and inseparable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good tracks\\n\r\n-  Only about half of them are memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  3-gatsu was a series that I was determined to watch when I first read about it.  Despite my rather unfavorable history with Shaft and how much I dislike Shinbou's style of storytelling, I was determined to watch it no matter how many shinbouisms were thrown at me because I truly believed it was gonna be something special even when I found out that not that many people really watched.  And honestly, while it may not rank high score-wise, this is a series that speaks to me personally, and I'm really glad that I decided to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nI've already praised how much I like Bump of Chicken's work on the series's tracks and how well the character development was weaved into the series despite its flaws, so I want to get into specifics here.  I think hands down my favorite moment of 3-gatsu was the ending scene of episode 10.  The amount of raw emotion and power behind that scene in that point of the series was a huge catalyst for how everything else played out after that and it was honestly bone-chilling hearing those words, sticking out as one of my favorite scenes of anime to date.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf I may be honest...I don't like Nikaidou.  Obvious characters you're supposed to not feel sorry for aside, NIkaidou is that one character I found to be kinda irritating despite how big of a role he played in the series.  There's something about that cheerful arrogance that irritated me and I wanted to poke him with a needle so he'd deflate like a balloon.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  If you haven't watched this series, I would highly recommend putting this on the watchlist because this is one of the better series of the 2016 year.  It saddens me that this show wasn't on a majority of people's radars, and as someone who saw through the whole thing and shares his opinion with of many of those who watched the series, 3-gatsu is a powerful, emotional journey that should be experienced, especially if you suffer from depression.  Trust me, as someone who's suffered the same shit, this was a very positive and heartwarming experience to have.",

            "content": "The first word that comes to my mind when I try to describe this show is 'beautiful'. It is that simple and yet not simple at all. I start the show and the beautiful french song wins me over. When I finished 3 episodes I saw all the potential for this to eventually become one of my favourites. Although the route the show took was not what I was expecting, I am glad the feelings I was expecting were met.\r\nFor starters, the show deals with our protagonist Rei and his journey to find the happiness he has been looking for. Like everybody who has beenthrough their teens, Rei asks himself a lot of questions we all can relate to. It's not something that no one has thought of before but what it does is help you go through all those years you probably spent thinking about the things our protagonist thinks about. It's a journey where you can reinvent yourself. You can identify and understand people who are going through similar phases and be more pleasant to them at the same time. The show is easy to understand and yet the best parts of the show are pretty subtle. You are a human, you've been through things, you have felt things and you have to ask yourself the questions. The more human you are the better you can appreciate this show. After reading this much, the show probably seems like an edgy show about teen problems with sad and gloomy atmosphere all the time. In fact, it is pretty different. Although the things brought up in 3 gatsu no lion is pretty deep at times but it never tries to sell it too much to the audience. It tries to keep the atmosphere as easy and every day like as possible, just what you would expect from a slice of life. It can be an everyday smile and spread smile show one moment and then manages to cover it with beautiful relatable sadness the very next. It makes sure not to overdo the depressing themes and tries some very not funny comedy. The purpose of the comedy never seems to be about making people laugh. Rather it's about making them feel warmer and more vulnerable to digest the more serious concepts.\\n\\n\r\nThe show focuses on shogi and people who build their life around shogi. But no one has to understand Shogi to truly appreciate the show. Rather its the story of people choosing a not so lovely life, the struggles they face because of it and their reasoning to continue. The answers to the questions are pretty simple and it is presented that way but they still manage to hit hard because of the sheer presence of realistic natural emotions that can easily win people over. The pacing is slow because of those things of course. But that shouldn't affect people because the show never really loses the magic it attracts its audience with. The show is better of being slow because that is what allows it to excel as well as it does. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is fantastic. The use of environmental description and portraying them beautifully adds a lot to the strategy of making things warm to the viewer. It adds to character development through the imagination of the characters.Not only does the artwork look good but with great animation, it also serves a strong purpose to why it is what it is. It just feels very real. It is a very special show.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in 3 gatsu no lion is also wonderfully done. Good storytelling through opening and ending, meaningful lyrics and nice songs as well. The soundtrack is mostly chill as if there's a touch of sadness and recovery to it, like the nature of the show itself. No matter how many emotions the show portrays it rarely goes out of its soothing way of music. No matter what the problem is it's natural. People go through them. Hence they can feel better with a few drops of tears. The music portrays everything as soothing and calm. Time for a mandatory Steven Wilson quote-\\n\\n\r\n\"Those are the things that make me want to express or exercise something through my songwriting.\\n\\n\r\n\"There's a lot of beauty to be found in sadness and melancholia.\\n\\n\r\n\"One of the things that you find time and time again - not just with music, but with literature - is that things that appear to be quite depressing on the surface can ironically be very uplifting and touching to other people.\\n\\n\r\n\"When you hear something that really reminds you that you're not alone in feeling sad, depressed, melancholic, angry - I think that can actually be a very cathartic experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack works in a similar fashion for 3 gatsu no lion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow I talk about my favourite aspect of this show of course. The characters! The characters in 3 gatsu no lion have a lot of development in a short period of time. Rei Kiriyama is a pretty successful yet unhappy teen. He doesn't enjoy shogi but still plays on because it is the only thing that gives meaning to his life. His sense of survival is the thing that keeps him ticking. He isn't proud of his reasons and wants to find more to himself. The show's best parts are about Rei's inner conflict and self-discovery. The 3 kawamoto sisters are people that can make Rei feel different. Their purpose in the show is strong. They are pretty detailed characters who are supposed to contribute to building a warm environment for the entire show. They have their own emotions and they easily feel sympathy and care for other people.\\n\\n\r\n2 other characters I would like to talk about is Rei's adoptive father and his adoptive sister. Rei's adoptive father is the kind of person who would give more importance to his passion of shogi than to his own children. That would result in a messed up psychology for Rei's adoptive sister Kyoko who is another important character in the series. Her presence creates doubt and problems for Rei which plays a vital role in his development \\n\\n\r\nRei's relationship with his homeroom teacher is one of the highlights of the show and certainly one of my favourite things. Basically, some of Rei's traits is also some of our most pathetic sides that we often can't let go. His conversations with his teacher address those and is a life lesson for the audience in general. One other character of importance shows up as Rei's mentor later in the series. His development is also something to admire and reminds us just why we love this series in case we ever forget in the middle of all those attempted comedy that we might not appreciate all the time.\\n\\n\r\nHow much did I enjoy the show? It is not something people would watch for entertainment.The journey itself is rather the draw here.It is not a show where you leave easter eggs to have the people talk about and discover vague meanings and how technically superior it is to other works.It's better than that. It's just very relatable, has a strong purpose and feels very warm and soothing.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Of course season one leaves things to be desired but that is why we got a season 2. Hopefully, season 2 will be just as good if not better. I hope they don't go downwards from here. As for season 1 as a stand-alone, well I am very happy no doubt. Would recommend everybody to watch it the right way for sure. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Visually and emotionally engrossing but intellectually misplaced, this show struggles most at maintaining a focal core to its story, undermining its originally interesting characters. This nebulous nature is demonstrable most by disregarding the emotional struggles of the protagonist. The advancement of story plot by becoming a sports-esque shonen midway through the show abandoned our initial premise of a numbed and enervated youth, struggling with self-discovery and plagued by a fear of straying from routinely methodical thinking. The transition in show style itself is not necessarily at fault, rather that the execution lended itself poorly to the furtherment of the characters. This striking offence widens evengreater when the show eventually doesn't even follow the main protagonist, who becomes relegated to a support character with no influence over the story whatsoever. After this, the rest of the watching experience becomes waiting for the show to run out of episodes and come to a close.\\n\\n\r\nArt is above average. Sound is above average. Enjoyable despite culminating and then terminating without proper development or resolution of the main characters.",

            "content": "We've all felt a bit lonely at some point in our lives. Yet, when we're asked to describe loneliness, it becomes somewhat difficult to express it. We take for granted the comfort of others, the warmth of a hug, and even just the presence of someone who recognizes that you exist. We feel as though there's no point to life if there's nobody to experience it with. After all, we're only human.\r\nI think that 3-gatsu no Lion perfectly captures this type of feeling. It's one of the few shows that tells an honest story that is made only by someone who had also experienced suchemotions. The show's use of imagery to captivate the audience, the story that is borderline tear jerking, and the music to embrace the atmosphere of the situations presented truly made this anime one of the few stories that drove me to awe every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who experienced loneliness and depression before, I feel as if 3-gatsu no Lion is directly speaking to me. Though the shogi in this show is an important part of the story, I've never felt overwhelmed by all the terminology that the characters use. It is safe to say that you don't need to know a lot about shogi to appreciate the story. The story is about Rei Kiriyama and his relationship with others as he traverses through the trials of life. At the beginning of 3-gatsu no lion, we're introduced with a beautiful French song that coincides with a sweeping view of Rei simply getting ready and walking from his apartment to his next shogi game. In the background we see Rei's apartment, ragged and without furniture, the cup ramen on the floor, and a beautiful landscape of the area around him. We also see his clothes and how he conducts himself every morning as he prepares for the day. While he's walking to the shogi hall, we see him enshrouded in a crowd of people, as if he were simply a background character, emphasizing his loneliness in this sea of people living their day-to-day lives. By the end of this segment, we already know what Rei is like, and the entire scene is almost entirely without dialogue. Such masterful storytelling is very rare in anime nowadays. Whereas other anime tell their stories entirely through exposition and boring conversations, 3-gatsu no Lion tells it entirely through its animation and music to effective results. The beautiful French music mixed with ordinary scenes that many could relate to in this first episode is the epitome of this. It is moments like this that make me go, \"This is why I watch anime.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't just show Rei as a depressing character. It also shows how he tries to overcome his situation, by persevering through his sad emotions, and by strengthening his resolve and give meaning to his career in shogi. Throughout the course of the show, his past constantly comes back to haunt him, yet we see him trying his best to overcome it. Rei changes from someone who lives only for the sake of living, to someone who enjoys spending time with his newfound companions. And the change is almost unnoticeable until you take a step back and look at his character. It is thanks to the show's wonderful pacing that neither feels rushed nor too slow that helps you know Rei more on a personal level.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are also wonderful to watch, especially the moments with the three sisters -- Akari, Hinata, and of course Momo. The moments with those three just bring so much life to the show that I just wish that they had more screen time in the second half of the show. I want to know more about them and go more in-depth to their family situation and problems. And this problem extends to some of the other characters as well, as some just completely disappear. It's really a shame that they didn't get as much development as Rei did over the course of the story, but luckily there's a second season for that (hype!). Another more prominent supporting character worth mentioning is Shimada. At first, he seemed like a character who wasn't as important when he was first introduced, but I was surprised at how much depth and focus he was given in the latter half of the story. His dedication and reason for playing shogi is one of the most relatable and emotional story arcs I have ever seen, and it just goes to show the ability of the writer to make amazingly lovable characters. It just irks me that some characters didn't seem to get as much love.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is simply stunning. Shaft really outdid themselves this time. Instead of raising the number of head tilts and the surreal, mind numbing imagery seen in their previous works, Shaft manages to strike a perfect balance between realism and dreamlike symbolism. The art style evokes a sense of comfort in the mundane, awe in the inspiring scenes, and even beauty in the depressing scenes. I often find myself just sitting in my seat appreciating the level of detail in the scenery of the background and the images that Rei conjures up in his internal monologues, never feeling overwhelmed or taken out of the story by the animation. The show is simply a master of blending art and animation with storytelling, which is what all anime should strive to do.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the music is also an important component to the memorable scenes. Where in most anime the music is there for the sake of being there, in 3-gatsu no Lion the quieter tunes add on to the scenes and build emotional resonance. For example, in a conversation when Rei is having a conversation someone who deeply admires him and asks Rei why he went back to high school, the piano in the background starts off quiet and harmonized in the background. But once the conversation became more intimate and Rei connected with this person, the piano gradually grew louder and created a sea of emotions, making this scene one of the most amazing scenes I've ever seen in anime. I was almost left in tears once that scene was over. The soundtrack is so beautiful that it is a sin not to appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is such an enjoyable watch that I'm baffled that many haven't watched this amazing show yet. Not many anime could match this sort of quality, and it's a shame that shows like this get buried underneath all the mediocrity that comes out every year. If you're like me and crave for a more emotional story of striving for success and happiness in life, then this is a show for you.\\n",

This is one of the great spiritual laws of life.\" - Shoghi Effendi \r\nHis name is \"Shoghi\", how could I not quote him here? \r\nMarch Comes in like a Lion, or Sangatsu no Lion in Japanese, is the newest work produced by studio Shaft, previously known for shows such as Madoka Magica and the Monogatari series. While those are the only shows I watchedfrom them, at least at the time of writing this review, I was always intrigued to see what could they do if they adapted something with a realistic setting, without any supernatural elements that they could use to express their very specific, highly unusual style. I got an answer with this show, starting Fall 2016 I was once again introduced to all the things I grew to respect about both the directing and the writing talent working for that studio. How well did the transition from fantasy to realism work for me personally? Well, I'm here to share my thoughts on exactly that, so if you are interested to see it, even though you already saw the score I gave it and probably think I'm just an another fanboy, then I encourage you to keep reading. \\n\\n\r\n*Slight spoilers for 3-Gatsu no Lion included* \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9,5 \\n\r\nWelcome to a world where a game of shogi means more than you could ever imagine, but at the same time it means less than you would ever anticipate. That's the world that the main protagonist - Rei Kiriyama - lives in on a daily basis. As one of the few players to enter professional shogi while also being a middle school student he decided to live on his own, making a living off of doing just that. However, Rei doesn't love shogi. It's not something he's ever passionate about, every match feels like a job to him, he only strives to be better because he needs to eat and pay rent. Shogi is the only thing he's really good at, taught by his now deceased father and other people, he has grown to be a recognizable face amongst the players and enthusiasts of the game. Even that doesn't bring him joy, as his dark past is always in the back of his mind, not letting him fully enjoy what life has in store for him. However, one day he begins to develop bonds with people. Throughout the show he meets both the ones interested in shogi and the ones that never played it, and through those encounters something starts to resonate within him. He starts discovering himself, his reason to push on, his motivations and goals and most importantly, why does it hurt so much when he loses at something he doesn't feel passionate about. \\n\r\nJust from the premise alone, the anime seems very complicated for anyone that isn't from Japan. Shogi isn't a game that's popular overseas to put it lightly. If you're afraid that it isn't suitable for you because of that fact alone, let me dispel those doubts. This is not a show that focuses heavily on the shogi board, but everything that happens around it, closer or further away. From the daily practice at home to the big tournament live streamed on national TV, we actually see very little of the games, not even once do we see one in its entirety, without any interruption. No, this isn't a show that focuses heavily on strategies to defeat the opponents or major conflicts being decided by a mere game. This is actually a drama, intertwined with several slice of life elements. Yes, shogi is in the middle of it all, but the show does a good enough job not to make it complicated for any newcomers, at one point even explaining the rules through special songs with cute cats as endings of some episodes, though I'm certain that anyone who has experience with the game will also find something to his liking, because even if the strategies and games aren't touched upon for too long, they're still there. \\n\r\nThe story progresses quite fast, which is surprising considering how slow the dialogues are and how much time the show spends on some scenes. It's narrative feels sluggish, but it's somehow constantly pushing forward, with each encounter or event providing some sort of insight, some sort of a push towards the next episode. \\n\r\nJust like in real life though, this story goes through phases and constant development. It follows the current state of the main character, sees him clinging to new hopes and people without him even realizing it most of the time. Everything starts with the kindness he received from the Kawamoto family. The oldest sister - Akari - brought him in when she saw him on the streets and the rest of the people living in her house slowly started warming up to him. Rei, who never encountered such kindness, can't even begin to comprehend how he got into that situation. He can't understand where all the warmth and happiness he found came from. Nonetheless, this first push into being a part of society definitely helped him grow, he decides to go back to school and after many other events, he can finally decide on something in his life That's when the show starts changing, it pushes back the happy sisters and all the slice of life elements into the background and pulls shogi into the foreground. Personally, I was very satisfied with this change. It helped the show feel fresh and showed that it's able to leave its comfort zone to provide a different take on the progression of the plot and its themes. While for some this decision backfired heavily, for me it was the dream scenario, because this was the part where the fantastic script and directing could shine in the usual Shaft style, not saying that it didn't do so before, it just wasn't as prevailing. \\n\r\nAs for the ending, even a 2 cour anime can't cover the entirety of the ongoing manga, but thankfully at the end of the final episode that the second season is coming in Fall, so there's no need to worry about an unfinished product. It's not like it left anything completely unconcluded, it's just that it needs more time to fully bring the story to an end. \\n\r\nFrom that point on it really started reaching for stars, for the place at the anime pantheon where the biggest analysts could  forever argue about its themes and their messages to the characters and the viewer. A show that, amongst other things, already was a great commentary about the difficulties of being a pro at a young age, an issue that is becoming more relevant than ever before, starts to add the issues of people who were pros long before Rei's career started. This were supposed to be the key moments that would decide on this show's greatness. Did it truly reach that? For me yes, it did. It handled it very maturely, without rushing into conclusions and delivering the closure at a very good pace, it let everything build up to the point where I was excited for every new story that it wanted to show me, surprised by both the writing quality and the procurement by the studio. It kept on overtaking itself, at no point could I feel any signs of regression in its quality. Instead, the constant growth left me astonished. Even when the show went the more predictable direction, it always threw in a little twist so the viewer won't feel like he got scammed out of something. It truly was one of the most humane stories that I experienced. \\n\r\nGoing back a bit, I want to touch upon the slice of life elements, as they truly split the community, at least during the time it aired. Besides the ones that didn't care or enjoyed everything all the same, we had the side that hated the heavy shogi parts and enjoyed the easiness and warmth of the scenes with the sisters, but on the other one there were people who preferred strong and thoughtful narrative without the cute moments that they considered worse. I am the one that didn't think it mattered. The outstanding work of directing both and mixing them in so they could become the perfect reverses of each other in my opinion brought out the best from both of them. While there were longer periods where one received more screen time than the other, they were easily swapped by different things. The happy feelings didn't came out only from the sisters, neither did the drama come out only from the shogi games. Different characters underwent multiple events that showed different sides and approached the same inner problems and conflicts Rei faced through their mindsets. This is another thing that 3-gatsu really excelled at. \\n\r\nNever before have I found myself seeing as many details as I did with this series. That's not to say they're not subtle, far from it actually, and I don't think it's just because I felt like I could relate to the story. Actually, the subtlety here is used more often than straightforwardness. That's why I, as the viewer, found more than I usually would. It operated its atmosphere really well and knows what it goes for. I can understand why some would say that slice of life-like moments ruin that, but I think the show really needs them. Just as any other show with this amount of pressure put on the viewer, it tries to take his mind off of it so he can smile but also think about everything that happened up to that point. You may use it as a breather at the very least. I'm just a moefag, I enjoy simple things in anime, especially when they're done as well as they were done here. \\n\r\nAll in all, the story is deep, and it only goes further down the rabbit hole with each episode. Never stops trying to go above and beyond what it set for itself at the beginning. Always moving, but never stopping being alluring, charming, interesting and surprising until the very end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 \\n\r\nEverything will once again boil down to how you see certain genres. 3-Gatsu took a risk mixing the simple, moe cuteness and heavy, symbolic way of storytelling. I'm certain that it knew that people who don't enjoy one or the other could feel alienated when it took the main stage as I mentioned before, but I'm sure that if that's the case, then people could find something to enjoy in the characters. From the first episode it struck me as a series where everyone from the cast will have some problems they'll have to deal with, whether they will take the main stage or not was left as a mystery. What's surprising though is how many character profiles it managed to present. Each one has enough of a time spot to provide a valuable view on one of the story elements. For example, we get to see all types of shogi players, each at a different part in their private life, their professional career and with a different meaning they find in playing it. All of this affects Kiriyama's decisions and his way of life. It's not something that's brushed off, all characters are introduced at the correct times, so they could destroy Rei's view of the future, bringing either light or darkness into it. \\n\r\nI'll delve deeper into his character. As an orphan who moved into a house full of people with dream of shogi greatness he had to work hard for the status he got at the point where we meet him. He was adopted to a family where shogi skills were the most precious ones. His potential unfortunately started to bring sadness rather than happiness. People started seeing him as a shogi machine, rather than a kid. Because he was an adopted child, the arguments arose and after some time he decided to move out and live off of his earnings as a pro, which leads us to the beginning of the series. As a lost youngster, not understanding what he wants in life, never even trying to find it he mindlessly continues to pursue shogi and lives a monotonous life, but when he meets the Kawamoto family he starts seeing that it doesn't have to be like this. \\n\r\nThe family consists of three sisters and their grandfather. Their mother and grandmother passed away. The oldest sister - Akari - works at a bar. One day she found Rei on the streets and took him home. There he also met the middle sister Hinata, who is a very passionate and reckless klutz, and the youngest Momo, who is the cutest little thing in existence. Their grandfather works at a sweets shop. They're not the most wealthy family, but they get through somehow. Any time that we get to see them together they provide a lot of lovely, happy feelings, but that doesn't mean they never undergo difficulties. Despite all that, they take Rei into their family as if he was their own kin, take care of him and invite him to dinners. They're very altruistic and as I mentioned before, they also had to go through the premature death of their family. But that's where the similarities end, because the Kawamoto family are the exact opposite of Rei. They're happy, hardworking, passionate and expressive. They think about their future, but try to not to keep their head in the clouds to maintain the household. This sudden meeting of two worlds really exemplifies what the show can do best. \\n\r\nLater we meet Rei's rival and friend Nikaidou, who despite his chubby appearance and loud, sometimes obnoxious way of being can provide thought provoking ideas and be friendly towards newly met people. His mentor - Kai Shimada - is, once again, mostly the opposite of him. He is skinny, lets thing get to his head, but he is also a much better shogi player that can blow someone's mind with his style of play. There's also Rei's teacher who tries to push him into doing what he really wants to do, even neglect his studies if necessary. \\n\r\nAll the characters, including the ones I didn't mention, help Rei slowly understand something that he couldn't even begin trying to comprehend before. They show him their own worlds and as he begins to find his long lost strive for a better life their interactions end up being the pushes he needed to escape the enclosed dark place he found himself in. It's really hard for me to remember such a well balanced cast, with just the right amount of time provided so they won't feel dull or forced down the viewers throat, but 3-Gatsu achieves it and in a style that doesn't leave any other element pushed to the sidelines. The writing doesn't lose its goal for a second as it drives every character into a point where I could be satisfied with the time I spent with the, but with a room to grow and expand if needed. \\n\r\nJust as a quick note though, this show relies heavily on long monologues to develop its characters. I know that it's a problem to many, but unlike some other shows, this one also visualizes all the thoughts to make it more interesting. Still, if you don't feel like that's your thing or you simply don't feel like watching a show like this, you should be informed about it beforehand. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9 \\n\r\nWhen it comes to anime directing I can't think of a more distinct style than the one of the person who single handedly made Shaft into what it is today - Akiyuki Shinbou. After watching one of his works, going into the next one the first thing you'll say is: \"Oh, this is a Shaft anime\". It's no different here. Sudden, sharp camera work, fast yet clear scene transitions, constant changes in the color pallet, a lot of close ups and the usage of colors and backgrounds as a way of showcasing emotions. It's all here. What I always wanted to see however is how he would continue his pursuit of imagery in a show without supernatural elements. The answer was easy enough, he simply visualized all the emotions, stuff that was going on inside the head of a character. Everything seems to have a consistent meaning, water is a symbol of being flooded by something a character can't fight with, foggy backgrounds mean that a character is deep in thought etc. so, directing wise, really damn good once again. Shaft really does deliver on this aspect, unless of course you don't enjoy this style of directing. If something I felt the severe lack of neck tilts. EVERYTHING NEEDS MORE NECK TILTS. \\n\r\nThe art style is pretty, and there are definitely things that stand out, like the wide panoramic shots of the town during day and night or the cute, comedic chibi-like moments, but the character designs leave a little bit to be desired. A lot of the faces look similar, they're hard to read unless someone's making a very clear facial expression and their closed mouths are barely noticeable during most scenes. The characters themselves look good, distinctive and unique for the most part, theres one pair that I sometimes mixed up, but besides that I could always say who's who. The thick outlines definitely helped with that, those were the strongest point about the character designs. \\n\r\nThe animation is really beautiful. Unless it's necessary to the feeling of the scene or it's simply a close up, character rarely stay in one place. Often there's something going on in the background, like the cats in the Kawamoto house, another pair playing their own games or a simple sparkle or a special effect. There are a couple of weird graphical choices, but they're more often then not fully aware choices to make something seem more comedic and cartoony. \\n\r\nBy the way, the openings are directed even better than the rest of the series. Could talk for hours about their meaning, but time is precious and there's anime that's waiting for me as you read this, so I'll keep it short. First opening shows Rei falling into the water not being able to escape his memories, while the ending shows him getting out and meeting his past self, as he manages to get past his trauma. The second opening is a reminder of the road Rei had to go through and the future that lies ahead of him, while the second ED shows him once again falling down, but this time he has something that he can happily look forward and look up to and manages to continue on, even if he undergoes minor regression and faces many obstacles, especially mental ones. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nI'm not the one to judge music properly, but I do feel like the soundtrack screwed around with a lot of ideas and lacked consistency, even in the first episode one insert song was in French and after that we didn't get to hear any more and at times I didn't feel like the switches between the happy and sad music were done properly. The soundtrack on its own is gorgeous, really pleasant and ambient, it follows the themes of the show, complements the scenes themselves very well, often gets louder and more intense during important moments which is always nice, uses a lot of instruments and when it needs to, the show can get quiet to provide a nice breather for the viewer so he can think about what happened up to that point or what's about to go down. Lots of positives overall. \\n\r\nThe voice acting here is great. A lot of the times, just when I started to think that the tone of someone's voice is about to get repetitive they either switch it, stop talking or the music changed to keep it fresh. We get to hear the voices of popular seiyuu such as Kana Hanazawa, who once again voices a cute girl, Nobuhiko Okamoto, who once again voices a very impulsive character, Miki Shinichiro, who once again voices a stoic character, alongside many others such as Marina Inoue, Takahiro Sakurai, Ai Kayano and others.  A fresh seiyuu that voiced Rei also do a good job, he can put on a good, emotional performance, talk in a steady, melancholic tone, act surprised and provide a lot of other expressions. At times I even felt like the characters were created for the voice actors and not the other way around. \\n\r\nThe OP's and ED's, besides the great directing, sound great and really fit the rest of the soundtrack both with the lyrics and the music itself. \\n\r\nToshiki Kameyama isn't one of the most memorable sound directors, his more notable work are probably Kokoro Connect, original Escaflowne, Nisekoi and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, but he really did hit it out of the park this time. He really does fit the realistic Shaft style. Great work. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nBeyond the slower start, this series really provided me with one of the most unique and special experiences to date. The subtlety in every scene and the care put into all the details, while a bit slow paced, definitely made the series into something that I always wanted to see. It really felt like I went through the story alongside Rei, not only as a passive observer, but as someone who attached himself to his ideals and waited to see more of it each time an episode ended. Not often was a series that doesn't actually build up huge amounts of tension, or at least not up to a specific point, left me so empty upon finishing it. I'm sure it won't be a feeling I'll forget any time soon. \\n\r\nAs I'm writing this I feel completely entranced by what I got out of it, debating over meanings of certain situations and looking back at my life realizing how many similar decisions I had to make, while quite a few series were able to do this, March comes in like a lion was able to do it week after week, episode after episode, key moment after key moment. That's why this show is truly one of my favorites, an unforgettable piece of art that I'll gladly revisit once I cool off. The second season has already been announced, so my rewatch will have to wait a bit. Not that I'm complaining of course. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\r\nI was a fan of other Shaft works before I started 3-gatsu, but this cemented it's place as one of my favorite studios. Their works are always consistent and bring something special to the genre they tackle. While everyone gushes over how Trigger saves anime, I'm just here watching how Shaft tries its hardest to make it into a place where masterpieces can be born. The amount of talent in the staff that gathered to create this one show, that I could have never expected to turn out as well as it did, put out something that I think current dramas should look up to in almost every element. Not everything works at all times, but when it all clicks, then it's worth every minute of the time I spent with it. I'm seriously glad I started watching anime when I did, because seeing something like this being put out into the world is a magnificent feeling. I'm certain that when someone in a couple of years finds this little gem amongst thousands of new anime, he'll be able to enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed it when it aired. It's that universal and timeless. \\n\r\nAm I overstating it all? \\n\r\nProbably, but those are my honest feelings and they're as pure and heartwarming as happiness on Momo's face when she sees Rei coming her way, Hinata's passion in life or Akari's concern for other human beings. \\n\r\nNow, excuse me while I go and weep about all those little moments that I just remembered. \\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion and I highly recommend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that Sangatsu no Lion is my favorite anime of all time, mainly because of season two. However, season one is still fantastic because of the art, sound, and characters making up for the fact that the story is just \"good.\" One of the main reasons Sangatsu no Lion is my favorite show is because it is the true definition of a slice of life. It covers family, friendship, depression, retirement, fleeting love, school, etc., while most shows can only cover one or two of those topics.  Now into the review. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nWhile the story is far from bad,nothing pops out as mind blowing or fantastic. Rather, each arc delivers a solid, meaningful message that is consistently good and is supposed to help the protagonist, Kiriyama Rei, grow as a character. The stories start from Rei, a 17 year-old professional shogi player (Japanese Chess) playing a game against an opponent. The stories center around the interactions he has with each person after the match, whether he wins or loses. Through these encounters, he learns to better deal with his tragic past as he attempts to move forward and become more independent. However, the pacing of the show is a bit too slow. Not enough happens in the 22 episodes, as the arcs could definitely be shortened. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNo anime has amazed me more in the animation direction than Sangatsu no Lion. Whether the art style fits your taste is up to you, but the changes from the normal animation, to a funny cartoon, then to something that can instantly be used as a wallpaper is just amazing. What I appreciate the most about the animation however is the attention to detail. Despite having a relatively small budget which led to the decision to use primarily water colors, they make the most of what they have and then some through creativity and never being lazy. Every pickup shot, motion, and landscapes are made as if it's the most important shot of the show, which is something we can all appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI believe the soundtrack should set the tone or mood of the show, and here, the soundtrack alone makes watching Sangatsu no Lion very relaxing. Because of the pacing and the story being a bit lacking, it is a very hard show to binge, but I found myself always being in the mood to sit down and watch the show, and would stop after watching two or three episodes. The Opening and Endings come mostly from a band called Bump of Chicken, and the second Opening song called \"Sayonara Bystander\" is one of my favorite songs in an OP. The OST's (original soundtracks) set the mood for each scene perfectly, making you feel what Rei is feeling, whether that be lonely, reminiscent, or calm. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, the characters really carry this show in season one, especially the Kawamoto sisters. Momo (kindergarten), Hina (middle school), and Akari (age 22-23) are the only people that treat Rei like family. Much like the animation, the side characters are also given great attention to detail. Rei's teacher at school seems silly and draws many laughs, but is also a deeply caring person who truly wants to help students who are struggling. The other thing that Sangatsu does really well is creating characters that you can really, really hate. Kyoko, Rei's foster sister, and her love interest, a fellow professional shogi player, become characters that you truly despise, making you love characters that stand up to them even more. We watch Rei go through all kinds of emotions as he tries to deal with these characters while attempting to keep his emotions separate from his shogi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story and pacing make this a barely 10/10, I still enjoyed season one because of the reasons mentioned above. While the popularity of Sangatsu is sky high in Japan, it continues to remain relatively low world wide. If you've seen season one and thought it was just okay, give season two a chance, when every single arc manages to be mind blowing and fantastic while the animation, sound, and characters continue to be sublime. If you haven't seen this show yet, it's definitely worth the watch.",

            "content": "This review is for both the first and second season of 3-Gatsu no Lion.  3-Gatsu no Lion is an absolute masterpiece in character writing, and as the show progresses, I keep finding myself getting blown away.  I have never seen a show (or really any media) with a cast of such unfolding, believable, multi-dimensional, human characters.\r\n3-Gatsu no Lion centers itself on a high-school Shogi player who suffers from overwhelming depression, and lives in relative isolation.  The depression is visualized in absolutely beautiful ways through the animation, the metaphors and the protagonists inner monologue.  And ultimately you find yourself rooting for acharacter who fails to see his value and assumes he is burdening all of those around him, while also seeing the outside perspective of how he is touching and shaping the lives of those around him and bettering the world, even though he cannot recognize it.  In spite of the inherently dark themes in the show, it always remains believable and never feels contrived or melodramatic.  And somehow, the show threads the needle and feels really uplifting instead of depressing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while I think that the story of the protagonist earns this series a 10/10 rating by itself, I find myself getting blown away by how the show handles the side characters.  Every character in this world is incredibly human, and has their own motivations and struggles.  This show constantly subverts expectations by making you root for characters that lesser shows would have left as cliched antagonists or undeveloped background characters.  But 3-Gatsu no Lion lets these 'background characters' step into the foreground, sometimes even drifting away from following the protagonist for a while.  The reality is, the show introduces characters for you to hate, and then you wind up understanding them and sympathizing with them.  Or it sets up characters for you to overlook and then pulls the rug out from under you when you realize that they are just as complex people as the main character and have their own equal struggles.\\n\\n\r\nThe power of the show is that it is one of the few shows where the main character isn't the center of the universe, but is struggling inside a living breathing world.  And in most shows, the main character is 'special'.  In 3-Gatsu no Lion, he is definitely special, but so is everyone.  This is a show that is filled with characters that all could have been the main character, and that is an impressive feat.  And it also makes the main character's struggles more real and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nI may be biased in that 3-Gatsu no Lion perfectly fits within my stylistic preference for shows (along with shows like Oregairu and Natsume Yuujincho).  But 3-Gatsu no Lion is the most 'human' show I've ever seen, and I think is a must-watch for anyone who likes Slice-of-Life shows, or emotional/uplifting shows.  This one is really special.",

Some anime are able to mix drama, comedy, and moe, but this anime doesn't seem to have any synergy. It just jumps around between them while keeping the main narrative about shogi. Other anime are able to capture their audience into an uninteresting sport such as Chihayafuru but 3-gatsu doesn't delve into shogi enough for the audience to care, but focuses so much of the show around it where the audience must sit throughit. The show has no overarching narrative and no reason to root for any of the characters. It's a garbled mess that looks pretty on the surface.",

That\u00b4s not the only point that bothers me. The design is kinda careless, but that\u00b4s just the typical SHAFT thing you have to deal with. Maybe you like blurred background and faceless side characters, maybe you liketo know what\u00b4s happening next because you see that leant back SHAFT head, maybe 3-gatsu no Lion is exactly what you call perfect. I would not, I hoped for more.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u00b4s talk about the characters and the story, since it\u00b4s the most important thing for me. Here we come to the points that I really like. There\u00b4s nothing new about an introverted main character that goes through a really hard time in his life, but Rei is kinda surprising you. He is the stereotype that you already know and still he makes decissions that don\u00b4t fit in his role. It\u00b4s like seeing a child grow and develop new characteristics. As you start the first episode, you are dead even with Rei because he doesn\u00b4t know much more about his surroundings. \\n\r\nThe thing that keeps you watching this anime is the question about his past. A lot of things happend, really sad things, really disturbing things and you sit there watching it and waiting for an explanation. \\n\\n\r\nSince I mentioned his really sad past, I have to comment that I\u00b4m still waiting for 3-gatsu no Lion to make me cry. It has so much potential to be a tear-jerker, but it\u00b4s just not happning. Every time you think that it will crash your feelings, SHAFT decides to get off the track. Shame on you. But thanks for explaining Shogi for dummies! xD\\n\\n\r\nI just watched episode 11.5, so maybe it\u00b4s going to get better but if you\u00b4re just as disapointed as I am, you just have to concentrate on Momo and the cats. Those are some hilarious side characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sangatsu no Lion story is not that impressive, and this is not only an anime about shogi, but its more about coming-of-age story of overcoming depression. It's a surprise for me because i was expecting a depressing drama like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, turn out complete opposite of that. What spectacullar about this anime is the character. Rei, the series' protagonist, resonate with me very close, it feel so real to me what & how he feel. \r\nAltough Rei have very different story & living place than me, still i can relate so much with him. For example many characters do not understandhow can he sad, and indeed, for someone so gifted enough as to turn it into a career from a young age how is someone like that be unhappy with what he do?. I think that's what people around me think too, but also for myself, \"I should be happy for what i do, why i'm not?\" that word keep coming to my mind over and over. Then, how Rei keep moving with his life silently and leaving his problems unresolved, this feel so much realistic. Most people have many problem, but mostly rather than solving like much fictional story that just focus on single problem, we usualy leave it there, there is so much more to do & think than just that. I think that one of Sangatsu no Lion message is that okay to have a unressolved problem, it's normal, just keep moving foward.\\n\\n\r\nPeople could argue that there is a bit too much comedy in this show. And, certainly, if you are looking only for serious storytelling from start to finish, you may end up feeling somewhat alienated by the end. But this is what real life does, you can cry then five minutes later laugh. Our feeling is not one dimensional. when we depressed because something, we still can be happy because something else, while depressed feeling still there. Our emotion is stacked, not cancel each other. This mean when someone is happy, not mean he is not depressed. And when someone is depressed, not mean he is not happy.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not about resloving problem, but about to accept it is part of normal life, and how to overcome it. Also I find more about happiness in this show than any other show. But certainly this show not for everyone, without you resonate with the character i think it will be bit hard to appreciate this show.\\n\\n\r\nMany reviews, usualy discuss the anime in a technical way. \"The animation is excellent\", \"the characters well developed\", \"the story is weak\". But Sangatsu no Lion can't reviewed that way for me. It feels more real. And so I write something more personal.",

            "content": "At first 3-gatsu no lion may seem like the most boring anime ever, but don't be fooled. \r\nThis anime is a Slice of Life masterpiece, not only it sets you in an everyday scenario, but also makes you feel related somewhat to the characters and while i don't really find shogi interesting this anime made me change my way of thinking about this game. \r\nWhat makes this anime different from any other SoL is that it's not happy neither relaxing, is actually very realistic (there are obviously happy times as well). It shows you the different emotions that humans feel during their whole lives, likefear, sadness, depression, anger and not only the happy parts, but every part of the human emotions. \\n\r\nAnd i think i never related to a character the way i did with Kiriyama (the main character). I live alone and so does Kiriyama, and he explains what is like to live a life as a \"grown up\" but he realizes he sucks at being an adult and he talks about the fact that being independent doesn't stop you from being sad or depressed, and i related to the way he lived SO MUCH, also to the little lights in his life, the Kawamoto sisters giving him a warm feeling of happy and losing that feeling everytime he left their house, i related to that a lot. Literally i think he describes living alone being in your teens so accurately is scary. \\n\r\nNow, it did have his flaws, while the first half of the season is awesome i think the second half lacked something as it didn't focused on the main character, it focused on a supporting character and his story but i still enjoyed it, not as much as the first half though.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art may not be the best out there, it is really soothing and i think it really fits this type of anime, watching it made me feel cozy idk lol, the art style is very pretty in my opinion, is like one of those pretty aquarelle paintings, idk it really gave me a different feeling, and i've never watched any art style like that (except for honey and clover wich is made by the same author). \\n\\n\r\nAnd now, let's talk about something that i LOVED! The soundtrack. \\n\r\nIt was beautiful, every ending and opening were also beautiful, specially the openings, they made me feel something i never felt while listening to an opening. \\n\r\nI absolutely love bump of the chicken plus 3-gatsu, beautiful combination.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nShould you watch it? YES\\n\r\nWill everyone enjoy it? No. I feel like this is one of the animes i'm always going to tell people to watch and they are never going to watch, i would never recommend it to someone new to anime though and i don't think everyone can enjoy this series because i fell that you really have to understand the characters feelings to truly feel something about this anime. So if you are kinda depressed i think you might enjoy lol. I loved it but i know that not everyone can like this. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!\r\nSangatsu no Lion revolves around Rei Kiriyama, a frail boy that has to deal with a terrible loss. To distract himself from his emotions he turns to Shogi - a japanese board game similar to chess. His unhealthy obsession with the game is only fueled by the bad parenting of his new 'shogi father'. Rei's new siblings naturally grow to hate Rei instead of their father for stealing his attention. Rei also starts to blame himself for breaking the family apart so he wants to leave the house asap. Soon he becomes a pro and can afford to live by himself, heis 'happy' that he left the house without doing more damage. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to Rei, that is the finish line. He can now somewhat take care of himself, he has a place to live. He just goes to the shogi hall once in a while, and he doesn't even need to get better at it. He just needs to stay at his current level... nothing needs to change, life is okay. That's where we meet Rei, a depressed boy who thinks he is okay in his solitary aquarium. In the following episodes, through his eyes, we get to see how he evolves through his interactions with people and shogi. I know nothing about shogi but I found the premise fascinating and the story did not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nAs the contrast between the life with his friends and his solitary life became more and more apparent, sometimes Rei was depressed, other times he was crying from happiness. The audience is intentionally put painfully close to Rei, listening to every thought that goes through his mind in slow pacing. The plotline was interesting and realistic. Whether the scene was dramatic or humorous, whether Rei won a game or lost, the show always handled it brilliantly. It was an amazing experience to be able to watch things both from an omniscient view and from Rei's perspective.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the other characters, The Kawamoto sisters show Rei how dark and lonely his side of the bridge is and how there are other ways you can cope with loss. Nikaidou urges him to take better care of himself and his shogi, to not be content where he is. Takashi sensei reminds him he's still just a kid but also that he is amazing for his age, that he should have self-confidence. Every character has a meaningful place in Rei's life, and impressively none of them is just a \"development tool\" for him. \\n\\n\r\nDespite seemingly revolving around Rei, the show is realistic and deep with its side characters as well. Akari doesn't just take Rei in because he's \"stray\", she geniunely cares and it isn't a one-way street. Rei is a big help to their family.. or rather he is family. Nikaidou is not your typical one-dimensional shounen rival, he has his own reasons for pursuing Rei. Even Takashi has plenty moments where it's apparent his life doesn't revolve around his favorite student. Same goes for every single character in the show, everyone has their own lives to worry about. Thanks to the masterful narrative, everyone feels so real and important and well developed.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really elevates the series to a work of art is its amazing use of visuals and sound. The artstyle is gorgeous and unique. The show makes great use of symbolism without going overboard and becoming too abstract. Visually, this is easily the most impressive anime I've seen so far. Not because the landscape or animation is as pretty as in Made in Abyss or Shingeki no Kyojin, but because it handles tonal shifts and abstraction extremely well and has a unique approach to facial expressions. The soundtrack also does a great job accompanying the switches in atmosphere and is filled with beautiful bittersweet piano tracks.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of negatives, I had no idea what Shogi is so it was hard to appreciate the matches. They were still dramatic and insightful but I'm sure I'd enjoy it a lot more if I actually knew what was going on. It wasn't much of a problem at first but Shogi became more prevalent towards the later episodes so it was a bit of a turn-off. Nikaidou's cute introduction obviously wasn't enough to understand pro matches. Secondly, as cute and lovely the Kawamoto family is, the humour in their household was sometimes cheesy and repetitive. The over the top humour amplified the disparity between Rei's melancholy and happiness but didn't feel real at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Sangatsu no Lion is an amazing show and highly recommended for anyone who wants to witness \"art\" in anime.",

            "content": "3-gatsu no Lion is a rare bird. Unlike many of today\u2019s shows, it eschews fast-paced, action heavy plot in favour of using its characters and their interactions with each other as vehicles to explore themes common to us all. Its reflective tone, stunning visuals, and emotionally-charged music also help set this show apart.\r\nStory\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a no-holds-barred, adrenaline-charged thrill-ride, 3-gatsu no Lion is not the show for you. Few significant events occurred within the show\u2019s 22 episode runtime. This did mean that it dragged from time to time and I was never on the edge of my seat desperate to see what would happennext, particularly as I have no real interest in shogi. However, 3-gatsu no Lion persistently ambled along at a relaxed, steady pace, its focus love and its various expressions, including sharing with each other, be that a hobby/interest, a meal, or a special occasion, and the loneliness that we all feel from time to time as human beings. Whilst these two subjects may seem dichotomous, 3-gatsu no Lion, in a contemplative, thoughtful way, wove them together, reminding us that intense loneliness can be remedied through seeking solace in the people around us. At times it can be nice to watch a more contemplative show such as this. Life can often be draining, with its many pressures and demands. Shows such as this can, therefore, act as a soothing balm to a weary soul, encouraging us to unwind and immerse ourselves in its soft, gentle world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is more character than story-driven. Its characters develop more in their interactions with each other than in response to their circumstances. To me, that is 3-gatsu no Lion\u2019s greatest strength.  It was less about shogi and more about Rei\u2019s poisonous relationship with his adoptive sister, Nikaidou\u2019s one-sided rivalry with Rei (which was often played for comedic effect), Shimada\u2019s sense of obligation towards the people of his hometown, which was both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness, and the Kawamoto sisters\u2019 intense love for each other, which overflowed into love for the lost. And whilst many of these characters\u2019 issues were not resolved, I didn\u2019t feel like that was a problem. I\u2019ve always appreciated the realism of Umino\u2019s works. Sometimes it isn\u2019t possible to wave a magic wand and fix all of your problems, sometimes you will wrestle with an issue for what feels like a lifetime. But, as 3-gatsu no Lion hints, as long as you have the support of the people you love, you can continue to fight without giving up.\\n\\n\r\nArt/music\\n\r\nI absolutely adored 3-gatsu no Lion\u2019s art. Umino\u2019s art and character designs are among my favourite of all manga-artists and have transferred well into the medium of anime. The use of soft, pastel colours, beautiful scenery (that often reminded me of Van Gogh\u2019s The Starry Night), and delicate pen/brush strokes, alongside the show\u2019s contemplative, relaxed pace, combined to give the show a real dream-like feel. And whilst its background music wasn\u2019t especially memorable, the opening and ending tracks were also beautiful and emotionally-charged.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment\\n\r\nWhilst 3-gatsu no Lion\u2019s meandering pace made me feel restless at times, I found the show to be extremely enjoyable overall. It proved that, with a strong enough cast of characters, a show doesn\u2019t need to be full of action to hold your interest. If your cast are interesting and likeable enough, you\u2019ll care about even the most minor details of their lives and the smallest of trials they undergo. And the cast of 3-gatsu no Lion did just that. They had me watching and waiting to see if they could overcome the difficulties that they faced right until the show\u2019s conclusion.",

            "content": "I think I wanted memories of not running away\r\n-rei kiriyama\r\nReviewing one of your favorites shows is hard. I may have already given up in four attempts, when trying to write a coherent review for this. The pressure that comes, with the knowledge of knowing, that what you are writing is not making justice, to the amazing quality the series has in your mind. Coming along with the even worst feeling, the guilty which comes with the though of your flawed attempt turning people off people from the work itself. But as kiryiama, that is quoted here said, I also do not want memories of runningaway even from this responsibility. So let\u2019s go to my review of 3-gatsu no lion.\\n\\n\r\nSo I will start with a rather divisive aspect of this show, the sudden swifts between comedy and drama.  Many consider those jarring, I really like this contrast though, our protagonist is trapped in his own negative and tortured vision of reality, his own problems mostly being created by his own mentality, which in turn only makes then even worst. Making for endless internal monologues about the cruelty of reality, reviving saddest memories possibly in a melancholic tone. But outside of that mentality, there is this world of fun whacky characters, that really look and care about him, their amusing interactions showing him other side this world, being sometimes a relieve and sometimes a burden for his lonely self. Besides what also makes it work, is how the show no matter what emotion it is trying to convey, it goes all out with it, it sincerely wants to make you feel the sadness, the melancholic and the joy, all those uneven emotions that make life worth it, at the same time.  And believe it, I say that as someone that is not that big of a fan of the comedic scenes, those usually were funny and adorable, but not the appeal of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou know discussing the plot in this one is kind of hard. In terms of continuous progressing events there is little of them in this show. What we have here is a completely personal approach to storytelling, this is rei\u2019s journey through and through out (with one noticeable exception), the series goes to great lengths to show exactly that. The person he is, the values he believes, what experiences made him that way, how the interactions with several different characters influenced and still influence him.  The depth of emotions and moments that made his entire life is displayed perfectly. It could be argued this type of storytelling comes to the expense of other characters, since most of the other ones are not as interesting, and that happens in this show, but it is not as prevalent of a problem here, a lot of the characters are still pretty good and unique on their own, and a lot is made to show or imply they all have their own life\u2019s and issues going on, which in turn, makes them way more than devices to move the plot. Also as a side point please people, stop saying this series is about shogi. Sure the game is used as device to showcase some of the character issues, like Kiryama low self-esteem and guilty, for example with the suffer he had when he crushed another character goals, and it has this theme and ambition, and working hard to achieve your goals, not unlike many sports series. But those as the sport itself are never the main focus, the focus is always on the characters their interactions and drama. Hell you really do not need to understand how is shogi is played to watch this, and if you are really infatuated with it, they explain the rules to you\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of plot progression, also ties to another recurrent complaint, hailed against the show, the character development, and the changes in the characters are too slow or nonexistent. The former is simply not true at all, the last episode serving to show how rei\u2019s view of other changed, just compare how much outspoken he is in disagreements in the end of the series, and how the found things he really cares about. The former is mostly true, but that actually is one of the series strengths. Depression is a cycle of highs and lows, there are no easy answers to solve it, every self-betterment, being a struggle for the person. There is no character development for him that comes only with internal motivation, Rei may try to believe he is all right now, that he found motivation and is finally going to move on. And then something happens, he loses the only match he really wanted to win, Kyouko (best girl) comes back to visit him, then he is back at the gutter, feeling even worst this time. Its usage of character regression, is a powerful, but impressive criticism, of a shallow and simple view of the solving of this kind of issue. There are also no answers other characters may give him, Shimada altruism, is at first presented as a solution to rei self-centeredness, that is only a deception though. Later we found out why through several episodes, a negative side of said altruism, the pressure of the responsibility that comes with what he tries to achieve, becoming an obsession that deteriorates his health, and gets in the way of his ability of playing shogi. A truly endless need to rush out things, meaning to him an own personal hell. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing I will concede is really missing in 3-gatsu, it has no central theme tying the whole thing together. Saying a 3-gatsu no lion has no themes or messages, it wants to explore is laughable at best, from family, and how that defines the individual, guilty, knowing how the forgive and accept yourself, the effects of traumatic events, learning to let go of your past, the precedence of human interactions, ambition, the pressure of competition. But I cannot say it all ties back to a central theme. Sure I can easily track guilty as the most prominent one, Rei just blame himself, for everything around him, from the ruining of the relations of his foster family, to the lie that decided what his life was going to be, to the fact he constantly win at shogi a sport he has no idea what it means to him, or if he really cares about it, getting in the way of the inspirations of those that really care about it. He has no means of dealing with that overblown sense of guilty, so he constantly tortures himself in his mind about it, his depression and lack of self-esteem mostly steaming from that.  But no lots of thing like do not have much to do with guilty. In my mind that comes of more like a missed opportunity to have a thematic cohesive work.\\n\\n\r\nYou know the kiriyama quote at the begging of the review is only there for one reason, when rei said that, it become engraved in my mind as the moment I realized this show was going to become one of my favorites. Mind you, not only because I find that particularly sentiment relatable, being someone that was constantly bombarded with the question, why did I continued going to university, I barely took anything out it, sleeping in every class and not talking with anyone at school. But I still kept going to that place, and I could not explain even for myself very well why. And that moment explained what I was feeling way better than I ever could, of course I would never skip classes, how could I justify to myself, the fact I was running away, from the school life I so dearly desired. This show has dozens of this moments that helped to reflect and understand myself better. It gave me the tools I needed to have a better reading and understanding of my reality and is in a lot of ways the catalyst, for the improvement of my situation. And I can never be grateful enough to this show for that, or recommend the show enough for that matter.\\n\\n",

            "content": "3-gatsu no Lion is an absolutely brilliant anime. \r\nI have so much to say but I'll try to be brief. \r\nLet me start off by saying I'm not a shogi fan. I'd never even heard of it before this anime, yet I still managed to enjoy this so much. So, if you're using shogi as a reason to avoid watching this\u2014stop it.\r\nThe anime, although it about shogi, does not entirely focus on the game. Throughout the episodes, it gives us enough information in a easy-to-understand-and-process way, so that even total babies to shogi (ahem, me) understand enough of what's going on. It doesn't overload thisinformation, though, giving the perfect amount, and using the game to present to us a drama anime that works through some of my favourite themes, such as success/failure. \\n\\n\r\nThe story as a whole is written very well. It doesn't focus on a subject too big that the writers end up having to rush just to get it done, and instead it leaves just the right amount of room to take its time in exploring the characters and their lives, and is thus successful in creating an effective ambiance/feeling around the story and drawing us in. I am a sucker for seamless stories, ones that are able to naturally incorporate various things throughout episodes and then ties them all together for a nice finale, and this anime does just that.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, if you appreciate devices such as symbolism, you'll be in for a treat. The animation in this story is already super appealing, but the way this anime uses symbolism made me really giddy. It tells a story not only through events but through its animation, which was really wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'm a huge fan of the main character's interior monologue. It kind of reminds me of The Catcher in the Rye, if you've read it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, definitely give this anime a chance. I can't imagine anyone disliking it (unless, perhaps, you are of a younger age\u2014personally, when I was 10-13 I was more interested in action-packed things\u2014in which case this may not be for you).",

            "content": "Storytelling is not just about the story. It's also about how it is delivered.\r\nWhen I first saw the studio name \"Shaft\" next to \"slice of life\" anime, I was pretty doubtful; Shaft's directing choices are often multi-angled, with various high contrast shots and rapid scene transitions which makes it optimum for mystery and psychological genre. But apparently their approach also fits the \"slice of life\" genre.\r\n3-Gatsu no Lion is a masterpiece in directing; the sound and the shot choices act perfect to deliver the desolation Kiriyama faces as he lives an isolated life, questioning his way of life. This is how to direct an anime.\r\nStory:7/10\\n\r\nWho knew that such a board game can create new insights about life? March Comes in Like a Lion just touches you with just the sense of realism - something that I rarely get in this medium. I feel like that I am in Kiriyama's shoes as I am watching this. And Kiriyama's spiritual growth is perfectly natural and, well the story just seems in touch.\\n\\n\r\nBut then why am I giving this a relatively low score?\\n\r\nMostly due to pacing. Quite a lot feels unresolved after watching the first season (I haven't watch 2nd season so far and I plan to). And Kiriyama's development feels pretty slow. I just felt like that if this entire story was told in 15 episodes rather than 22, it would have resolved this issue. Well, I guess reading the manga might solve the problem for me her.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSolid work from Shaft. Seems like they preserved the original artist's art style too. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI don't think I can immediately find an anime that does better in this field except Bakemonogatari (also by SHAFT). Great openings and endings, and all insert songs and sound effects are placed perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nAll just feel REAL. I can relate to them. And they have scars like regular human beings.\\n\r\nI am giving an 8 for now because it doesn't feel like that the characters haven't been fully explored yet. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story does start to feel little repetitive after a certain point; there are just to many shogi matches to count. I just didn't feel like that the first season ended in the right part. \\n\r\nAnd most importantly, I am just not a big fan of slow paced anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nA masterpiece in directing choices. But slow pacing could have been improved. It kinda felt a little repetitive near the end. Nice slow paced story for slice-of-life fans. I think I need to get to 2nd season before being fully able to rate this anime.\\n\\n\r\nTL DR; Realistic anime with great directing choices. The slow-pacing might upset people not accustomed to this type of anime. Too early to judge as this story does not feel complete with just 1st season.",

I also hope that it can solve all the doubts that have been opened in the series (since it does not have an ending in which nothing concludes in genreal).",

It works best when it's either especially dramatic, or focusing on the warm, but somewhat melancholic relationship between the sisters and Rei. The (to me) most intresting aspect was Reis incredibly negative relationship with his \"sport\", something you rarely see, and defenetly not that well done. That being said, the show kind of fell apart it's second half. I thinkup to the introduction of his Mentor everything still had enaugh focus, but afterwards, the story shifted it's focus way more to Reis school life, which had been mostly glossed over before, and basicly wraps that up in a happy ending in like 4 episodes. The conflict between him, his sister and his dad is dangling in the wind, the 3 sisters never talk to him about it (on screen).... The whole last episode shows reis relationship with shogi in only a positive light, as if it only brought him good things. There wasn't enough time spent on his changing  emotions towards it. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\\n\r\nPretty good, only the toddler looked a bit...wierd... at times. Some of the positive imagery alsso looked too goofy/childich at times, and didn't mesh well with the darker images of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\\n\r\nCan't really judge the soundtrack, seemed mediocer. The voice actors on the other hand...most of them were consistently okay, though often overeager. Even in happy moments, more toned down acting would have helped the atmosphere a lot. Rei'S voice actor sounds really great when he's contemplating or talking while holding back or calm, but way to old whenever he has to be loud or energetic. A younger voice would have propably been more convincing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6)\\n\\n\r\nSince i like to suffer, i enjoyed most of it quite a lot! Especially the 3 sisiters and rei's interactions were great, and the dramatic stuff. But the aprupt and unfitting end, that didn't ty up most of the storys, as well as the implied incest love story /thing/ made me enjoy it a lot less then i should have. It defenetly had more potential, wich only serves to make me angry. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nStill propably the best anime of that season. If you like characterdriven, moody slice of live Dramas, you should have a good time - or at least something pretty to look at",

            "content": "After the first 3 episodes i could already say, with big security, that this was going to be one of my favourite animes.\r\nThe story. I can\u2019t say for certain what caught my eye with the story, since it\u2019s a slice of life. I\u2019ve always loved this genre and the calmness behind it, which was very well portrayed throughout the anime.\r\nThe awesome first-person narration manages to describe, without explicit telling, exactly what goes through Rei\u2019s mind and his feelings at the moment. I could even say that every line has some kind of poetic depth to it, with the main focus being the confusion and sadnessof the character. The addition of the three sisters in contrast to Rei\u2019s apparent depression was a big yes for me, along with the no-romance path this first season took, showing that a slice of life can be very joyful and entertaining even without a dramatic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe art. I wasn\u2019t used to Shaft\u2019s drawing style, (and i had a problem specially with the mouths) - not meaning that it\u2019s poorly drawn. But characters\u2019 aside, the art with the background, the city and mainly the expressive way of showing Rei\u2019s feelings with distinct images, added a huge depth to the story. In this anime, i must say narration and art had a complementary relationship. That perfect mix gave me chills during some parts of it! Simply a piece of art in storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds. Aside mundane sounds and narration in general, nothing else caught my attention in special. Notice that anime didn\u2019t require much of it, and when it did, it was a perfect job overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters, as mentioned, were a good mix in contrast. The three sister\u2019s home being Rei\u2019s safe place added a warmth tone to the story that the main character was lacking, due to all his emotional scarring. Calmness was noticeable with all the characters. But there was constant sadness within Rei and even the sisters, even though they were portrayed as the safe zone and contrast to Rei. Another example of the explendid of narration lays right on this point. The emotional baggage with all of them was so unbearable it could almost be palpable. Merging with the joyful scenes between them in the sisters\u2019 house, it was discreet, the \u201celephant in the room\u201d. Not talked about, but seen, felt.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m including \u201cenjoyment\u201d and \u201coverall\u201d scales in this last topic. This anime was sowmthing to pay attention and just feel. It didn\u2019t require you to do anything else. A mere art to be enjoyed. Although, i have to admit it got tiring on some episodes, for example the ones with only shogi talk, it was probably fun for those who knew the game, but that wasn\u2019t my case. Overall, i hope you guys had a nice ass time watching this, because i did!",

Something like \"UUAAARRUUUUHH URURURUR HAAAA\" sounds like a chimp right ? Studio Shaft is being shaft again making this amaaaaazing anime, seriously shaft you are too perfect.\r\nI'm not gonna lie (in april :P) this is not for everyone, if you are a younger viewer and you haven't had your fair share of traumas andthe loss of a loved one (I hope you never do but life is rarely goes so easy on people, you will probably experience a regret or loss or both that when you remember it your blood and body freeze, for me it was the death of people and pets you love one after the other in a short amount of time, it was like Grim Reaper decided to hang around me but I digress) you might not really understand the main character or the overall feelings of the characters. Or if you have an energetic personality and don't like long conversations you will not enjoy this anime to the fullest. This anime is like reading a very very good book. You need to be patient and calm to enjoy its full potential.\\n\r\nIf you didn't like the anime now, try rewatching it after a couple of years, when you think you became patient and calm enough to enjoy a cup of tea while looking at a nice view without twitching.

It's the one genre that is seemingly immune to poor reviews, simply because as long as the show is comforting, then it'll get a good score. I particularly like it when slice-of-life intersects with progress. Last year's Comic Girls did that, as well as Barakamon a few years back.\r\nOne of my first favorites when I became an anime junkie was Hikaru no Go, which also centered around a competitive board game. With 75 eps and a controversial ending, it has largely faded from memory today. But it was enjoyable, and Hikaru had significant growth throughoutits run.\\n\\n\r\nMarch Comes in Like a Lion explores much of Rei's past. But I felt empty when the show didn't use this past to really affect the person he is now. And at the end, I felt the same way he did. Nothing much got accomplished during S1, and I didn't feel Rei had grown as a person. Instead, he was still wallowing in self-pity. Without significant progress, S1 felt like a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't help that the humor in the episodes felt completely forced, as the artstyle turns into chibi silliness. This is supposed to relieve the view from the seriousness of Rei's depression, but I felt it was out of place and more annoying than how it was used in Your Lie in April.\\n\\n\r\nHikaru no Go inspired a generation to learn Go, including more than a handful of western fans at anime conventions. I don't think March Comes in Like a Lion will do the same with Shogi. I hope S2 impresses, I really do. But S1 was a slog to get through with its strange chibi takes and generally inconsequential cast.",

            "content": "I have a love/hate relationship with drama anime. Maybe not the genre, but a theme I see in most of them. Cause I have noticed that I can kind of separate drama shows into two parts. Ones that don\u2019t have jokes, and those who do. Maybe this can seem kind of weird, but I have some examples. We have shows like \u201cA Silent Voice\u201d, \u201cDarling in the Franxx\u201d and (Maybe) \u201cViolet Evergarden\u201d. All of these have jokes in them, but they are far and few between. I could tell that they didn\u2019t want to make a comedic show. \r\nBut then we have shows like \u201cYourLie in April\u201d and \u201cAnohana\u201d, who have a lot of jokes. And while it isn\u2019t necessarily bad to have jokes in a drama show, I find that most jokes in these shows don\u2019t fit well with the dramatic aspects.\\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, \u201cMarch Comes in like a Lion\u201d is one of those show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMarch comes in like a lion, directed by Akiyuki Shinbou who also directed Bakemonogatari, other Monogatari seasons and Nisekoi, is a really good show. It has some really good music and a pretty unique art style. But unfortunately, I found some parts of it to be boring (There, I said it). When the show is really serious or cute, it is really enjoyable to watch. The Kawamoto family\u2019s interactions were really enjoyable. Making food or just talking, it was all really fun.\\n\r\nAnd similarly, the more psychological parts of the show were also really enjoyable. We get to see how sad and afraid Rei is and how he realizes that when he finds a place he can be happy. It is probably my favorite part since it is where Kai Shimada, my favorite character in the series, gets a lot more development. \\n\\n\r\nBut whenever the shows do something different, I just found it boring. There were entire scenes that were \u201ccomedic\u201d. But I didn\u2019t find it to be funny, and it just dragged the show. At least that\u2019s how I felt.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut at the end of the day, I really liked the show. Except for some of the flaws I had (Too many comedic scenes, some cheesy animation, too much \u201csaying what you think\u201d, some underdeveloped characters and parts where I wanted it to be more subtle) it was a very high-quality show. It has a pretty unique art style, the music is great, some very memorable characters and a fantastic ending IMO.\\n\\n\r\nSo even though I didn\u2019t find it to be a masterpiece like many people think (Which is fine, no one's opinion is worth more than someone else\u2019s), I can understand why it is such a loved show. I\u2019m going to give this show a weak 8/10",

            "content": "\u201cSangatsu no lion\u201d is an anime with a focus all over the place. It isn\u2019t really a good \u201cdrama\u201d anime neither is it a good \u201cseinen\u201d anime, its shogi aspects is also sometimes rather forgotten and taken aside to have lots of slice of life comedy moments. Especially at the beginning there is probably 20% drama and 80% comedy.  So if you came to see a mature take on a sports anime with drama and a lot of maturity, in the fashion of something like \u201cPing pong the animation\u201d, \u201csangatsu no lion\u201d isn\u2019t really the show you were looking for. However it does createa very light hearted atmosphere and was easy to watch even for someone who didn\u2019t really like the comedy all too much.  And it gets progressively better.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses around a young high school student who became a professional shogi player. He lives alone in his apartment and has, at the start a very mysterious backstory, which is presented to be very tragic and we should feel sorry for him. The story starts of very one sided, with everything happening out of the perspective of the protagonist and many other character come around as rather one-dimensional because we know too little about them. This was fixed later on by adding backstories to side character as well to make them more interesting. There is also a clear distinction between characters, that are always in comedy scenes and character who mostly are involved in the drama part of the show. This approach is better than to just simply include every character in silly comedy to a point where you can\u2019t take anything they do serious anymore (like in FMA brotherhood), but it still raises the question\u2026 why include both?\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really think that drama and comedy work well together. One of the 2 has to suffer in order for the other one to succeed. This could really be seen in this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe drama aspect of the show seemed to be just there to make the protagonist interesting, for me however it didn\u2019t work and I found him rather bland with a backstory similar to so many other. That\u2019s the main reason I really welcomed the later included focus on side character and their relationship to the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe shogi aspect is merely a tool and not too deeply focused. It took them 8 episodes to introduce the basic rules of the game to the audience, but then again, if the show thinks you just learned about the game it is understandable that it doesn\u2019t go into any deeper analysis into professional shogi games. That\u2019s probably why it was missing completely in this anime. For me this was a bit disappointing to see. The anime also didnt really manage to build up much of a tension with their shogi games (espeically at the start), but it gets better the more episodes you watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe slice of life aspect seemed to be the most focused one, at least at the start. What they basically wanted to achieve was to take this introverted main character who only focuses on shogi and has a sad past and put him in a goofy environment with 3 sister who mainly function as comedic relieve. The reason for all of this is also very random, which sets it very much apart from everything else that happens in the show. I found none of these comedic relieve characters to be in any way relatable or interesting and the comedy felt very typical and unfunny (with a weird fetish around cats, which also didn\u2019t do it for me). It tries to be self aware with characters constantly referencing how this and that looks like an anime or a manga, but this was just used to create cheap laughs and nothing more. \\n\r\nHowever the whole start is very light hearted and because you still have quite a bit of shogi story aspects is wasn\u2019t too much of a chore to go through to reach the more interesting part of the story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound design wasn\u2019t really well done. The voice acting was ordinary, but the soundtrack was really not existent beyond forgettable background songs. There was one fine piano track at some point but it was very quickly forgotten.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very weird. The characters have huge mouths and often large eyes to make them look cute (a bit different from typical anime character eyes) , but they sometimes look like cgi characters. You will get used to the art style and not notice it too much but at first it kinda annoyed me. Backgrounds were nicely drawn and I found it nice that they depicted the real design of the shogi hall building in Tokyo. \\n\\n\r\nFor all the bad things I had to say about this anime I still have to add that I enjoyed watching it. Its story is engaging and grips you into it. It\u2019s somewhat relatable and in many ways down to earth (at least compared to other anime).  It could have been a lot better but for what it is worth it can introduce a lot of people in the fascinating world of shogi. \\n",

            "content": "Summary: Gripping, touching, and relatable look into growing up, 3-gatsu no Lion (Season 1 & 2) is a must-see Slice-of-Life Seinen show, for any who are patient enough for its dialogue-heavy nature. Its storytelling is on par with the best that anime currently has to offer, and is one of the most relevant stories to young adults that has been recently told.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe protagonist, Rei Kiriyama, is a shy, quiet, and reserved person. Many an issue plague him throughout his life, which proves to test his resolve greatly. The story follows Rei in his journey through his life as a professional shogi player, and alsohis many personal trials and tribulations outside of his shogi matches. A very simple premise, but one that is told both beautifully and realistically. Newcomers to this series should beware that it is a very dialogue-heavy show, rife with characterization and gradual plot progression. The shogi aspect of the story may feel somewhat boring or monotonous for those who are not familiar with it, but they are done well enough to immerse the viewer from the very first time. When one digs deeper, however, the themes behind this narrative are truly beautiful, and relevant. Rei's battle with depression and his subsequent triumphs speak volumes about perseverance, while the Kawamotos lend to the importance of having a support structure through life. Rei's relationship with shogi accurately represents life's unforgiving nature, and further reinforce the importance of persistence. This is just scratching the surface of the many statements that the narrative makes! This all being said, it is not a show that any anime fan can sit through and stay engaged in. If you are into character-driven, realistic fiction narratives, then this show is right up your alley. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nFrom the first moment of the show, the distinctive art style is prominent. Personally, I have never seen an anime with an art/animation style quite like 3-gatsu no Lion. It may take some adjustment at first, but by the end it's likely to have grown on you immensely, as it did for me. Not only are the character designs almost perfectly faithful to the manga, but it is very clear that the manga's use of visuals as symbolism is taken to an entirely new level in the anime adaptation. The use of colors and cutscene-like  simulations (dramatized versions of characters' thoughts on screen) scattered throughout each episode are used brilliantly in conveying the tone of the scenes. Backgrounds are always clean and well-done, and not a trace of CG animation was used when animating the characters, even for scenes with large crowds.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nPerfection. From voice acting, to OST/OP/ED songs, to background noise, 3-gatsu no Lion shines as an example of the highest quality of production that anime has to offer, among the best ever produced. Characters are brought to life with profound beauty and emotion, with no exceptions. Rei, the Kawamoto sisters, and Kyouko are particularly well-embodied by their voice actors, perfectly balancing their characters' emotional ranges and effectively conveying them to the viewer. Accompanying the quality voice acting is thoroughly realistic ambient noise, which essentially sounds identical to the real world. It was made abundantly clear that every cup being put on a table, every door being closed/opened, had quality work behind it. While other shows may skimp on these minute details, 3-gatsu no Lion shows once again that it is of the highest quality of anime. The show's music is beautiful in its own right, but is also used as yet another way to convey the tone of the narrative. The two opening songs, for example, contrast each other in tone and visuals, the former being more negative/depressing, and the latter taking a lighter tone (reflecting the progress Rei makes in his life and in his battle against depression). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nIn any anime series I've seen (including other great shows, such as \"A Place Further Than the Universe\" and \"Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu\"), I have never experience characters that are as well-developed, realistic, and complex as in 3-gatsu no Lion. While other series' may only flesh out their main characters, time is taken to develop each prominent character of the show. This characterization is done subtly, over time for most of the main cast, including Rei, his family, the Kawamotos, Kai Shimada and Nikaidou. The seeds of suspicion are planted early after each character's introduction, through dialogue and behavior, and later expanded upon in flashbacks which rarely obstruct the narrative of the episode. The result is characterization that does not only feel realistic, but also natural. In short, each character feels like they could be a real person. Each character is complex and distinct, in both behavior and backstory, with Momo being the main (obvious) exception.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAs someone who enjoys getting to know characters, and being immersed in a narrative (maybe even forgetting it's fiction periodically), this show was great to sink my teeth into. With a hefty episode count, and plenty of quality narrative material to absorb, it was one of the best anime I've seen. This being said, my unfamiliarity with shogi made some scenes harder to get through than others. I found the scenes exploring Rei's relationships with his adoptive family and the Kawamotos, his new \"unofficial\" family, among the most enjoyable and believable fiction I've experienced, but the shogi scenes often made my interest drop until the ends, where the results of the games were revealed. For this reason alone, I could not rate it perfectly. This being said, it did not detract from my experience nearly enough to keep me from rating it less than a Masterpiece overall. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nIf you especially character-driven shows, I couldn't think of a better anime to watch than this one. The episode count is on the higher side for slice-of-life, especially by today's standards, so be prepared to pace yourself. This is a beautiful, touching story that I believe everyone should experience, if they have the time and patience.",

            "content": "(woah woah woah, everything is a 10 but the overall is a 9 ? the explanation is at the end of review. )\r\nFirst and foremost, I truly believe this anime to be a masterpiece and is definitely worth your time. In fact, you should go watch the show right now. If you are still skeptical, I hope this review can change your mind. I believe that you should experience the whole story yourself so I will only be giving the minimal amount of information about the setting of the story.  \r\nMarch comes in like a lion revolves around the daily life (and the developmentas a person) of a professional shogi (Japanese chess) player , a young 17 year old boy  - Kiriyama Rei. On his journey to escape his past he met the Kawamoto family in an unfamiliar town, from there his life started to change bit by bit\u2026.\\n\r\nI don\u2019t consider the show to be slice of anime, at least not in the same vein as K-on or Lucky Star, to me, the show is more of a hardcore drama. It can also be considered a sport anime in the same way Ping Pong the animation is one. Some may say the shogi scenes are boring but I think they only add to the show. Shogi matches are merely an excuse to see the interactions between our MC with the supporting characters and a tool used to develop both Rei and his opponent. The characters in this show, especially Rei and the three sisters of the Kawamoto family are very realistic. Their stories are like the lives of someone out there living in the real world being told to us. The depths of the supporting characters are nothing to scoff at either; you\u2019ll clearly see this fact through the previously mentioned shogi matches. It is incredibly enjoyable to watch the growth and maturity Rei gains throughout the series. The character writing in this series is simply superb. \\n\r\n At it\u2019s core, March comes in like a lion is not a shogi anime, it\u2019s a coming-of-age anime, a story about overcoming depression, loneliness and traumas. Don\u2019t come into the show expecting all smiles and rainbows. Something I also really like about the show is how it\u2019s also a powerful tale about the struggle of becoming successful and what it actually entails. I think many people can relate to this at some kind of level. This was made apparent in the 10th episode of the show but I won\u2019t go much further into details, you\u2019ll just have to trust me on this unless you want this master piece be spoiled to you.\\n\r\nHaving the same author as Honey and Clover does really show through the art style and character designs. She has a unique and distinct style that can make some scenes so sweet that you\u2019ll get diabetes but can also make the characters so much more emotional and heavy. The anime is adapted by Shaft, famous for their creative, innovative and experimental adaptation for the Monogatari series. As a manga reader myself, I have seen many of my fellow readers vehemently \u201chating\u201d on Shaft being the studio who will adapt this manga of the same name. Their arguments being: Shaft\u2019s style does not fit with this manga and so on. However, Shaft being the studio of choice for the author herself; have pulled through yet again with their artful and stylish yet still very genuine animations. Shaft made the transition between the more slow, dark and heavy shogi scenes with the more light hearted and comfortable scenes so seamless, which is a remarkable feat. Dare I say that the soundtrack of March comes in like a lion is one of the best in recent times. It is incredibly gorgeous; the heavy-hitting tracks that are sparsely used always instill very complex emotions into me. You only really need to watch the opening episode to see this. I enjoyed all of the Openings and Endings, they matched well with the show.\\n\r\nThe show does have slow pacing at times and the dialogues are heavy (very fitting for Shaft). The show does take quite a while to pick up it\u2019s pace, but if you have the patience, you\u2019ll greatly be rewarded. March comes in like a lion currently does not have a conclusive ending end won\u2019t have one for a long time as the source material is also still running. There still many plot points unresolved, but fear not, FOR I AM HERE, the second season of the show (coming October 2017).\\n\r\nSo in the end, how good is March comes in like a lion ? To me it\u2019s the only thing that had such a huge impact on me in recent times since Aria and Space Brothers. I\u2019m giving it a 9.5/10 and I\u2019m only withholding the 10/10 for future sequels, since I already know as a manga reader that the series is only getting better from here. \\n\r\nPS: Kawamoto sisters and owl cats.  \\n",

I think that just for an anime about a game the matches were more spectacular and fascinating than in most shounen anime. Lead of the series Kiryiama Rei is not only appealing with his personality but also with his character development throughout the series. I recommend it to people who like darker and more psychological kind of anime. But it isn't just dark all the time. With some of its lighter moments it brings a nice contrast that'sintriguing to watch. So fellow anime watchers just watch it =)",

            "content": "There is no spoilers.\r\nReview will be changed when this show will be completely aired.\r\nStory:\r\nThere is not actually a story about something specific. Yes, there a sort of dark drama or something but in fact it's just about daily life of some people, their relationships and a little bit of stupid humor. In one word: A typical Shaft Studio's anime. Very similar to every show by them.\r\nArt:\r\nShaft knows their work. Art is very awesome, stylish and very close to original manga. But I have a really weird feeling when I see faces from \"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso\" and that loli face from Miyazaki's animations.\r\nSound:\r\nOf courseI love Kana's voice and the music is nice but the main protagonist's tone sounds like Araragi's even there is another voice actor. Shinbo never changes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThey're okay but not impressive except a main protagonist's stepsister. She is really awesome. I felt how something is screaming in myself when I saw her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt's very easy to watch for me but you need to know this is Shinbo Akiyuki's work. A lot of meaningless frames, autsim and meditation. You need to like these things if you want to watch Shaft's anime.\\n\r\nAnd the humor is really stupid. Honestly, it is not funny I swear you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTo be honest, I can recommend this show if only you're a Shaft's fan. If you not - better read the manga. I read the first pages and they are much better in my opinion. That's all, I guess.",

            "content": "I have been avoiding this anime for like two years now, thinking it was \"Oh... another silly melodrama\". So, I waited until the anime was finished airing, then I checked out a few clips of it and thought maybe it wouldn't be as bad as I thought. It turns out in some ways, I was right, there were a couple of overemotional parts but the anime in general was fairly decent. I was worried about how the story would turn out from the beginning.\r\nThe anime is more like a Kyoani anime, since you have your male protagonist meet and befriend some girls. It has alittle melodrama in it, but it doesn't try to pull at your emotions as often as a typical Kyoani anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything really special. It's about this orphaned shogi player with a traumatic family background and he struggles with socializing and depression. It tends to be too slow-paced and struggles with inconsistent pacing. The first like 10 episodes of the series has Rei bonding with these three girls named Akari, Hinata, and Momo, but the rest of the series is about shogi and Rei withdraws from the girls more. One of the good things about the series is Rei's bondage with the three girls, the girls were my favorite character but in the teen episodes, the series throws that out the window and the girls are reduced to side characters. Add in a little excessive drama but we'll get to that with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe show mainly focuses on Rei and to a lesser extent, Akari, Hinata, and Momo (before the teen episodes, that is). After that, the show starts focusing more on Rei's relationship with the secondary characters who didn't get much screentime during Rei's bondage with the girls. Those are Rei's family and his shogi associates. Rei is an okay character, it took me a lot of time for him to grow on me. He's a quiet character who struggles with depression which can make him come off as a crybaby to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe three girls are adorable and they provide the levity and light-heartedness of the show and that's why they're my favorites. They're a good balance to the gloomy melodrama of Rei's life. They are also resilient, strong, caring people who are going through a hard time too but take each day as it comes and I respect that in characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the secondary characters who Rei interacts with beside the girls, they don't really get much development. I remember Nikaido and Kyouko getting a little development and backstory but they are still weak characters as they do not get that much backstory or character development as to why they're the way they are so I couldn't sympathize or relate to them. They both just come off as arrogant, loud characters to me. So, overall, the secondary characters are weak and not compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is the most beautiful, realistic I have ever seen in anime. Shaft's quality could rival that of Kyoani's art and animation. I do remember the character designs in the beginning were inconsistent since some of them didn't really fit the scenery but that was brief so that's forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this anime? Maybe, it's not for everyone. It's not great but it was fairly decent to me. It turned out better than I thought it would be but I do think that the anime should've laid off some of the melodrama it had. I would rate it like a 6.4./10.",

            "content": "My score: 9/10\r\nWhat it deserves: 7-8/10\r\nWhy the difference? Prepare yourselves, for this is going to get deep.\r\n3gatsu covers something that not many anime have done; life. Plain and simple, without over exaggerating somebody's pain or having angst upon angst, without trying to force you into liking any one specific character.\r\nI still remember the opening episode. It was dark, and morbid, and it felt heavy and gloomy and dreary. And then, suddenly, Momo appeared, followed by the other sisters, and their squishy cats and the gentle happiness that always surrounds them and light entered my soul. \r\nAnd THAT is exactly what is so darn beautiful about3-gatsu, as well as the way Shaft has interpreted it; you feel gloomy when they want you to feel gloomy and happy when they want you to feel happy. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the reason I'm pointing this out is because usually, in anime, they try too hard to get you to feel something, and it backfires entirely. Many a time have I watched something that was clearly meant to be touching but I just felt myself clamming up and cringing. In other words, controlling the emotions of the watcher in the palm of the creator's hands is an incredibly rare power very few anime possess.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, with that opening episode, Shaft has indeed hypnotized us, but they don't abuse it. It is, as I said, about life, and hence, very often, there are long stretches of nothing, of boredom (not because the show is boring, but because you feel the emptiness that the characters feel), loneliness, and that only makes those little energetic moments all the more powerful.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nOne could basically classify 3-gatsu as a slice-of-life. And it is that, in essence. So originality of story isn't really up for discussion here. And yet it's so much more. I found the story to be so simple, so basic, and yet the way they portrayed it, it felt like everyday was a struggle, everything had importance, nothing happened without a reason. And somehow, it made me...treasure this reality so much more. Things that seem so utterly insignificant to others; when you're trying your best but no one else sees it... understanding that it matters to YOU. In essence that's what this is about, and by gosh that is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSo I suppose, rather than the story, the story TELLING is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nYou blink and every character is a stereotype, then you blink again and suddenly, every character is raw and complicated and real. You're so swept away in the moments, that when hundreds of them pass and you look back, you'll see just how much everything has developed, that everything was leaving a mark. And that's how it is in life, and why reality is always so much more complicated than in anime; because things are always and forever developing, even without us noticing. Only months later do we see any actual results.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu doesn't just develop our lead shortcake, Rei Kiriyama, but everyone. And this happens through the eyes of Rei, and what makes that so powerful is that it develops the side characters WHILE developing Rei simultaneously. \\n\r\nNow that, is something special.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWhen I heard Shaft was producing, I immediately told myself I'd never watch it. With their flashy colors and textures and random striking of poses, I thought I'd never be able to take anything the characters said seriously. And with a story by Chika Umino, characters are everything. \\n\\n\r\nBut then I watched the opening song, strangely enough, and their directing of it was so unique, exactly what I'd thought the story to be like. And then I watched it, dreading the worst, but it was nothing short of beautiful. Staying loyal to the manga's original artwork while throwing in dashes of their own style, Shaft managed to put their directing to use, and what resulted was a story that flowed and involved and hooked the audience with a style that can still only belong to Shaft. \\n\\n\r\nShaft, well done for reading the atmosphere and calming down on the head tilts. Standing O.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nFull justice was done here. Openings, endings, the OST in general; Everything fit to enhance the effect of the main goal - making the characters shine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I didn't give it a 10 was not because I didn't tear up (this is usually my prerequisite for a show. If it made me cry, with no other obvious faults, I give it a 10), because feels this show does not lack. Rather it was because indeed, sometimes, it got too gloomy and scenes would drag out; an issue I'm sure is not present in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is also why 3-gatsu probably won't be watched by the masses; it IS gloomy. It IS drawn out, and perhaps melodramatic at times. And I'd have to agree with you - or at least, the me at episode 7-ish would. \\n\\n\r\nSee, I entered the show, and I only thought 'wow, okay, dark, dark, gloomy, gloomy'; and yet I continued to watch. I don't know what it was - maybe it was Momo, with her teeny dress and leggings; maybe it was those annoying cats; maybe it was the fantastic opening theme (which I never skipped), maybe it was the way Rei tried so hard all the time, with a subliminal kindness no one could see and yet nothing worked... \\n\\n\r\nWhatever it was, I was well into the show before I realized - hang on. \\n\r\nThis is.... really quite beautiful.\\n",

            "content": "In spite of our sorrows the world will constantly move, never stopping to even consider our feelings, as if it wishes to be cruel to us. Even people around us will go on with their lives. Even during our darkest times, there will be people around us who are happy. And the opposite stands equally true. This is a universal truth. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around our personal joys and miseries. A San Gatsu no Lion truly understands.\r\nA masterwork of visual storytelling, San Gatsu no Lion is ready to showcase the deep, heavy atmosphere the show often has the showcase along with unyielding hoyand glee. Our protagonist Rei is a truly broken human being. When left alone to his thoughts, Rei\u2019s overwhelmingly dark and toxic view of the world shown through brilliant dialogue and accentuated through the visuals. The visuals become melancholic. Yet the moment another person appears in before of him, his thoughts are forcibly changed. For that moment his perception of the word is shattered and the visuals take a warmer more loving tone. This is just one aspect of how the show masterfully uses it\u2019s medium to drive home the power of the script and the feelings of its characters. The First 11 minutes of the show\u2019s first episode barely has any speech, yet you can learn more about the character in this show just from the visuals alone, than you could have learned from just monologue.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in San Gatsu no Lion are nothing short of wonderful. From the lovable Kawamoto siblings to all minor character that appear in the show all have distinct and believable personalities. The main character Rei is a well realized character who the audience will feel very easily attached to. Clever, well written dialogue quickly establishes characters and even one off characters are able to garner empathy. By the end every notable character becomes someone you can genuinely care for.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically the show is unmistakably unique and truly beautiful. There isn\u2019t any show that looks quite like it. This extends to the character designs which are also unique. Extra care is put into the character\u2019s facial expression in order to convey emotion. The use of both light vibrant colors and dark sadder colors are also done perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSan Gatsu no Lion understands joy as well as it understands sadness. It never allows itself to be intolerably depressing. Similar to our everyday life the characters of San Gatsu no Lion face both joy and sorrow, drama is contrasted with humor, lethargy is contrasted with enthusiasm and caution is contrasted with optimism.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of San Gatsu no Lion is truly warm. It doesn\u2019t allow people in it to wallow in their own sorrow, instead it basks everyone who wishes to be a part of it with unbridled affection. Every life has its own ups and downs. That doesn\u2019t mean that the joys of others cannot wash away your sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nThis massive wall of text does not even begin to describe my affection nor the sheer greatness of the show. If you are looking for a character focused drama that can reach the hearts of the coldest cynic there honestly aren\u2019t many other shows that are of this caliber.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 (I want to give Rei a hug and Hina a pat on the head)",

            "content": "3 Gatsu no lion review\r\nA lesson about life told through shogi matches.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story revolves around a 17 years old 5th dan shogi player Rei. First i will explain what is shogi since this show focused on that. Shogi is japanese chess and the usual goal of the game is for one player to checkmate their opponent's king winning the game. Thus, the aim of the game is to checkmate their opponent before their opponent manages to do so.Each player has the same number of pieces and each piece moves according to a specific rule.\r\nThe story in 3 gatsu no lion is told from theperspective of our main character and his development through the shogi matches.\\n\r\nOne of the themes this show abords it's coming of an age portrayed by our main character Rei. We are shown how Rei is forced from a young age to face life's challenges and his struggle to overcome them through shogi.\\n\r\nShogi is everything that he got and shogi portrays his identity as a individual in the society.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime portrays the human weakness and focuses on it through our characters who have different experiences through their shogi matches. Every person needs a goal, a guiding light to show them their right place in the society and the message is conveyed to the viewer with the help of the symbolic animation art that enforces it.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also tells us about having a mentor , a person to admire that can help you as a individual and motivate you to do your best next time.Also that mentor becomes the bridge that connects you to your goal and helps you cross the big sea of struggles so you won't drawn or get lost halfway.\\n\\n\r\nAlso this anime tells us about a common thing every human has in his life, it's a place we all return after a hard day, a place were somebody is waiting for you with a smile and a hot meal, yeah we all know the feeling it's a place we all call HOME.Like our main character who was struggling to find his own place , after meeting those 3 sisters he found a place he genuinely calls \"a warm blanket\". This also portrays some of our human weakness that we need to rely on someone to face the hardships of life, be it friends, family, lover or total strangers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat brings a fresh air to the story is the symbolic animation art used to emphasize the story and characters. The moving train symbolizes the life of our characters , they travel to a new destination which represents a new challenge in life and each stop represents struggles that they must overcome. Upon reaching the final station which is their destination ,their goal from the beginning, aboard the train they meet new people that fill the empty chair beside them called experience and learn and progress as a individual in a society.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion the anime portrays different emotional stages of human life like loneliness, goal, a place to belong to call it home, dreams, through our characters actions and influence across the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nWe have a variety of characters that have unique traits and personalities everything symbolized by the stuning animation art.They are the shogi pieces on our table that protect and help the \" ou\" Rei through our story.\\n\\n\r\nRei is the main character and the story is told from his point of view and through his shogi matches experiences. When facing weak or strong oponent we learn more about his personality and him as a individual who develops and learns new emotions like fear, envy, hatred,love, betrayal, anger. Also shogi for him was his only place that he can find peace of mind and his trueself. Shogi helped him to overcome his painfull childhood and his loneliness by filling up the empty chair beside him. Through shogi he found and meet new people and experienced different stages of life.\\n\\n\r\nKyouka is Rei adoptive sister and the perfect phrase to describe her is \"a beautifull lightning on a sunny day that brings rain\". It refers to her unstable personality and shows us her weakness as a human. She is cynical and sometimes cares for Rei in her own way that she express it. She has a weak side that shows only to Rei and this makes her more realistic as a character and human being.\\n\\n\r\nShimada is Rei mentor and the new experience in his life that changes him. His meeting with him changes Rei and helps him to care more about the people around him. Also his influence across the story is significant. He is the one who cracks open Rei's head and wakes him up . His presence is suffocating like Rei describes him , he is the silent type but when in a shogi match his true form is revealed which is of a great player and teacher for the young generations.\\n\\n\r\nThe three sisters Akari, Hina, and the adorable Momo, are the best supporting characters for Rei that help him develop across the story. The sisters through their actions and reactions show to the viewer how enjoyable and sad life can be. Despite their own circumstances they always help Rei and welcome him to their house with a hot meal and a smile. A place that Rei calls \"a warm blanket\".\\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters contribute to the development of our main character Rei and are used very well by the anime for the story and plot.The school sensei who helpes Rei and guides him when he is depressed and cant make a decision. Also he is his only friend at school.Nikaido who is the self proclaimed friend of Rei which brings a comic relief to the story and helps Rei in his own way too.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9/10 \\n\r\nStunning visuals and animation art that captivates the mind and soul of the viewer. The symbolic animation art is used to emphasize the characters personalities and emotional state.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening song and ending are lit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nSome parts of the show i have to admit were plain, some were captivating and some were amazing and full of feels and lessons about life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 \\n\r\nTo conclude i will say this: life is like a moving train were we all go on board, experience and meet new people that change us and our surroundings and finally reach the final destination our goal in life. This is the message that 3 gatsu no lion convey to us through that simple and yet interesting shogi match.",

            "content": "About this series: 3-Gatsu No Lion is a series of depicting various forms of art. It starts off with a seventeen-year old\u2019s pilgrimage. His mission was to aim for the best. Soon, we realize that this isn\u2019t a pilgrimage but a train filled with people that connect to each other with shogi. Shogi is a form of communication between two individuals. What makes this series special is that it isn\u2019t only competitive but also heartwarming and filled with messages throughout our real life. We also get to witness that professional shogi players sacrifice their position in life and devote themselves to shogi. In this series,the main character faces him, society, and others to cross the border of solitude. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story progresses in a steady pace that equally matches with the message carried along with it. It would be best to describe the story as similar as the first opening theme song because the main character keeps on sinking and being dragged by the ocean until someone pulls him from being drowned eternally. The ocean pulling him to the abyss can be symbolized as the shackles of disapproval, insecurity, and expectation. The person that pulls him from drowning can also be symbolized as the bonds and trust made with others.  Each chapter seemed to fit along perfectly each other as similar as filling a puzzle; drama to set up an atmosphere, competitive shogi battles that keeps us on the edge of our seats, and the tiny bits of connection to the audiences made by emphasizing with the main character\u2019s experience. Although the series felt like it was cut short during the lion tournament arc, it overall went on a smooth and perfect pace. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is similar to Your Lie In April but with less colors and more shading.  I find it unique and suitable to portray dark yet soothing themes. The dim imagery is perfectly synchronized with the self-conflicting emotions and thoughts that characters go through.  \\n\r\nSound: The soundtracks in the anime produce the general mood of the situation. The soundtracks aren\u2019t loud or constant; they change accordingly, similarly as water. The soundtracks are mostly piano composed. Aside from the ost/soundtracks, the opening and ending theme songs are beautifully composed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Rei is a sensitive and anxious seventeen-year old boy that attempts to overcome his weaknesses. The people he meets and deals with have a large impact in his life. I believe that Rei is an ideal main character in this story because characters with flaws have great potential to grow. He may seem timid and nervous but he carefully observes his surroundings and is analytical at times. Other shogi players struggle and dedicate most of their effort in Shogi similarly to Rei\u2019s dedication to Shogi. As mentioned previously, the characters are all aboard in the same train to the same destination.However, the character development isn\u2019t very obvious yet it is efficient to some extent. I believe it needs to improve in this field. Nevertheless, every character in the anime was equally significant to the story because they all support the important message throughout each chapter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Exploring the field of competitive shogi left me in excitement for the next episode. \\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\n(Pros) - Steady pace\\n\r\n-\tMany messages throughout the series\\n\r\n-\tUnique art style \\n\r\n-\tVariety of Soundtracks\\n\r\n(Cons) - Was cut short during the lion tournament\\n\r\n             -  Vague character development \\n",

            "content": "The experience of being an anime fan has changed quite significantly since I was a wee lad. Now that the industry is at a point where U.S fans can view everything legally as it airs simultaneously in Japan, has crafted a need for fans to always be watching the currently airing shows. Which can get tiring because about 9/10 shows are either bad or shows that will be forgotten the moment the last episode ends.\r\nSangatsu No Lion is a beacon of light; not necessarily because it is the most breathtaking viewing experience, but more so because of a very specific set of reasons. There aretwo brands of sports anime, the melodramatic type(i.e. Touch/Cross Game) and the monster-of-the-week type(i.e. Hikaru No Go). Sangatsu no Lion fills an interesting niche insofar as it merges the two together in a seamless manner. I have a conjecture that this is due to the strength of the directing. Sangatsu no Lion has a ton of great visual imagery. There are no bland shots, there continues to be interesting animated sequences that are very necessary to break up the monotony of two people playing Shogi. \\n\\n\r\nSangatsu No Lion's biggest selling point is that it does not do anything egregiously bad. There is nothing that will compel you to drop this series and as a result of this, all of the strengths flourish and there only remains a reason for the viewer to return. Which was a necessary component to add to a show of this nature, due to the fact that there is not much demanding your constant attention. You can put this show on in the background as you do work, glance up every few minutes and still not have missed much exposition or interesting progression.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, this series is the very definition of a sum-of-its parts. There are some anime where you know very clearly what are the strongest and weakest aspects. The MC is boring, but at times he can be a very compelling and interesting protagonist. The love interest is a little over the top, but she does add an interesting dynamic to the protagonist that would not otherwise be there. In terms of flaws, this show is a mixed bag, there are bad elements but they are clearly all there for the sake of creating some interesting character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have ever struggled with feelings of isolation or depression. Look no further, watch this right now! Sangatsu No Lion gets it. The MC is for all intents purposes depressed and is struggling with some self-hate issues. Issues that get in his way of connecting with others and trusting other people. Having a character with trust issues does not automatically make this show \"deep\" or \"thoughtful\" but the way it juxtaposes that with the people in his life who genuinely care about him is done to a masterful degree of success. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was good. I wish I could rate it higher, but it just stumbles over its own two feet because the show does not have a strong sense of urgency jumping from one plot point to the next. This is not a thriller, and if you are coming to this for that type of entertainment, look elsewhere. The joy of watching this comes down to the details and minutiae of this characters life.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: It would help in your enjoyment if you have some background with Chess or Shogi so you can understand some of the strategical concepts that are thrown around semi-frequently.",

            "content": "3-gatsu in the Lion may have been one of the best dramas I've ever seen-- in fact, it comes easy on a possible TOP 5 drama anime I've ever seen, after all. It is simply all very well done; From the incredibly elaborate plot to the very well-constructed events to a completely different and captivating premise, so that all the true drama that was presented fit perfectly into all relevant and irrelevant factors. The dialogues are great and the characters are sensational.\r\nThe dramatization on the introversion of the Rei (protagonist), contrasting with the way he seeks to escape from this reality through the Shogi, isbeautiful to see.\\n\r\nThe comments he makes mentally throughout the episode are brilliant. Unlike any narrator, he does not describe the scene and the chewed and hand-delivered delivery to you, these thoughts make you reflect a second time about the scene and help you to understand it otherwise. It's the least, touching.\\n\r\nAnother positive point worth mentioning is comedy. The comedy is very well served, so to speak. In other words, it knows when it should appear. Perhaps she had intruded in some moments she should not, but in general, she knew when she should be present, and when she should not.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot develops at a desperately slow pace. It would not surprise me if someone fell asleep in the middle of some episode, because considering this factor, it is quite understandable, but I think one of the main differentials of 3-gatsu in the Lion is precisely this calmness in addressing the events. So if you can stand up for the whole episode, it's going to be worth more than it's worth.\\n\r\nAnother thing worth highlighting in the 3-gatsu universe is that even a seemingly insignificant character can make the narrative of the story completely change. A simple helper changes the way you tell and work the plot. This is great.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great. Seriously, the cast overall is very good. It does not have a character without utility or bad use. They all had their respective functions, and they performed very well (I have not yet decided whether I love or hate the Rei sister, haha).\\n\\n\r\nAnd technically, the anime was to take the blow. Holy shit, the scenery here is beautiful. Seriously, I really wanted to see Shaft work on a utopian feature film, just to see what the visual art of 3-gatsu would look like. If within a week, they made it possible, how would it be in a time of production and larger budget? I have mental orgasms just thinking ...\\n\r\n3-gatsu has a cartoon style in graphic art, and in addition to being very beautiful, makes the anime's ambiance spectacular and, above all, perfectly emphasizes the theme of the work. It was very good. I definitely can not see 3-gatsu with a visual art (scenarios) otherwise, otherwise this; Think, 3-gatsu with the scenarios of the ufotable (Fate, God Eater), for example. It would really be very beautiful, but also, well anti-climatic.\\n\r\nThe animation is relatively above average. It is fluid and makes the movements of both the joints of the characters, hair and even the clothes, be in a perfect synchrony and much more pleasant to see.\\n\r\nAnd finally, on the soundtrack, my God, what absurdly beautiful thing. What an incredible soundtrack. I believe that since Clannad, I had not seen a OST as beautiful and climatic as that of 3-gatsu, congratulations to all involved in this question, they did a wonderful job.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, 3-gatsu in the Lion, is basically more of the appearance. Not superficial, it may seem like a drama with a touching point and another touching with a set of characters that are there to develop the protagonist, but having a deeper point of view, you can realize how incredible the plot is, and how brilliant it is. The way it has to take place.",

            "content": "March comes in like a lion... Oh where do I start? This is one of my all time favorites!\r\nBefore I get started though, I will mention that I have not yet read the manga so this review is strictly on my reaction to the anime.\r\nThe story revolves around a teenage professional shogi player named Rei. You quickly find out that he is an orphan who is now living alone while still trying to attend high school and continue on his career path as a professional player.\r\nNow this is considered a sports anime but don't worry if you're not familiar with shogi. The shogi episodes goby at a good pace and are done in such a way that you actually become engrossed and not bored by the game play.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot of the story is about Rei and his relationships with others in the form of flashbacks and present day. He's had a rough life, the past 10 years after losing his parents and sister he was brought up by another family but was always felt alone. His \"adoptive\" father and sister have big roles to play in his emptiness.\\n\\n\r\nBut thankfully there is a light in the darkness or several lights for Rei. He doesn't spend a lot of time at school but when he does he is usually in the company of one of the most caring teachers ever! He also has a safe haven to retreat to found in the Kawamoto home. Three sisters Akari, Hina and Momo have welcomed Rei into their home and their hearts in the most heartwarming way I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes when Rei is with the girls are my favorites. there is so much warmth and love there. The girls also have known tragedy, They live with their grandfather. Their grandmother died and so has their mother, quite recently from what Rei can tell. The wounds are too fresh for the girls to talk about what happened to their mother and they never mention what happened to their father who is absent and never brought up.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to mention the art and sound quickly. The art style is absolutely gorgeous! The background music is soothing and fits in perfect. The two OP and two ED are fantastic! Everything blends together so nicely.\\n\\n\r\nI found out today that there will be a season two and I am so happy I can't contain myself! I can't say enough good things about this anime.",

            "content": "Well, well, well... How should I begin... First of all I have to prevent that I will do my review in french. Your eyes may burn with my english, so... Let's just start !\r\n3-gatsu no lion est honn\u00eatement pour moi un bijou, un chef d'oeuvre et bien entendu c'est un avis subjectif. Je veux juste que les gens comprennent \u00e0 quel point cet anime vaut la peine d'\u00eatre regard\u00e9 et appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 \u00e0 sa juste valeur.\r\nL'histoire 10/10: On suit l'aventure de Kiriyama Rei, le personnage principale \u00e2g\u00e9 de 17 ans et professionnel de Shogi. Pour ma part j'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu parl\u00e9 du shogi (Akashi Seijuuro ouencore Shikamaru Nara xD), mais sans jamais approfondir la chose et gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cette histoire j'ai pu d\u00e9couvrir ce monde qui est plus complexe qu'il ne para\u00eet. \u00c7a nous montre qu'on a pas forc\u00e9ment besoin d'action pour aimer une histoire et pour l'appr\u00e9cie. \u00c7a vous fera tout aussi planer et sentir d'\u00e9motions si vous y mettez du votre.\\n\\n\r\nL'art 10/10: Wow, wow, WOOOOOOOW !!! Plus j'avan\u00e7ais, plus je prenais des claques et plus j'avais des frissons rien qu'avec le graphisme. Comment vous dire que les dessins sont magnifique, l'animation tellement bien calcul\u00e9e et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie ! Ce n'est absolument pas un graphisme comme les autres. Les \u00e9motions sont super bien retranscris dans les mouvement, \u00e0 tel point que tu ressens ce que les personnages ressentent. Ils jouent avec les angles, les couleurs, les formes pour faire ressentir quelque chose, pour dire quelque chose et \u00e7a franchement, je trouve \u00e7a magnifique. C'est vraiment de l'art pour moi, pas de simples dessins.\\n\\n\r\nLe son 10/10: Encore ici, je n'est rien \u00e0 dire si ce n'est que les g\u00e9n\u00e9riques et ost sont magnifique. Dans certains animes les musiques sont la pour nous faire ressentir de l'amusement, de l'intensit\u00e9, mais l\u00e0 ce n'est que pure \u00e9motion. Je peux m\u00eame dire que l'art et le son sont tr\u00e8s similaire dans ce qu'ils veulent faire passer. Dans l'opening 1 et 2, j'ai compl\u00e8tement voyag\u00e9, mais pas ailleurs, voyag\u00e9 dans les \u00e9motions. Je parle toujours et encore d'\u00e9motion, mais je pense que c'est le but de cet anime. En \u00e9coutant l'ending 2 je plane compl\u00e8tement et c'est ce que j'aime ! Et une chose vraiment positif par rapport aux ost, c'est qu'on a eut droit \u00e0 un en fran\u00e7ais ! J'\u00e9tais choqu\u00e9e ! C'est toujours du japonais (normal) et de l'anglais, mais le fran\u00e7ais \u00e9tat une tr\u00e8s bonne surprise !\\n\\n\r\nLes personnages 10/10: D\u00e9j\u00e0 le personnage principale... Il me touche \u00e9norm\u00e9ment. Je dirai qu'on peut le cat\u00e9goriser dans les personnages assez path\u00e9tique (je parle du vrai sens de path\u00e9tique, ce n'est pas p\u00e9joratif), tellement sa vie est mis\u00e9rable, et dont on pourrait se lasser parce qu'il n'avance pas et ne fait que se plaindre. Mais absolument pas !  Il est \u00e9mouvant et nous fait nous questionner sur certains aspects de la vie et de l'\u00eatre humain. Comme tout les autres personnages d'ailleurs. Qu'ils soient fous, joyeux, tristes, intimidants ou autres, ils nous apprennent tous quelque chose d'important selon leurs v\u00e9cus, et \u00e7a c'est une tr\u00e8s belle chose. Vous ne pouvez que vous attachez \u00e0 eux, avec leurs qualit\u00e9s et d\u00e9fauts.\\n\\n\r\nL'amusement 10/10: Le 3 premiers \u00e9pisodes sont assez lents (ce n'a absolument pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un probl\u00e8me pour moi, parce que je savais que \u00e7a annon\u00e7ait quelque chose de super) mais il ne faut pas abandonner et lui donner \u00e7a chance. Ils sont assez myst\u00e9rieux aussi, on ne comprend pas forc\u00e9ment le probl\u00e8me de l'histoire, mais plus on avance et plus on reste scotch\u00e9s ! Je ne vois pas les minutes d\u00e9filer, et je n'exag\u00e8re rien du tout ! Rien qu'avec le r\u00e9cit du narrateur je suis \u00e0 fond, alors quand le rythme est un peu plus rapide je suis aux anges *.* \u00c7a me fait vraiment r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir sur l'humain et me fait comprendre certaines choses.\\n\\n\r\nLe tout 10/10: Comme vous pouvez le voir, j'ai mis 10 partout et je ne pense rien exag\u00e9rer. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 emport\u00e9e par cet anime \u00e0 tel point que j'ai du \u00e9crire une review. C'est de l'art, c'est tout ce que j'ai \u00e0 dire et ne pensez pas que parce que c'est du shogi, une chose que vous trouvez peut-\u00eatre ennuyeuse, que \u00e7a l'est forc\u00e9ment. Il faut se laissez aller et appr\u00e9cier tout simplement. Action, aventure, combats et gros seins ne font pas tout... xD Un peu plus de simplicit\u00e9 fait du bien ! Si vous avez aim\u00e9 Shigatsu wa kimi no uso, je recommande fortement 3-gatsu n lion. Les deux emporte par leur magie.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free*\r\nMuch is expected from the author of Honey and Clover, the bar is raised quite high. The pace of the relatable slice of life with a hint of unrealism just to relief our stress from our daily life. If this is your slice of life anime, I have to warn you, it either is your cup of tea or it is not: the pacing of the episodes are too slow for some, and too much realism, intensity and lack of comedy in the genre makes it hard to grow likeable. Doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a shot.\r\nMarch Comes In Like A Lion startsoff great. The story has a main point and focus with a rich background with relatable feelings. It becomes clearer halfway through the anime that the main theme was \"depression\" and \"shogi\".  However, it is hard to convey depressive messages when every 5-10minutes the scene is interrupted by cheerful side characters or cheeky ones. It is not to say it is not allowed but it is overused and reached borderline hateful. It destroys the mood, the audience is unable to digest and digress lessons learnt in the episodes and hard to keep up the pace of the characters as they keep getting interrupted. \\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, because shogi is a japanese board game, the chess pieces are in kanji characters, it is not appreciated when they do not fully explained the rules properly and instead entertained it in such an annoyingly enlightened mood which is not catchy. When it is hard to grasp the rules of the board game, it is very anticlimatic and felt like the audience is \"holding lottery tickets to hear the news on the radio on who wins this round\".\\n\\n\r\nOn the brighter note, the character development was great, considering that aspect alone. There are main but subtle changes in the main character and the side characters are very great developed. The sound is fittingly amazing to the brilliant animation where every scene surely captivates the audience heart, making it memorable. Watching the anime definitely makes you appreciate the minute details you have in life, and how wonderful it is.\\n\\n\r\nShould March Comes in as a Lion be you first slice of life? No, unless you like it to be super comedic. However, there are classics out there, that will captivate your heart and breathe you life to your world a perspective you never seen before: an appreciation to live.\\n\r\nFor others, should you watch? Not unless, you are really bored and need more slice of life entertainment. Nothing wrong with that. No one is perfect.",

Even during the arcs about shogi, a sport which I know nothing about, I was very engaged in the story. The characters are a treat, as are the beautiful Shaft visuals. It's a great show for those who are depressed and want a heartwarming slice-of-life show that doesn't just pander with aesthetics, but intelligent writing and relatively complex subject matter.

            "content": "Truly enjoyed and appreciating watching this anime. \r\nThe richness of the visual metaphors, especially those of water, fit perfectly with the unique and interesting art style. \r\nAlso the soft, gentle subtlety of warm moments and the lonely yet beautiful portrayal of the more sombre and depressing moments were executed very nicely in my opinion. \r\nGoing into more depth into each of the categories, the story was well set out early on in the show and remained strong. This aspect mingles very closely with character for me, so I'll discuss that too here. Rei's struggles to live alone compounded by his lack of family, his strugglesto understand and accept his relationship with shogi, and his introverted personality were all very relatable, as they were realistic and ultimately, very human. \\n\\n\r\nThe unique art style that experimented with surrealism made what could have been possibly more mundane scenes highly meaning and engaging. It is difficult for me to go into details here, but I was very satisfied to see that this show would not settle for a conventional but cliche art style. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was great, as the osts used matched their corresponding scenes and the emotions and thoughts involved very well. However, it was the visual metaphor of water in the opening that really stood out to me as outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nFrom beginning to end, the naturally slow pace of the show brought out my enjoyment and appreciation much more that if it had been a fast-paced, plot focused story. It was truly one of those rare shows that goes deeper than an interesting plot to see, or simply strong emotional moments. This is not to say that such shows have no value, but I, and I believe many many others too, appreciate literature that goes beyond plot and emotion at a different level. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, this was the first anime that prompted me to write a review and receives a well-deserved 10/10 overall from me.",

But there's just something missing from this series as a whole. The best way I can describe it is that it just feels mundane. As a whole it's definitely a nice mellow series with the beautiful art and calm soothing sounds but there's just a huge gap that cannot be filled and that for me is the plot.\r\nThe plot is just so empty it makes watching this show feellike something I want to do when I'm really bored or when I just want to chill for a while. It's not going to be a page turner that's for sure but if you're into stuff like that (which I thought I was because I really like slice of life stuff) then sure give it a shot but after 5 or 6 episodes I couldn't see a point in really pursuing it although I have watched through the whole series. The MC just feels pathetic and his self deprecation throughout the show borders on irritating but there are nice moments in the show too where I feel good just listening to the sounds and watching the characters laugh and smile. Overall it's ok but nothing I'd be encouraging whole heartedly you gotta try it to see if it's really your taste",

That\u2019s a good chunk of the show. However, a lot of the monologue is particularly relatable and profound. \r\nThe scenario is the main reason I began watching this. It reminded me of Your Lie in April for some reason. I'm happy to report that it is nowhere near as sad... at least not in the same way. \r\nThe characters are also particularly well done. They are human and damaged. I found myself painfully familiar withsome characters, as I know people like them. At the end of the day every one of them is just struggling to find meaning and love whether they think they're worthy of it or not. \\n\\n\r\nThe only major criticism I have is the shows issues balancing shogi and relationship arcs. The first half focuses pretty heavy on the latter. Then it finished up strong on the shogi. If anything it should have been reversed. But hopefully they\u2019ll do a better job interweaving the two in season two, which I am already watching as it airs. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to rate the overall story at this point, as the second season is still airing.

This anime is nothing similar to that anime and I really regretted thinking like that without even giving it a try. \r\nThis anime has a wonderful story and animation. I am more than satisfied with the character development and the realism felt in the anime. The main character, Kiriyama Rei's emotions and the situation in is very well displayed through the Shaft Studios very own techniques such as monotone colors in the background and simple basic color in the art.I think studio shaft nailed on making this anime personally. They were able to add the soft drawing and funny moments and when the anime was on its serious tone they were able to capture that very well. \\n\\n\r\nI have literally no bad comments on this anime and it makes me wonder why this anime wasn't recognized. I may think it is due to the fact that the anime is based on shogi, a board game that isn't well known. But I think while watching this anime you are able to learn about shogi.  \\n\\n\r\nI am looking forward to its 2nd season. \\n\\n\r\nAs a person that loves opening and ending themes of an anime, artist Bump Of Chicken sang season 1 (opening and ending) and season 2 (opening) and Yonezu Kenshi which is my favorite singer sang the ending theme of season 2 did great job and the song matches the anime perfectly.",

It takes it's time and addresses many small details, which can make it seem slow. However, I thoroughly enjoy this sort of storytelling, and it allows me to really think on every situation and dilemma. There are plenty of explanations about the story, so I would just like to focus on what this show did and why I rated as high asI did.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the general writing. By the and of the season, I felt as if I knew the characters personally, that I understood what drives them and what they struggle with on a daily basis. The characters were felt so real, that I was captivated whenever they spoke. The main character, Rei, is obviously dealing with some form of depression, and perhaps even social anxiety, but this doesn't take over his character. Too many times have I seen characters with a single defining personality trait: always happy and excited, always quiet and calm, always emo and sad, etc. Rei is seen feeling lonely, excited, happy, content, depressed to the point of sickness, and even more. Rei, I feel, is a character that many teenagers can relate too on some level. He wants to have a place where he firmly belongs and he wants to have control of his life.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile there are the three girls: Momo, Hinata, and Akari. They are also dealing with their own problems (though mostly Hinata and Akari, as Momo is still a small child). However, unlike Rei, their tragic losses have helped them grow closer as a family, making their home warm and comforting, and Rei even compares it to a kotatsu. This is what we all want: a place where we can feel safe, at peace, as though our troubles are gone even for a moment. Regardless, the three sisters still cope with their loss and sadness. \\n\\n\r\nWhat stood out to me the most in the show was the realness of it, and how well it was written, to a point where I'm not sure I can talk about much else. The art was consistently beautiful, the soundtrack was moving, and the story was endearing. If you're looking for an amazing story, watch this. If you aren't a fan of slow pacing, try it out anyways! I think this is a show everyone should at least try, because god knows this has risen to my top favorites in anime. (Also, sorry if this review seems disorganized, it is my first after all)",

I think that 3-gatsu no Lion is well worth a watch, especially if you enjoy slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

            "content": "Sangatsu No Lion is the successor to the popular series Your Lie in April, it contains allot of it's elements and has lots of the similarities to Your Lie in April well still managing to be unique in it's own way. How is Sangatsu No Lion different from Your Lie in April? Your Lie in April was focused on the love between characters and their emotions for each other well Sangatsu No Lion switches it up and focuses on the love between family members and their feelings for each other.\r\nThe premise is still the same, Main character with a sad backstory focusing at becoming thebest at something he doesn't love anymore, meets a person (or people in this case) that pulls him out of his depression and shows him there is more to life than just piano or shogi. Both show struggling characters climbing up and meeting other characters with similar problems to them. However the big difference here lies in the love. Your Lie in April deals with love to one person between all the characters well Sangatsu No Lion deals with love for family members and people so close that they feel like family.\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu No Lion is very similar to Your Lie in April but is still extremely different in lots of aspects. I really think Sangatsu No Lion did an amazing job at being enjoyable even if I didn't really understand shogi, I think one of the best parts of the series is when Nikaido is teaching Hinata and Momo how to play shogi and the whole time i'm thinking \"This is just for us people who have no idea what they're doing\" after that I went and did research on shogi just because I felt sad that I was being taught like a child. I still have next to no idea what i'm doing but at least I can proudly say I know what the different pieces do (kind of.)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I definitely recommend this anime to everyone, especially if you enjoyed Your Lie in April. The anime all around tells such a good story and all the characters are so goddamn lovable that there's no way I could not recommend it. I really think Sangatsu No Lion was an amazing successor to Your Lie in April and went kind of under the radar when it was being aired.",

            "content": "Well, this is my first review and i really wish that this can help everybody.\r\nI think that Sangatsu are such a amazing anime, the story is pretty solid and well directed. When i started to watch, soon on the first episodes, my concern was that the dark and heavy tone that the story takes sometimes would stand out too much, being honest i see as something necessary and real, once the personality of some characters goes to this, but at the same time perhaps the present weight could be more controlled, this tone which makes the second part less enjoyable in comparison to the firsthalf nevertheless not less brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great, Rei makes you get care about him and cheer for his growth and happiness, the Kawamoto sisters are so endearing and lovely, Nikaido and the other shogi players are good and interesting too, even the unlikeable and tempestuous Kyoko gets my sympathy and comprehension on the lasts episodes that she appeared (i really think that even when she lashes out, in the end she just needs love, support, and someone that wants to understand and guide her) and last but not least the cats... are so funny, every single moment that they are showed up are quite fun, they should had more time on screen (the best ones in my humble opinion =D)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this first part of history was very strong in all senses, and the anime made me more knowledgeable about shogi and shows that he can be fun too.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend without reservations, and i look forward for the next season.",

            "content": "Begining with the first glance on the poster I wasn't sure if I would watch 3-gatsu no Lion. You know, it doesn't look very much appealing. In combination with synopsis it gives an impression about ordinary slice of life anime. Well, a good friend of mine insisted that I should give it a go. And I did. Partly I was right, partly I was wrong. Now, more into details. \r\nTo be clear about the story, you should realise that it's NOT about shogi. In first place it's about Kiriyama Rei, his attitude towards other characters and the world in general. It is very characters-oriented storyand it is the thing that actually makes 3-gatsu no Lion great. Personally, I love this type of anime when main hero struggles with life's hardships and challenges. It's inpiring and heart-warming. \\n\r\nOf course, a good amount of time is dedicated to shogi, but shogi, I repeat, works as decoration. So, if you doubt yourself whether it might me boring because of that, leave your doubts right now. Furthermore, the way the show tells about shogi is interesting and involving. \\n\r\nThere are a lot more things the story has to offer. I guess, it's even possible to learn something watching this show. \\n\\n\r\nArt is simply amazing. I wonder why they made poster so mediocre when the anime has outstanding art. Really, I fell in love with it. It is peculiar, special and you wouldn't confuse it with something else. Some scenes worth even special remark. My favorite episode was about Kiriyama's game with oldman. Omg, it gave me shivers while I was watching it. The way they did last scenes of that episode was very passionate. \\n\\n\r\nI loved op-s and ed-s. First one was better, on my opinion. Well. Speaking about sounds, it's excellent. Actors' work, some special sounds... everything's alright here. I especially liked kawaii voices some characters were issuing :) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters, as I already pointed out is the main part of the series. It is basis. Besides, very interesting main hero, Kiriyama, there are a couple more characters which were unique as well. All characters are very good written. I could feel they were alive. I could simply sympathy with them. Gosh, haven't I written yet about cats? Just forget everything I wrote till this point. You should watch this show because of brilliant cats :) I know you would love them. I mean, how a human being couldn't possibly like those cats?\\n\r\nHeh, okay, back to being serious. There are still some characters whom development we have yet to see in the future. I hope so at least. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this show a lot. It is so warm and homelike. I can't complain about anything save the fact it's not ended. So, a lot of questions and problems remain unsolved. I have my hopes up for the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to anyone who seeks in anime something more than simple entertainment. Yup, it's a slice of life anime. But not an ordinary one. \\n\r\nHighly worth watching.",

            "content": "Intro \r\n3 gatsu no lion whose full name is March comes in like a lion is a slice of life and sports anime that is based off the manga of the same name. 3 gatsu no lion is the shortened term that I use to refer to both the anime and the source material. I haven\u2019t read the source material yet however after watching the anime I may actually look into it. \r\nStory and setting \r\n3 gatsu no lion is a sports and slice of life anime that focuses on both the professional career of the main character Rei and his personal life which isalso affected by his career. The story largely takes place in Tokyo although Rei does travel to other parts of the country in some episodes to either take part in competitions and witness others playing. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime showcases the life of Rei Kiriyama a 17-year-old who is socially awkward but considered to be a powerful shogi player having started out when he was in middle school and becoming a pro while there as well. His achievements plus the fact that he started Pro while only just in middle school has made him somewhat famous. While also looking at the professional career of Rei in Shogi the story also looks at the isolation that Rei surrounds himself with which is a result of his shogi skills clashing with his family. The story alternates between looking at Rei\u2019s career and his interactions with several support characters and the struggles of other Shogi players and their background stories. \\n\\n\r\nShogi itself is relatively interesting sport and was an interesting theme to use for the anime. Shogi while like conventional western chess is infinitely more complex with each piece having far more ways to use than what is seen in western chess. The strategies that were observed from the anime looked pretty complex made even more so by the fast-paced matches that were shown in the anime. All in all, Shogi is a sport and game that is rarely seen in the west so it was an interesting topic to see for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\\n\r\nRei \\n\\n\r\nRei Kiriyama voiced by veteran voice actor Kengo Kawanishi of Mobile suit gundam iron blooded orphans and Naruto shippuden fame is one of the main characters of the series. A 17-year-old teenager and a professional shogi player that went pro when he was still in middle school Rei is a relatively quiet person with his personality being best described as shy, quiet and focused. Because of a tragic accident that took his family away from him Rei was adopted into what can be a traditional shogi family. It is here that Rei was introduced to Shogi by his adopted father. Unfortunately, Rei\u2019s skill with Shogi had the opposite effect in that it caused Rei and his family several problems that eventually resulted in Rei leaving home to be independent. Rei\u2019s wrestle with this fact is one of the many struggles that he faces in the anime. Apart from Shogi Rei actually has very few other interests and indeed it can be said that Shogi is everything to Rei as it gave him not just a sport to take part in but also a purpose and a path in life that eventually led Rei to pursue a career in Shogi. In a way Shogi gave Rei a clear purpose in life something that he did not have before. Because of his quiet nature, Rei can be socially awkward around people and as such his closest friends are for the most part the fellow shogi players that he meets as he goes through his career. However, the exception to this rule is the Kawamoto sisters that helps take care off and support Rei after they encountered him.\\n\\n\r\n One of the central themes of the anime apart from showing Rei\u2019s growth as a shogi player and his career in that is Rei opening his rather closed personality to others and him learning to rely on others rather than try to do everything by himself. Throughout the series there are a number of characters that try to get Rei to do this with the best ones being the Kawamoto family of sisters. The interactions between Rei and the Kawamoto sisters especially Akari and Hinata was especially cute and it was nice to see Rei slowly open to them. All in all I felt that Rei as a character was well designed and that his voice actor Kengo Kawanishi did a pretty good job portraying him. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAkari \\n\\n\r\nAkari voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Tales of Zestiria the x and Anohana fame and one of my favourite seiyuu\u2019s is one of the main characters of the show. A resident of the same town that Rei lives in Akari is also Rei\u2019s neighbor in that she and her family only live across the river from Rei\u2019s apartment complex. A kind hearted, understanding and considerate young woman Akari can be considered the very image of a young mother if one did not know that Akari\u2019s family actually consists of three sisters. Due to the early death of her mother Akari was forced from an early age to take care of her sisters and also manage the household as the eldest daughter. As a result, Akari\u2019s life is generally focused around helping to support her family. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that Akari does not have the opportunity to work as she also helps her grandfather in running a traditional Japanese sweet shop and at the same time also work as a hostess in her aunt\u2019s bar. Ironically it is her latter job that allowed her to encounter Rei when she took him in after finding him sick after a night out with friends. To Akari Rei is very much like a lost lamb that needs to be taken off and as a result Akari likes to take care of Rei and get him involved with their affairs. Apart from being kind and caring Akari is also very perceptive in that she can easily see the pain that Rei hides behind his easy going and nervous attitude when he is with them. Rather than trying to pry out the reason Akari instead tries to let things slide and patiently wait for Rei to reveal this when he is ready to do so. \\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between Akari and Rei tend to be quite heart-warming in that Akari can confide in Rei the worries and issues that she has with regards to her family with Rei who is someone that she trusts. Similarly, this relationship is also mirrored in Rei who also tries to open up to Akari when he is feeling down. The relationship between Rei and Akari can be quite funny as Akari can act somewhat like a mother type character as she cares about the well-being of Rei with the best example in the series when she and her sisters kidnapped Rei to take him to a hospital after suspecting that he was ill. When Akari is with her sisters a great deal of hilarity can occur due to the fact that all three like sweet things like snacks but have to balance their desire for them with the family budget. Although the relationship between Akari and Rei doesn\u2019t progress past that of good friends and Neighbors I think that it is entirely possible for them to be paired as a couple seeing that their age difference isn\u2019t that large plus Rei is one person that Akari has a lot of trust in and cares a great deal in. All in all I think Ai Kayano did a pretty good job portraying the character of Akari.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nHinata\\n\\n\r\nHinata voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Psycho pass and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei fame and my second favourite seiyuu is the second of the three Kawamoto sisters within Akari\u2019s household. A middle school student Hinata is a positive, upbeat and cheerful person that always tries to cheer Rei up when he feels sad. One notable trait of Hina is that she is a heavy sleeper that at the same time always manages to wake up at the last minute and yet still make it to school on time. Although she isn\u2019t as good as a cook as Akari is Hina\u2019s bento\u2019s still look to be pretty tasty. Like Akari Hina also likes to take care of Rei and as the series progresses it becomes apparent that Hina has developed feelings for Rei as she gets flustered quite often when he\u2019s around and also the actions that she took when she saw Rei and Kyouko. Though the anime only hints at this possibility I think it will be a good thing as depending on which year Hina is in for middle school the age difference between them is not that great. When Rei is not with them for some reason it\u2019s funny seeing Hina worry about him and at the same time consider the various punishments for him when he doesn\u2019t come. Like Akari Hina can also be quite understanding of Rei but at the same time Hina also tries to involve him in her affairs which is always funny to see.  Within the anime there are quite a few episodes that focus on Hina as a character with the most notable one being the arc that focuses on her crush in school. I quite liked this arc as it showed not just how frantic Hina can get and at the same time how creative she can get with her bento\u2019s as well. All in all, Hinata was a well-designed character and I felt that Kana Hanazawa did a pretty good job portraying her. Her relationship with Rei was also cute. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMomo \\n\\n\r\nMomo voiced by veteran seiyuu Misaki Kuno of Log Horizon and Myriad Colors Phantom World fame is the third sister of the Kawamoto sisters within Akari\u2019s household. A preschool student Momo can be described as pure, innocent and cute but she does have a selfish and stubborn streak at times which can be quite comical when it appears. Momo for the most part is limited in the interactions that she can be part off due to the fact that she is still a preschool student. For the most part Momo serves as the comic relief for the show defusing otherwise tense situations with her presence. Like Akari and Hinata Momo also likes Rei and sees him akin to a family member and someone that she can trust. \\n\\n\r\nKyouko \\n\\n\r\nKyouko voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Marina Inoue of Attack on Titan and Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series. Kyouko is the adapted sister of Rei\u2019s adopted family and has a rather interesting relationship with Rei. Older than Rei by four years which would make her 21 years old Kyouko is beautiful but hot headed and has a mean streak about her that makes it hard for people to know her. Her personality can be described as manipulative, willful and independent. Kyouko is a stubborn person at times and can also be annoying and disrespectful to others while also being independent. In a way, her personality was shaped by her father and his desire to have his family focus their careers on Shogi. However, Kyouko\u2019s does change at times especially when she is around Rei that she has a grudge on. Though she bears obvious dislike for Rei she can still act innocent around him though this usually happens when she wants him to take care of her. In a way Kyouko has a rather negative influence on Rei\u2019s life and career in that she often induces doubts and worry in Rei before crucial events like shogi matches. However, Kyouko isn\u2019t really a true villain in that she doesn\u2019t bear hatred towards Rei in a literal sense rather she seems to enjoy hindering him for her amusement. All in all Kyouko was a rather complex character and a well-designed one and I felt that her seiyuu Marina Inoue did a great job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nNikaido \\n\\n\r\nNikaido whose full name is Harunobu Nikaido is voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto of Alderamin of the sky and Owari no seraph fame. A important support character within the show Nikaido can be considered to be Rei\u2019s first and best friend though only Nikaido sees this as the truth. Rei and Nikaido met when they were little through the player of Shogi and because of being beaten by Rei repeatedly has declared himself to be Rei\u2019s lifelong rival. Like Rei Nikaido is a professional shogi player though not as skilled as Rei is. Despite seeing Rei as a rival Nikaido also sees Rei as a friend as well and as they both understand shogi on a more intimate level than most people do he can easily see when Rei is in turmoil during a match. Nikaido does try to cheer up Rei at times when he\u2019s down and there is one instance in the anime when Nikaido forgets his role as a commentator and tries to get Rei to understand where he went wrong. Aside from his interactions with Rei as part of Shogi Nikaido also gets the chance to interact with the Kawamoto family where he teaches them the basics of Shogi with the help of a very well designed and animated picture book that shows the pieces as cats. I felt that Nikaido was a pretty good character as apart from motivating Rei as his rival he also supports him as a friend. Nikaido\u2019s background isn\u2019t as well explored as other characters but it\u2019s obvious that he comes from a reasonably rich family as he has a driver and a butler following him. Nikaido\u2019s struggle with his health and his desire to do well in Shogi I felt was well done however. In the end, I felt that Harunobu Nikaido did a great job portraying Nikaido. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHayashida Sensei \\n\\n\r\nHayashida sensei voiced by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Naruto and Anohana fame is one of the support characters of the show. A teacher that teaches at the high school that Rei attends Hayashida is the only person that knows that Rei has a professional shogi career outside of the school and thus the reason why he is absent from school for the majority of the school year. As a fellow player of Shogi Hayashida understands the life choices that Rei goes through in balancing shogi with is school life. As a result, Hayashida tries his best to stop Rei from being dropped out of school by showing him the work that he must do to catch up his school year. Apart from his school life Hayashida also cares about the well-being of Rei having seen that his quiet attitude isn\u2019t going to win him any friends in school. Though his attempts at doing so usually fail. However, while certainly not within his assigned duties it was nice to see Hayashida do so much to help Rei get a decent chance of passing his school year and in the end I felt that he was a pretty good teacher who cared about every one of his students. I felt that Takahiro Sakurai did a great job portraying Hayashida Sensei \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nThe art style I felt was reasonably done and I felt that the character designs for each of the characters was well thought out and designed. The color that was used in the anime was also a pretty good choice. The animation that was used for the anime I felt was also well done and looked natural and smooth. For the shogi matches the clear and crisp animation greatly helped in allowing the viewing of each of the individual pieces and the moves that were being made. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\r\nThe music for the series I felt was pretty good with the second opening theme and the second ending theme being my favourite. The scene music I felt was also well done. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting that I place an emphasis on I felt that Akari and Hinata\u2019s seiyuu\u2019s Ai Kayano and Kana Hanazawa respectively did a excellent job portraying their respective characters. Rei\u2019s voice actor Kengo Kawanishi I felt also did a great job. Additionally, the character of Kyouko who I felt was a rather complex character was played excellently by Marina Inoue.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nAt its heart 3 gatsu no lion is a slice of life anime that\u2019s combined with a sports anime thus giving a story that not just shows the growth of the main character Rei as a human being but also his growth as a professional shogi player. The combination of genre means that it also combines and features several different themes into the anime. These include the growth of the character as a human being, the human emotion that\u2019s balanced with the intrigues and challenges that are a result of the sport that\u2019s being portrayed with this being Shogi in this case. This balance of themes I felt was interesting as it allowed us the viewers to see not just Rei\u2019s journey as he grows not just in his career as a pro shogi player but also as a human being and in doing so break out of the shell that he had built to protect himself with. \\n\r\nThe subject matter of Shogi I felt was also good as this subject is something that is not very well known outside of Japan compared to the likes of international chess. The strategies that were shown in the anime were also well explained and animated which was good to see as Shogi can be hard to understand at times. In no small part, due to the picture book that Nikaido bought each of the pieces that are used in Shogi were explained pretty well and in great depth. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I quite enjoyed 3 Gatsu no lion and Shogi was certainly an interesting subject matter to feature. Seeing Rei\u2019s growth over the series and seeing him forge friendships and be more open to others was also nice to see. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "3-gatsu no Lion! This is an anime of Fall 2016 that I just started on a whim. I really didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised cause this anime was fuckin brilliant. So good that only 12 episodes in, it made it to my end of the year list for Top 5 anime of 2016, and only went on to solidify that position 10 episodes later. \r\nBeing a Huge Slice of life fan, this anime really stood out to me as unique and one of the best in the genre. The story has a lot of substance and progresses very well, themain plot about shogi is very unique and at times feels a lot like an actual sports anime. It's really great and is very well paced but this anime's strongest point are it's characters, who do a great job carrying the plot. There is a lot of range and variety in them, They are extremely realistic and relatable, their designs are very unique and everyone is just written so well, Oh, and there are some parallels too. Especially our MC, Kiriyama Rei. He is really how good an introvert MC can get. He is considered a Prodigy Shogi player but he has a really dark past and he is such a loner. To see things from his perspective is something that's very interesting and this show does it extremely well. You sympathize with him and start to genuinely root for him, watching him grow and develop along the way is such a joy to watch. I love his first person narration too, It feels like having a real conversation with him and he says a lot of deep things, I could just listen to him all day. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of cute and lighthearted moments that puts a genuine smile on my face. It's another thing this anime does very well, It does a great job at balancing the dark and light themes. Which is possible through the great quantity and quality side characters. Especially the scenes with Kiriyama and the Kawamoto family. Momo-chan and the Nekos are so cute, they alone make the show worth watching. The other elder sisters and Kiriyama empathize with each other, They provide some much needed hospitality and help Kiriyama overcome his loneliness. Those scenes are really warm and make you go like \"Ah..That's such a lovely family\" but nah, they've been through some shit too, there is always that lowkey sadness under that bright smile. They've been holding back a lot, but we all want to be happy, we all want to or should at least try to look forward to a bright future no matter how dark our past is or how big of a mark it left on us. This is something the anime conveys really well. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, This anime has a fine amount of well written side characters, some of my favorites are Nikaidou, He considers himself as our MC's rival and best friend. He's a very charming and energetic character and it's hard not to love how passionate he is about Shogi. Kyouko is someone who's negatively affected our MC in past, She is that character you'll hate but still feel for. Shimada is one of my favorite characters, He's very calm and mature. But his ambitions and back story are what make you wanna really root for him. Touji Souya is the #1 Shogi player, He has \"Loner\" written all over him and I really like the mysterious vibes i get from him, also has like parallels to Kiriyama which I mentioned earlier. Can't take my eyes off him during his screen presence. I could talk about them all day, just few of brilliant characters here. \\n\\n\r\nI love the animation and soundtrack. The art style is very unique and refreshing. some of the city and water landscapes are breathtaking as well. It does a great job of making the quiet and lonely atmosphere feel like a quiet and lonely atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtracks are soooo good. Sometimes they come in so well it gives me chills. It's just excellent. I love all the OPs and EDs as well. I watch the second OP at least 5 times before starting the episode. It is Performed by Yuki. Who also performed the OP of \"Sakamichi no Apollon\". Another one of my favorite OPs. Her voice is kinda weird but brilliant and goes incredibly well with the production. I love the 2nd ED too! It gives me some lonely, nostalgic vibes. Love it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this show, I'd give it a 9.25/10. This is an anime I'd highly recommend. Again, one of the best shows of 2016 in my opinion. I'd suggest it to even people who don't normally enjoy Slice of life as well. It has something for everyone so just give it a shot and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I did!",

When I read the story, I thought that it was a boring Slice of Life anime.\r\nI was so wrong.\r\nSangatsu no Lion brings you a tragic backstory of the MC (no innovative) and how he \"fights\" this with an curious sport: Shogi.\r\nShogi is like japanese chess, for saying it in a nutshell. I don't know how to play it, but that's not important. In this anime, Shogi is the thing who brings Rei (MC's name) back to life. Rei loves Shogi, but does he love it personally or just becauseShogi save his life? \\n\r\nThat's the enigma, until Rei finds about an peculiar family, who will help him to, maybe, find an answer.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know why this is a masterpiece, I highly recommend you to watch it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIncredible.\\n",

It's a seinen/slice of life/sport-game anime! Of course, shogi is not exactly a sport, however everything concerning competitions has the same feeling for me. The same exciting feeling!\r\nRei is our MC and he is really similar to Arima Kousei (Shigatsu) and of course I liked him the moment I saw his sad \"megane\" face. Rei is a \"zero\" in a \"common\" society. Almost invisible, he fails to be a normal high school kid not only because he is agenius young shogi player but also due to his tragic past. He is a lonely kid trying to be an independent adult. In the anime, we will see how his life changes when he meets new people, some of them are reliable friends, that will help him to find his place on the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is funny, sad, realistic and exciting at the same time. Sometimes you laugh a lot, then almost cry at the same episode! I really loved this anime... I've already added to favorites, it deserves! 3-gatsu no Lion is a masterpiece!\\n",

            "content": "Sangatsu no Lion is listed as a 'game' anime first, but that definitely takes a back seat to the slice-of-life/drama genres. It's very much a show about shogi, but not the technical aspects - it's a show about shogi players, and their struggles and lives. \r\nI loved this show, I should just put that out there. I'm not always a fan of what Shaft does, but in this case they really hit it out of the park. The artistic direction of the show combines perfectly with the story to make each episode a real experience. The first episode is a perfect example of this. Iwon't spoil anything, because the first episode is one of my favorite 'first episodes' to air last year, but it's super great stuff. \\n\\n\r\nAnother of this show's strong suits is the charm of its characters. Over the course of the show you get to know a lot of people, and come to love (most of) them. Rei in particular - you really get sucked into his story and his troubles and come to feel for him. \\n\\n\r\nI had one major con with this show: I don't feel it properly resolves all the issues it brings up over the course of the narrative. The issue with Rei's family, in particular, sticks out as something that is never dealt with with any finality. I was thinking this might be intentional? To make it feel more \"realistic\" (in life, we don't always resolve all our issues at once, after all), or it could be that things were just meant to be open-ended. Either way, I would've appreciated some closure. \\n\\n\r\nBut basically, Sangatsu no Lion is a great little show, everything you want out of a slice-of-life/drama. It's serious and funny by turns, with a character journey I found deeply relatable. Give it a shot!",

            "content": "AN ANALYTICAL REVIEW OF \u201c3-GATSU NO LION\u201d. (Spoilers - It's really for people who've seen already because I get into some detailed aspects of the anime)\r\nThis anime needs no introduction because this is myanimelist and you can already get all the info you need, such as Studio, Director and all that. Instead, I\u2019m just gonna ramble about why \u201c3-gatsu no Lion\u201d worked for me\u2026 and other people who might relate to my opinions. I\u2019m also not gonna waste a lot of time with characters and story\u2026 because this review is really for people who have watched the whole thing and for whom the usual reviewingaspects should be obvious by now. \\n\\n\r\n\u201c3-gatsu no Lion\u201d is one of the few anime that I found myself eagerly waiting for each week and yet, after downloading the episode (Because I\u2019m a bloody pirate from a third world country) I would not actually watch it. I would probably wait 2 or 3 days before having the courage of doing it. Why is that? It is an anime that I love, obviously. And yet, each time, it would require an immense amount of courage for me to sit down and have myself go through it. \\n\\n\r\n\u201c3gatsu\u201d works on many levels. And not being in any way an expert on anime, I am compelled to write a review for it because of how I appreciate what the show has accomplished. \\n\\n\r\n1) Abstract Visuals as a Metaphor for Emotional Distress\\n\\n\r\nWhile there must have been other anime to do this before, \u201c3-gatsu\u201d is the one that has impacted me the most. Yes, the show has a great art style that is this mix between childish cartoon and then the normal anime style art with attention to realism and proportion (for most part). The art style itself is fundamentally very light and bright with use of pastel colours and paintings with a palette that is very vivid. It\u2019s very reminiscent of the background art for \u201cYuri!!! On Ice\u201d, which had the same watercolour style. This art style is more apparent when the Rei is happy and is with the Kawamoto family because this represent how he views the world when he\u2019s the surrounded with people that he cares about and more importantly, people that care about him. That very palette changes when Kiriyama is alone and becomes much darker and thicker. You can feel the heaviness that he feels and see how the world closes in around him. But honestly, these styles are all pretty standard. What \u201c3-gatsu\u201d did which impressed me and touched me at the core was the use of abstract imagery to represent the emotional distress of Kiriyama and why the show chooses to show only his sadness through such metaphors instead of also applying the same technique to his more joyous moments. \\n\\n\r\nThat is because Kiriyama understand his happiness. He knows the few things that make him happy, even if he sometimes questions it himself. His realisation is often gradual. He keeps analysing the situation until he figures out the exact element that is making him happy and for these scenes, the art style remains the same because we, the audience, are the see the logical and emotional progression and realisation. \\n\\n\r\nBut we can see that many times, when Kiriyama is at his lowest point, when he questions the very foundations of his life and his choices, he cannot come up with an answer that he is satisfied with. And those are particularly apparent at the beginning of the show when Kiriyama was still very much under the control of his pain. Kiriyama knows that he is sad and he knows that the reason he is sad is because of the loss of his family, and the general outcome of having to move in with a foster family and having his siblings hate him and all that\u2026 but above all, Kiriyama is going through an actual depression. The guy is not just sad, he is depressed and as we all know, depression is when logics very often stop working. As opposed to happiness, Kiriyama cannot just analyse the situation. His sadness is something that he feels with overwhelming force\u2026 He FEELS it\u2026 and that is why the show chooses abstract visuals to represent his emotions. His reality is distorted, nothing makes sense, he doesn\u2019t know what is wrong\u2026 he can only feel the sadness and for him that emotions resembles the scenes that we see. It can be him being submerged by an ocean\u2026 him withstanding violent winds\u2026 or just a cut where we see the colour black and white just blending in together in a storm with the sound of it becoming a threat to your senses, your emotions. While I believe that these metaphors might work more with some people than it did with others, I still think that they do an incredible job at portraying the emotional distress of the main character without seeming to be just pure time wasting art\u2026. That\u2019s the way I see it. Every cut has a reason to be there. (Apart from the weird 2 or 3 episodes where we would get that weird cat-shogi song in the middle of the episode). While the slow pace of the show gives the audience breathing room, to assimilate all the emotions, there is no denying that when they emotions kick in, they do take your breath away. That is why watching \u20183gatsu no Lion\u2019 is always a viewing experience that I both dreaded and loved. \\n\\n\r\nIt is also only in episode 22 that you see the visual metaphors being applied to his happiness, and you can already see that it is already better shaped than before. Much less abstract and more of a simile. Which is a splendid way of differentiating between the two emotions; happiness and sadness. \\n\\n\r\n2) Being a Masterpiece of Tonal Consistency (Cursing ahead, I got heated during the paragraph)\\n\\n\r\nA LOT of anime out there suffer from the tonal consistency issue. Have you watched \u201cAkame ga Kill!\u201d? Or \u201cBungo Stray Dogs\u201d? These are two anime that I found the most astoundingly offensive when it came to directing because whoever directed those shows had obviously no idea of how to make these anime a pleasant viewing experience. Now, I know a lot of people enjoyed those shows, but I didn\u2019t. Setting aside the issue of the stories just being generic and the characters being bland and boring (Except for the first 4 episodes of the second cour of Bungo), these two anime suffer from massive tonal inconsistency. In \u201cAkame ga Kill!\u201d You would have Tatsumi just witnessing the death of one of his comrades, and the background music playing would be upbeat and light, the shot composition would be this medium shot, cutting characters out with no obvious focus on any particular character\u2019s emotions and literally after 1 minute, Leone or some other punk would crack a joke while they are all fucking attending the FUCKING FUNERALS or some shit like that. Or just pointlessly use \u201cLe Chant de Roma\u201d at any given scene when this soundtrack is clearly for the most dramatic and tense moments! Same thing for \u201cBungo\u201d, where Dazai would actively go from one tone to another, disrupting the whole mood of the show with no regards to how this affect the narration. What \u201c3-gatsu\u201d does that so many anime failed to do is to have tone shift, yes, but all these tone shifts are occurring instead of being made to happen. Do you see what I\u2019m saying? Probably yes, probably not. Bear with me. Kiriyama is a well-developed character, sure, but he is also very established\u2026 his behaviour is set. He will never actively do anything to change the way things are going, he will never just decide to be happy and then see the world as brighter and happier. He doesn\u2019t cause the tone shift, he doesn\u2019t disrupt the emotions that the audience feels alongside him. Instead all the tone shifts are brought about by external characters who enter the scene and cause it to change. Be it Momo jumping into his arms, or Nikaidou trying to change his mood. All the tone shifts happen for the sake of actually changing the tone from dark and sulky to light and funny. They take us by surprise yes but they happen in a way that makes us happy instead of confused about why a character is smiling at his friend\u2019s funerals or why his head is in chibi style when everything around him is fucking Armageddon. Life is also a surprise and tone shifts happen all the time. There is no schedule and that\u2019s why I think \u201c3-gatsu\u201d did a great job at portraying the realism in this way. The tone shifts are done quickly and completely. The mood changes completely without blending or lingering emotions from the previous scene. That is why this anime is gold! \\n\\n\r\nThis show is not at all style over substance. It anything, its style has substance and its substance has style\\n\\n\r\n3) The Directing of Character Development\\n\\n\r\nI am not familiar with the work of Akiyuki Shinbo. I\u2019ve only ever watched \u201cKatte no Kaizou\u201d which is just batshit crazy and fast paced with not much sense. And he seems to be the only director working at Shaft\u2026 But I honestly loved how he helmed the show, knowing exactly how to pace it so that the development of the character feels natural and progressive. The first half of the show focused heavily on Kiriyama as an individual and as the show continued, we begin to see how his interactions make him grow and know more about himself so that by the second half (Where the focus in more on shogi) , he is both growing\u2026 and discovering more about who he is. His development is done in both a backward and forward fashion as the audience learns more about Kiriyama\u2019s past but also see how he is presently changing. We learn why he behaved the way he did at first and we see what makes him stop behaving that very way. And that is the best kind of development. It was not only about making sure that your character had an interesting past, but also making sure that he evolves over the course of the anime. In this aspect, the development of Kiriyama reminds me very much of Killua Zoldyck\u2019s masterful development in \u201cHunter X Hunter (2011)\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nKiriyama is the only character who evolves that way as the rest of the cast are explored through backstory but that\u2019s okay because they are actually legitimately very likeable and interesting characters. I\u2019ve always thought that if you cannot make your character behave interestingly, then give him an interesting backstory and if you cannot give him an interesting backstory, then make him act interestingly and be likeable. Luckily, \u20183-gastu\u2019 ensure that all its characters are likeable and are developed properly. The Kawamoto sisters do not change a lot throughout the show but that\u2019s all right because they are genuinely good people who\u2019ve suffered a lot\u2026 and their courage to keep moving on and to keep smiling through thick and thin makes them winning characters! We learn about their past and we see how they are, and I\u2019m perfectly satisfied with having them the way they are. They are interesting. Momo is a toddler, she has no fucking development needed at this stage. I\u2019m just happy she is sweet and doesn\u2019t take too much space by just being the cute kids that makes you go \u201cAww\u2026\u201d but actually served a purpose in developing Kiriyama\u2019s backstory. Akari is my favourite one but she is already an adult and all her development is very much in her backstory. As a supporting character, she is perfect. Hinata is the one which technically would have the most development happening if she were a main character but even she is very low key and doesn\u2019t overstep her boundaries as a supporting character. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I also really enjoyed in the show were the quick cuts to facial expressions and how these definitely help to isolate a particular emotion of the character. That was a really cool bit directing choice. Like I said, every scene in this show is useful\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nWhile, I don\u2019t think this show has everything that I need for it to be among my favourites, I still believe that it is one of the best shows of the last few seasons and is special enough in the way it is executed. Many episodes had me smiling like a kid, many episodes had me holding my tears in because I simply could not afford to relive the pain that I was seeing Kiriyama go through. \\n\\n\r\nSo\u2026 is \u201c3-gatsu no Lion\u201d a masterpiece? Not for me. It is a great show with potential of being a Masterpiece had a few things been handled a little differently. I think the focus on Shogi is a little overwhelming at times, as someone who is not familiar nor interested in the game. That is especially apparent in the second half of the anime. The characters, while very well developed and memorable, still aren\u2019t unique. Not enough for me, at least\u2026 But otherwise, yes, it is a fantastic show. It truly is. So\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I made much sense at all\u2026 I felt like writing that shit, so I did. Take care guys. \\n\\n\r\n(If only I could put as much thought and dedication in completing my Uni work as I did for this \u201creview\u201d\u2026 *sigh*)",

            "content": "[I don't think I understand how you write reviews without spoilers so beware] \r\nLet me start with thanking the creators, please. Because they deserve awards for this anime, they deserve praising and recognition. To be honest the only Shaft anime I loved before was Soremachi, and the art there wasn't really a reason. I found the art in Nisekoi and Mekakucity confusing sometimes, super creative, though, but none of those really clicked with me. This time? This time I was awed from first second to the last. If for nothing else, I would recommend Sangatsu no lion to be watched for the art and creativityof the staff. They did such a wonderful job, that I couldn't stop feeling like this is why anime exists. To suck you into a world of wonders, and that is what Sangatsu no lion was for me, a world of wonders. \\n\\n\r\nI'm reading the manga, so I was really glad it got an adaptation, but I was never this hyped about it before the anime. The anime pulled up this manga for me so much that I'm not even sure how to express it, because I'd like to just scream about how mindblowingly amazing it was every week. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the story. I saw people saying this story is boring, and I saw them dropping it after a few episodes. Maybe if you never had depression, or never had to deal with someone with depression, you can't really appreciate this story. Because it is mainly about a boy who suffers from severe depression. I saw people saying Rei annoyed them with his tone of voice which was dark, or they could do nothing else but pity him. As someone who had depression, it kind of pains me, to be honest, but what can you do? We can be annoying. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you are curious about what it feels like to have depression, or how to try to help your friends with it, give this story a try with open mind, please. It's really good. The art helps you understand how it feels SO WELL. All those scenes when Rei was suffocating under water? All those dark, monotone colors? All the coldness? Ohmygoodness, so well done, so expressing, so easily sucks you into the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the part about how to deal with someone who has it? Look at Rei's teacher. Look at how he never pushed him over his limits, but never gave up being a positive influence either. Look at Shimadasan who waited till Rei was able to make the first step, then held this boy's hand tighter than anyone before him. Look at Nikaido who kept coming back, who never was discouraged by Rei's rejection (and also, please try to understand why Rei rejected him, because people like Nikaido, so so full of drive, they are too much when you are under all the weight of the shadows of your mind) And last, but not least, look at the Girls  look at them, and maybe try to understand even if you are the kindest, the most shining person to be around, then you are the goal, you are the dream that needs to be quietly, peacefully be around and always holding your hand out for us, so when we are ready, we can go and grab it - but never rush us.\\n\\n\r\nThe stages of Rei's recovery are pictured perfectly. He was a fighter before he met the girls, ohmy, never underestimate the power it means to not kill yourself, to wake up in the morning, to decide you'll go back to school - the teacher in the last episode with telling Rei that he won't ask him to do his best, because he is already doing it!!! -, he clung to shougi with all his might to not give up on life, but he was on the verge of losing. Without meeting the girls, without getting that new ray of sunshine to thrive \\n\r\ntoward, he would have never been able to let the teacher, Shimadasan or Nikaido help him. \\n\\n\r\nIn the last episode Rei says he hasn't really changed. I don't think that's true. No, his personality did not change, he will be the introvert, determined kid that he is from now on too. But he did change how he accepts life. He changed the way he looks at other people. Rei in the first half of the season wouldn't have been able to look at the other people around him as companions, but he is now. And that is change. There are relapsing times, there will be from now on too, but he is getting there. And it's maybe just me, but it gave me so much hope. It's so nice to see a character with depression GETTING THERE. \\n\\n\r\nIt's strange, I wanted to write a review from like the 11th ep? - the one where Rei gets angry for the first time at that old guy for blaming him for his losing, because that was the first real moment to show his shadows are getting thinner, also the first moment when I was awed by Rei's seiyuu's performance - but until this point I thought my main take on the story would be about the people who made Rei like this. But that last episode, the positivity of it, makes me unable to do that. I REALLY liked his step family's problems, you know. They are so contradictory, so flawed, and I could probably hate them if they weren't so human. Everybody is just so human in this story, nobody is black/white, everybody is gray, so you can see them at their worst and best. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the art, the characters, the story, all of those are just 10/10 for me. And let me tell you the sound is perfect, too. The first part's op and ed? THE FACT THAT BUMP OF CHICKEN GAVE THEIR NAME TO BOTH??? Omg, Bump's music is the equivalent of Sangatsu's story. And the soundtrack is great, too. Emphasizes the coldness of the first part at first, then in the last ep that huge turning point to the happier music? Gawd, I was crying. (Lowkey here for all the seiyuu, too. THIS CAST \u00e9aks\u00e9laksd\u00e9kas\u00e9ka)\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, what else could the enjoyment be than 10? The overall should be 1000, though. I'm sorry, but I'd fight anyone on the importance and perfection of this story. Mental health is important, and it is amazing to have such a well done anime with it in the center. It's not action, it's not sport, it is slice of life, and one of the bests ever done in that genre. \\n\\n\r\nCannot wait for the second season, and more Souya and more of the Girls. And most importantly more of Rei's recovery <3",

March Comes In Like A Lion is definitely one of those animes you have to turn to.\r\nThis anime is so beautiful with the vivid backgrounds and vivacious movement every step you walk. It's like you were walking across a bridge and look down to see the clear light aqua water that trembles beneath you. Many of the scenes in this anime are quite heartbreaking in fact, this anime has made me cry once I rewatched the episodes over and over.  \r\nHowever, the only flaw I couldperhaps say about this anime is really the story with Shogi. The only reason I could say this is from how I am not positive on how to play Shogi nor even know what's going on in the Shogi matches half of the time but overall definitely an amazing anime to watch.",

            "content": "This is just a review of this season, not the show as a whole. I am aware that there is some further character development in season 2 which might raise the points for characters, but as it's divided by seasons, that's I've chosen to review it.\r\nMarch comes in like a lion or 3-gatsu no lion is... sad. Sad in the way that you're sad something wonderful is imperfect, the way that there is a crack in the old, beautiful porcelain vase on your grandmother's dining table. The production is splendid, but the reality of the world that our main character is, almost psychedelically, blended into- with swirling colors and metaphorical imagery - opens a portal into the world of Shogi and a simple tale of a lonely person finding a new family.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not an action packed tale, but intense nonetheless, without falling into the trap of melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nThere is a simplicity which works in 3-gatsu. Because after all, complex situations are not really required to tell a compelling story. It's not by levels of revelation or incredibly clever dialogue that this show grabs an interested viewers' heart (I might argue it's through the stomach as there are some lovely looking dishes in there...). It's by portraying the mental state of our character with imagery, a few words from his perspective and beautiful demonstration of animation skill that transcends portrayal and becomes almost a stream of consciousness.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is it actually about? We have a young man who is a shogi (Japanese chess) master. We follow him through his matches and his very gray every day life. As he comes into contact with a lovely family and befriends them, his perspective of life begins to shift to a more positive one, with some issues that life presents affecting him. We get to follow him through his changes. There's nothing really challenging about him as he is a pretty kind fella. There are some rounded characters in the show, but this guy is the martyr of cold and rough behavior directed towards children.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nStudio Shaft was probably the best choice for this adaptation. They have a way of giving warmth and emotion, even negative such. There are also some sudden and well-made closeups add a sense of intimacy that could have been difficult to ascertain were it animated by a different studio.\\n\\n\r\nThe metaphorical imagery is made in such a way that you want to stay in them and not leave, sort of what you might feel looking at some early impressionist art. It truly captures this show's portrayal of melancholia simply bursting at the seems, slowly dying and giving way to life.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI find sound a bit difficult to review, but I enjoy the intros - the sounds enveloping the scenes seem to grasp the emotions well and I particularly like what's going on in the mindscape imagery.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest point of the season. There's nothing wrong with the characters - they just develop a bit slowly. I really enjoy them in fact, and I know that they develop further in season 2. It's just a matter of priorities, as some setup and aesthetics take a lot of room in 3-gatsu. These characters are likeable and relatable for a lot of people, which can't be said for all popular shows.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI was on the verge of scoring 9 here, but it would have been a fanboy move. I really love watching this show. It's an emotional ride with a hopeful message and a slow, calm pace that puts my mind at ease.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nA smack-dab winner among the newer long-running animes out there. It's got a powerful story with some well-maneuvered social drama.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review is helpful, please take one episode at a time and let it sit with you before playing the next.",

            "content": "After coming into 3-gatsu no Lion expecting a more serious take on the oh-so-controversial genre that is \"slice of life\", I have to say that my high expectations were met with a great cast of characters with their individual struggles, personalities and roles - complimented by the signature Shaft cinematography. \r\nPersonally, I was kinda excited to pick up and watch a show that completely shatters the usual \"lighthearted and funny\" take on the genre...that is \"slice of life\", by bringing in a healthy dose of realism and (of course) complicated family issues. Though the show consistently reminds you that life isn't all sunshine and rainbows,it also, despite previously being thought impossible by me, has breaks reminding the viewer that there's always (usually) a light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that story and plot progression wasn't 3-gatsu no Lion's strongest point or even a point that developed at all. However, this \"lack of development\", in my opinion, was a good trade off for the extremely life-like personalities of the characters (more on that later though).\\n\\n\r\nThough the \"Story story\" is quite lacking (in 22 episodes, the protagonist barely achieves anything besides a healthy ass whoopin' by Shimada), the background story, or the \"story before the story\", is interesting in regards to: a) what actually happens and b) as explanation to Rei's random PTSD moments when he partakes in a normal activity such as hanging out with friends and so on. This show exchanges the \"what\" for \"why\" in terms of story progression. Also, the small developments in what you might call plot help you understand Rei and his current state of being (purposely being vague so I don't spoil the \"character\" section)  better than an event filled story about a boy's rise to become a shogi master would've been or at least that's what I believe.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story for the show is VERY slow, and that's not exaggerating. Sometimes, scenes get repetitive; you start seeing Rei sitting alone in his apartment whilst reading shogi guides in your sleep or perhaps you fall asleep BECAUSE he's sitting alone reading shogi guides AGAIN. So, I warn everyone who is considering watching the show: if you fall asleep if characters aren't doing backflips 24/7 or engaging in hour-long dialogue, don't watch this. It's a bad idea. Otherwise, you can enjoy the show in a psuedo state of relaxation as your mind has an existential crisis despite nothing actually happening around you.\\n\\n\r\nSound and visuals: 8/10\\n\r\nFirst OP and ED were forgotten while playing on the screen in front of me. The second OP (especially) and ED were good in both visuals and song.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about the backing track for this show: it wasn't particularly loud or in-your-face. It was quite forgettable really. But that isn't actually why I'd give it a 7/10. The amount of cases of \"wrong place wrong time\" songs that have destroyed otherwise climatic or reflective moments (in anime and other shows) is stupidly big. This show doesn't have that problem. Why? It isn't afraid to use the easiest backing track of them all: silence. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the scenes are just Rei internal monologuing with sound effects in the background, but they do an amazing job at reflecting the tension of the scene while also kinda reminding you that \"hey, this is another huge milestone in character progression\" or \"this is supposed to be tense\". \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise the actual soundtrack and so on aren't especially bad or good. They do the job: creating background noise so we can remember the scenes where they aren't playing.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals, however, are stupidly fitting. Leaving character-rotation animation aside the signature Shaft zoom-ins and outs really help the dramatic/serious moments and the (also signature Shaft) abstraction (making it really damn simple) helped make the more light-hearted and comedic scenes fit. Good job on that part. The character and animation style (how they actually looked) was original and, overall, left me void of any complaints really (except, you know, for that first one).\\n\\n\r\nDecent soundtrack with fitting visuals. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHoly hell, where do I begin with this? Everyone was developed, except maybe the school cut-scene people who we just needed to know were dicks. Everyone had a personality. Everyone filled their roles, from self-indebted best friend to that one old guy that we obviously have to hate or else we hate you. They developed a character that was supposed to be a faceless nobody to the second most developed character in the entire arc, bringing to light how naive and tunnel vision the protagonist was. Everything about each character fit. Especially Rei, though I have to say they try a tiny bit to much to make us sympathise with him at the end when, really, we just needed an explanation behind another PTSD moment. I also have to reiterate this: they turned a NOBODY, like, one of the pointless obstacles that we don't care about into the focus for, like, seven episodes or so. And they made me care about all of them! Even the guy we are supposed to hate because he doesn't return another character's feelings (and he's a dick), ends up having a reason for being so cold (besides being a dick). All of them were relatable in some small way at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe anti-hero protagonist, Rei, is the main reason why the show is unique, in my honest opinion. He looks at the world in such a depressingly straightforward way, and at himself in an even more depressingly self-deprecating way, that it makes happy and fulfilling moments in the show memorable just because they aren't depressing. However, this strategy works so damn well so I can't even complain. And sometimes, what would otherwise be a \"happy\" moment is presented as \"cheating\" or \"weak\" by our four-eyed bundle of joy and ends up shaking him instead of encouraging him. His delicate, yet interesting, pessimistic state of mind keeps the show serious while making any colourful and playful moments a breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the small story progression the show DOES have is exaggerated greatly to show the importance of these small events to certain characters, which I think is a reasonable way of displaying the individual interests of every character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters definitely carried the show with good progression and an explanation to why they are the way they are (for most of them).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGreat show if you don't mind slow-paced storytelling and character building. The show flows pretty well with no parts that I would specifically solo out as \"unenjoyable\", except maybe the first episode as it needs to ramp up and explain what the hell's going on. The protagonist, Rei, is developed as someone who we can empathise with and is mainly responsible for the show's serious tone with the other non-backstory related characters supplying the much needed breaks from the series' unexpectedly tense atmosphere, before shattering you with an undeserved but wholly needed reality check.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI know this show will lose people to how damn slow it starts and how damn slow it continues to be until the end of time, but it is wholly worth trying  if you are doubting or on the fence and definitely worth watching if you were a loner (like me). Three episodes then decide. That's what I did (the first one was a bit too slow) and I was rewarded with another anime series that could replace the time where I was feeling bored with time where I'm depressed about how bored I am now that it's done.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it a bit and decide.",

            "content": "Do you know those stories that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside and leave you with a happy smile? 3-Gatsu No Lion is one of those.  Some people may feel like staying away from the show because the story involves Shogi (and yes it does play an important role) which is a different variation of Chess but the show is so much more than this. It is about Rei, a professional Shogi player in Middle School and when we meet him for the first time he is mentally in a very dark place but he gets \"rescued\" by a very kind familyconsisting of three sisters and their grandfather. Later on, he meets other people who also enrich his life and also help him become a better player.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThis is in many ways a slice of life story with some drama thrown in for good measure. There are some episodes which are a bit more tedious (frankly I was neither a huge fan of the \"baseball crush\" storyline nor the cats that explained Shogi) but overall I loved the pacing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThere are way too many shows where characters simply do not seem to change. They exist but this is not true for Rei. I the first episode Rei walks around his life without any joy and thinks about killing himself.  Rei is depressed and the only thing that motivates him at all to get out of bed is playing Shogi but things change. He meets the wonderful Kawamoto sisters who welcome him to their lives as well as their hearts. Their warmth often made me teary-eyed and even Rei admits that being with them feel like a nice warm stove on a cold winter night. Shimata, an opponent who becomes his master, is also a fascinating and wonderful character. What is wonderful to see is how Rei is learning how to enjoy life and how his outset in life become more positive over time. \\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nThe score is serviceable but nothing special.  It works well with the show. I am not a huge fan of the 2nd OP but the Bump of Chicken songs are just divine. \\n\\n\r\nI love 3-Gatsu no Lion because it often leaves me with a big smile on my face and sometimes also with a tear. It is hard not to care for the characters. I wish the show would receive more attention since it is truly a great drama. I am very much looking forward to watching the second season.",

This anime really packs a lot of emotions and character development and i believe that\u2019s what makes it such a phenomenon. Throughout the show i felt connected and kinda emotional as well, the words and structure the anime has makes it even better. The sisters are a very refreshing touch to the anime and brings a sense of comedy to it. I think that the dubbed version of this anime is way better than the sub, that being said i can\u2019t wait for the dubbed version of  season 2 to come outand i can\u2019t wait to see the amount of development Rei will go through!",

            "content": "This anime gives us a beautiful and unusually realistic glimpse into depression, anxiety, and isolation. Each of these issues are tackled through multiple characters with their own perspective on the matter and their own methods of coping. It demonstrates the numerous different ways we may define \"strength.\" I would definitely recommend this series to everyone.\r\nWhat I liked best about this anime was that when learning to write a story we're often told that all the supporting characters need to be real, that they can't just exist for the sake of having people for your protagonist to interact with. They must each have their own storiesbeyond the story, each with their own struggles. They must be, like here in the real world, the protagonist to their own stories. 3-Gatsu no Lion (March Comes in Like a Lion) takes this idea well beyond what we could imagine. To the point where you're not entirely sure who to root for during any of the numerous shogi matches. Even the cruelest antagonist has their story told such that we can sympathize with them and in the end realize that they aren't just \"that a-hole.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you love to have your heart warmed, if you like to go \"DAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaawwww,\" or if you're a bit down in the dumps and are looking for something to pick you up this could be just the thing you need.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: This series is a super slow burn the entire way through both seasons, all 44 episodes.",

Now, 17, he is living alone and away from the pressures of the shogi community and his dysfunctional adoptive family. Rei is finding his place in life when old friends return to disrupt his quiet life. He must find a way to deal with his complex emotions and decide who is truly willing to help him along his journey.\r\nPros:\r\n-Rei is such an effective protagonist and his emotional inner monologues are the best thing about theshow\\n\r\n-The shining characters beyond Rei are Shimada and Kyoko. Kyoko\u2019s complicated backstory with Rei as well as her tempestuous relationship with a married man is one of the most daring and honest characters that anime has ever tackled\\n\r\n-Show is best in its quiet moments with its wide shots of the city or Rei looking off into the distance. The show can be picturesque when it wants to be  \\n\r\n-Gives an accurate insight into what depression and anxiety looks like in various forms as exemplified by the characters with the heavier storylines \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-While the side characters seem integral to Rei\u2019s character development, they seem to take more screen time than necessary\\n\r\n-The Kawamoto sisters pull focus from the more interesting themes and story beats and could have been removed from the story entirely in favor of Rei finding character development through other side characters \\n\r\n-The show fails to make shogi feel interesting to watch to those not previously familiar or interested with the game\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat did you think of season one of March Comes In Like a Lion?",

While there are good characters the antagonists aren't very good, specifically *spoilers* Rei's sister and G dude. Both psychopaths apparently and how do you redeem that?\r\nHowever, the non crazy asshole characters are worth watching and Rei seems to be changing forthe better. Or for the Shogi.

            "content": "Now you must be thinking why I gave this anime 10 out of 10, well that is because when I consider a anime true masterpiece I usually do not rate that anime, I just leave that anime without any rating as testament of my appreciation for that work of art. But this anime is not widely known as other anime's so I thought by giving it a perfect 10 I might increase its rating which will encourage other people to check this anime out.\r\nThe Story :\r\n                Rei kimiyama is a17 years old teenager, who is professional Shogi player and lives alone because he did not wanted to be any burden on his adoptive parents. By living alone he encounters the Kawamoto's family, who are the nicest people he has ever known. You people might be thinking that this is a sports anime that revolves around the playing Shogi but that is not the case here, shogi is rarely shown in the anime, most of the anime revolves around Rey overcoming his depression and finding that he is not alone in this world. That is the gist of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters :\\n\r\n                       For characters lets talk about our main characters here first. Its indicated from the start that Rei hates himself for various reasons, that are later revealed in the story so I am not going into any spoilers here but I am just gonna say that he hates himself because of his adoptive family. Later in the anime story focuses on rey and his hardships and how he overcomes those hardships. Depression and anxiety is really something else that I have not seen very often in other anime's these days. I would like expend on other characters but for that I have have go into second season of this anime which is not related to this review that is why I will not explain other characters in this review.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art. \\n\r\n           Hmmm.... what so say other then that its beautiful and every frame is a eye candy. studio SHAFT really went all out on this anime, team Shinbou did a really fine on this one. I really can not imagine this anime without its art-style because its fitting to this anime, the use color black and blue to express Rei's anxiety and depression its something I have never seen before and its just goes well the anime every time its used.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\n                 By point in review you know that this anime is not a happy go lucky one, so if want a anime with real characters development then this anime is for you. I enjoyed every second of this anime. If you liked Hachimitsu to Clover then you will like this one too because they are from the same author and have same method of character development as well, at least at at some points I think.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\n            Well what else I can say about this anime to convince you people to watch this anime because I have already said everything that I can say about this masterpiece. I will say that you will not regret watching this anime.",

Conversations between characters are sublime, and the characters consist on one of the bests casts in all anime, period.\r\nFurthermore, the tempo of the series is supreme, based more on the fact that they dont waste time in any episode.With the exception of the fucking cats, god i hate those cats.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it is still a slice of life anime, and there are some people that wont like it because of that, but this anime is really good, for real, even if you dont like slice of life genre give it a try.\\n\r\n Another detriment is that this is not the full story and there are more seasons to come, but if they are as good as this one, well color me happy.\\n\\n",

In turn he applies what he learned from overcoming these hardshipsto his own life.  This anime to me exemplifies a journey of self discovery, a journey which as shown is this anime, is a cycle through suffering from uncertainty, and joy through the act of grabbing a hold of life.",

            "content": "This anime is something far outside the mold of what I am usually inclined to watch. I have deep interest in action-adventure anime, something that focuses on a protagonist that is usually accompanied by a strong cast at his side, going on adventures and saving the day. That, or a rom-com that focuses heavily on the development of relationships between the protagonist and one or more girls around him until he decides who he really loves. Lion was a complete gamble when I watched it because it was merely a suggestion my friend made and I went in with low expectations. I was completely absorbedafter two episodes. Not because of any action or romance that was put on screen. I was drawn in by the deep characters and the beautiful display of the terrible emotions and feelings that a lot of us experience in life. The main character, Rei Kiriyama, is a troubled young man who plays Shogi, a form of Japanese Chess, professionally. He doesn\u2019t hate the game, but he doesn\u2019t love it, playing it simply as a means of living in life. He lost his parents at a young age and was brought into a house that brought conflict between him and the children of his adoptive parents. This troubled him through his entire life, and the best he could do was isolate himself from those around him as a way of dealing with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is less about what\u2019s going on around him and more about what Rei and those he cares about are experiencing in those moments. Rei is a great protagonist, not feeling too depressing as a character and carrying a lot of small quirks and problems that make him feel real. The cast around him are also great, most usually bringing some light into Rei\u2019s life and giving him a much needed push toward a less isolated lifestyle. Along with the art style that displays the waves of emotions and troubles through imagery, the characters are no doubt a huge highlight in the story. Rei\u2019s depression is expressed through the feeling of being stuck under water, constantly drowning with no way to air. His isolation portrayed as a whirlwind of darkness that constantly surrounds him. When he sees the Kawamoto family though, they radiate with light and warmth that he desires. \\n\\n\r\nLion makes you feel for each character and understand the emotions they experience with force, making your heart strain when something goes wrong and making your heart leap when something finally works out. It doesn\u2019t drown you in depression despite the amount of emotions it pushes on you, always showing that even when things get bad, you always have a chance to bounce back and change. After losing to Shimada before the finals, Rei becomes bedridden and depressed. He spends most of his time curled up in bed and almost starving himself because of the pain. The Kawamoto family realize they haven\u2019t seen him in some time, come to his home and take care of him until he\u2019s feeling better. It\u2019s moments like this that show that even when things seem to be their worst, there is always a way to recover. In this case, it\u2019s through the sisters that he can come back.  \\n\\n\r\nEach character has something to bring to the table. Certain ones do provide only a bit of intrigue to the story, while others persist as either fundamental players in Rei\u2019s life or are presented with very real problems of their own. One prominent person in Rei\u2019s life is his step sister, Kyouko. She can be very confusing in her relationship with Rei, constantly trying to push guilt on him over his victories over other players but still relying on him as a form of comfort when her own strained romantic relationship isn\u2019t working out. At times, you think that she hates him for taking attention away from her to their father, but other times she is seen confiding in him. At times, their relationship seems to even border something taboo, small flashbacks alluding to Kyouko possibly sexually abusing Rei. Their relationship is tricky to understand, but makes for great moments in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent good in Rei\u2019s life is the Kawamoto family, who consists of three sisters and their grandfather. They provide a warmth for Rei in his dreary, cold world that he is constantly putting himself into due to his bouts with depression. As much as he loves the sisters, he is constantly putting on the breaks to keep himself from getting too comfortable. Insecurities and fears drive him to think that like his foster family, he will somehow drive this family apart with his presence. Despite this, the sisters constantly invite him over, using his tendency to be unable to refuse people to make sure that he comes over. They serve as the family that he always wanted, becoming too attached to them to ever outright abandon them, even with his lingering fear.\\n\\n\r\nRei\u2019s biggest thing in Lion seems to be that while he\u2019s great at Shogi, he doesn\u2019t enjoy it. It\u2019s his way of life and what he does for a living. Rei doesn\u2019t play to win, he plays to \u2018not lose\u2019. It has become his only way of surviving in the world as his profession. This entire concept is finally turned on its head for him when he plays against a superior Shogi player, Shimada, who later on becomes a mentor of sorts. Shimada provides Rei with the knowledge of what he\u2019s missing as a Shogi player, the hunger to win rather than not wanting to lose. Rei comes to admire his skill and drive, allowing himself to be humbled by Shimada and become one of his students of sorts. Shimada has great development of his own, almost taking center stage for several episodes that depict his own troubles in the Shogi community, having challenged the champion several times but always falling short. This is another great display of character development done right in a story, exploring his thoughts and pains throughout his endeavor to beat the champion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and imagery of this level is rare, and I\u2019m always happy to find a cast of characters that has me interested in every single one. Lion speaks to you about the emotional struggles of the heart from all angles, ranging from depression, loss, defeat and many others. But despite the turmoil, you have to keep fighting until you\u2019ve won. Even if you keep falling down, don\u2019t let it stop you from pushing forward. I have named it one of the instant classics among the anime I have come to watch and will continue to enjoy it as long as it keeps going. \\n",

            "content": "To start of this is one of the most recent anime that has given with a relaxing great feeling as i watched it and followed it through atleast the early stages. \r\nWhile this is strange to  say this but i enjoyed this less in some ways as i went further out in the story but let me start at the beginning. The beginning is great in many ways that it gives you a good cool feel to it although that might feel slow for some i kinda love those beginnings that start that way. As the story progress we learn more about the maincharacter story and what has happened through his life that gets alot more interesting. Its what i would call a low key dark anime that stays on the grey side of the world early on in the anime. As we get further there are some annoying parts which i have to blame some of the characters for the main character kinda being one of them mostly. Since as the story developes and sound more interesting it also goes away from being one of the more unique into what i would like to call a predictive plot line which in some ways starts to get slightly irritating for me as i watched it since it was ah yeah now this is gonna happen and now we have to wait that long for something new. \\n\\n\r\nNice feeling to the art i felt i liked the way the eyes were made in this anime was very nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe first opening and ending are one of those great ones you almost cant skip but you just love hearing it again and again. And if i combine it with the good and calm soundtrack i find myself saying only good things. The second opening and ending though is not up to par. They are less than interesting and feels like good enough op and endings but nothing special about them. \\n\\n\r\nI personally really like the main character Kiriyama, Rei alot atleast i do in the first 13 episodes or so and some later might have to do with the impact is lessening after a while but i feel he gets more uninteresting at times  in the later stages of the anime. Early he is this cool , calm and almost empathic feeling character thats interesting to follow but later he softens too much and starts to feel less like the one you started with in many ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kawamoto sisters are an interesting bunch with personalities from 3 different of stages in a persons life. Child , Teenager and nearly adult. Although i at times can find them too imposing on the story and they can be a little too friendly in a sence. I also enjoy having them there since they sometimes helps the story on or help the main character. None of them are overly boring or annoying which i like but its not like everything about them is interesting either. \\n\\n\r\nI fully enjoyed this anime in many ways eventhough i have my complains about some of the later points i really enjoyed it in every way and it goes into one of my go back to anime when i feel like i need to watch anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime never really got me to a 10 to be honest it felt to me more like an 9 or a strong 8 but in the end i felt it was unfair to give it anything but 9. If you like calm and relaxing anime that also gives you a great story then you will love this. I will almost say that you should love it in that case but if your not very fond of main characters that arent as action packed/ in your face or stories that arent as straight forward and a little slow then this anime might not be there for you but i hope most people will atleast give it a try. \\n",

            "content": "Once again Shaft studios delivers an amazing series. I came into this show without knowing what to expect, aside from that it's a slice of life like series. Coming out of it, I ended up finding more than what I initially expected. The story is a strong one, detailing the main character's struggle for success. However, while I really enjoyed the story, the pacing is a bit slow. There are many moments of silence when setting the mood, and it felt like the plot was progressing way too slow. But this alone shouldn't stop you from watching this series, as it is a powerful taleon its own. \\n\r\nThe art style is similar to Your Lie in April, if you somehow haven't heard of that series you should watch it. The animation is gorgeous all around, as expected of the great studio Shaft. I've always liked the way that Shaft studios animates. They move aside from the generic animation that most other studios use and instead offer a more unique style. Whether you love it or hate it, you have to admit that uniqueness is one of their greatest strong points.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was not really impressive, unless you count the intro songs. They were super catchy to say the least... Aside from that, the ending songs were okay, and I don't remember any of the insert songs, so I wouldn't say they are great either.\\n\r\nThe characters are the super strong points of this series. Each character, especially the main ones, had development of their own which I don't find in many other series. Not much else to say other than watch it to see for yourself. Aside from the slow pacing, everything else about this series is pretty good!",

He lives alone, and meets a family with a grandpa and three girls.\r\nThe story was very slow paced, and may be boring for viewers. Despite that, the build up was worth it. To avoid spoilers, the story has a complex way of viewing it, but once watching enough, it's easy to view the incredible story.\r\nThe art was ok in my opinion. But the animation was amazing. Just in the beginning episode alone, it blew me awaywith the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was kind of confusing, so it was hard to understand what was going to happen with character interactions. With the flashbacks, it helped, with repeating something about a character, it gets in our head to know the importance of the character.\\n\\n\r\nSo I really give this anime a try.

            "content": "March Comes In Like a Lion may have you draw some parallels to Your Lie in April in that both focus on teenage boys gifted in particular talents who suffer some sort of mental trauma due to facing strong familial pressure to engage in their talents and getting out of whatever trauma that is negatively affecting them. In the case of March Comes In Like a Lion, this involves Rei and his interest in shogi as he is under pressure to use the winnings from his victories in the game to maintain living independently from his estranged adoptive family. However unlike Your Lie in April,this series offers some major improvements in how it explores its somewhat similar premise.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas Your Lie in April resorts to melodrama in exploring the issues surrounding Kousei and Kaori, March Comes In Like a Lion is more grounded in the exploration of Rei's situation. While Rei is cynical and isolated to engage with others, the series does not overdramatize these elements to his character and the growth he undergoes to improve himself is more gradual instead of in large spurts as Your Lie in April does with Kousei. Also while Kaori serves as the sole trigger for Kousei's growth in Your Lie in April, Rei's growth is undergone by gradually bonding with others in and out of the game of shogi that he is part of.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strength that March Comes In Like a Lion has over Your Lie in April is the exploration of its supporting characters. Whereas the majority of characters in Your Lie in April were mostly irrelevant in the series, many of the characters in March Comes In Like a Lion have their roles to fulfill in the gradual growth of Rei's character and a number of them even get fleshing out to give them more depth and not feel like mere archetypes as much of Your Lie in April's cast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the last major element that March Comes In Like a Lion is more polished in than Your Lie in April is the execution of its comedy. This was a major issue for my viewing of Your Lie in April because of the style and timing meshing poorly with the anime's more serious developments. With this series, its comedic timing is better executed to not be as abrupt in presence during more serious scenes and is more diverse in style depending on the situation that plays out for a comical moment, being either subtle or over-the-top without taking away from ongoing developments occurring within said scenes. While my mileage did vary on when I chuckled during March Comes In Like a Lion's comical moments, I did appreciate the anime's better timing and diversity of comedy compared to Your Lie in April.\\n\\n\r\nStill, this isn't to say that Your Lie in April edges over March Comes In Like a Lion in some areas. The visual presentation in Your Lie in April is far superior in detail and animation, as March Comes In Like a Lion utilizes a pastel-like animation style similar to Honey and Clover. While the character designs look decent with this drawing style, scenic shots looked washed out in comparison to Your Lie in April and the animation is noticeably not as fluid in comparison. Also whereas Your Lie in April had a conclusive ending, March Comes In Like a Lion ends inconclusively as its manga source material is still ongoing as of this review and a second anime season of the series is expected to continue the anime's plot when it starts airing during the Fall 2016 anime season.\\n\\n\r\nStill in spite of these minor issues with the comparisons, March Comes In Like a Lion is a series that can still stand on its own feet with the quality storytelling that it offers in exploring the developments of Rei's character and others who interact with him throughout this series. A definite recommendation if you have interest in character-driven comedy/ dramas.",

Most importantly throughout the story the MC interacts with very interesting side character who help him to gain a better understanding of meaning in his life. These interactions also lead to some amazing heartfelt moments that really make the anime. One thing I noticed andmust applaud the creators for doing is that the art changes moods during these heartfelt moments and the art consistently reflects the mood of the show at any given moment!",

            "content": "Great Anime does not have to be full of exciting happenings that drive you to the end of your seat, nor does it have to be beautifully crafted with extravagant art and music. If one is technical, Sangatsu no Lion can very well hold its own in those areas, the art is drawn in such a way as if it came out of a storybook. The contrasting colours and music tempo to depict a shift in mood is done masterfully. But what blows me away is how the show can convey a story in such a way that it looks more like a first personview of the life of a young man whom all of us can see a part of ourselves in. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStaying faithful to the manga by adapting chapter to chapter (and always reminding us so with a white frame), the pacing of Sangatsu no Lion is never an issue.  We slowly but progressively come to know of our Shogi prodigy \u2013 Rei Kiriyama who, as much of a genius as he is, is not invulnerable and is basically like us, facing the ups and downs in life.  The beginning of the show pictures how Rei came to this present point in life, how he interacts with the Kawamoto sisters, how he fights not just his Shogi battles, but also his inner demons that often plunges him into a dark mood. Though many would argue that the second half side-lines the Kuwamoto sisters and even Rei himself and shows technical, tedious Shogi games, I argue that the second half gives Rei the opportunity to look into the lives of his seniors, who have stayed on the path of competitive Shogi far longer than he has, thus allowing him to basically see what lies before in the future,  indirectly letting him understand himself further and develop his character.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a good balance between comedy and drama, giving off a bright, vibrant vibe with people in laughter in joyous scenes while showing the sadness and gloom after. It is an ever-going cycle that allows us the viewers to understand that the joy and happiness that our characters are going through is unfortunately bound to be disrupted; and on the flipside, the horrible phases that they are going through are bound to end with a light at the end of the tunnel. For example, as we see the hardships that Rei faces with his family background, he stumbles upon his eventual solace in the Kuwamoto household. As he enjoys the warmth and company and leaves with a rare grin on his face, he stumbles upon a relative who reminds him of why he was shrouded in dark depression in the first place.  It is not the Utopian fantasy that us viewers like to find escape in, nor is it the depressive carnage that makes us reflect on how fortunate we actually are, instead it realistically depicts how life is \u2014 a mix between the two. \\n\\n\\n\r\nA resounding theme that this show reminds us of is that the success and joy of one sometimes come at the expense of another. With a show that has a setting based on competitive Shogi, this is bound to be a given. Unlike most typical shounen anime, however, where we feel the joy of our characters upon the finishing move, we see how Rei feels guilt as he sees his opponents drown in sorrow upon defeat.  The story masterfully depicts this in one scene \u2014  As Rei sees his opponent walk away in defeat, he then looks at his own palms, similar to how people look at their own shaking hands upon harming someone. He breaks down in turmoil of how he himself struggles with his problems, as he understands that relying on his proficiency in shogi to survive has to inevitably bring sadness to others if it means to avoid his own. This reminds us that we do not live in our own bubble and that whatever we do and whatever that happens to us has an alternate effect on others.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith this theme, comes the frequent \u2018Light vs Dark' theme that this show utilises.  It shows how certain happenings can have both a \u2018good' and \u2018bad' outcome/ effect. Be it a contrast between the visit of a friend and the visit of a relative, or the contrast between how Rei's Shogi opponents take their defeats with newfound motivation or self-destruction. \\n\\n\\n\r\nContrastingly, the characters in the story are not just black and white, but a mix of grey. Kyouko, though depicted as the brash sister who takes advantage of Rei's feeble personality, is shown to have a lot more depth to her character as she is actually far closer to Rei than she presumably is, she gives off the \u2018you really dislike but can't entirely hate her' kind of feeling. Rei himself isn't just a kind and feeble boy but also breaks down and shouts out his frustrations and his selfish desires to live on.  There are no character archetypes, no tropes, and each character acts and thinks like real people with their respective backgrounds and experiences.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion uses simple elements to show symbolism, it follows the basic principle of \u2018show, don't tell' faithfully. It does not spoon-feed the viewer, it isn't too cryptic either, it prioritises letting the viewers pick up on the underlying meaning of scenes on their own. Be it the emergence of water that drowns Rei to show the depressing and suffocating stage of life that he is enduring, or the bright colours of the Kuwamoto sisters' home, in contrast to the almost monochromic colours at his own home, to show the warmth that it exudes. Daily life moments that if looked closely has a much more profound meaning \u2013  the scene where Rei realizes how cold he is when he is not in the Kuwamoto household can also be a deeper illustration of how he begins to rely on the sisters like an emotional crutch, or even the game of Shogi where each move on the board looks like an emotional attack on Rei's opponents as he defeats them and feels guilt afterwards.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat's so good about Sangatsu no Lion is that it feels natural, watching Rei charge and his goals and embarrassingly stumble at one of his obstacles, him finding the friends and family he needs due to the emotional scars that he received, it sort of reminds us of our own lives doesn't it? Though this is indeed a work of fiction, it could as well be an autobiography and none would be the wiser.  It's not a  \u2018Slice of Life' that shows the typical everyday life of people, but a \u2018Slice of Life' showing the life of a person growing up on life's treacherous but meaningful journey.",

            "content": "Before you move forward and think of watching this anime, let me warn you this is not your typical anime. This is different. By no means do I mean it is bad different, it's good different.\r\nThe anime itself is paced like a book, like you are reading chapters of stages of life of Kiriyama Rei (The main character). The anime showcases the various highs and lows in his life and hence, how he develops from each of them. The basic premise of the story is that Kiriyama loses his parents at a young age and is adopted by his father's close friend who is ashougi enthusiast. Although, the series has a lot of scenes showcasing shougi being played, by no means are you required to have basic knowledge about shougi.\\n\r\nIn the 1st episode itself we see Kiriyama spending time with three sisters who are not related to him by blood but seem to be the only sweet little things keeping him together. As the story progresses we get to analyze his relationship with his colleagues both at school and at shougi, his father, his adoptive sister and other minor characters.\\n\r\nI personally liked the story a lot as it is very detailed and the viewer is many times given opportunity to think about the relationship of MC with other characters. Mostly the relation between the adoptive sister and Kiriyama has many levels to it. At once you feel that the two don't really like each other but there are hints showing that they are intimate in a different manner. \\n\r\nThe are is specially good. The art itself reveals a lot about how the scene is going to progress. You are able to determine if it is the cheerful part, the serious part, the sad part or the many plethora of emotions that the show showcases.\\n\r\nWhen I talk about sound I talk about the voice actors and the music. I won't lie, I like that starting and ending songs. Although many people tend to ignore this since the studios almost never make a mistake here but the voice actors perfectly fit the art of each character. They sound exactly the way you would expect a character to.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier this anime is like reading multiple chapters out of the life of Kiriyama rei and hence, I love how the character of the MC has developed in the anime. You also see character developments for the adoptive sister and only a little of the same for the three sisters.\\n\r\nWhen we talk about enjoyment, I wouldn't say it's something that is happy go lucky. It is something that begs you to think. Hence, I would say enjoyment is 7 out of 10. Given that you, like me consider enjoyment to be something cheerful and funny.\\n\r\nI award the show an 8 only pertaining to enjoyment. Otherwise I would say it could easily be a masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"should I watch this show?\" I believe you should. The animation invokes powerful emotions, the story carefully balances its drama with its cute slice of life moments, and the supporting cast is one of the most colorful ensembles in recent memory. The narrative touches on loss and isolation, and how those feelings can drive victims away from their families and circles of support. In this story, we see a young protagonist taking baby steps toward finding the strength to rely on others without feeling like a burden.\r\nOn the finer points: the protagonist narrates a lot. Not everyone will like this storytelling approach. However Kiriyama Reiinternalizes almost everything, so narration is something we should expect in a story like this. In fact it would feel weird without it. The art of the animation is stylized in such a way as to suggest the director didn't want us to forget that this all came from hand-drawn manga. That hand-drawn feeling has the power to draw you in, making you feel warm when it wants you to while leaving you feeling cold if it deems it necessary for the scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was one of the better things to come out of 2016. It was so great it even moved me to learn shogi and order my own set. While the show doesn't end with any particularly compelling cliffhanger, it gives you plenty of reasons to look forward to season 2: for starters, more shogi, more wacky opponents, and possibly more singing cats!",
