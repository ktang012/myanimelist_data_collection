            "content": "Believe it or not, the name \"Canaan\" is actually a reference to the Old Testament of the Bible, describing a land \"flowing with milk and honey\". Naturally, the name piqued my curiosity when I first saw it. I was quickly surprised when I saw that this anime is set in modern day, with the protagonist of the show bearing the same name as its title. I was left pleasantly surprised in the end, and found myself considering a re-watch of the show at some point.\r\nCanaan is essentially the story of a photographer named Maria, and her friendship with the mysterious girl named \u201cCanaan\u201d.  Mariaheads to China to do some investigative work, but quickly finds herself in need of protection from her friend as she winds up getting in way over her head. This anime is an excellent mixture of action, character development, and heartwarming moments. I\u2019ve rarely seen a story told so well in so few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10): You never know what you're going to get with short animes like Canaan. Much to my glee, this show is a gem among short animes. With a grand total of only 13 episodes, it's easily worth the amount of time spent watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is rather straightforward, and doesn't go through any exceptionally large twists. However, I found that this added, rather than detracted from the enjoyment value. The story is fairly simple, yet leaves you eager to watch the next episode and discover exactly what sinister force is behind the strange happenings.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil anything for you with any further synopsis (this anime is frankly far too short to bother with such things), but all you need to know is that while the story isn't the best I've yet seen, it was entertaining and fun to watch. Once again, you won't feel like you wasted your time. (Seriously, it's only 13 episodes, just give it a shot!) If you enjoy action shows, yet feel the need for good character development along the way, this anime would be an excellent choice for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)- This show stands out to me as one of the finest examples of animation out there. Now, seeing as there were only 13 episodes to animate, the creators were able to pay more attention to each one, giving much more care to detail, and smoothing out places other animes would have been forced to skip over. I especially enjoyed the depiction of the Chinese festival early in the show, where there was some truly beautiful scenery, even mixed with some very believable CGI. The various CGI effects are given just as much attention as the rest of the lush backgrounds, creating a very smooth and coherent mixture which is very pleasing to look at. This is probably one of the best drawn anime that I have yet seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10)-  this show is superbly voiced. This isn't the sort of show that demands for many truly brilliant performances, but the actors performed the demands made of them very admirably. The one notable exception to this is the role of \u201cHakko\u201d. I can\u2019t say much without spoiling anything, but Hakko has very little dialogue until the last few episodes of the show. Remaining mute for most of the show (except for a few groans and sighs), Hakko is later given some dialogue that is both immensely important, and emotionally moving. This was no easy task for any actor, especially given the important nature of her few lines. All in all, excellently done!\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was a good deal less memorable than the voice acting. It never stuck out to me as bad or unlikeable, but I never found myself thinking about the quality of music. It never really caught my ear, thus I couldn\u2019t rate it as high as I would have liked. In contrast, the opening song is catchy, and very appropriately themed for the show. Overall, the music was probably the weak point of the show, but that\u2019s hardly an insult in comparison with the quality of its other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)- Here is where the show truly shines. The role of protagonist is essentially shared by Canaan and Maria, as they are given about equal screen time and character development. Canaan is rather quiet, stoic, and rough, while Maria is friendly, outgoing, vivacious and fragile. This makes for an interesting combination, with Canaan being an ex-military, trained assassin, and Maria being an inquisitive photographer with a knack for getting into trouble.\\n\\n\r\nThese two share an interesting and unique friendship, which, much to my satisfaction, was devoid of any yuri themes. Their friendship is strong, and remains a driving force throughout the show. These two are supported by a cast of equally interesting supporting characters, each of which has a satisfactory, and interesting back story. Refreshingly, the villain of the show was far more than a mindless murderer, but had a story nearly as interesting as that of Canaan herself.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Canaan can be a bit boring (due largely in part to her stoic nature), Maria easily makes up for this with her lively, innocent, wide-eyed view of the world. Canaan has a darker side to her, dating back to her military training, which Maria is still too na\u00efve to see at the outset of the story. I found Maria to be an extremely lovable, and downright adorable character. While her constant repetition of the word \u201csugoi!\u201d (amazing) may annoy some viewers, I thought it depicted her innocence and sweet nature very well. Canaan\u2019s darker, quieter side provides an interesting balance to this duo.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are placed into some rather emotionally touching situations, even to the point of bringing me to tears. I cannot say why, for fear of spoilers, but I was highly impressed by the clever use of the characters back stories, and even their unique abilities (which are given to only a select few characters) to provide an emotional charge that many action shows lack entirely. You\u2019ll find a nice blend of action, character development, and even heart-wrenching moments that will bring you to the point of tears.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on, but I think I\u2019ve made my points clear. I grew to love each of the cast members, and I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll feel the same way if you give Canaan a chance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)- After all the bragging I\u2019ve done about this show, why only a 9? I had to knock off a point because it felt too short. The show easily could have been extended without dragging, and the ending left me feeling as though a sequel was in store. I have not heard of any plans for a sequel at this point, but the ending certainly left that possibility open. Ultimately, it was an extremely enjoyable anime, but really left me wishing for more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)- Certainly not the best anime I\u2019ve ever seen, but an excellent one, nonetheless. I highly recommend it to anyone. Even if you end up not liking it, you\u2019ll only have lost 6 \u00bd hours of your life, so why not? =)",

            "content": "To tell you the truth, I had no interest in CANAAN at all.  That all changed when at a local con, they decided to show CANAAN's Opening.  Solely from that, my interest in it grew and with it, I set out to find the promised land, CANAAN.\r\nNow let me begin with the story.  First of all, it is by no means badly paced.  No doubt, it was written in the anime description itself that anime was about all walks of life pulled together by a global conspiracy.  A conspiracy in which only start to come together as the story progresses.You'll not figure out everything from the start and by the end, most if not all your questions will be answered.  For some it may start off slow, but to tell you the truth, starting up like a Hong Kong action movie (set in Shanghai) is anything but slow.  The progression as the action ramps up and the mysteries answered is just perfect, leaving me quite satisfied with the ending.  However, they did slip up a bit.  The transition is jarring by segregating the last mini arc with Alphard before the conclusion but after the mystery was solved.\\n\\n\r\nWhat better way to accompany the story than with well-drawn art?  To say that it is well drawn is one thing, but most, if not everything, is recreated in great detail.  Even with the more intense action scenes, the quality stays well within the boundaries, never dropping too far below the quality of say, more static talking scenes.  I'm a minor gun nut as well so I must laud the military equipment on display.  Not just objects but characters too.  Liang Qi never would have seemed that 'troubled' without the appropriate art to render her neuroses.  There are points however, where the animation or the art could be better but that would just be nitpicking now.  I would say that overall, it is a solid showing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on the other hand is not as spectacular.  Sure the adrenaline rush inducing opening was indeed quite a treat, but that's just my bias towards rock music.  Conversely, it could be said that the ending is merely okay, but again, that is just musical bias.  The background music doesn't stand out particularly, it only acts up subtly and even then you have to actually pay attention to it if you really want to listen.  But really, that's not the point of background music anyway.  It keeps our attention firmly placed on the action, where its supposed to be.  There is also the voice acting, which, were it horrible I would comment more on it.  I don't follow any voice actors in particular and I find no fault in their delivery, so I'll have to say your mileage may vary.  Sound effects aren't extravagant either.  They seem realistic sounding enough to convince me they could be real.  Not that I'll be comparing the sound of gun fire to actual real guns.  Nope, not at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the characters.  Though it may be usual, the characterisation really shines for the big shots.  Canaan's maturation, mentally, is well done, seeing her having to face the consequences of her actions whilst she was more naive.  Or Maria's insecurities and little wishes, which by the end she seems to have come to terms with.  Or Alphard, in the end, trying to banishing the ghosts of the past.  Those who tag along for the ride as well are not given the cold shoulder, being treated with realistic conflicts and their ultimate resolution.  Whether it is Cummings' impossible love, Santana's guilt, Yun Yun's personality or Natsume's secrets.  Which is sort of a shame that some of the minor characters are still quite one sided, but I guess that's more an issue of not having enough screen time or a deliberate choice to have us focus on the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well, its hard to say I didn't enjoy this Hong Kong action anime (set in Shanghai).  The fight scenes particularly touching me the most, awing me time after time with the fluid animation and choreography.  That's the main highlight from me.  That is not to say I can't enjoy CANAAN as a whole though.  The plot in the end made sense, the characters made sense, and even some things may have made less sense than others, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment at all.  In my book, this is what I call a well rounded anime, probably one of the best to watch this season.  So to those still on the fence, I heartily recommend you to join me in the promised land, Canaan.\\n",

            "content": "This CANAAN review is for those who are a little bit sceptic about this show. If you have watched anime for a long time (like me) you will find this anime lacking, but it might intrigue the newcomers to the world of anime.\r\nAlright lets get this on the road. CANAAN is not unique, it does not offer anything special or new, on the contrary is rather average. Why? This show has been covered with a high animation budget, therefore it looks better than most anime. You have to admit anime trailers with good animation tend to stand out than other trailers. With good animation comesgood story, isn't that what you had in mind?\\n\\n\r\nWRONG (watched 9 episodes), you might tell me to stick to the end before reviewing this anime entirely, but I'm writing this review for you before considering watching an average show. If you are still not convinced, read on.\\n\\n\r\nCANAAN starts rather odd and might throw people off balance, which was for me a bad thing, it didn't intrigue me to watch further but since I try to have a policy of watching at least 2 episodes before judging. The main story is about Canaan, a typical stereotype gunslinger girl who obviously has issues from the past until she meet a friend who tries to get back to ''normal life'' (who is a very annoying stereotype). We meet people related to Canaan, not in the family way, they just share some sort of blood mark because of some incident. And that incident gave them some abilities, either good or bad. As you might have already guessed Canaan drew the longest straw in that contest, thats how average it gets. \\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences and animation is nothing new in the anime world, a little bit high jump and there, some dodging bullets, some villains doing the same here and there. It's not the same after Trinity showed how its supposed to be done. The antagonists are as stereotypical as Canaan herself, uncharismatic stereotypes, apparently they share some past ''cough''. \\n\\n\r\nSo is there anything good with this show, besides the good animation? Yes the sound, they actually put a lot of work in the little English that is spoken there. \\n\r\nIf you just recently started with anime, this definitely is a good watch for most.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you must watch crazy girls with guns with good animation, watch Black Lagoon or Full Metal Panic Second Raid (And yes I know its mainly a mecha show.). If those girls don't impress you then nothing does.",

            "content": "Guns, explosions, superpowers, and hot chicks duking it out in fast-paced action. Yeah, if there ever was a reason to watch this show, there you have it.  I guess that's legitimate enough.  Sorta.\r\nWhat's good about this show is the action, artwork, and sound/music. So at the very least, the show is aesthetically pleasing. \r\nThe problem with this show is pretty much everything else.  The plot, whatever it was, was pretty difficult to follow.  Maybe it was a combination of this show being hard to take seriously during random hilarity (like the HIGH TENSION taxi chase done CHINA STYLE) that ensued duringthe first few episodes, or maybe it was due to people making a lot of metaphoric statements that really don't relate to the viewer very well until the last three episodes. The intentions of the protagonist/antagonist forces are pretty vaguely explained late within the show, and whatever reason Alphard was doing stuff to make Canaan's life miserable, the more I think about it, the less sense it makes. And generally, the characters show very little development. The same behavior like Maria constantly idolizing Canaan or YunYun being a noisy flat-chested klutz gets pretty stale.\\n\\n\r\nAt any rate though, the plot really doesn't have particularly huge depth, despite being as confusing as it was. There weren't any real plot twists for the most part, nothing that really would blow your mind away as x character did something ridiculously huge that changed the direction the story was headed. Nothing like that ever happened. So really, the plot is ultimately nothing outstanding for all the trouble it goes through to pretend that there is a huge awesome story behind it.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one anime where I would tell you to watch a few specific episodes and ditch the rest of the show, this would be one of such. The first three or so episodes have some of the most epicly random action you will ever find in anime.  Although I guess 13 episodes isn't a huge waste of time, watching the last ten episodes I believe is ultimately a disappointment waiting to happen.",

            "content": "Right from the start, a certain \"emptiness\" can be felt as the general atmosphere. In a ravishing, but flawed universe set in Shanghai and later the deserts of the Middle East, a puzzling battle between several parties takes place.\r\nAmidst this chaos painted with many sentiments, an impressionistic tale of friendship, unrequited love and subconscious search for one's true nature. This hollow in the heart of each character isn't easily filled and tends to expand to the anime as well, leaving it flawed and to be taken as-is, without any resolve to tie up the loose ends.  \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nPlot itself is original. The \"real world\"conflict involving terrorists, secret organizations behind the government of USA and Japan, with a dash of genetic experiments (this is dealt in a realistic fashion) isn't often seen in the ocean of \"slices-of-life\", stories with supernatural phenomena and fighting animes. Bad thing is - it likes to open a lot of doors to deepen the personalities of characters, but does little to at least hint to a sensible reason behind some actions they take. This spot is usually supplemented with a variety of colors and their associations the main protagonist can see and the ongoing search for the meaning behind the name Canaan and its relation to the actual character of its bearer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFlashy, fluid, consistent. A select number of eye-pleasing color makes the palette of CANAAN. Action sequences show the character motions in their entirety rather than resorting to \"epileptic\" lines in the background as the means of portraying speed and resolve (a major plus). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nVoicing is good, but I can't really say it's anything more than that; in my opinion, there isn't anything exceptional to it. OP and ED are catchy and fit the anime well, surely worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThey are memorable and lively. Their actions are often confusing though, it's as if the makers of the anime wanted to add weight to their personalities by somewhat random and radical behavior but along the way forgot to fit all the reasons to support those.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHere CANAAN fails the most; to put it shortly, although technically you are supposed to be captivated by the bustling plot, action and general turmoil, you simply are not. I found myself often drifting away and forgetting what I was watching, by which time it was difficult to get back and realize what the hell was happening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n",

Unless you have played this game, the story will be confusing as some important events are left unexplored. The strong female leads, Canaan and Alphard, brought on the fast and furious action, but some of the characters were more comical than serious, especially the villains. Character development is quite slow. Some of the supporting characters seem irrelevant until late in the anime. \r\nStory (7)\r\nThe pacing for the anime is excellent.

However, the background behind the story is vague and confusing for those who have not played the game. The little of the story that Canaan does tell is pretty interesting. There is not a solid conclusion to the anime, and it provides an open ending. The plot is not exactly original, but it is entertaining. The government is the main villain who are injecting random people with deadly viruses to give them superpowers. \\n\\n\r\nYears ago, a terrorist organization called Snake performed an experiment in a ghost village known as Shibuya, which is several kilometers outside of Shanghai. It created an infection called the Ua-virus, which had very few surviving test subjects. The survivors from that village are broken into two categories: borners and non-borners. Borners have a purple mark on their body, giving them special abilities. They continue living by taking medication. Non-borners are like zombies, and their only chance of survival is to wear a special mascot head that blocks out UV rays and sound. No medicine can cure them. If the helmet is removed, they bleed out of their head and die instantly. The job is to stop Snake from creating more victims and find the cure to the virus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6)\\n\r\nCanaan and Alphard (Canaan\u2019s rival) are two active and serious characters in the anime by letting their guns do the talking. They are responsible for the entertaining nonstop action in the anime. Other secondary characters contribute to the series by solving the mystery within the plot. They show relevance to the story that helps viewers understand a few things about the background. \\n\\n\r\nCanaan greatly lacks character development, and the relationships between the characters are not fully explained. E.g. Canaan and Maria are best friends, but the series barely emphasized on the background of their friendship.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters, including the villains, take away the seriousness of the anime and makes it appear as a joke. Maria is introduced as a character who would play an active role in the story itself, but she turns out to be the character who always needs to be rescued by Canaan. She has a bubbly personality, jumping and screaming Canaan\u2019s name in excitement in the majority of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main villains, Liang Qi (Alphard\u2019s sister), primary objective is to please her sister by playing the \u201ckiller\u201d role in her presence in hopes of earning her praise. This is sometimes done by either pointing a gun to someone\u2019s head or playing with a BB gun. If Alphard ignored her, she\u2019d run off screaming or wailing.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the supporting characters appear irrelevant to the plot until near the ending. For example, Yunyun appears out of nowhere at random places but makes a contribution to the plot in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9)\\n\r\nP.A. Works, the animation studios responsible for series like Angel Beats, is responsible for the good quality. The settings are unique and detailed, especially the streets of Hong Kong during fighting scenes. Character designs are pretty good as well, suiting their personalities. For example, Maria is drawn as an energetic character. It distinguishes the characters that are affected with the Ua virus with detailed marks on their bodies, contributing to the plot in general. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\r\nI recommend watching it in English sub, because Canaan\u2019s Japanese voice actor has a more serious voice that is fit for an assassin. Her English voice sounds dull. The other characters\u2019 voices fit their personality regardless of the language. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music is not that attractive, but the OP and ED make up for it. The OP has a catchy tune to begin each episode, and the ED calms down the mood with a soothing tone. The closing song was my favorite, because it seems to fit your typical assassin anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6)\\n\r\nI watched Canaan in hopes of another powerful Noir or Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, but it was not as exciting because of the characters. Also, I was confused with the plot, because most of the important events are only in the game and not emphasized in the anime. I don\u2019t plan to re-watch it in the future, but its ED is one of my favorite songs in anime. The action is pretty good, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6)\\n\r\nCanaan has intriguing fighting scenes and detailed settings. It would\u2019ve been a more enjoyable series if the characters were more tolerable and serious for an assassin anime. The minor plot holes and lack of character development are disappointing, unless you\u2019ve played the game.",

I have always enjoyed TYPE-MOON's visual novels and other games, however their transitions to anime have not been quite as enjoyable. In fact, they have been quite bad. Tsukihime: Lunar Legend was disjointed, a problem only continued with their adaptation of Fate/Stay Night. However, CANAAN so far seems like they could finally get it right. I'll update this as the series continues and reaches it's end, however two points I can make now; CANAAN has amazingly nice artwork, and as of it's opening episode an engagingenough premise. Here's to hoping they do not encounter their all too common pacing issues.",

            "content": "I don't know what I was doing in 2009 that prevented me from watching Canaan when it aired. But as it is, I watched it about a month ago and I was blown away by how great it was. It captured my attention from the beginning, an art that some series could work on.\r\nStory [7/10]\r\n\"Soldiers who're born within destruction take hatred as their weapon. Listen, Canaan. You must not counter hatred with hatred...ever\".\r\nI just want to say that Canaan has one of the best intros ever. The combination of Siam's solemn voice and the sad, haunting violin music in the background just sent chills downmy spine.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite simple. It's not completely original, but it does have its own uniqueness. Basically, an organization called Snake performed an experiment on a small village, exposing its inhabitants to an infection known as the Ua-virus. The reasons for why this happened is explained later in the anime, so I won't go too deep into that. The story focuses on the survivors of the experiment. However, what truly makes Canaan stand out from all the other dark war stories is the twisted relationship between Canaan (the protagonist) and Alphard (the antagonist). Alphard believes that hate is her source of power and that by conquering and controlling it, she is unbelievably strong. She tries to prove this to Canaan (and also corrupt her) through tests and trials. I must say that Alphard is the coolest antagonist ever. Her raison d'etre is badass as hell. She and Canaan have an backstory that I wished the anime would have gone deeper into. \\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nCanaan aired in 2009. I almost couldn't believe that when I found it. It's art is well above the quality of the other series that existed in 2009. It's good enough that I could believe it was a 2012 anime if someone told me that. While the character design is awesome, the background/scenery could use a bit of work. The fight scenes are great. THE GREATEST. The animation quality of the fight scenes is definitely top notch.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nCanaan has some of the most exquisite violin music I've ever heard. It works perfectly with the mood of the anime. It induces a strong feeling of nostalgia and regret that just makes you appreciate relationship between Canaan and Alphard even more. I love the melody that Canaan, Siam, and Alphard hum.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as a Shanghainese speaker, the Shanghainese was pretty darn good. It's an amazing feeling to listen to a sub and be like woah, I understand that. I didn't look into the voice actors for some of the very very minor characters, but I could believe that they imported some Shanghainese people to voice stuff. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Canaan and Alphard is amazing, the more we learn about it. Canaan means \"the promised land\". It symbolizes pureness of heart, which is made more interesting by the fact that Alphard's old name used to be Canaan. Added on to this is the cute, heart pounding relationship between Canaan and Maria. The relationships between Santana and Hakko, Cummings and Liang Qi, and Liang Qi and Alphard are also great.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in Canaan have a purpose, excluding the truly minor background characters. There's nothing I hate more than a side character who contributes nothing to the flow of the plot. They all develop. Well, a large majority of them. In this sense, Canaan is one of the most complete and satisfying anime I've seen so far. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the awesome things I've mentioned before, Canaan falls a bit short in developing the background between some characters, namely Maria and Canaan. There's an unanswered question at the end that I'm still confused about and it drives me a bit insane sometimes. Also, the pace drops a bit around episode 8 or 9, where I almost dropped it but thank god I didn't. \\n\\n\r\nBut overall, watching Canaan is a wonderful and thrilling experience that'll leave you with a lot of feels.\\n",

            "content": "Anime based on video games are nothing rare. Even though it might seems like a terrible cross over, it is not to take into consideration. Just like books to anime, it could be either good or terrible. Based on the game 428,which earned a perfect score from Famitsu Weekly, CANAAN is a series with a predictable and slightly cliched story, but will still be fairly enjoyable for the viewer.\r\nThe story of CANAAN is predictable and cliched, but it does not mean it sucks. I have seen animes of the same length trying too hard for an original plot and in the end was filled withmassive holes. For a 13 episodes series, it would be a stupid move to try looking \"intelligent\" and offer a complex plot. Gladly, CANAAN as a simple plot and very easy to folllow. While the main story is based on revenge and protecting the ones you love, which are fairly overused aspects in animes, the UA virus and its relation with the government will back it up correctly. Sadly, the ending is the major flaw of the anime. It is very hard to forgive an anime for a bad ending, since it is usually what you remember the most, but I'm not saying the ending was worst than shit. In a comparison to the whole series, it did suck. I would compare it to impossible endings that often american movies would include in their motion pictures, cliched and irrational. In summary, the plot is fair.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in CANAAN is great, no doubt about that. While the characters were variated, some characters just had the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.The 3D didn't really appeal and seemed off from the rest of the art.  The real beauty is the background art.  The city of Shangai never felt so alive and dangerous, and the desert of the middle east looked like a land of despair. In other words, colorful and powerful.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, a great voice cast for the characters, their voice didn't feel awkward in any way and were perfectly suited. The animation opens with an opening theme that  blends well the style of the anime, action. As for the ending, it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nMemorable and simple minded characters is what CANAAN delivers. Memorable in any way you would think of. Some characters were unbelievable for their personalities, while some were memorable because they looked like ultimate retards, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. There can be complaint about not having enough background stories of few characters, but a 13 episodes series it is not something you'll always get and for good reasons. As I said earlier, getting too complex can get confusing and leave massive holes in the plot. You will instead receive the essential, enough to at least understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is af I was driving on a sine wave. Having its up and down, the enjoyment was not constant or wasn't building up. While I was thrilled with enjoyment on a scene, a next scene would crash it all and vice versa. I do not mind \"boring\" parts at all, and boring in mean of pointless dialogues and scenes that don't make progression in the stories, but CANAAN didn't blend it well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn overall, CANAAN is no doubt a good series. I wouldn't be reminded by it, nor will recommend it absolutely, but you will have fun watching it. And if you don't, well that's not really my problem.",

All these are clearly evident alongside small more tiedious themes.\r\nIt gives us an aspect and a veiw, a small peek into the mind of a strong-willed female lead as well as a weak, wavering one. \r\nThough some aspects are rather dark, supernatural and maybe hard to believe. But with a little patience the world of CANAAN envelopsyou, pulls you in to a fascinating world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI could not have asked for a better anime, lacking a bit in the animation area, though not in the action department! Very sold and beautiful art though The story may have some seemingly meaningless turns and twists though all builds up to an explosive and well grounded climax, something that can't be missed!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had not heard of the anime Canaan until i was reading a review on Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood trail and noticed it in the recommended section.\r\nAfter reading a synopsis of the story and watching a short preview i was baffled to see how this could appeal to anybody who liked the gritty, over the top action fest that is the Black Lagoon series.\r\nStill, needed a series to go to after the amazing Black Lagoon saga so i decided to give Canaan a shot anyway not expecting much. I have to say im glad i did since it is easily one of the best animeseries ive seen of late, im a very busy person and for me to spend the time to watch an entire anime series it must have very good production value (which is why generally i prefer OVAs).\\n\\n\r\nPA Works did an amazing job with this series, it is impeccably animated and the action scenes are fluid while still maintaining amazing details.\\n\r\nThe character design was a breath of fresh air to me as well, its nice to see female leads in an anime that actually look like they can pull off the stunts they do on screen.\\n\r\nCanaan herself is slender framed athletic and lightly muscular, her arch rival Alphard is also stunningly depicted, with an almost fitness model look to her. It must have been a difficult decision to draw them like this instead of the typical tiny waist big bust female characters which often seem to be the \"safe bet\" for many other series.\\n\r\nThe fight scenes between these characters are something you would expect to see in the most modern of action films (think along the lines of The Raid or John Wick). Details such as the weapons used are so good that i was easily able to recognise the FNH Five SeveN handgun used by Alphard the first time i saw it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is good, i suggest reading the Canaan back story from Type Moons 428 In a Blockaded Shibuya to get the best out of it. Its easily found online and will only take you 15min to glance through. I did it only afterwards yet still thoroughly enjoyed it, though i wish i would have done so before hand.\\n\r\nWhile the story can be slow placed at times, the relationship between Canaan and the female lead Maria is developed well in general, there are some questionable moments which you hope would be explored more later on but arent, it is still good as a whole. \\n\r\nMaria is arguably the lead character and the story is shown from her perspective in most cases, she starts of as a ditzy ahoge haired blonde who you think is going to be another annoying wet blanket holding back the action, but she gradually starts to think and show wisdom and maturity beyond her appearance and youll start to appreciate who she is and what she tries to ultimately (sometimes unsuccessfully) achieve.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many supporting characters, most of which are reasonably well developed. Mr Mido, Maria's work colleague is also funny yet serious when needed to be. Canaan keeps to her self, but she is hardly shy she is just not used to having much contact with normal people much, she is basically a La Femme Nikita style lone assassin who yearns for some friendship, which later becomes obvious she really wants.\\n\r\nThe character who steals the show for me though is Alphard, if you liked Revy from Black Lagoon im certain you will also love Alphard. She is truly interesting and her motives are not always clear until the end. However her calm and controlled demeanor paired with her devastating speed, strength and skill during combat make you respect or even admire her, even though she is a \"bad guy\". Despite not having any special powers she was a more than worthy adversary to Canaan right to the end, and you get the feeling that Canaan really did not like to take on Alphard. Alphard is extremely dedicated to her task.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the story which lacked some consistency and substance on a few occasions, the only other weakness for me was the soundtrack. After the brilliant opening which really sets the mood (i never skipped it once), the rest of soundtrack never quite lives up to that opening, which is a shame, the outro is notably disappointing.\\n\r\nI watched the dub, and its a top notch dub. I highly recommend it mainly since the voices used for Canaan and Alphard are spot on and match their tough on-screen appearances well, the Japanese version may be better in terms of Maria and some of the other characters, so ill leave that decision up to you which aspect you feel is more important.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its only 13 episodes so its definitely worth your time and money provided you are willing to forgive it for its few weaknesses, if you can you have a winner and future favorite of the genre in your hands. Hopefully they visit the story again for a second season, but that looks unlikely at this time unfortunately.",

            "content": "Canaan has a history that's bit unusual. The anime came before the manga or the light novel. But it is a sequel, to the critically acclaimed visual novel game 428: Fusa Sareta Shibuya de. The question is, is this sequel to a game that was only released in Japan accessible to people who have never heard of the game?\r\nCanaan's story opens with two Japanese journalists going to Shanghai. The two of them get separated and one of them finds herself in danger only to be saved by the mysterious Canaan, whom she has some connection with from the past. They quickly become involved in aplot involving a deadly virus and terrorism. Overall, the story is handled very well. You might expect it to get bogged down with references that you'd have to play the game to get but it does a good job of explaining everything that's important for the audience to know. The action sequences are really strong. It's fast paced, but not to the point where it gets ridiculous or feels rushed. It has love as a pretty important theme and, unlike a lot of things that use the same theme, it does a good job exploring both the positive and the negative aspects of it. Love is shown as a source of strength but it's also connected with insanity. That goes into a second important theme, duality. A lot of the characters, conflicts and other themes explore a dual structure. The themes are well handled most of the time. Although there are a few moments where they get exaggerated in a slightly ludicrous way. The biggest weakness to the story is that they have several flashbacks and a lot of them aren't necessary for the story so they just come off as filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done. They have complex motivations that are revealed during the story and are realistic for them. Every important character is complex and well developed. There aren't any characters who are extraneous to the plot. The protagonists and the antagonists both have sympathetic qualities that make them interesting and help strengthen the conflict. They also get some compelling dynamics that help move the plot forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. The characters are nicely detailed and the backgrounds are vibrant and lively. Things like planes and guns are very well detailed and look realistic. The art takes advantage of Canaan's unique senses in a way that's story relevant and helps you understand her without overly relying on those segments. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good. Sawashiro Miyuki, Sakamoto Maaya and Nanjo Yoshino all do fantastic jobs in their roles. The only real problem I had was that some of the English dialogue seems a little stiff and unnatural, but there are very few moments where they show people speaking English so it's not a big problem. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 7/10. Canaan and Maria have an incredibly homoerotic relationship which is well executed and adorable. Liang Qi also has a really obvious romantic interest in Alphard. But their relationship is not adorable. It's actually creepy. It's pretty obviously deliberate, so the whole difference between the two dynamics could be part of the duality theme.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Canaan is a 9/10. Its problems are pretty minor. It has excellent characters, a very well told story and really good action sequences. If you enjoyed Bakuretsu Tenshi or El Cazador de la Bruja you'll probably enjoy it as well.",

            "content": "Canaan has several things going for it:\r\n-While the overall plotline isn't particularly original, the human stories within each episode can work really well. Episode 10 is a real heartbreaker.\r\n-The animation quality is amazing. There is almost no reliance on panning stills, except when the characters actually are not moving. The action sequences move and flow like dances with all motions captured. The character designs are appropriate for a young-adult themed show. Even the backgrounds are memorable. The seedy yet modern depiction of Shanghai, especially in ep1, is a real eye-opener for a westerner.\r\n- Characters: I've found Hakko and Alphard to be especially memorable characters. Alphardis almost a tragic hero rather than a villain. Her psycho \"sister\" Lian Ji is the real evil here, and it seems Alphard doesn't really hate Canaan as much as Canaan hates her, except for the effect Canaan has on her team. Canaan's relationship with Maria (Isn't Maria Osawa the name of a Japanese porn star?) is also \"different\" as they are such complete opposites.\\n\r\n-Good DivX high resolution fansubs are available. Average visual quality of fansubs in general has gone up amazingly in the past 18 months.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside:\\n\r\n-The long-term plot is just a sci-fi, government-conspiracy action thriller.  It's a fine example of the genre, but apart from the flower design, the effects of the UA virus aren't particularly original, nor is pinning the whole experiment (in China???) on the CIA. I get the feeling of gaping holes in the logic here that I just haven't been able to spot.\\n\r\n- The male characters are pretty generic crusading investigators or wimps.\\n\\n\r\nNeutral \\n\r\n- The opening theme is cool and the themes during the show are fine. I haven't really listened to the closer.",

            "content": "Note: I haven\u2019t played/watched 428 yet, so this is only a review on the animation itself. Sorry if the review is a bit long. \r\nCanaan is one of the most underrated anime I have watched in the past years. This could be easily attributed to how horrible the guns-and-gals genre has been faring lately. One would think that it would be a brilliant concept to link two popular (yet greatly different) topics together, but time and time again the industry has proven that this conventional plot doesn\u2019t work. \r\nThen, you may ask, why would Canaan be any different?\r\nLet\u2019s start with first impressions. Like most ofmy friends, Canaan seemed like a very underwhelming production at first, probably due to the fact that the pictures that you can find about Canaan often have NO relation to the actual story itself. \\n\\n\r\nI have a habit of always finding the flaws of a work before appreciating its virtues, as discovering the good points of a masterpiece isn't difficult. However, I really couldn\u2019t find any flaws during the entire anime (this does not mean it doesn\u2019t have it flaws) but of course, in retrospect, there were certain elements that could have been done a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story is pretty rushed and fragmented. Throughout the story, we are introduced to a multitude of characters and interludes, some serving a lot more purpose than I thought, and some, vice versa. The audience is bombarded with many many sub-stories, and I daresay, digressions, as the work mentions quite a few interesting yet rather unfinished stories. On the first episodes, we are introduced to two journalists, Maria and Mino, looking for viable news-worthy titles in the huge city of Shanghai. The story accelerates exponentially, as they manage to spiral into a gunfight with masked men that the public seem to ignore. Without time to comprehend what just happened, our protagonist Canaan jumps out of nowhere and saves our dynamic duo, and somehow is an acquaintance with one of the journalists. One of the biggest plot holes in the story is the lack of background information. A tremendous amount of emphasis has been put on the character Maria, being the light that guides our heroine forward. However, the story mentions NOTHING about the affiliation between the two. This lackluster section would definitely make the audience question why our protagonist defends her with her life, and why she is the motivation for the story to go on. Continuing on with this problematic area, the story mentions numerous times that Maria has a minor case of retrograde amnesia, but gives no follow-up to this. We do not know what happened before Shanghai, and the audience is probably as lost as Maria is, and most of us will be scratching our heads when the characters in the story repeatedly inquires if she has truly lost her memory. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you look at the score I give, you\u2019ll realize that I find this series really amazing. Other than the few faults that I\u2019ve pointed out above, nearly everything is excellent, or even near perfect. (I\u2019ll try to give talk a bit about each section. \\n\\n\r\nThe visual aspect is absolutely stunning, even for today\u2019s standards. Unlike most anime where you might be able to say that a certain scene or character looks brilliant, Canaan has both. The characters are brilliantly drawn, and the scenery is almost as good as Shinkai Makoto\u2019s. The animation is extremely fluid, possibly due to its 29.976 frames per second, and the choreography (if that\u2019s the right word) for the characters are simply really well thought out. There isn\u2019t a scene in the entire series that feels stiff or rigid, and even the monotone Canaan displays a good array of emotions given that she has such a small pool of emotions. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio aspect is equivalently fabulous, and it\u2019s the only reason I managed to know about this work. The music is extremely fitting, be it the opening or the ending, and the variety in the two gives the audience both a sense of excitement and tranquility. The music serves a great purpose, as it not only starts the episode off with a bang, but also reminds the audience of the core storyline. On a side note, the performances of the voice actors are beyond amazing. Canaan displays quite a wide range of characters, with some being exceptionally difficult to portray (such as Liang). Yet, each seiyuu performs his/her job perfectly, and even monotonous characters like Canaan feel are illustrated vividly. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all this, my favorite is the characterization. On the surface of the matter, Canaan uses archetypically clich\u00e9 characters. A kind hearted, weak body, yet strong minded protagonist, a seemingly apathetical, yet in reality is the most caring accomplice, and a powerful, yet puzzled gun-girl are all characters we have seen way too many times. Conversely, Canaan does a good job in directing the audience in the right direction. In contrary to the many characters that aim to achieve superficial and unrealistic goals, such as world peace (or domination) or a brighter future, our protagonist has a truthful, yet effective ideal. The reason that she fights is simple, she does not want to lose what she holds precious again. The depictions of the characters are immensely lively and realistic, each doing what they feel right themselves, be it for friendship, or for love. Each character serves an irreplaceable part in the overall story, and each segment of the journey tells us a bit more about them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point that is worth noting is the attention to details. There are many subtle elements that the casual viewer may miss. For example, even the name of the characters shed light to the story itself. The religious allusion of the name Canaan being the land of hope adds a second layer to the story, and even the name Maria gives an indication of her role. Many foreshadows appear, such as the discussion of sunny weather, and other motifs like the camera or the Pocky that Canaan is always chewing on, give further confirmation and hints to the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhile accepting the imperfections of the story, Canaan has one of the most thrilling and sophisticated plots of all time. One should complete disregard any first impressions on this work, as it most definitely is an unfair judgment. The production strikes a perfect balance between the emphasis on characters and plot, making the story both character and plot driven; the work doesn\u2019t feel like a shonen anime that features the mishaps of the protagonists, nor does it feel like a war-time anime which often overlooks how the characters develop. The overarching story of the conflict between Alphard and Canaan opens up many possibilities for parallel (yet slightly sub-par) stories, such as the intertwined touches of romance. Moreover, viewers will quickly understand the effect of minor characters on the work, and the entire reason for the richness in story is due to the diversity in characters. Every single action is useful, be it the dialogue between two characters, or the small gestures of kindness displayed towards one another. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Canaan is definitely a masterpiece. The focus on both an intellectual and an emotional level concoct a beautiful result. It is definitely worth your time.\\n",

Naturally, the name piqued my curiosity when I first saw it. I was quickly surprised when I saw that this anime is set in modern day, with the protagonist of the show bearing the same name as its title. I was left pleasantly surprised in the end, and found myself considering a re-watch of the show at some point.\r\nCanaan is essentially the story of a photographer named Maria, and her friendship with the mysterious girl named \u201cCanaan\u201d.  Mariaheads to China to do some investigative work, but quickly finds herself in need of protection from her friend as she winds up getting in way over her head.

Much to my glee, this show is a gem among short animes. With a grand total of only 13 episodes, it's easily worth the amount of time spent watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is rather straightforward, and doesn't go through any exceptionally large twists. However, I found that this added, rather than detracted from the enjoyment value. The story is fairly simple, yet leaves you eager to watch the next episode and discover exactly what sinister force is behind the strange happenings.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil anything for you with any further synopsis (this anime is frankly far too short to bother with such things), but all you need to know is that while the story isn't the best I've yet seen, it was entertaining and fun to watch. Once again, you won't feel like you wasted your time. (Seriously, it's only 13 episodes, just give it a shot!) If you enjoy action shows, yet feel the need for good character development along the way, this anime would be an excellent choice for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)- This show stands out to me as one of the finest examples of animation out there. Now, seeing as there were only 13 episodes to animate, the creators were able to pay more attention to each one, giving much more care to detail, and smoothing out places other animes would have been forced to skip over. I especially enjoyed the depiction of the Chinese festival early in the show, where there was some truly beautiful scenery, even mixed with some very believable CGI. The various CGI effects are given just as much attention as the rest of the lush backgrounds, creating a very smooth and coherent mixture which is very pleasing to look at. This is probably one of the best drawn anime that I have yet seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10)-  this show is superbly voiced. This isn't the sort of show that demands for many truly brilliant performances, but the actors performed the demands made of them very admirably. The one notable exception to this is the role of \u201cHakko\u201d. I can\u2019t say much without spoiling anything, but Hakko has very little dialogue until the last few episodes of the show. Remaining mute for most of the show (except for a few groans and sighs), Hakko is later given some dialogue that is both immensely important, and emotionally moving. This was no easy task for any actor, especially given the important nature of her few lines. All in all, excellently done!\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was a good deal less memorable than the voice acting. It never stuck out to me as bad or unlikeable, but I never found myself thinking about the quality of music. It never really caught my ear, thus I couldn\u2019t rate it as high as I would have liked. In contrast, the opening song is catchy, and very appropriately themed for the show. Overall, the music was probably the weak point of the show, but that\u2019s hardly an insult in comparison with the quality of its other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)- Here is where the show truly shines. The role of protagonist is essentially shared by Canaan and Maria, as they are given about equal screen time and character development. Canaan is rather quiet, stoic, and rough, while Maria is friendly, outgoing, vivacious and fragile. This makes for an interesting combination, with Canaan being an ex-military, trained assassin, and Maria being an inquisitive photographer with a knack for getting into trouble.\\n\\n\r\nThese two share an interesting and unique friendship, which, much to my satisfaction, was devoid of any yuri themes. Their friendship is strong, and remains a driving force throughout the show. These two are supported by a cast of equally interesting supporting characters, each of which has a satisfactory, and interesting back story. Refreshingly, the villain of the show was far more than a mindless murderer, but had a story nearly as interesting as that of Canaan herself.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Canaan can be a bit boring (due largely in part to her stoic nature), Maria easily makes up for this with her lively, innocent, wide-eyed view of the world. Canaan has a darker side to her, dating back to her military training, which Maria is still too na\u00efve to see at the outset of the story. I found Maria to be an extremely lovable, and downright adorable character. While her constant repetition of the word \u201csugoi!\u201d (amazing) may annoy some viewers, I thought it depicted her innocence and sweet nature very well. Canaan\u2019s darker, quieter side provides an interesting balance to this duo.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are placed into some rather emotionally touching situations, even to the point of bringing me to tears. I cannot say why, for fear of spoilers, but I was highly impressed by the clever use of the characters back stories, and even their unique abilities (which are given to only a select few characters) to provide an emotional charge that many action shows lack entirely. You\u2019ll find a nice blend of action, character development, and even heart-wrenching moments that will bring you to the point of tears.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on, but I think I\u2019ve made my points clear. I grew to love each of the cast members, and I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll feel the same way if you give Canaan a chance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)- After all the bragging I\u2019ve done about this show, why only a 9? I had to knock off a point because it felt too short. The show easily could have been extended without dragging, and the ending left me feeling as though a sequel was in store. I have not heard of any plans for a sequel at this point, but the ending certainly left that possibility open. Ultimately, it was an extremely enjoyable anime, but really left me wishing for more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)- Certainly not the best anime I\u2019ve ever seen, but an excellent one, nonetheless. I highly recommend it to anyone. Even if you end up not liking it, you\u2019ll only have lost 6 \u00bd hours of your life, so why not? =)",

            "content": "To tell you the truth, I had no interest in CANAAN at all.  That all changed when at a local con, they decided to show CANAAN's Opening.  Solely from that, my interest in it grew and with it, I set out to find the promised land, CANAAN.\r\nNow let me begin with the story.  First of all, it is by no means badly paced.  No doubt, it was written in the anime description itself that anime was about all walks of life pulled together by a global conspiracy.  A conspiracy in which only start to come together as the story progresses.You'll not figure out everything from the start and by the end, most if not all your questions will be answered.  For some it may start off slow, but to tell you the truth, starting up like a Hong Kong action movie (set in Shanghai) is anything but slow.  The progression as the action ramps up and the mysteries answered is just perfect, leaving me quite satisfied with the ending.  However, they did slip up a bit.  The transition is jarring by segregating the last mini arc with Alphard before the conclusion but after the mystery was solved.\\n\\n\r\nWhat better way to accompany the story than with well-drawn art?  To say that it is well drawn is one thing, but most, if not everything, is recreated in great detail.  Even with the more intense action scenes, the quality stays well within the boundaries, never dropping too far below the quality of say, more static talking scenes.  I'm a minor gun nut as well so I must laud the military equipment on display.  Not just objects but characters too.  Liang Qi never would have seemed that 'troubled' without the appropriate art to render her neuroses.  There are points however, where the animation or the art could be better but that would just be nitpicking now.  I would say that overall, it is a solid showing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound on the other hand is not as spectacular.  Sure the adrenaline rush inducing opening was indeed quite a treat, but that's just my bias towards rock music.  Conversely, it could be said that the ending is merely okay, but again, that is just musical bias.  The background music doesn't stand out particularly, it only acts up subtly and even then you have to actually pay attention to it if you really want to listen.  But really, that's not the point of background music anyway.  It keeps our attention firmly placed on the action, where its supposed to be.  There is also the voice acting, which, were it horrible I would comment more on it.  I don't follow any voice actors in particular and I find no fault in their delivery, so I'll have to say your mileage may vary.  Sound effects aren't extravagant either.  They seem realistic sounding enough to convince me they could be real.  Not that I'll be comparing the sound of gun fire to actual real guns.  Nope, not at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the characters.  Though it may be usual, the characterisation really shines for the big shots.  Canaan's maturation, mentally, is well done, seeing her having to face the consequences of her actions whilst she was more naive.  Or Maria's insecurities and little wishes, which by the end she seems to have come to terms with.  Or Alphard, in the end, trying to banishing the ghosts of the past.  Those who tag along for the ride as well are not given the cold shoulder, being treated with realistic conflicts and their ultimate resolution.  Whether it is Cummings' impossible love, Santana's guilt, Yun Yun's personality or Natsume's secrets.  Which is sort of a shame that some of the minor characters are still quite one sided, but I guess that's more an issue of not having enough screen time or a deliberate choice to have us focus on the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well, its hard to say I didn't enjoy this Hong Kong action anime (set in Shanghai).  The fight scenes particularly touching me the most, awing me time after time with the fluid animation and choreography.  That's the main highlight from me.  That is not to say I can't enjoy CANAAN as a whole though.  The plot in the end made sense, the characters made sense, and even some things may have made less sense than others, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment at all.  In my book, this is what I call a well rounded anime, probably one of the best to watch this season.  So to those still on the fence, I heartily recommend you to join me in the promised land, Canaan.\\n",

            "content": "This CANAAN review is for those who are a little bit sceptic about this show. If you have watched anime for a long time (like me) you will find this anime lacking, but it might intrigue the newcomers to the world of anime.\r\nAlright lets get this on the road. CANAAN is not unique, it does not offer anything special or new, on the contrary is rather average. Why? This show has been covered with a high animation budget, therefore it looks better than most anime. You have to admit anime trailers with good animation tend to stand out than other trailers. With good animation comesgood story, isn't that what you had in mind?\\n\\n\r\nWRONG (watched 9 episodes), you might tell me to stick to the end before reviewing this anime entirely, but I'm writing this review for you before considering watching an average show. If you are still not convinced, read on.\\n\\n\r\nCANAAN starts rather odd and might throw people off balance, which was for me a bad thing, it didn't intrigue me to watch further but since I try to have a policy of watching at least 2 episodes before judging. The main story is about Canaan, a typical stereotype gunslinger girl who obviously has issues from the past until she meet a friend who tries to get back to ''normal life'' (who is a very annoying stereotype). We meet people related to Canaan, not in the family way, they just share some sort of blood mark because of some incident. And that incident gave them some abilities, either good or bad. As you might have already guessed Canaan drew the longest straw in that contest, thats how average it gets. \\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences and animation is nothing new in the anime world, a little bit high jump and there, some dodging bullets, some villains doing the same here and there. It's not the same after Trinity showed how its supposed to be done. The antagonists are as stereotypical as Canaan herself, uncharismatic stereotypes, apparently they share some past ''cough''. \\n\\n\r\nSo is there anything good with this show, besides the good animation? Yes the sound, they actually put a lot of work in the little English that is spoken there. \\n\r\nIf you just recently started with anime, this definitely is a good watch for most.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you must watch crazy girls with guns with good animation, watch Black Lagoon or Full Metal Panic Second Raid (And yes I know its mainly a mecha show.). If those girls don't impress you then nothing does.",

            "content": "Guns, explosions, superpowers, and hot chicks duking it out in fast-paced action. Yeah, if there ever was a reason to watch this show, there you have it.  I guess that's legitimate enough.  Sorta.\r\nWhat's good about this show is the action, artwork, and sound/music. So at the very least, the show is aesthetically pleasing. \r\nThe problem with this show is pretty much everything else.  The plot, whatever it was, was pretty difficult to follow.  Maybe it was a combination of this show being hard to take seriously during random hilarity (like the HIGH TENSION taxi chase done CHINA STYLE) that ensued duringthe first few episodes, or maybe it was due to people making a lot of metaphoric statements that really don't relate to the viewer very well until the last three episodes. The intentions of the protagonist/antagonist forces are pretty vaguely explained late within the show, and whatever reason Alphard was doing stuff to make Canaan's life miserable, the more I think about it, the less sense it makes. And generally, the characters show very little development. The same behavior like Maria constantly idolizing Canaan or YunYun being a noisy flat-chested klutz gets pretty stale.\\n\\n\r\nAt any rate though, the plot really doesn't have particularly huge depth, despite being as confusing as it was. There weren't any real plot twists for the most part, nothing that really would blow your mind away as x character did something ridiculously huge that changed the direction the story was headed. Nothing like that ever happened. So really, the plot is ultimately nothing outstanding for all the trouble it goes through to pretend that there is a huge awesome story behind it.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one anime where I would tell you to watch a few specific episodes and ditch the rest of the show, this would be one of such. The first three or so episodes have some of the most epicly random action you will ever find in anime.  Although I guess 13 episodes isn't a huge waste of time, watching the last ten episodes I believe is ultimately a disappointment waiting to happen.",

            "content": "Right from the start, a certain \"emptiness\" can be felt as the general atmosphere. In a ravishing, but flawed universe set in Shanghai and later the deserts of the Middle East, a puzzling battle between several parties takes place.\r\nAmidst this chaos painted with many sentiments, an impressionistic tale of friendship, unrequited love and subconscious search for one's true nature. This hollow in the heart of each character isn't easily filled and tends to expand to the anime as well, leaving it flawed and to be taken as-is, without any resolve to tie up the loose ends.  \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nPlot itself is original. The \"real world\"conflict involving terrorists, secret organizations behind the government of USA and Japan, with a dash of genetic experiments (this is dealt in a realistic fashion) isn't often seen in the ocean of \"slices-of-life\", stories with supernatural phenomena and fighting animes. Bad thing is - it likes to open a lot of doors to deepen the personalities of characters, but does little to at least hint to a sensible reason behind some actions they take. This spot is usually supplemented with a variety of colors and their associations the main protagonist can see and the ongoing search for the meaning behind the name Canaan and its relation to the actual character of its bearer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFlashy, fluid, consistent. A select number of eye-pleasing color makes the palette of CANAAN. Action sequences show the character motions in their entirety rather than resorting to \"epileptic\" lines in the background as the means of portraying speed and resolve (a major plus). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nVoicing is good, but I can't really say it's anything more than that; in my opinion, there isn't anything exceptional to it. OP and ED are catchy and fit the anime well, surely worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThey are memorable and lively. Their actions are often confusing though, it's as if the makers of the anime wanted to add weight to their personalities by somewhat random and radical behavior but along the way forgot to fit all the reasons to support those.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHere CANAAN fails the most; to put it shortly, although technically you are supposed to be captivated by the bustling plot, action and general turmoil, you simply are not. I found myself often drifting away and forgetting what I was watching, by which time it was difficult to get back and realize what the hell was happening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n",

            "content": "Canaan is an assassin anime with excellent animation and intriguing fighting scenes. However, Canaan is a sequel to its game called 428: F\u016bsa Sareta Shibuya de. Unless you have played this game, the story will be confusing as some important events are left unexplored. The strong female leads, Canaan and Alphard, brought on the fast and furious action, but some of the characters were more comical than serious, especially the villains. Character development is quite slow. Some of the supporting characters seem irrelevant until late in the anime. \r\nStory (7)\r\nThe pacing for the anime is excellent. The series immediately begins with fast action and laterbecomes something deeper with tragic and dramatic events. However, the background behind the story is vague and confusing for those who have not played the game. The little of the story that Canaan does tell is pretty interesting. There is not a solid conclusion to the anime, and it provides an open ending. The plot is not exactly original, but it is entertaining. The government is the main villain who are injecting random people with deadly viruses to give them superpowers. \\n\\n\r\nYears ago, a terrorist organization called Snake performed an experiment in a ghost village known as Shibuya, which is several kilometers outside of Shanghai. It created an infection called the Ua-virus, which had very few surviving test subjects. The survivors from that village are broken into two categories: borners and non-borners. Borners have a purple mark on their body, giving them special abilities. They continue living by taking medication. Non-borners are like zombies, and their only chance of survival is to wear a special mascot head that blocks out UV rays and sound. No medicine can cure them. If the helmet is removed, they bleed out of their head and die instantly. The job is to stop Snake from creating more victims and find the cure to the virus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6)\\n\r\nCanaan and Alphard (Canaan\u2019s rival) are two active and serious characters in the anime by letting their guns do the talking. They are responsible for the entertaining nonstop action in the anime. Other secondary characters contribute to the series by solving the mystery within the plot. They show relevance to the story that helps viewers understand a few things about the background. \\n\\n\r\nCanaan greatly lacks character development, and the relationships between the characters are not fully explained. E.g. Canaan and Maria are best friends, but the series barely emphasized on the background of their friendship.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters, including the villains, take away the seriousness of the anime and makes it appear as a joke. Maria is introduced as a character who would play an active role in the story itself, but she turns out to be the character who always needs to be rescued by Canaan. She has a bubbly personality, jumping and screaming Canaan\u2019s name in excitement in the majority of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main villains, Liang Qi (Alphard\u2019s sister), primary objective is to please her sister by playing the \u201ckiller\u201d role in her presence in hopes of earning her praise. This is sometimes done by either pointing a gun to someone\u2019s head or playing with a BB gun. If Alphard ignored her, she\u2019d run off screaming or wailing.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the supporting characters appear irrelevant to the plot until near the ending. For example, Yunyun appears out of nowhere at random places but makes a contribution to the plot in the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9)\\n\r\nP.A. Works, the animation studios responsible for series like Angel Beats, is responsible for the good quality. The settings are unique and detailed, especially the streets of Hong Kong during fighting scenes. Character designs are pretty good as well, suiting their personalities. For example, Maria is drawn as an energetic character. It distinguishes the characters that are affected with the Ua virus with detailed marks on their bodies, contributing to the plot in general. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\r\nI recommend watching it in English sub, because Canaan\u2019s Japanese voice actor has a more serious voice that is fit for an assassin. Her English voice sounds dull. The other characters\u2019 voices fit their personality regardless of the language. \\n\\n\r\nThe background music is not that attractive, but the OP and ED make up for it. The OP has a catchy tune to begin each episode, and the ED calms down the mood with a soothing tone. The closing song was my favorite, because it seems to fit your typical assassin anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6)\\n\r\nI watched Canaan in hopes of another powerful Noir or Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, but it was not as exciting because of the characters. Also, I was confused with the plot, because most of the important events are only in the game and not emphasized in the anime. I don\u2019t plan to re-watch it in the future, but its ED is one of my favorite songs in anime. The action is pretty good, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6)\\n\r\nCanaan has intriguing fighting scenes and detailed settings. It would\u2019ve been a more enjoyable series if the characters were more tolerable and serious for an assassin anime. The minor plot holes and lack of character development are disappointing, unless you\u2019ve played the game.",

I have always enjoyed TYPE-MOON's visual novels and other games, however their transitions to anime have not been quite as enjoyable. In fact, they have been quite bad. Tsukihime: Lunar Legend was disjointed, a problem only continued with their adaptation of Fate/Stay Night. However, CANAAN so far seems like they could finally get it right. I'll update this as the series continues and reaches it's end, however two points I can make now; CANAAN has amazingly nice artwork, and as of it's opening episode an engagingenough premise. Here's to hoping they do not encounter their all too common pacing issues.",

            "content": "I don't know what I was doing in 2009 that prevented me from watching Canaan when it aired. But as it is, I watched it about a month ago and I was blown away by how great it was. It captured my attention from the beginning, an art that some series could work on.\r\nStory [7/10]\r\n\"Soldiers who're born within destruction take hatred as their weapon. Listen, Canaan. You must not counter hatred with hatred...ever\".\r\nI just want to say that Canaan has one of the best intros ever. The combination of Siam's solemn voice and the sad, haunting violin music in the background just sent chills downmy spine.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite simple. It's not completely original, but it does have its own uniqueness. Basically, an organization called Snake performed an experiment on a small village, exposing its inhabitants to an infection known as the Ua-virus. The reasons for why this happened is explained later in the anime, so I won't go too deep into that. The story focuses on the survivors of the experiment. However, what truly makes Canaan stand out from all the other dark war stories is the twisted relationship between Canaan (the protagonist) and Alphard (the antagonist). Alphard believes that hate is her source of power and that by conquering and controlling it, she is unbelievably strong. She tries to prove this to Canaan (and also corrupt her) through tests and trials. I must say that Alphard is the coolest antagonist ever. Her raison d'etre is badass as hell. She and Canaan have an backstory that I wished the anime would have gone deeper into. \\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nCanaan aired in 2009. I almost couldn't believe that when I found it. It's art is well above the quality of the other series that existed in 2009. It's good enough that I could believe it was a 2012 anime if someone told me that. While the character design is awesome, the background/scenery could use a bit of work. The fight scenes are great. THE GREATEST. The animation quality of the fight scenes is definitely top notch.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nCanaan has some of the most exquisite violin music I've ever heard. It works perfectly with the mood of the anime. It induces a strong feeling of nostalgia and regret that just makes you appreciate relationship between Canaan and Alphard even more. I love the melody that Canaan, Siam, and Alphard hum.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as a Shanghainese speaker, the Shanghainese was pretty darn good. It's an amazing feeling to listen to a sub and be like woah, I understand that. I didn't look into the voice actors for some of the very very minor characters, but I could believe that they imported some Shanghainese people to voice stuff. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Canaan and Alphard is amazing, the more we learn about it. Canaan means \"the promised land\". It symbolizes pureness of heart, which is made more interesting by the fact that Alphard's old name used to be Canaan. Added on to this is the cute, heart pounding relationship between Canaan and Maria. The relationships between Santana and Hakko, Cummings and Liang Qi, and Liang Qi and Alphard are also great.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in Canaan have a purpose, excluding the truly minor background characters. There's nothing I hate more than a side character who contributes nothing to the flow of the plot. They all develop. Well, a large majority of them. In this sense, Canaan is one of the most complete and satisfying anime I've seen so far. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the awesome things I've mentioned before, Canaan falls a bit short in developing the background between some characters, namely Maria and Canaan. There's an unanswered question at the end that I'm still confused about and it drives me a bit insane sometimes. Also, the pace drops a bit around episode 8 or 9, where I almost dropped it but thank god I didn't. \\n\\n\r\nBut overall, watching Canaan is a wonderful and thrilling experience that'll leave you with a lot of feels.\\n",

            "content": "Anime based on video games are nothing rare. Even though it might seems like a terrible cross over, it is not to take into consideration. Just like books to anime, it could be either good or terrible. Based on the game 428,which earned a perfect score from Famitsu Weekly, CANAAN is a series with a predictable and slightly cliched story, but will still be fairly enjoyable for the viewer.\r\nThe story of CANAAN is predictable and cliched, but it does not mean it sucks. I have seen animes of the same length trying too hard for an original plot and in the end was filled withmassive holes. For a 13 episodes series, it would be a stupid move to try looking \"intelligent\" and offer a complex plot. Gladly, CANAAN as a simple plot and very easy to folllow. While the main story is based on revenge and protecting the ones you love, which are fairly overused aspects in animes, the UA virus and its relation with the government will back it up correctly. Sadly, the ending is the major flaw of the anime. It is very hard to forgive an anime for a bad ending, since it is usually what you remember the most, but I'm not saying the ending was worst than shit. In a comparison to the whole series, it did suck. I would compare it to impossible endings that often american movies would include in their motion pictures, cliched and irrational. In summary, the plot is fair.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in CANAAN is great, no doubt about that. While the characters were variated, some characters just had the feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.The 3D didn't really appeal and seemed off from the rest of the art.  The real beauty is the background art.  The city of Shangai never felt so alive and dangerous, and the desert of the middle east looked like a land of despair. In other words, colorful and powerful.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, a great voice cast for the characters, their voice didn't feel awkward in any way and were perfectly suited. The animation opens with an opening theme that  blends well the style of the anime, action. As for the ending, it was alright.\\n\\n\r\nMemorable and simple minded characters is what CANAAN delivers. Memorable in any way you would think of. Some characters were unbelievable for their personalities, while some were memorable because they looked like ultimate retards, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. There can be complaint about not having enough background stories of few characters, but a 13 episodes series it is not something you'll always get and for good reasons. As I said earlier, getting too complex can get confusing and leave massive holes in the plot. You will instead receive the essential, enough to at least understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is af I was driving on a sine wave. Having its up and down, the enjoyment was not constant or wasn't building up. While I was thrilled with enjoyment on a scene, a next scene would crash it all and vice versa. I do not mind \"boring\" parts at all, and boring in mean of pointless dialogues and scenes that don't make progression in the stories, but CANAAN didn't blend it well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn overall, CANAAN is no doubt a good series. I wouldn't be reminded by it, nor will recommend it absolutely, but you will have fun watching it. And if you don't, well that's not really my problem.",

All these are clearly evident alongside small more tiedious themes.\r\nIt gives us an aspect and a veiw, a small peek into the mind of a strong-willed female lead as well as a weak, wavering one. \r\nThough some aspects are rather dark, supernatural and maybe hard to believe. But with a little patience the world of CANAAN envelopsyou, pulls you in to a fascinating world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI could not have asked for a better anime, lacking a bit in the animation area, though not in the action department! Very sold and beautiful art though The story may have some seemingly meaningless turns and twists though all builds up to an explosive and well grounded climax, something that can't be missed!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had not heard of the anime Canaan until i was reading a review on Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood trail and noticed it in the recommended section.\r\nAfter reading a synopsis of the story and watching a short preview i was baffled to see how this could appeal to anybody who liked the gritty, over the top action fest that is the Black Lagoon series.\r\nStill, needed a series to go to after the amazing Black Lagoon saga so i decided to give Canaan a shot anyway not expecting much. I have to say im glad i did since it is easily one of the best animeseries ive seen of late, im a very busy person and for me to spend the time to watch an entire anime series it must have very good production value (which is why generally i prefer OVAs).\\n\\n\r\nPA Works did an amazing job with this series, it is impeccably animated and the action scenes are fluid while still maintaining amazing details.\\n\r\nThe character design was a breath of fresh air to me as well, its nice to see female leads in an anime that actually look like they can pull off the stunts they do on screen.\\n\r\nCanaan herself is slender framed athletic and lightly muscular, her arch rival Alphard is also stunningly depicted, with an almost fitness model look to her. It must have been a difficult decision to draw them like this instead of the typical tiny waist big bust female characters which often seem to be the \"safe bet\" for many other series.\\n\r\nThe fight scenes between these characters are something you would expect to see in the most modern of action films (think along the lines of The Raid or John Wick). Details such as the weapons used are so good that i was easily able to recognise the FNH Five SeveN handgun used by Alphard the first time i saw it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is good, i suggest reading the Canaan back story from Type Moons 428 In a Blockaded Shibuya to get the best out of it. Its easily found online and will only take you 15min to glance through. I did it only afterwards yet still thoroughly enjoyed it, though i wish i would have done so before hand.\\n\r\nWhile the story can be slow placed at times, the relationship between Canaan and the female lead Maria is developed well in general, there are some questionable moments which you hope would be explored more later on but arent, it is still good as a whole. \\n\r\nMaria is arguably the lead character and the story is shown from her perspective in most cases, she starts of as a ditzy ahoge haired blonde who you think is going to be another annoying wet blanket holding back the action, but she gradually starts to think and show wisdom and maturity beyond her appearance and youll start to appreciate who she is and what she tries to ultimately (sometimes unsuccessfully) achieve.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many supporting characters, most of which are reasonably well developed. Mr Mido, Maria's work colleague is also funny yet serious when needed to be. Canaan keeps to her self, but she is hardly shy she is just not used to having much contact with normal people much, she is basically a La Femme Nikita style lone assassin who yearns for some friendship, which later becomes obvious she really wants.\\n\r\nThe character who steals the show for me though is Alphard, if you liked Revy from Black Lagoon im certain you will also love Alphard. She is truly interesting and her motives are not always clear until the end. However her calm and controlled demeanor paired with her devastating speed, strength and skill during combat make you respect or even admire her, even though she is a \"bad guy\". Despite not having any special powers she was a more than worthy adversary to Canaan right to the end, and you get the feeling that Canaan really did not like to take on Alphard. Alphard is extremely dedicated to her task.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the story which lacked some consistency and substance on a few occasions, the only other weakness for me was the soundtrack. After the brilliant opening which really sets the mood (i never skipped it once), the rest of soundtrack never quite lives up to that opening, which is a shame, the outro is notably disappointing.\\n\r\nI watched the dub, and its a top notch dub. I highly recommend it mainly since the voices used for Canaan and Alphard are spot on and match their tough on-screen appearances well, the Japanese version may be better in terms of Maria and some of the other characters, so ill leave that decision up to you which aspect you feel is more important.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its only 13 episodes so its definitely worth your time and money provided you are willing to forgive it for its few weaknesses, if you can you have a winner and future favorite of the genre in your hands. Hopefully they visit the story again for a second season, but that looks unlikely at this time unfortunately.",

            "content": "Canaan has a history that's bit unusual. The anime came before the manga or the light novel. But it is a sequel, to the critically acclaimed visual novel game 428: Fusa Sareta Shibuya de. The question is, is this sequel to a game that was only released in Japan accessible to people who have never heard of the game?\r\nCanaan's story opens with two Japanese journalists going to Shanghai. The two of them get separated and one of them finds herself in danger only to be saved by the mysterious Canaan, whom she has some connection with from the past. They quickly become involved in aplot involving a deadly virus and terrorism. Overall, the story is handled very well. You might expect it to get bogged down with references that you'd have to play the game to get but it does a good job of explaining everything that's important for the audience to know. The action sequences are really strong. It's fast paced, but not to the point where it gets ridiculous or feels rushed. It has love as a pretty important theme and, unlike a lot of things that use the same theme, it does a good job exploring both the positive and the negative aspects of it. Love is shown as a source of strength but it's also connected with insanity. That goes into a second important theme, duality. A lot of the characters, conflicts and other themes explore a dual structure. The themes are well handled most of the time. Although there are a few moments where they get exaggerated in a slightly ludicrous way. The biggest weakness to the story is that they have several flashbacks and a lot of them aren't necessary for the story so they just come off as filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done. They have complex motivations that are revealed during the story and are realistic for them. Every important character is complex and well developed. There aren't any characters who are extraneous to the plot. The protagonists and the antagonists both have sympathetic qualities that make them interesting and help strengthen the conflict. They also get some compelling dynamics that help move the plot forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. The characters are nicely detailed and the backgrounds are vibrant and lively. Things like planes and guns are very well detailed and look realistic. The art takes advantage of Canaan's unique senses in a way that's story relevant and helps you understand her without overly relying on those segments. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good. Sawashiro Miyuki, Sakamoto Maaya and Nanjo Yoshino all do fantastic jobs in their roles. The only real problem I had was that some of the English dialogue seems a little stiff and unnatural, but there are very few moments where they show people speaking English so it's not a big problem. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 7/10. Canaan and Maria have an incredibly homoerotic relationship which is well executed and adorable. Liang Qi also has a really obvious romantic interest in Alphard. But their relationship is not adorable. It's actually creepy. It's pretty obviously deliberate, so the whole difference between the two dynamics could be part of the duality theme.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Canaan is a 9/10. Its problems are pretty minor. It has excellent characters, a very well told story and really good action sequences. If you enjoyed Bakuretsu Tenshi or El Cazador de la Bruja you'll probably enjoy it as well.",

            "content": "Canaan has several things going for it:\r\n-While the overall plotline isn't particularly original, the human stories within each episode can work really well. Episode 10 is a real heartbreaker.\r\n-The animation quality is amazing. There is almost no reliance on panning stills, except when the characters actually are not moving. The action sequences move and flow like dances with all motions captured. The character designs are appropriate for a young-adult themed show. Even the backgrounds are memorable. The seedy yet modern depiction of Shanghai, especially in ep1, is a real eye-opener for a westerner.\r\n- Characters: I've found Hakko and Alphard to be especially memorable characters. Alphardis almost a tragic hero rather than a villain. Her psycho \"sister\" Lian Ji is the real evil here, and it seems Alphard doesn't really hate Canaan as much as Canaan hates her, except for the effect Canaan has on her team. Canaan's relationship with Maria (Isn't Maria Osawa the name of a Japanese porn star?) is also \"different\" as they are such complete opposites.\\n\r\n-Good DivX high resolution fansubs are available. Average visual quality of fansubs in general has gone up amazingly in the past 18 months.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside:\\n\r\n-The long-term plot is just a sci-fi, government-conspiracy action thriller.  It's a fine example of the genre, but apart from the flower design, the effects of the UA virus aren't particularly original, nor is pinning the whole experiment (in China???) on the CIA. I get the feeling of gaping holes in the logic here that I just haven't been able to spot.\\n\r\n- The male characters are pretty generic crusading investigators or wimps.\\n\\n\r\nNeutral \\n\r\n- The opening theme is cool and the themes during the show are fine. I haven't really listened to the closer.",

            "content": "Note: I haven\u2019t played/watched 428 yet, so this is only a review on the animation itself. Sorry if the review is a bit long. \r\nCanaan is one of the most underrated anime I have watched in the past years. This could be easily attributed to how horrible the guns-and-gals genre has been faring lately. One would think that it would be a brilliant concept to link two popular (yet greatly different) topics together, but time and time again the industry has proven that this conventional plot doesn\u2019t work. \r\nThen, you may ask, why would Canaan be any different?\r\nLet\u2019s start with first impressions. Like most ofmy friends, Canaan seemed like a very underwhelming production at first, probably due to the fact that the pictures that you can find about Canaan often have NO relation to the actual story itself. \\n\\n\r\nI have a habit of always finding the flaws of a work before appreciating its virtues, as discovering the good points of a masterpiece isn't difficult. However, I really couldn\u2019t find any flaws during the entire anime (this does not mean it doesn\u2019t have it flaws) but of course, in retrospect, there were certain elements that could have been done a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story is pretty rushed and fragmented. Throughout the story, we are introduced to a multitude of characters and interludes, some serving a lot more purpose than I thought, and some, vice versa. The audience is bombarded with many many sub-stories, and I daresay, digressions, as the work mentions quite a few interesting yet rather unfinished stories. On the first episodes, we are introduced to two journalists, Maria and Mino, looking for viable news-worthy titles in the huge city of Shanghai. The story accelerates exponentially, as they manage to spiral into a gunfight with masked men that the public seem to ignore. Without time to comprehend what just happened, our protagonist Canaan jumps out of nowhere and saves our dynamic duo, and somehow is an acquaintance with one of the journalists. One of the biggest plot holes in the story is the lack of background information. A tremendous amount of emphasis has been put on the character Maria, being the light that guides our heroine forward. However, the story mentions NOTHING about the affiliation between the two. This lackluster section would definitely make the audience question why our protagonist defends her with her life, and why she is the motivation for the story to go on. Continuing on with this problematic area, the story mentions numerous times that Maria has a minor case of retrograde amnesia, but gives no follow-up to this. We do not know what happened before Shanghai, and the audience is probably as lost as Maria is, and most of us will be scratching our heads when the characters in the story repeatedly inquires if she has truly lost her memory. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you look at the score I give, you\u2019ll realize that I find this series really amazing. Other than the few faults that I\u2019ve pointed out above, nearly everything is excellent, or even near perfect. (I\u2019ll try to give talk a bit about each section. \\n\\n\r\nThe visual aspect is absolutely stunning, even for today\u2019s standards. Unlike most anime where you might be able to say that a certain scene or character looks brilliant, Canaan has both. The characters are brilliantly drawn, and the scenery is almost as good as Shinkai Makoto\u2019s. The animation is extremely fluid, possibly due to its 29.976 frames per second, and the choreography (if that\u2019s the right word) for the characters are simply really well thought out. There isn\u2019t a scene in the entire series that feels stiff or rigid, and even the monotone Canaan displays a good array of emotions given that she has such a small pool of emotions. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio aspect is equivalently fabulous, and it\u2019s the only reason I managed to know about this work. The music is extremely fitting, be it the opening or the ending, and the variety in the two gives the audience both a sense of excitement and tranquility. The music serves a great purpose, as it not only starts the episode off with a bang, but also reminds the audience of the core storyline. On a side note, the performances of the voice actors are beyond amazing. Canaan displays quite a wide range of characters, with some being exceptionally difficult to portray (such as Liang). Yet, each seiyuu performs his/her job perfectly, and even monotonous characters like Canaan feel are illustrated vividly. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of all this, my favorite is the characterization. On the surface of the matter, Canaan uses archetypically clich\u00e9 characters. A kind hearted, weak body, yet strong minded protagonist, a seemingly apathetical, yet in reality is the most caring accomplice, and a powerful, yet puzzled gun-girl are all characters we have seen way too many times. Conversely, Canaan does a good job in directing the audience in the right direction. In contrary to the many characters that aim to achieve superficial and unrealistic goals, such as world peace (or domination) or a brighter future, our protagonist has a truthful, yet effective ideal. The reason that she fights is simple, she does not want to lose what she holds precious again. The depictions of the characters are immensely lively and realistic, each doing what they feel right themselves, be it for friendship, or for love. Each character serves an irreplaceable part in the overall story, and each segment of the journey tells us a bit more about them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point that is worth noting is the attention to details. There are many subtle elements that the casual viewer may miss. For example, even the name of the characters shed light to the story itself. The religious allusion of the name Canaan being the land of hope adds a second layer to the story, and even the name Maria gives an indication of her role. Many foreshadows appear, such as the discussion of sunny weather, and other motifs like the camera or the Pocky that Canaan is always chewing on, give further confirmation and hints to the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhile accepting the imperfections of the story, Canaan has one of the most thrilling and sophisticated plots of all time. One should complete disregard any first impressions on this work, as it most definitely is an unfair judgment. The production strikes a perfect balance between the emphasis on characters and plot, making the story both character and plot driven; the work doesn\u2019t feel like a shonen anime that features the mishaps of the protagonists, nor does it feel like a war-time anime which often overlooks how the characters develop. The overarching story of the conflict between Alphard and Canaan opens up many possibilities for parallel (yet slightly sub-par) stories, such as the intertwined touches of romance. Moreover, viewers will quickly understand the effect of minor characters on the work, and the entire reason for the richness in story is due to the diversity in characters. Every single action is useful, be it the dialogue between two characters, or the small gestures of kindness displayed towards one another. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Canaan is definitely a masterpiece. The focus on both an intellectual and an emotional level concoct a beautiful result. It is definitely worth your time.\\n",

A \u2018diamond\u2019 within short anime for sure, deep and beautiful\u201d  \r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\nThe fourth anime I ever watched. So let\u2019s see\u2026\r\nGirls and guns, a combination that ensures the attention of most people \u2013mainly and without doubt males- to be honest. Here\u2019s where \u201cCanaan\u201d comes in, to break the stereotypical \u2013boring- \u201cGirls with guns\u201d type of anime.\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, on the outside \u201cCanaan\u201d \u2013might- look like the typical fan-service kind of anime, focused mainly on the usual action and sexual innuendos, but in all honesty, Canaan is different.in that aspect, it\u2019s deep and meaningful.\r\nIn all honesty shortanime shows are a bit of a gamble for they usually lack something whether some back story, or the sound or the character developments, but to put it bluntly Canaan has everything and it\u2019s worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start \uf04a\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 8-\\n\r\nProbably the most \u201clame\u201d thing in the whole anime is its premise, the typical good vs evil kind of environment. But let me tell you that by lame I don\u2019t mean that the story is boring nor interesting, I just mean that it isn\u2019t the most original\u201d thing in the world but it has something unique. It\u2019s a story that is easy to understand even if you haven\u2019t played the game \u2013and base scenario- \u201c428: Fusa Sareta Shibuya de\u201d. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cCANAAN\u201d is one of those shows that -because of its story- it leaves you wanting more, and not because it has plot holes or anything but because it\u2019s that good.\\n\\n\r\nIt has one of the most alluring and absorbing starts that I\u2019ve ever watched in a anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 9- \\n\r\nOne of the things that captivated me before watching the show was the art. Usually before watching a show I try to uncover or \u201cstudy\u201d the anime \u2013to see if it\u2019ll be worth my time-. The show is a \u201crole model\u201d of animation. The scenarios \u2013the festival, restaurants and the city- are believable and incredibly well depicted. The art developers \u201cimmerse\u201d you inside the show in a way that back in the day I had never seen or felt before. And not just that, the characters were made in such a beautiful way to, the artists didn\u2019t just make a face for the characters, the made simple things a memorable thing \u2013like the eyes (and their expression) of Maria Oosawa, the hair of Canaan and the tattoo of Alphard and Canaan-.\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly\u2026 whether you\u2019re talking about the scenarios or the characters they\u2019re all \u201cattractive\u201d to the eyes and mind of the viewer.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 10-\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said before I\u2019m a guy that places the soundtrack/score of a movie/TV show as probably one of the most important things of them all, and I must say \u201cCanaan, oh! Canaan\u201d \\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re watching this show subbed or dubbed (I watched it both, and the first time was in English) the voice acting is incredible, the actors performed beyond words. And the work of Miyuki Sawashiro or Shelley Calene-Black (Canaan) and the work of Maaya Sakamoto or Lesley Pedersen (Alphard Al Sheya) is a work that transcends. It\u2019s emotional. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack/score in my opinion is the \u201cjewel of the crown\u201d \u2013as I usually say- it was made by Masumi Ito (under the pseudonym Hikaru Nanase). It\u2019s one of the best works I\u2019ve ever heard on my life. A work very swayed by oriental music/instruments \u2013obviously-. It\u2019s a very memorable soundtrack with some of the most superb violin and piano tracks ever.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same way that the art designers immerse you in the anime by the way they depict the surroundings and characters, it\u2019s the same thing with the music, transcending for it isn\u2019t just a plain soundtrack, it\u2019s depicts the mood or creates a mood within the show.\\n\\n\r\nA-MARVELOUS-WORK!\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 10-\\n\r\nHere\u2019s another aspect in which \u201cCANAAN\u201d excels. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cOh! Look at that! ANOTHER boring show with pretty girls and guns, right?\u201d Well WRONG. Canaan has both things -YES- but it IS more than that. CANAAN is a show about fighting, about learning the truth but most importantly about relationships. Don\u2019t misunderstand me \u201cCANAAN\u201d isn\u2019t the typical \u201cmisogynistic\u201d lame story as twilight in which the MC can\u2019t do anything without her vampire lover. No, this is deeper than that.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a story about changes in a personal level.\\n\\n\r\nDifferent from most short shows CANAAN excels in character development. With the unique friendship between the two MC\u2019s \u2013Canaan and Maria- or the relation between Canaan and Alphard. Relations that take this anime to amazing \u201cplaces\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are believable. They\u2019re humans and show emotions. Although Canaan is a really stoic person, but her journey will \u201copen her heart\u201d. \\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT:10 & OVERALL: 9-\\n\r\nSuper enjoyable and recommended. Although the show leaves you wanting more for being that good.\\n",

            "content": "Guns? Check. Girls? Check. Girls with guns? Check.\r\nCanaan is a story about a young woman named Canaan, who is alone in the world. Her parents are dead and the man that saved her and took care of her has been killed. Now Canaan must confront the ghosts of her past if she is to prevent a deadly and mysterious virus named the Ua virus from being introduced to the world.\r\nSo I have to say that Canaan is up there as the best paced story I've ever seen. With 13 episodes, most anime are always criticized because they've felt rushed or everything that should have beencovered wasn't. I think this mainly has to do with the fact that Canaan never lost site of it's main plot like so many others. In most anime, you can have one, two, even three different arcs happen in 12 episodes and of course it'd feel rushed then since that's like four episodes for each arc. Canaan however took a different route and just had one arc for all 13 episodes which made you feel like the story was complete when you finished it. There is a reason I gave the story a seven though. \\n\\n\r\nI never really got enveloped into the story like other anime has done for me. The story was weird to me and I considered dropping it after the second episode. I just found the whole thing to be quite boring and there never was a sense of urgency in the story. You could tell what was going to happen and the only time that a problem arose that I cared about, it was solved just as quickly in the same episode. It dissapointed me quite a bit and I think it could have been better written. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can't complain about is the art style and the animation. It was beautifully made and the animation for the fight scenes was amazing. All the movements for each knife swing to each gunshot was fluent and I really have no complains. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters weren't my favorite. More than half of them felt like psychopaths to me and I never cared about what happened to any of them. It seemed like half of the script was Maria Osawa (Canaan's one true friend) just shouting \"Canaan! Canaan! Canaan!\" Over and over again (no joke watch the anime if you don't believe me, I still can't get her screams out of my head). One memorable character I have to bring up is Liang Qui, one of the main antagonists. I think she just got to me because she had a sister complex which basically means she was in total love with her sister (so incest basically). Now you may not find that too weird, I personally am open to things like that, however when your sister is swinging a knife at you and cutting you and all you're screaming is \"More! More!\" That's when I draw the line. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways if you're curious watch this anime and see if you like it. I didn't think it was great at all and I probably won't watch it again, but I've seen other reviews and I know that a lot of them has enjoyed this anime so perhaps you will too.",

The main characters are mostly lifeless and unengaging, and the villains are so utterly irritating that I could barely bring myself to finish this. Specifically, the villain on camera the most has an onee-san fetish and is constantly screaming and horny; it's extremely offputting (not only because that's inherently offputting, but it also clashes intensely with the serious tone and setting). This show's tone and premise are good, but the characters and writing are just so bad that Iactively urge you not to watch this. \\n\\n\r\nJust go watch Phantom Requiem for the Phantom instead of this. It's similar in tone and overall feeling but it's better in every single way.",

            "content": "NABILA\u2019S ANIME REVIEW: CANAAN (2009)\r\nGenre: Action, Drama\r\nAshamed with no regrets, I admit to finishing this anime in a timespan of 24 hours during the school holidays where I have 3 books to read for english, arguments for and against to create for historic debating, a game to make for multimedia and revision for maths. I only had about 5 days left of the holidays and this was how I as spending it -watching Canaan with as much glee as anyone could ever have. Although as I\u2019ve read multiple times, this is quite common for an anime fan to do; ditch all their responsibilities in orderto watch a super awesome looking anime that\u2019ll rock the socks off our own feet.\\n\\n\r\nThat very paragraph alone should be able to summarise my heartfelt feelings towards this anime. Regardless of the heavy doubts i had for it during the first 3 episodes where I had absolutely no idea what was going on but still rather enjoyed the whole plot that was slowly unfolding out in front of me. Although with this in mind, while watching an anime that you absolutely no clue as to what was going on, your mind conveniently flows towards the thought of quickly looking everything up to add that needed background information and then forget about it as though that whole research session did not happen as soon as you continue onto the next paragraph. \\n\\n\r\nThis was exactly what I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe Canaan plot was all too random for one to somehow understand all in one go without looking bits up. Even during episode 4, I still had no idea as to who I wanted to play out good and bad (as what is considered good and what is considered bad all goes back to the person). \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, this pre-research did not hinder my ability to enjoy this anime. Rather, with a strong hold of the actual plot and characters, I (personally) was able to enjoy this anime quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nNow let us go into the criteria of my reviews: \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nUnderstandably, this anime was trying to control what was essentially given out to the audience -which I can understand completely as I myself am an aspiring author with no motivation (YES THAT IS MY PUNCHLINE I AM SORRY). Wether you do research before wait for the anime itself to essentially \u2018reveal\u2019 itself to you, there really shouldn't be negative effect. I personally found the unfolding of the plot quite exciting and I quite thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes I did know a few things before jumping into the anime (well more like episode 5), but like I stated before there\u2019s absolutely nothing that hindered my ability to enjoy this anime to it\u2019s extent. For that, I will be giving the plot line a strong 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I agree as to how stunning the animation was (especially considering the release date ((yes it is not ancient but still))), I\u2019ve got to admit -I\u2019ve seen better. The animation in this anime isn't bad. It passes the level of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018enticing\u2019 but doesn't quite make it into the \u2018HOLY COW WHAT IS THIS PIECE OF BRILLIANCE THAT I HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH\u2019. For that, I will be giving the animation an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, I don\u2019t know how to summarise my feelings towards the characters and their development during the anime. It was a bit of everything really. Sometimes, character development got pushed back due to an issue or a conflict -and Canaan is perhaps one of the strongest anime in this category. The character development is amazing, but again, I myself cannot word its amazing-ness myself. Just watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8 \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really need to explain myself do I?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: a SUPER SUPER strong 8.5\\n\\n\r\nDO I RECCOMMEND? Yes \\n\\n\r\nCheck me out at:\\n\\n\r\ntumblr: animutalk.tumblr.com",

One of these women is Cannan, an assassin/mercenary, the other is Alphard, (Cannan's rival who is also a professional and mercenary assassin and who runs a terrorist organization called Snake). The name is even in English to do justice to what happens in the anime (which I can not say). \r\nThe latest girl is Osawa Maria, a victim of a biological attack on the streets of Shibuya, Japan for two years. Their meeting brings us to interventions between Canaan and Alphard becausethe two have a connection in which they have a tragic story in common (which is the same for both but at different occasions).\\n\\n\r\nIt is a drama anime that unfolds in passing the episodes while it is exciting and makes us think of the friendships we have even with the closest friends. It is also an anime captured for the current generation, which consists precisely in giving to think even with scenes and interrogations more than obvious, also by the way is slightly bizarre because for YunYun (a character in the series) nobody lives at the mercy of a box of pills.\\n\r\nLet's say I liked the story, but it's nothing out of this world but I enjoy it, I liked the psychological highlights that the characters have throughout the development of the anime, I found the story interesting in China, I just think that the range of characters could be greater since the UA virus did not spread to an entire population based on a terrorist industry.\\n\r\nI may think that I should recommend because I think the story of Canaan itself would be good to do, but I prefer not to do it because in my opinion the anime would be better seen and better structured if it happened in the city and not on a mountain or a train, etc. and that was what happened.\\n\r\nFinally I want to say that the enemies/soldiers were so few but so few that I honestly did not even miss them. \\n\r\nBy the way is to underline the Cannan's \"synesthesia\"when she have red eyes !",

Maybe Type-Moon and Mari Okada weren't the rock stars they are now.\r\nSome things age like wine, but \"Canaan\" is Pepsi Blue. If you have nostalgia for laser blue consumer products, perhaps you also have nostalgia for the George W. Bush era of blockbuster terrorism, dubious US military operations in tandem with evil paramilitary forces, black hawk choppers circling bombed out desert villages, a shadowy vice president and his cabal pulling the strings, the pervasive browns of tactical shooter video games, andmore time bombs than you can shake a stick at. Canaan offers all this and more.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it's watchable. Takashi Takeuchi\u2019s familiar character designs are rendered crisply in its acrobatic bullet-opera shootouts. And Kinoko Nasu & Mari Okada\u2019s grim sensibilities align in a story about a warrior of fate burdened by her supernatural \u201csynesthesia\u201d vision (or one could call like it is: The Mystic Eyes of Death Perception), and the web of guilt and envy that surrounds her. Unfortunately it rarely transcends the mundane of its era. Okada\u2019s now-familiar brand of over-the-top melodrama makes for some entertainingly grotesque moments, but its drama is shortchanged by a semi-supernatural global conspiracy story that reaches for \"Metal Gear Solid\" levels of convolution. The hows or whys are hard to keep track of, and lack Hideo Kojima\u2019s eccentric knack for camp and absurdist levity.\\n\\n\r\nThough \"Canaan\" is only P.A. Works\u2019 second TV series, proceeding Okada\u2019s \"True Tears\", it feels older than it is. Perhaps by its 2009 release, it already missed the zeitgeist. The inauguration of Barack Obama was the culmination of post-9/11 fatigue reflected in popular media. \"24\" was already in its final seasons. The apocalyptic, terrorism-packed \"Battlestar Galactica\" just aired its tortured finale. \"Metal Gear Solid 4\" wrapped up its canon a year earlier. The market was not ripe for a terrorism-flavored action anime in the desert with cartoony analogs of Bush, Cheney and Blackwater. Oh, and Pepsi Blue ended its distribution in 2004. Perhaps it\u2019s better to experience this era, and this anime, with curious nostalgia than with the contemporary viscerality it never fully grasped.",

            "content": "A thirteen episode Action/Drama series, Canaan is based on the manga written by Type-Moon. The manga is published by Kadokawa Shoten, but has yet to reach the states. The anime had it\u2019s original run in the summer of 2009 from P.A. Works Studio, and has been dubbed in English by Anime Network in September 2010. The story actually takes place two years after the Nintendo Wii visual novel, 428: Fusa Sareta Shibuya de. I already watched the subbed version and recently watched the dub, so I\u2019m gonna take on both versions.\r\nTwo years ago, Shibuya was ravaged by a biological terrorist attack using the deadly Uavirus. Maria Osawa was saved when her father inoculated her against the virus, but is left with partial amnesia from the shock. She works as a cameraman when she reunites with a girl named Canaan in Shanghai, China. A gifted assassin with synesthesia, she is under orders from an unknown organization for a yet unspecified mission. (Anime News Network)\\n\\n\r\nThere are two types of people who are infected by the Ua virus, Borners and Unbloom. Borners are those who survive being infected by the virus, some gaining powers (Hacko) or just some extra body parts (Yun Yun). Unbloom are those who also survived the Ua virus, however gain no special abilities and become extremely vulnerable to UV rays and outside noises. Snake, a terrorist group run by Alphard, ran experiments on people in a distant village a few years prior to the events in the anime. Their goal, to study the effects of Borners and Unbloom in order to use the Ua virus to, pretty much, cause war. The only person really standing in their way is Canaan.\\n\\n\r\nThe look of the series is pretty much your basic Action anime series with decent animations. The most interesting look of the series is Canaan\u2019s synesthesia powers. Whenever we look through her eyes everything becomes color coded, depending on people\u2019s emotions and condition(her targets are blue, hungry is gray, kindness is yellowish gold). The story is pretty basic: a girl working for an mystery organization (Canaan) and is also out for revenge against the person who killed her mentor (Alphard). At the same time she also befriends another girl eventually turning her into her new reason for living (Maria). Add in a strange virus and some sadistic characters and you\u2019ve got this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few parts that are never explained at all in the series. For instance, in the beginning we are just told that Canaan and Maria are friends. The only thing about their past that the anime calls our \u201cexplanation\u201d is a) Canaan saved Maria from bad guys and b) the two of them bond over Cat\u2019s Cradle. Another piece that is never explained is why Minrou went to Shanghi, besides trying to get \u201cthe big scoop\u201d. What kind of \u201cbig scoop\u201d are we looking for? Did the gossip magazine get a tip that a teenage girl who can see colors and can shoot like a ninja-monkey would be tearing around Shanghi? However I did find out that Minrou was actually one of the main characters from 428: Fusa Srenta Shibuya de, and a survivor of the Shibuya incident two years prior. So if you haven\u2019t even heard of the game then you are completely lost.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the English and Japanese versions aren\u2019t bad, but if I had a preference I would stick to the Japanese. The voice actors in the Japanese version match the idea of the characters better then the English. Although both versions have very good portrayals. Both Maaya Sakamoto and Lesley Pedersen give a good performance as Alphard, as well as the actors for both Minoru and Santana. Shelley Calene-Black plays a decent Canaan, but I preferred Miyuki Sawashiro\u2019s more tom-boyish and naive Canaan better. When it comes to Maria and Yun Yun the Japanese voice actors are certainly superior. But I believe the best portrayal of a character in either version is Liang Qi. Both Rie Tanaka and Jessica Boone do an amazing job with this role. Playing out not only her obsession for Alphard but the insanity that goes along with this character. You almost feel sorry for her and the torture she goes though both mentally and emotionally.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside to this series is, again, the fact that it\u2019s your generic action series. It has huge gun fights, secret organizations bent on taking over the world, and the occasional necrophilia.... Oh wait.... That\u2019s just this show..... however that\u2019s also the major downfall of this series, the story itself. The characters are decent, with some of them developed nicely while others not at all. There are patches in the story where, unless you have seen it\u2019s proceeding visual novel, then you have no idea where some parts of the story come into play, or why some of it matters. It\u2019s still enjoyable to watch whether you want to see those gun fights or watch the complex mind games between Canaan and Alphard. Or, hell, see Liang Qi lose her marbles!\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Canaan is a good action series that has a few twists to keep the audience\u2019s attention. It sticks to the story through and through with a few fun parts at times. Mostly from seeing Yun Yun and her many many jobs, plus the jokes about her boobs(or lack thereof). It\u2019s one to at least take a look at, and either you\u2019ll love it, hate it, or just go \u201ceh\u201d.",

            "content": "The short of it is that this is a very action-oriented anime similar to Black Lagoon - but with a better story and characters - all while being only 13 episodes long. \r\nStory:\r\nA relatively generic affair overall; Canaan's story blends Full Metal Alchemist and a little bit of Ghost in the Shell - but ultimately falls short of both of them in terms of emotional impact and comprehensiveness. It makes you care and remains consistently engaging through all of the thirteen episodes. There's nothing terribly original about it but it does everything well; it struck me as being more Western movie inspired.\r\nArt:\r\nI don't remember everbeing stunned or impressed by the visuals, but I don't remember seeing anything bad, either. The action scenes flow nicely and have interesting, fairly detailed, backgrounds and the characters move fluidly - coming together in some well-done fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nGood FX compliment the fight scenes; bullets hit with a solid thud and punches and kicks are delivered with a muffled thump. There aren't any annoyingly voiced characters or poorly done stuff (like \"engrish\"). As long as audio doesn't hurt an anime it's good in my book, and it certainly didn't in Canaan.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Canaan really shines - there are no unnecessary side-characters, everyone is important to the main story line and is treated as such. All of them really feel like they develop and evolve from beginning to end. Canaan also has a really solid villain that takes you on a rollercoaster of feelings. Had the actual story been a bit better, Canaan's characters could've shined even more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nA semi-believable action-thriller with great characters and fight scenes, Canaan made me happy that I chose it over the innumerable other anime I need to watch at some point. It isn't a classic or anything - nor do I think it should regarded as such - but Canaan left me feeling satisfied; if I had to watch it all again, I would.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nA flawed gem, Canaan impresses with its character development despite a fairly derivative story line.",

            "content": "The girls-with-guns movement is spotlighted again during my time and this show has come to mind to have some elements of shows like that in the past and wondering that will this be a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu comparison to those other shows? Well, first, the name \u201cCANAAN\u201d is a reference to the Old Testament, describing a land with milk and honey. Also, the anime is based on the scenario of a visual novel game 428: F\u016bsa Sareta Shibuya de made for the Nintendo Wii and onto a sequel to the game, it centers around three women and their connection to an anti-terrorism summit two years ago,Shibuya was ravaged by a biological terrorist attack using the deadly Ua virus. Maria Osawa was saved when her father inoculated her against the virus, but is left with partial amnesia from the shock. She works as a cameraman when she reunites with a girl named Canaan in Shanghai, China. A gifted assassin with synesthesia, she is under orders from an unknown organization for a yet unspecified mission.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? I already sensed the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu situation describing the plot details of this anime\u2026\u2026.mainly because it all reminds of the Bee Train trilogy of Noir, Madlax, & El Cazador de la Bruja, three shows whose plots are not really that different from each other and the fact the latter two are spiritual successors to the original. Personally, I do like the Bee Train trilogy more or less (Madlax being the less, El Cazador being the more) but I have developed a sense of what to come across to these types of show, for example:\\n\\n\r\n1.\tThe show is set in an exotic place other than Japan.\\n\r\n2.\tSometimes the theme is war (either inner or outer) and an organization unknown to the world is somehow involved.\\n\r\n3.\tMain female character is an assassin or bounty hunter; the other one has amnesia and can\u2019t remember shit.\\n\r\n4.\tSometimes one is stoic (or both in Noir\u2019s case); the other can be the picture of innocence and naivet\u00e9. \\n\r\n5.\tThe tone of the relationship between the two female characters has more or an equal amount of Yuri tones. (i.e., I sense a lot of fan fiction about these girls wink wink). \\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s basically what I sense when I watch these types of anime\u2026\u2026\u2026\\n\r\nNow as for characters, Canaan herself is the basically stoic female assassin we seen and she can get pretty dull to know about (she became an assassin due to death of her parents and her mentor Siam and wants revenge against the person that offed him) but she was interesting for a while.  Maria Osawa is the archetype character of being the eyes of an innocent naivet\u00e9 young woman and she was a likable character from start to finish (and cute, too. I\u2019m just saying).  There is also her boss Minorikawa or Mino-san, who feels more like he\u2019s just in for the ride, like a role reversal considering Maria would fit into that role. Then there\u2019s Yun Yun, the eccentric and energetic young girl and the comic relief (which is kind of new in my book of these types of shows) and one of the surviving test subjects of the Ua virus experiment. The prominent antagonist of the show is Alphard Al Sheya, the leader of the terrorist organization Snake and Canaan\u2019s archrival and there is Alphard\u2019s top lieutenant Liang Qi and I got to say that she has got to be one of the craziest, obsessed, and deranged secondary characters I\u2019ve seen\u2026\u2026..it scares me a bit but, hell, I love that about her. Her almost OTT appearance makes it seem believable that she is that fucking insane about what she does. I actually cared more about her than the main villain or the main character. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI would say that Bee Train is somehow involved in the production and they are, but they don\u2019t do the main animation, it\u2019s the work of P.A. Works, the same animation team behind Angel Beats and Another and it looks absolutely beautiful. There was no noticeable mistake and hiccup in any of the fight scenes and I applaud them for that. The character designs were a bit basic for anime design of character although I keep thinking of Yun Yun as a little girl rather than an older female. The opening song of the show comes out a bit obnoxious especially with the electric keyboard in the beginning. The rest of the BGM and ending song were quiet, melodic, and sometimes stealth for a while.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe dub by Sentai Filmworks was alright, however I should have talked about this guy already the last time I reviewed something from Sentai (that wasn\u2019t a re-release from Geneon) and yes, for those who know what I\u2019m about to say is about the ADR director/writer Steven Foster, who is responsible for the dubs of High School of the Dead, Ghost Stories, and the majority of most Sentai Filmworks dubs today and he can be either decent or awful and fortunately for him, it\u2019s on the line of listenable for me. I will give praise to the voice actors/actresses including Shirley Calene-Black, Hilary Haag, Andrew Love, Serena Varghese and especially Jessica Boone for her role as Liang Qi. Yeah, you can tell I really loved that performance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: I can easily say that I really did enjoy the series all throughout the run, even if most of the plot either seems already done in an anime but some of the time the dialogue is a bit awkward and jarring to hear because of the adapted writing, but I\u2019ll say that if you like any of the girls-with-guns anime trilogy, you\u2019ll like this. If you don\u2019t (and I know some who don\u2019t), then you might want to skip this.\\n",

            "content": "Fourth Review - Canaan\r\nWell where to start with Canaan then, this anime in my opinion was actually really good. I loved the plot of the anime and thought that it was well planned out, although you have to pay attention to the anime to keep on track. The development of the plot helped with character development as the plot at the beginning is quite empty and it picks up during the course of the series. \r\nCharacters were already involved with each other before the beginning of Canaan, however as the anime went on you could understand what terms the characters were on and after awhilethis shown how closely planned out each character was. The one thing that lets down the whole character development with the main protagonist (Maria) is the way she was portrayed, a 'damsel in distress' and a 'dumb girl'. This was good as it grew closer with the other main character Canaan however it was the same story of what happens when the 'bad people' are around. \\n\\n\r\nTo me Canaan had a good animation for the year it was made, it shown detail and different lights in animation during the anime. The animation was well created and gave the 'realistic' anime look rather than a sketchy look, this is what made me like the anime more. The sound in Canaan was also good, the opening especially was well produced and went with the genre and style of the anime Canaan was. \\n\\n\r\nPutting on my 'Yuri-Goggles' now, Canaan shows Girls love like a normal real-life love, the characters weren't on top of each other like other anime. The Yuri was slim and was discreet, however you could tell there was something there between the main protagonists. If your into Yuri anime then this is one that could be nice to see. (Sorry shouldn't go into too much detail here.) \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Canaan a lot, I found that the enjoyment was good as it kept you wanting to see what happens next, it kept you engrossed to see what the story is about and what happened in the characters pasts. I loved how Canaan itself was quite a smooth running series that didn't just have random fillers in the storyline and didn't have just random unexplained parts. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love fighting anime that is not overpowering in the fighting, If you love a simple plot in a story with really no fillers and an anime that keeps you wanting more. I would recommend Canaan, a good anime about girls with guns and some discreet Yuri bases. \\n\\n\r\nCanaan ~",

Before I get to my praises, I shall tackle my issues with the show. The show's plotting proved to be Canaan's weakest area where there wasn't much in the way of buildup concerning the plans that the Snakes had with the Ua virus as the show's central focus was more on the character relationships between the major female characters of the series than the virus plot. As a matter of fact, this plot element seemedso irrelevant that the show ran it alongside a typical case of government corruption by the American government without much explanation as to why and what was ultimately being planned with the virus seemed like something you could pull out of a science fiction/ horror movie. Adding to my snags with the series would be some over-the-top characters among those of the villains such as psycho lesbian Liang Qi and a childish-behaving old man with ridiculous speed and agility.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does save the series from complete mediocrity for me would be the character interactions and developments involving the major female characters of the series. The connections between Alphard, Canaan and Maria are a complex one as all three are essentially conflicted over how to treat one another in regards to their past relationships that are hinted at points through flashbacks. For example, Canaan cares for Maria dearly because of her desire to care for somebody yet does not consider Maria's feelings of helplessness from her encounters with the Snakes. Maria desires to be someone on Canaan's level yet because of their different upbringings, they can never truly have a deep friendship with one another. Alphard detests Canaan for getting the attention of their mentor Siam, yet does not have any desire to kill or make her rival suffer as she halts attempts made on the lives of Canaan and Maria; as well as having the desire to fight with Canaan at her potential. The chemistry between the three proves to be an interesting one because of the internal conflicts the three have over one another and it does more than enough to make up for the weak plot buildup with the virus.\\n\\n\r\nCanaan was one of the better-looking 2009 anime titles I've come across in terms of visual presentation. It sports clean and defined details plus a bright color tone with scenery and character designs; as well as having some great looking action scenes where you can expect fluid movement to be the norm without too many noticeable shortcuts in the animation. Animation highlights for me in the series included a gun-fight on city rooftops during a festival and an intense fight on a train between Canaan and Alphard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Canaan is quite the mixed bag of an anime. While it sports a high-quality visual presentation for a TV series with interesting character dynamics between the three central female characters, the series really suffers in its plot buildup and had to toss in some characters that seemed too over-the-top to be in a series as serious as this. While a decent watch, this isn't a series I would be willing to hop back to anytime soon.",

It started as what may appear as a common action anime with just battle scenes (greatly animated though), but it also surprised me with the story that it unfolds, although at first could be somewhat confusing to understand. \r\nOne of the may things that I'd like to point out is the excellent work of the voice actors and actresses, they really did an excellent job! \r\nLastly, I'd also like to point out somewhing that most animes don't achieve and that is character growth and story-telling through the series. It's amazing tosee the psychological effects on the characters due to the atrocious events of their past and the way the anime portrays it it's just excellent (specially Hakko's character)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's an 9 just because the story is a bit difficult to grasp at first and it's very easy to get lost if we're not paying attention to what the characters are saying.",

As I am familiar with TYPE-MOON I was a little bit worried when I heard about it, since two girls is not their normal choice of main characters, and I feared it may be some common Yuri anime with flashy action scenes and a little bit of science or religion (like they do). I was glad to find how wrong I was, as Canaan is both enjoyable and profound.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is kind of complicated, which is part of the enjoyment of the anime. you need to finish the anime to understand it. it does have some hardcore actionscenes that every action lover will enjoy, but they are all according to the plot. there is a perfect balance between story and action, so don't worry about it.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nnormal TYPE-MOON goodness. nothing left to say.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nsame. I only wish that the song they hum would be louder.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nBEST CHARACTERS IN THE WORLD. Canaan is just a normal girl, and Alphard isn't perfect. usualy, the hero is so powerfull and gracefull that only wants to be a loser, or a loser who wants to be a hero, but Canaan is different. she doesn't want to change, she is so normal it hurts. even though she is a cold blooded killer, she is still just a confused little baby girl. Alphard on the other hand seems very mature and looks as if she has it all figured out, but her character is dramatically developed in the end, unlike most of villians.\\n\r\nWho would enjoy it:\\n\r\nsmart people that love actions and boys who like hot girls fighting half naked.\\n\r\nWho won't:\\n\r\nshojo lovers, romance lovers, and people who don't like complicated plots.",

            "content": "I was looking for a \u201ccool\u201d new anim\u00e9 a year ago, when I stumbled into Canaan, and thank God it\u2019s cool since during that time I was really looking forward to the good anim\u00e9s. Canaan is about the title itself since the protagonist is Canaan herself. I can\u2019t follow the story at first since it\u2019s a bit \u201cwhat was happening?\u201d and then after two or more episodes you\u2019ll get it. The number one thing I don\u2019t like is Maria since she\u2019s the kind of character too typical, a damsel in distress who almost have no likable traits aside from being a good friend who stickswith you no matter what but aside from that she\u2019s stupid, weak, dependent, and not cute nor pretty at all. Since the cutest would be Canaan and the prettiest would be Alphard. Every hateful detail in the anim\u00e9 were compensated by Alphard LOLXD I wish Canaan and Alphard just be guys and not girls since they really look cool and HOT in a manly way. I do believe this has a bit of a shoujo ai hint in it, though it is not the main thing you\u2019ll see when you watch it because most of your attention would be on those awesome fight scenes. I think the characters namely Canaan and Alphard really portray a guy because that\u2019s the feel you\u2019ll get when you watch it; it\u2019s just that they were drawn as girls for the intention of having that shoujo ai feel. Another plus point for me is the fact that Maaya Sakamoto the one who sang the OP song for this anim\u00e9 is the seiyuu of one of the characters (Alphard); I really love her as a guy coz that\u2019s how I see her, haha and I also like Canaan as a guy to she reminds me of Allen Walker of D.Gray-man though they\u2019re not similar at all. Overall it\u2019s an anim\u00e9 that would be really good to watch.",

The story kinda gets the job done and that's about it. Not that I didn't like a lot of moments, but it is overall very obscure and introduces discussions about bunch of vague emotions that just come and go. Also, while the Siam backstory is very interesting, there is not quite enough focus than I would like, compared to Fate/Zero or Elfen Lied, where the main character's backstory is the main focus of a couple of episodes, . There are greatstandout moments, but the story itself is kind of a mess. Though to its credit, it ties up everything better than fellow 13-parter Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation (Biased Version): 15\\n\r\nHoly crap these action scenes are amazing 15/10 would watch again\\n\\n\r\nPresentation (Sureeus Verzhun): 10\\n\r\nBut seriously, the action scenes are very fluid and are very exciting. Even quieter scenes have a decent amount of fluidity to it. While a lot of time is spent in dark military bunkers and the gritty streets of Shanghai, it is actually a pretty gorgeous anime. While some scenes seem a bit jagged, these are merely nitpicks and are overshadowed by the gorgeous action scenes\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nWhile this isn't the usual pairing of a Type/Moon property and Yuki Kajura that was pretty much made in Heaven, the soundtrack is very strong, espescially the themes of Alphard and Siam. The OP is amazing, flashy, and catchy as hell. The ED is meh, and I skipped it a lot of times to see the OP again. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun with the characters, the taxi driver, though he only appears in a couple scenes, is freakin' awesome, and makes singing Jpop songs about China cool. Yun Yun was a combination of adorable, yet annoying, she doesn't get too much focus and is more of a comic relief vehicle and does the job adequately well, at least better than Jar Jar. Hakko is probably one of my favorite characters in the entire series, though, at first, she seems a bit off since she rarely speaks, when she does speak, she is very awesome, even if it often ends up bad for her. I'll have a hard time discussing the titular character without spoiling anything, but she is very interesting. One of the biggest problems I have though, is the relationship between her and Maria, it seems that they keep teasing the Yuri audience frequently with what I can only assume is just a strong mutual friendship. Oh I almost forgot The Snake Organization, here's a haiku for you weaboos out there\\n\\n\r\nAlphard bleeds awesome\\n\r\nI could care less 'bout Cummings\\n\r\nLiang is cray-cray\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nPretty freakin' cool\\n\r\nBut the plot kinda sucks\\n\r\nLiang's still cray-cray\\n\\n\r\nRECOMMMENDATION: MEDIUM-HIGH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Hooray.\r\nHowever, Canaan is, in my opinion, a very important anime to watch.  It presents a very important lesson to anime watchers; you can do anything with a cliched storyline.  That includes screwing it up to the point where it is unrecognizable besides a few lines that pop up now and then.\r\nCanaan could have been a lot of different things.  It could have been a love story.  It could have been a psychological thriller.  It could have beena complete farce.  It could have been a horror story.  If this anime had stopped to focus on any one of these aspects, it could have pulled off something amazing.  Instead, someone thought that the best way to really create an anime story is to throw all of the cliches from each of these stories, put them in a pot, and turn up the heat.  What was produced was something that resembled somewhat edible swamp sludge.  It was messed up, with some genuine good parts.\\n\\n\r\nI think that it was did a good job overall though, since it is pretty obvious that putting all of that stuff together doesn't work, but they tried it anyways.  They just sort of wanted to see if what would come out might have some element to it that was good.  It did.  That would be a spoiler though.  Watch it.  You can judge for yourself if it was a waste of time for you.  In fact, you might just redefine your own personal meaning for, \"waste of time.\"",

You also never really get a clear understanding of what exactly it is that the \"bad guys\" want other than to just cause some sort of chaos. In the end none of that really matters; it is really more about the story of a journalist, whose tag along co-worker who just so happens to be tied in with one of the action proneprotagonists, on his plight to make a good story that could help further his career. In the end, deep seeded relationships are made and the final episode makes the whole ride worth while. Really though, the ending made me smile big time!!!!",

            "content": "Animation and sound are both amazing and go together so well. This anime has some of the most suspenseful moments I've ever seen. The title sequence is also my favorite out of any anime. \r\nHow ever the story is not perfect, There are several holes in the plot and it is hard to follow at times. It is a great concept overall though and I was hooked from the first time I read the description. there are only a few main characters and they all play a big role at some point. There all awesome and exciting characters that you just want to know moreabout.. but you don't. This is the disappointing part, many of the characters, ALL the characters actually are very mysterious and you don't learn a whole lot about them. It is a short anime and it wraps up the plot nicely, but it could have just gone a little more in depth.",
