You will either absolutely love this or your reaction will be that there is a special place in hell for whoever dreamed this one up.\r\nI have devised a fool-proof test for whether you'll like this show or not. The results are based on your reaction to this joke:\r\nQuestion: Why did Salvador Dali's chicken cross the road? Answer: A fish, m*therf**ker.\r\nIf you found that joke to be funny, you'll enjoy this show and I am happy for you. For everyone else I'm reminded ofthe description of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. Watching this show is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. If only I knew some voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterward. Note that your enjoyment of this show has nothing whatever to do with your intelligence; only with what you find funny. If you are one of those folks who finds train wrecks mind-numbingly funny, then this is the show for you. For everyone else, you'll be better spending your time elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is intentionally poor. There is no story; just seemingly random, and I use the term loosely, gags.\\n\\n\r\nI set a new personal record for time spent before dropping a series.

            "content": "What makes a joke funny? Is it a well-thought build-up, steadily tied up, making us want to hear the punch line established at the end of a gag? Is it the topic a joke tackles, politically correct or, even better, the incorrect one? Is it the way it's presented and conveyed to us, with the use of different signals, voice tone and other small things people telling us the joke want to use in order to increase its impact? Or is it just the timing of it? No matter which of these reasons you choose, all of them are pale in comparison to the mostbasic aspect a pun, by definition, has to have in order to at least try to make an addressee laugh - the intention to be comical. As simply and straightforwardly as it sounds, I found it surprising that Pop Team Epic, an anime which the fans claim to be extremely witty and humorous, did not understand such a concept.\\n\\n\r\nIt looks as if this series' \"brain\" got stuck somewhere in the first grade of the elementary school, where the most random, stupid and nonsensical oneliners were considered to be absolutely hilarious. If you were to look at its episodes as something more than a shitpost, you would notice that within PTE, there are a lot of inconsistencies, among which, the fact that a gigantic portion of its gags, if not every single one of them, come off as undercooked, definitely stole the spotlight and single-handedly ruined every attempt at comedy. The structure of a standard joke consists of 2 elements: the build-up and the punchline, which I briefly referenced at the beginning, yet in this show, there seems to be no such thing as a punchline. As a result of it, the gags end up halfway through the build-up, leaving us without the conclusion. Because of it, quite literally, there's nothing to laugh at. By the end of the skit, the only thing we feel is indifference and abdominal pain because we just consumed something \"raw\". Heck, even though PTE makes a lot of brilliant and imaginative references to various popular movies, games, music or even anime, they simply could not be entertaining by themselves. That's not how references work, goddamnit! \"Play\" with them, mock the source material in a meaningful way, that's not offensive to the work itself, do something that makes at least a little bit of sense and aims at making me, the viewer, giggle. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also 2 \"miniseries\" in PTE, called Bob Epic Team and Pop Team Cooking, and oh boy, they accumulate everything this anime does wrong! Besides the easy to spot lack of care put into crafting the puns, Bob Epic Team, with its atrocious ideas and even worse execution of them is a completely and utterly disgusting abomination. Imagine a terrible paint drawing of a distorted character put into motion mixed with such cringey and lifeless scenes that the only thing you want to do, and in fact your brain forces you to do after witnessing such a travesty, is committing seppuku with a plastic knife doused in hot sauce for the extra spice. Pop Team Cooking, on the other hand, while suffers from the same problem of being lacklustre and inherently bad beyond salvation, is at least somewhat eye pleasant, which didn't lead my internal organs to be dying in an agonizing pain because of what I was seeing on my screen.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of being eye pleasant, the discriminative art style and simplistic animation, mixed with a live-action skit, 3D segments about France, which in all honesty, were mediocre at best, the previously mentioned appaling Paint drawings create a rather distinctive vibe and feel. The same can be said about the sound. The wacky and, to my surprise, lively voice acting, opening theme, different song parodies, for instance, Earth, Wind & Fire - Let's Groove, while they are not right up my alley, I can definitely see their purpose and appeal in such random and senseless series and to be honest, without the okay-ish production values, Pop Team Epic would be even harder to \"digest\" and that says a lot.\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic has its alright features, but at the end of the day, they meant nothing. It is just a terrifyingly awful meme you would find on some shitty website such as 9gag or ifunny and cry like a maniac, because of its quality. It's horrendous, it's shocking, it's unentertaining, but do you know which is the worst part? Some people will label it as an outstanding work because of that.",

            "content": "[Pop Culture References + Meme + Anime = Pop Team Epic]\r\n[Alternative Title \u2013 Memes, References, and High Quality Shitpost: the anime]\r\n*Part 1 of Review*\r\n(For those curious about this series, read this review):\r\nSTORY:\r\nStory? Who needs a story. Can\u2019t have a story, if you never had one. It\u2019s just random shit happening on screen because that\u2019s how Pop Team Epic rolls. The series features a variety of humor, ranging from black comedy (i.e. gallows humor \u2013 my favorite type of humor) to surreal humor to anti-humor, and to meta-jokes and parodies.\r\nThe series features many pop culture references, such as: Earth, Wind & Fire, Pok\u00e9mon, Hoshiiro Girldrop, Kimino Na wa, Chrono Trigger, Kemono Friends, My Neighbour Totoro, Metal Gear Solid 3 time paradox, Top Gun, Initial D, Hellshake Yano, YouTube subscribe, Undertale, Donkey Kong, the Shawshank Redemption, etc.\\n\\n\r\nI love how each episode has one long skit, such as sports anime (shogi/racing), science-fiction, murder-mystery, music, haunted house horror, romances, music documentary, etc, and manages to turn it into a parody. Loved every moment of it!\\n\\n\r\nEspecially, the entire Hellshake Yano sequence, in Episode 7; it was amazing and outstanding, considering everything was told through art sketches and the actors actually performing it on live camera. Glorious stuff!\\n\\n\r\nOther original skits include: Bob Epic Team shorts with the main character\u2019s face and body being distorted as hell, Japon Mignon shorts, live action actors and actresses, Pop Team Cooking shorts, POP TEAM 8-BIT, Pop Team Dance, etc. Every single skits was amazing, and well told and executed. I laugh at every single joke, reference, and parody, they displayed on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode contains two similar-looking 12-minute segments that feature different voice actors and other small changes to the skits. I think this idea is extremely unique and makes the anime stand out more compared to other anime series.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be a strange, bizarre, and even crazy, but this series allows numerous animators and content creators to have their creations shown on every medium, such as internet or television. It allows creativity to flow and flourish without any restrictions. And finally, it's not afraid to do what it wants to do. It just does it, and rolls with it!\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nSolid animations. Some of the skits come from the original comic strips, however the majority of them are original animations. The animators make use of a variety types of animations, such as fully 3D animations, CGI, 2D animations, live-action, stop-motion, and idiosyncratic animation from the AC-bu.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Kamikaze Douga is the primary animation studio that does 3D animation as well as the Hoshiiro Girldrop shorts; Space Neko Company does the 2D animations and \u201cPop Team Story\" shorts, i.e. the shorts that reference from the original comic; AC-bu does the idiosyncratic animations for \u201cBob Epic Team\" short; UchuPeople produces stop-motion animation for \u201cPop Team Dance\u201d shorts.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation may be bizarre, especially the idiosyncratic animations (i.e. distorted characters, background objects, and even strange fast-paced animations), it may be realistic (i.e. live-action, or the stop motion animations), or it may be crazy, but who cares, this is Pop Team Epic, where the crazy becomes even crazier.\\n\\n\r\nExcellent character models. Seeing Popuko and Pipimi being drawn in a variety of styles is interesting and dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nExcellent voice acting. The anime incorporates many voice actors and actresses to voice both Popuko and Pipimi. The voice actors for Popuko includes: Masashi Ebara, Y\u016bji Mitsuya, Aoi Y\u016bki, Toshio Furukawa, Y\u014dko Hikasa, Tessh\u014d Genda, Nana Mizuki, Hozumi G\u014dda, etc. The voice actors/actresses for Pipimi includes H\u014dch\u016b \u014ctsuka, Noriko Hidaka, Ayana Taketatsu, Shigeru Chiba, Mamiko Noto, Banj\u014d Ginga, etc. Then, we have french actor/actress, such as Fanny Bloc and Christine Bellier. I believe having many voice actors/actress changes thing up and makes it exciting, fun, and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEvery voice actor/actresses fits their roles and makes everything funnier. The male voice actors make everything twice as funny, especially when they sing songs and create exaggerated sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nExcellent opening song (i.e. \u201cPop Team Epic\u201d) by Sumire Uesaka, so good you get to hear it twice. Also, the first episode\u2019s opening song, titled \u201cTwinkling Star\u201d by Yui Ogura, Inori Minase, and Sumire Uesaka was also really good. The kick-ass opening sets the tone for the rest of the series. Excellent background music sets the mood, atmosphere, and tone for the characters and reactions to specific situations, whether it\u2019s comedy, mystery, drama, etc. The song, \u201cLet\u2019s Pop Together\u201d is an excellent parody of \u201cLet\u2019s Groove\u201d by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nExcellent characters that are funny and entertaining to watch. Background stories, character development, and even goals and motivations be damned; you know why you are watching this, and it\u2019s not for \u201cgreat character development or background stories\u201d. It\u2019s to watch two characters, Popuko and Pipimi, do crazy skits and perform hilarious jokes. I just love how Popuko and Pipimi are able to bounce jokes after jokes off each other.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nI smiled and laughed during every single episode. It doesn\u2019t matter what other people say, just watch for shits and giggles.\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is one of greatest show I ever watched in 2018.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\\n\r\nChange my mind.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n*Part 2 of Review*\\n\\n\r\n(For those on-the-fence about this show, please enjoy these lovely lyrics):\\n\\n\r\n\"Let's Pop Together\" by Pop Team Epic (Episode 4)\\n\r\n[A parody of \"Let's Groove\" by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]\\n\\n\r\nWe are pop team dance dance go\\n\r\nFor the fans and for the haters alike\\n\r\nDance dance go dance dance go\\n\r\nFor the fans and for the haters alike\\n\r\nYou haters will become fans eventually\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pop together, oh oh\\n\r\nLet\u2019s all live in harmony\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pop together, all night\\n\r\nWe love our fans\\n\r\nBecause they put food on our table\\n\r\nWe don\u2019t care about haters\\n\r\nThey\u2019re ridiculous, pathetic, not worth it at all\\n\r\nThe new manga volume is on sale now, you can buy it online\\n\r\nWhat a waste of money!\\n\r\nYou won\u2019t buy it?\\n\r\nAre you insane?\\n\r\nWe don\u2019t care, piss off\\n\r\nYay, the anime version is airing!\\n\r\nDon\u2019t bother me, I won\u2019t watch it\\n\r\nWhat, you\u2019re not watching it?\\n\r\nAre you stupid?\\n\r\nHow can you say this?\\n\r\nHow long are you going to fight this hater battle?\\n\r\nYou haters will become fans eventually\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pop together, oh oh\\n\r\nLet\u2019s all live in harmony\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pop together, all night\ufeff",

            "content": "*This review will mention a number of jokes from the series, mostly in vague terms to minimize spoilers while still offering a point of reference to those who have already seen it*\r\nAs soon as I committed to watching Poputepipikku (Pop Team Epic), I knew immediately that I wanted to talk about it, whether by discussing it with others or, as I have now done, writing a full review of this strange beast. It was clear that my opinion on it was different from the prevailing thoughts of the community. Of course that\u2019s not a bad thing; differences of opinion or perspective make such discussions farmore interesting, as opposed to a circle of like-minded cult members all chanting \u201cYes, man! Yes, man!\u201d in rhythmic turn.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, in the case of Pop Team Epic, the scenario looks more as if half the members in the circle suddenly turned to demons, the song of the ring an increasingly loud and aggressive \u201cNo, idiot!\u201d with both sides on the verge of slaughtering each other. Pop Team Epic is an unbelievably, viciously polarizing show, with outcries of love and hatred struggling for dominance. What could possibly make something so divisive? It's hard to say for sure, outside of the old saying that comedy is subjective, but it may have something to do with the show\u2019s unorthodox nature and format. Put simply, there\u2019s little else quite like Pop Team Epic, for better or worse. The closest reference point I can imagine would be parody sketch comedies like Robot Chicken, but even this fails to truly capture the format-stretching, meme-generating, self-aware surrealism on display here.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with little comparison to go on, and a product which in many ways defies traditional metrics, it\u2019s easy to become dismissive - to take your first, most basic impression of a title like Pop Team Epic and jump to conclusions about the work as a whole, whether positive or negative. I'll openly admit I did exactly this when I first saw the premiere episode, believing it to exist primarily to troll its audience (which it certainly does at times, but I'd hardly call it the show's sole purpose). Other stances span the full range from \"hilarious collection of memes about pop culture\" to \"insufferable unfunny barrage of nonsensical randomness to amuse the bottom-feeders of the internet\" among others - and to be clear, I'm not saying these specific stances are invalid or necessarily arise from quick dismissal. But if we're not careful, there's the risk of getting swept up in our immediate reactions and forgetting about the craft behind them - of losing perspective of the elements that go into the work as a whole to make it what it is. Pop Team Epic may come off as strange at times, but I believe like all media, it still deserves acknowledgement as an art piece, regardless of one's overall experience with it or eventual stance reached regarding its quality.\\n\\n\r\nSo here we are, as I make a serious attempt at understanding this show\u2019s vision and the tools it uses to pursue it, and then deciding whether or not I liked what I saw and why. All this, because I don't think a work like this should see its weird, experimental nature become an excuse to immediately write off its craft before at least giving an honest and open look at the content on display.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, there IS still the question of whether I personally liked it, so without further ado, I present my honest thoughts on this little oddity:\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is an absurdist sketch comedy starring Popuko and Pipimi, two recurring avatars who go around making all variety of over-the-top events happen, all while screwing with as many characters as possible, including the viewer watching it. It sets itself apart from other such comedies by embracing the concept of meta-humour, but in ways that are far more creative and interesting than the often-seen approach of simply breaking the fourth wall and calling attention to its tropes (some may know this as \u201clampshading\u201d). It also consistently gets creative with its formatting, whether subverting the standard 4-panel setup in various ways to enhance the element of surprise in its jokes, or making use of many alternative formats and styles to keep the variety up. Perhaps most critically, while wildly inconsistent in terms of quality, it shows an ability to tell its jokes without falling into common pitfalls of non sequitur and referential comedies\u2026 most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThat last point is one I\u2019d like to emphasize. Personally, I see more in this show's sense of humour than just arbitrary references for arbitrary references\u2019 sake, and this is coming from someone who typically isn\u2019t fond of non sequitur comedies. To explain why I feel this way, I feel it is helpful to try and break down why exactly I find randomness played for laughs to be ineffectual, as well as a bit about \u201chumour\u201d in general - hopefully, without coming off as conceited; it\u2019s no secret that comedy is a highly subjective affair, so take everything I'm about to say not as any sorts of \"rules\" for comedy, but rather, as an elaboration for why I find Pop Team Epic to work where so many others fail, leveraging my understanding of my personal sense of humour while still respecting the skill displayed by the content at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many theories out there which attempt to explain what makes something funny, but one that generally seems to align with my own sense of humour, and a useful starting point here, is Peter McGraw\u2019s Benign Violation Theory. Those interested in the study of humour are free to explore this and other theories, but to avoid needlessly padding this review, I\u2019ll stick to what\u2019s relevant here: it suggests that something will be funny if it simultaneously a) acts as a violation of what a person believes an aspect of the world \u201cought to be\u201d, and b) be presented in a benign (safe/non-threatening) manner. That's rather abstract, so to make a somewhat more concrete extension of this in the context of anime, one could theoretically achieve this by in some way surprising a viewer - such as by setting up expectations for the show or its universe and then defy them with some kind of \u201cpunchline\u201d, joke, whatever - but in a way such that the result is something the viewer won\u2019t find offensive, annoying, upsetting and so forth. Of course, this will vary from viewer to viewer. This is only one approach and not a perfect explanation by any stretch, nor are these anything close the only variables which may be involved. But it's a helpful springboard for diving into this show's content.\\n\\n\r\nApplying this idea to non sequitur humour, if something incredibly out of place suddenly shows up in a show\u2019s universe, then you\u2019ve defied the viewer\u2019s expectations for that universe, so you might get a laugh once or twice. But by repeating this joke, once it\u2019s been established that weird or arbitrary things can and will happen in this universe, you lose that element of surprise for any future irregular occurrences, and the effect is lost. Worse still, if everything is completely random, without some thread of logic or flow to latch onto, viewers may stop expecting anything aside from this randomness. And, if you keep showing non sequitur after non sequitur, and the viewer interprets that as the joke, it could get incredibly obnoxious.\\n\\n\r\nOne could also say similar things for referential humour; the first reference is an unexpected intrusion on the show\u2019s universe originating from another, but if you keep throwing out bare references, then the viewer begins to expect them.\\n\\n\r\nGiven this predicament, how exactly does Pop Team Epic seem to avoid this pitfall? The answer, I believe, is that Pop Team Epic is not truly random; it would be more accurate to say that the specific subject matter of any one of its mini-skits is seemingly random. By this, I mean that any given skit can have literally any topic of focus, regardless of what the previous one focused on, but on the other hand, most of the individual skits themselves do have their own sense of continuity and strange yet self-consistent logic. What this means is that so long as Pop Team Epic is able to set up and deliver actual punchlines through these self-consistent skits, it can function as an effective comedy despite its apparent randomness of subject matter and the prevalence of pop culture references. Does Pop Team Epic do any of this, with any degree of success?\\n\\n\r\nYes, it definitely does!\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the basics, Pop Team Epic makes use of many commonly-cited forms of humour in amongst all its madness. These include, among many others, comedic shifts in tone (certain \u201cHoshiiro Girldrop\u201d interjections), ironic character actions (the cigarette joke in an idol skit), situations being taken 4 steps further than expected to the point of absurdity (the same idol skit\u2019s conclusion), escalatory repetition (episode 2\u2019s manga speech bubble skit), some puns and wordplay I\u2019m not qualified to evaluate, and, alas, a few instances of seemingly barebones references that don\u2019t seem to have any strings attached. However, those latter types are thankfully a much smaller minority than one might expect. In most cases, there\u2019s a concerted effort to at least add something of substance the the reference in question, even if it\u2019s not always immediately apparent.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, simply having punchlines present isn\u2019t enough on its own. The fact that most of these \u201ctraditional\u201d styles of jokes are condensed into extremely short skits (setting aside some longer-form exceptions with multiple punchlines like the aforementioned idol skit) does pose a challenge for the show in terms of having the time to instill expectations or ideas in a viewer, and then deliver a joke that isn\u2019t completely obvious from the brief setup given. However, I personally found Pop Team Epic\u2019s success rate to be higher than anticipated, perhaps because its variety of material and approaches gave it plenty of options for what direction to take any given skit in, while still maintaining that critical sense of flow to avoid a nosedive into true randomness. It\u2019s a precarious approach - a constant balancing act which didn\u2019t hold every single time - but as far as I\u2019m concerned, it worked well enough.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, this show does make use of some tried and true approaches to telling jokes, and frequently succeeds at maintaining the elements of surprise, buildup and payoff. However, Pop Team Epic is no ordinary comedy, and in addition to these more conventional approaches, it also carries a number of less-common tricks in its grab bag.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, Pop Team Epic will often subvert the standard 4-panel format in order to further enhance its element of surprise, or add even more variety to how its jokes are delivered. 4-panel comedy strips will often spend three panels setting the stage, and then deliver their punchline on the fourth panel. This, of course, also applies to their adaptations, whether or not the boundaries between skits, sections or scenarios remain clear after the transition. In the case of Pop Team Epic, this transition is marked clear as polished glass by voiced-over title cards.\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic, however, often defies this conventional setup by placing an unexpected punchline near the beginning of the skit - what would be equivalent to the first or second panel in its original form - with the remaining panels adding onto it in some way, such as by taking the joke to further extremes or making humorous comments. This further adds to the element of surprise by varying the timing at which a punchline can hit.\\n\\n\r\nIn other cases, Pop Team Epic will flip the idea of the non sequitur card on its head, taking its normally-unrelated skits which the viewer expects to be unrelated in subject matter, and adds unexpected continuity between them to catch the viewer off guard. A good example of this (***brief spoiler for episode 3) is in a skit about Pipimi trying out a car, another person making disclaimers about its red colour and quietness, and Pipimi being satisfied, commenting that they can \u201ckill in silence\u201d and hide the blood on the car\u2019s crimson hue. The skit ends, and the viewer expects the joke to end with it. Then the next skit is about Popuko looking for a job, and Pipimi handing her a suitcase full of cash, a gun, and a hitlist for assassination.\\n\\n\r\n(***end of spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nAt another point, a skit makes reference to a certain piece of media, and then the next skit starts exactly the same way as the first, because the circumstances the first skit ended on would trigger a time reset in the universe being referenced. As a brief aside, this displays what I look for in referential humour. There should be some kind of punchline to go with the reference, and if the reference is necessary to understand the joke, its source should be something fairly recognizable to whatever audience is viewing it. In this instance, these conditions were met, showing that, at least some of the time, Pop Team Epic seems to understand that its frequent references cannot carry the comedy on its own.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more straightforward level, Pop Team Epic will change up the styles and even mediums in which it presents a given skit. Later episodes in particular got especially creative with exploring new formats, including alternate animation styles, various live-action/animation mixtures, and an enthralling segment involving two live-action performers manipulating pages of a sketchbook. This variety alone added a certain degree of entertainment value simply in seeing what the show would come up with next, even setting aside some of the jokes that were told by leveraging these new formats.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s enough about formatting. It\u2019s time to graduate to talking about the show\u2019s attempts at full-on meta-humour that I\u2019ve been building up.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019m usually not the biggest fan of meta-humour, but this has less to do with the concept than it does with the execution. As I mentioned before, I very often see attempts at meta-humour amount to little more than breaking the fourth wall, or a show plainly pointing out what tvtropes.org entry it\u2019s using at that particular moment. My gripes with this type of humour are similar to those of the non sequitur and referencial varieties: in isolation, as a one-off joke or small aside, it can work. However, doing it repeatedly ceases to surprise and can become increasingly annoying when overused. Furthermore, it simply lacks creativity; it takes next to no effort to do it and is far too common an approach. In short: it\u2019s a lazy, done-to-death gimmick.\\n\\n\r\nBut once again, Pop Team Epic steps beyond these trappings! It doesn\u2019t stop at trivial self-awareness or fourth wall breaks. Instead, the fourth wall ceases to exist here, and the show makes use of the viewer's acceptance of its self-aware nature to tell jokes that simply wouldn\u2019t have been the same otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nA character proclaims an action they'll perform in 30 minutes; the show shows them standing there waiting in real time as the ending sequence plays in the background. Viewer comments complaining about an animation quirk in certain segments are read; the show fixes this quirk and lets you witness the humorous results for yourself. Later episodes make sudden, unexpected yet seemingly obvious additions to the opening theme to comedic effect. Even the necessary censorship of copyrighted words leads to a pun that translated shockingly well into English, with the incredibly stupid yet earnest results leaving me rolling! These are just a few of many examples of Pop Team Epic reaching beyond usual approaches to meta-humour. These gags are novel, creative, and often surprisingly witty, leading to arguably some of the show\u2019s best and most unique material.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m saying, in essence, is that for all this show's madness, I do see a method behind it. It has far more tricks to offer than simply throwing snot, superglue, tree sap, maple syrup, sticky notes and other trinkets at the viewer in hopes that something will stick. Furthermore, these tricks are often interesting and creative in their own right, and the show displays a clear ability to make use of them for uniquely comedic effect. Well, most of the time, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, here is where I must address my main gripe with the series: its inconsistency.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I found many of Pop Team Epic\u2019s skits to be a hit, and for others could at the very least see what the joke was, there were also quite a few segments which I simply didn\u2019t understand. Whether it was because I didn\u2019t know a reference, the joke was poorly presented, or because there simply wasn\u2019t a joke at all, I can\u2019t say for sure. Regardless, many of them just seemed to truly be random, have no point, or in rarer cases, simply exist as a reference with no apparent joke attached. Of course, some such segments turned out to simply be setting up for punchlines in later skits (\u201cAre you upset?\u201d, though this one arguably had a punchline to begin with), while others could be seen as planting expectations for a later variation with something in common (the first knitted musical number), continuing the trend of playing with the 4-panel format. Others, however, seemed to lack even this purpose.\\n\\n\r\nFor some of these segments, one could make a case for anti-humour - intentionally skipping the expectation of a punchline as a punchline in and of itself, or perhaps having the punchline be that what\u2019s happening should, in fact, be taken at face value. However, I found that these segments seemingly devoid of a punchline happened a bit too frequently for this to work. As such, they had little impact and forced me to simply give up on trying to figure them out. Congratulations, Pop Team Epic, you've stumped me!\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say this, though: I\u2019d much rather a joke fly over my head completely than have it bashed into my head and get brain damage. But a quick smack to the face is perfectly okay!\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, I\u2019m fine with blunt and over-the-top presentation (which can be found aplenty here), but I tend to dislike it when such presentation is combined with repeating or over-explaining trivial and obvious punchlines in a way that feels unnatural or forced. It comes across as the show being afraid the viewer might be too stupid to get it otherwise, or as some desperate attempt to draw additional laughs from something that\u2019s clearly run dry of them. Thankfully, Pop Team Epic definitively avoids this particular pet peeve of mine. I can think of very few instances of a joke lingering beyond its allotted laugh-span - maybe some of the \u201cHoshiiro Girldrop\u201d material overstayed its welcome. But even in those cases, it didn\u2019t feel like it was forcibly dragged out, but rather, it simply went on as long as one might expect - which happened to be a bit longer than I found it funny - so this generally didn\u2019t bother me much.\\n\\n\r\nIn all other cases, Pop Team Epic, leveraging its 4-panel format, moves at a quick pace, with quick setup, quick delivery of its jokes, and quickly moving on from it, whether you \u201cgot it\u201d or not. This sense of pacing also means that even though many jokes or skits may fail to hit their target, their rate of fire is high enough to minimize long stretches of barren content. There are still some weaker episodes, mainly early on, but I found the series as a whole to fare quite well in holding my interest and keeping me amused.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, I\u2019ve just about covered my reasons for enjoying this show for what it is. For those brave or curious enough to give it a shot, a few things are worth noting in deciding how to watch it. First, if using official subtitles, I recommend going for Hidive\u2019s over Crunchyroll\u2019s. Many of the jokes contain nuances present in the former but lost in the latter. Funimation's English dub may also be a worthy alternative, but I can't speak on this personally. Secondly, Pop Team Epic has an unusual albeit suitable quirk in which every 12-minute episode is broadcast twice in a row, with the second adding extra context or substance to many of the jokes while giving Popuko and Pipimi different voice actors (usually a gruff male set for the second, adding to the surrealism). I myself usually preferred to skip to the 11:50 mark of each episode and just watch the more detailed second version, but how one chooses to respond to this quirk is up to them.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, most of us watch comedies primarily for laughter, and no matter how many types or theories of humour we may discuss to explain our enjoyment or lack thereof, in the end, laughter is personal, which all but guarantees that titles with wildly diverging opinions like this one will show up from time to time. So for those who enjoy the show as a collection of memes for forum boards, or simply as \u201cShitpost: The Anime\u201d, that\u2019s fine; keep doing so. Likewise, if you find the show insufferable to watch, there\u2019s no need to force yourself into thinking otherwise. But by the same token, whether watching it casually or going for further analysis, love or hate it, appreciate or despise it, let's not sit here and pretend that our own viewpoint or experience is the only legitimate one, that everyone in the circle who disagrees must be idiots, or that the work sitting in the middle is somehow beneath us.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my opinion, I enjoyed Pop Team Epic, both as a novelty act and as its own standalone product. Despite being more than a bit inconsistent, it still has its share of funny and memorable moments thanks to its straight-to-the-point attitude, creative use of meta-humour and blunt delivery of surreal gags, while mostly avoiding potential pitfalls of abusing non sequitur and referential humour. While it certainly won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, the show is also wholly committed to its unusual vision and shows a degree of skill in using its varied material, structuring and formatting to sell its unique brand of absurdity, For that, I respect it.",

            "content": "Before anyone can answer the question: \"What is Pop Team Epic?\" I believe a more pressing question is more like \"Why in hell am I writing a serious review of this shit post?\"\r\nActually, I have an answer to that question, unlike the first one. First of all, I love my absurd and nonsensical Chinese cartoons; I have a special place in my heart (and in some case my Top 10) for shows like Nichijou, Daily Lives of HS Boys, and of course, Gintama. That said, I don't really think Pop Team Epic can really stand up to those shows when we are talking about howentertaining they are, disregarding how much meaning or (non)sense they have integrated into their identity. \\n\\n\r\nI understand these are all big words, so I'll simplify it for those who only care for this anime because it's a shitpost:\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is a funny shitpost... but it gets old pretty quick. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I have to say, this show almost convinced me that I should think otherwise, as this show isn't really trying to be anything grander than a shitpost.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is- while I can get lost watching vines, cracks and just plain memes on YouTube all day, I really can't say the same for Pop Team Epic. \\n\\n\r\nI understand I am only on the fourth episode of the anime as I am making this review, however, I am already bored of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the anime is that random bullshit doesn't always equal entertainment for the audience. Bullshit needs consistency in its logic (unfortunately), or else it just becomes aimless, incoherent and pointless. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not like the anime is trying to parody one thing either. If it dedicated it's entire runtime to parodying JRPG anime like SAO (for example), then at least there would be something there for people to refer to for humor. It's a simple case of knowing what they are referencing, and the joke accurately making fun of the concept in a refreshing way. \\n\\n\r\nParody anime like Gintama have mastered this effectively- I'm not going to give spoilers, but a recent example of how Gintama plays with concepts found in its genre (shounen) and then shits on it while making it genuinely entertaining, is a scene from one of the latest episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe scene was of negotiations. On \"our\" side, we had the Shogun, whom now has bowel problems (it makes sense why he has bowel problems in context) and of one of the enemy leaders who was requested to negotiate with. The bowel problems in a normal shounen would be similar to that of \"butterflies in the stomach\", however, the joke doesn't stop there as it builds on itself. The shogun tries to subtly hint at his need to go to the bathroom without being direct about it, the enemy takes his references out of context and interprets them as threats. Without ruining the joke by saying what happens next, essentially the enemy leader understands by the end that the Shogun needed to shit, and \"negotiations\" end there. Both are embarrassed, to say the least, and all misconceptions between the two sides are adjourned. That is literally how you shit on negotiations.\\n\\n\r\nNow after reading that somewhat competent explanation of a joke you probably didn't understand, tell me, when does Pop Team Epic do something like that?\\n\\n\r\nInitially, I thought Pop Team Epic was a parody of the slice of life genre, much like Nichijou, by taking scenarios you would see in real life and pushing the joke to 11. I haven't read the 4-Koma manga, but I remember a few strips that would support that claim- as I saw that Popuko was giving the middle finger in a scenario you really wouldn't because of social norms. I thought when I saw this \"This would really be funny because that's what we all want to do\", so where is all of this in the anime?\\n\\n\r\nI suppose it can be later down the road, but why do we also have to do a parody of video games (that really doesn't make sense), horror movies, anime, manga, Hollywood blockbuster films intermixed with random nonsense that both looks ugly and makes no sense, AND THEN having the entire episode repeat itself before having time to comprehend it?\\n\\n\r\nThere's such a thing as overload, and Pop Team Epic doesn't seem to understand that you can't be funny without something like a breather. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the lack of consistency in both the animation and stories themselves damages all suspension of disbelief. That said, I never had any, nor did it need suspension of disbelief, because the purpose of this anime is to shit on other media. \\n\\n\r\nAll Pop Team Epic needed to do was shit on others right. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it didn't.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm sure that something will change in the span of the next 9 episodes, actually, I am practically guaranteeing that they'll do something crazy for their finale. But right now I am just bored of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is Pop Team Epic? I suppose Pop Team Epic is just... too much of everything.",

            "content": "There are certain anime series that get you wondering \"what the actual frigging hell am I watching\"...Pop Team Epic is an epitome of that kind of series. Even though it is meant to be a shitposting kind of series, shitposting doesn't actually mean good comedy (I'll go into a bit more detail about that in my review). It had me to the point where I was questioning even why this became an anime series in the first place. I'll be frank with this, even though I'm probably gonna anger some crazy fans: this thing is actually qualified as TRASH.\r\nI'll try to be brief with thisreview, cause even with just reviews, it's hard to really input anything decent about this series.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Story? Plot? HAHA, what plot? What story? In pretty much every decent to great series, you need to have some sort of story or settings implemented. Pop Team Epic had none of the sort...to me, at least, it is basically the Japanese version of Robot Chicken, but much worse. The parodies, skits, references, whatever the joke may be...that's ALL there really is to this series. Oh yeah, about the Hoshiro Girldrop tease and then the hi-jacking, it IS funny, I'll admit, but for the most part, it's just one cringy joke after another, and honestly, that kind of stuff can get bland after a while. When people tell me this series is very philosophical, I think it's more so of how it gets you thinking philosophically as to why this series is one of the most absurd things you'd have ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nART: I don't really have much to say about the art other than the fact it's the kind of art (excluding some parts) that you'd see in anime specials/shorts or in those wacky-looking Western cartoons. The chibi looks and all that for the two main characters, though...doesn't make them look any good whatsoever. I guess it's sorta okayish, but barely anyone is really gonna praise it or even be attentive to it, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Well, not much to say about it. I will admit that some of the ending themes were done pretty well, but for the most part, whatever soundtracks are featured will depend on the respective joke or parody, and even then are very subpar and mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: So the main characters here: a yellow haired shortie that gets easily triggered (sometimes for no reason) and a blue haired lanky quiet girl. Popuko and Pipimi are just really there with their rather contrasting personalities to set up each joke and play it out in the most absurd and ridiculous of fashions. Knowing that, I don't see how one can really like them as a character in general. The only way one would be able to like any of them is for the fact that they are at least the perfect fit, in terms of their personality, to make the jokes as outrageous as possible.\\n\r\nAs for character development...considering what this \"series\" is, there is none, and none needed. The supporting cast? Really depends on what the joke/parody/reference/gag is, honestly. The only truly recurring members are the ones that are part of the Hoshiro Girldrop skit, that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Now here's the part I really want to try to make clear. My level of enjoyment is usually mid-ground, but it purely depends on the jokes with each different episode. I do want to point out early that each episode is really just two copies of the same stuff placed together in the same 30 min timeframe...so it's more like 12-15 of just ridiculousness followed by another 12-15 minutes of the exact same damn thing...it's as if the staff thinks we can't get enough of it, for pete sakes.\\n\r\nI personally couldn't find myself really entertained after the first episode...in fact, the jokes eventually felt dry and bland, or just straight up cringe that doesn't turn out funny to me. Honestly, I'd get more kick out of watching classic Western/American cartoons or live TV shows where they have a similar sort of format, but a better display of hilarity and jokes. In short, enjoyment level for this series REALLY depends on how funny or stupid the comedy is, and for me, it's middle-ground. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Beware, as this series can be a mentally exhausting experience. Honestly, this is a kind of series that people would only support for the lols (OR LOL attempts). Even the artist contributions don't even really have much worth for it at all. Even Futurama, Family Guy, and American Dad actually had much better examples of random (though mostly inappropriate) comedy.\\n\r\nAs one who has suffered them and survived to tell the tale, I advise one with their sanity still intact to just avoid this like a god damn plague....however, if that you're THAT bored to where you're only entertained by ridiculousness and absurdity, I guess this series may fit your bill, but even then, you may eventually find it boring if the jokes don't rub you the right way. Granted, at least it's not something like Ousama Game, Boku no Pico, School Days, or Mars of Destruction.\\n\r\nAnd on that note, my rant of this \"series\" is done.",

I at least chuckled a couple times, so I've seen worse comedy anime. This is still pretty damn bad!\r\nPlot?\r\nThe plot is that random pop culture references happen. Oh look they referenced Skyrim! Oh look they referenced Dark Souls...and that's the joke. They referenced something. At least in Kobayashi's Dragon Maid when they parody Dark Souls, the joke is that a 5,000 year old, all powerful dragon is becoming addicted to a video game and acting like an otaku.The joke isn't just that they alluded to the game in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTwo girls who are drawn absurdly poorly make references and flip you the bird.

Also it looks slightly better than President Trap Kun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I saw the first episode I had a feeling of sheer dread in my stomach. I felt certain that MAL was going to rate this show over 8.5 and make it the ironically overrated series of the year. We did it with Pingu in 2017. Haha the joke is that it isn't really an anime. Remember how funny it was when Papa Franku made this same joke about FOUR FUCKING YEARS AGO! We did it with Food Wars. I personally don't see what makes Nichijou and Gintama THAT much better than this shit, but I don't need to understand MAL's taste. I'm just so proud of you guys right now. It's a shit series and it's rated like shit! Praise be to God!",

            "content": "Pop Team Epic is the name. Offering jokes that make no sense its game. Like it or not, it's all the same. Your sense of humor is to blame. \r\nPhilosophers, fools and shitposters all around the globe have been asking this question recently, but also since the dawn of tragicomedy: What makes a joke funny? Is there a single factor that answers to this question? Everything can be funny as long as it is presented in the preferred way. Much like with anime series, it is all about the execution. But this is still all about personal preferences, perspective and knowledge. How can a popculturereference deliver if one does not know what is is referring to? The original question has been answered already hundreds of times: The funny was inside you all along. #deep  #derp\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is a series thats target audience is the whole internet culture. Its jokes varie greatly from parodies to live action interviews. From original content to ridiculously bad coaxed into a snafu-tier memes. It's even familiar with taiwanese puppet shows, obscurities of all sort, and awkward elevator music. The series has a bit of everything, and for this reason its writing is full of quality differences. It's nearly impossible for every joke appeal to all viewers. Almost every joke in it can be understood in different ways and found to be funny/not funny for different reasons. This is quite original for comedy series and part of the reason why I found the series to be worth of my time so much that I watched it twice. There has been quite a few obscure comedies in the past, such as Masuda Kousuke Gekijou, Gag Manga Biyori and Tensai Senshi, but none of them successful. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual idea behind the series production is fairly interesting. It shows us how much voice actors can change the tone of the series and the aspects of jokes. Every episode is approximately 24 minutes long, but in practice it is just 12 minutes of either identical or highly similar content. The main difference are the voice actors. Other half is presented with male seiyuus and the another with female seiyuus. The male version typically also comes with extras such as quest analysis, voice-over live action reaction to the joke, and whatever else. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series for its uniqueness, different approach, and scenes such as flip-cover live action music show presented by 2 members of the production team. There is simply no other anime in existence that would even try to do content like this. It alone is worth of something: worth of giving Pop Team Epic a go.",

No matter how you try to look at at this anime, it's a trash. It is nothing more but a much of editing created by a bunch of idiots.\r\n  Just like the people who gave this a 1,  Kamikaze Douga never wanted to create a masterpiece, they wanted to create a piece of sh*t. And the anime tells us loud and clear:\"We poured our heart in to make a piece of trash.\" \r\n  Thus,20 minutes of completely random, pointless and bad jokes were created. What? You didn't have any pleasure while watching it? Perfect! Because that's exactly what the creators whats, to completely sh*t on your face. To play you around their weird and old references like a toy. \\n\r\n  And for those who saw the first episode, went on this site filled with rage, gave this anime a 1, and never touched it again, then congratulation, you at least are serious when it comes to watching anime. \\n\\n\r\n\"You mad?\"\\n\r\n\"I'm not mad.\"\\n\r\n\"You mad?\"\\n\r\n\"I'm not mad.\"\\n\r\nPerfect, let me beat you up, deep fried you and then cookies out of you.\\n\r\n\"You mad?\"\\n\r\n\"I'm not mad.\"\\n\\n\r\nLastly, for those who analyze this anime frame by frame, joke by joke.

It is a cultural celebration of anime as a whole from the adapted works of Bkub Okawa into many reaches of genre, style and presentation, and it's pretty shitty!\r\nThere's absolutely no need to dawn any thinking caps, judgemental barometers or even acquired tastes to appreciate everything Pop Team Epic has to offer, from the prospective yet tastefully dated memes and references, to the plethora of genres it covers from comedy to action, horror to romance, sci-fi to thriller etc., to the gunbelt array of studios and producersof each segment all representative of the vast styles of anime such as olden, CGI, modern, experimental, and everything in between, leads like Kamikaze Douga (haha snuck in some JoJo), Space Cat Company, Thibault Tresca, the immensely talented Makoto Yamashita and of course, the awe inspiring AC Department, all who've each handed well respected and unforgettable adaptations and original content.\\n\r\nFollowing suite to the meat of this review, Pop Team Epic is graded under the usual criteria but under the circumstances of its genre and meaning:\\n\\n\r\nStory -/10\\n\r\nEach encounter is completely unaffected by the last and helps portray the randomness and non-linear coherse plot that this anime obviously does not have. A simple story regarding the ominous shadow lords does encapsulate itself in the beginning, but you have to watch the show to find out what happens afterwards though~ \u2665\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nWhether spot on manga recreations, free liberty of Bob Epic Team, or the wonderful CGI portrayal, each representation is beautifully done to their own accord and some background art even having more right than needed be to look as good as they do for a show such as this. Only the best here.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music 10/10\\n\r\nAll effects are mastered well, both sides of repeating episodes featuring male and female voice overs were spectacular, (another bonus point, what show can you name off the top of your head that does this revolutionary thing) nobody is inaudible unless needed to be and the music is absolutely glorious, from OP to ED, in different styles and singers, and especially the OST capturing moods perfectly. Eisaaai! Haramasukoi!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nEveryone and thing is just so cute ohmigoooooooo-\\n\r\nNo doubts here, all main and supporting cast are destinctive, expressive, and most importantly, memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Pop Team Epic is fantastically enjoyable to nearly everyone who's finna woke at any time or situation, barring short term dated memes. Make no mistake, it is a shitty anime, everyone thinks so too, but it's undeniably a show that will withstand time and harbour memories of reliving the golden ages of anime as a whole, while bringing whole communities together, old and new. 10/10.\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading!",

Art is a creative process, and there is nothing creative about Pop Team Epic. It is an amalgam of references strewn about in the most banal of ways. Skyrim exists. Totoro exists. Pok\u00e9mon exists. That is all Pop Team Epic has to say. It just reminds you that better media exists, but in ways that are disrespectful and offensive to the time of the unfortunate viewer.\r\nPop Team Epic is a dreadful product. It is anti-art. It is anti-comedy.It is a middle finger to those who produce art because Pop Team Epic is devoid of creativity, vision, and passion; or to put it simply, something that is not art but wishes it was, and so instead it has to violently lash out towards.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation quality is awful. It is a poor adaptation of the source material, as the production staff was so obviously unaware of the differences between print and animated mediums. The sound is exceptionally poor. Normally a production like this would not be given the OK, but in the case of Pop Team Epic, it was allowed to pass because it was not a serious artistic product, but a way to sell merchandise to easily manipulated consumers through viral 24 minute commercials under the guise of of art.",

So for an anime short that doesn't give a shit, well for LA, LA might as well go with the crowd with it and LA enjoyed immensely or sometimes just utterly baffled in some skits with how this anime short just didn't give a shit with almost no sign of low quality baiting (Bob Team Epic is bloody taking the piss out of it you realize?) thus doing it well for the most part from the aforementioned pop culture references to the out of animation skits...though there are some flaws with that mainly the weirdness of Bob Team Epic series and those French segments which is...just WTF for LA but still it's Pop Team Epic.\\n\\n\r\nOk ok so the obvious is that if you don't like dank memes like these then you can unsubscribe to this anime short because that's really is what Pop Team Epic is, you wanna change whatever Pop Team Epic is from a trolling anime short into....into what?...then it's no Pop Team Epic either way. It's shitposting in the form of anime at it's finest. WHY do you think Pop Team Epic had a 22 minute run time but had only the first 10 minutes REPEATED TWICE just with different voice actors and some small changes here and there?, because Pop Team Epic being a full fledged anime series was a jab at those people who didn't think it would be possible and Pop Team Epic banked on it and WORKED.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well the \"animation\" is the say the least as even though the animation done by Kamikaze Douga is there in it's varieties of 2D to 3D animation, from the intentionally poor quality work of Bob Team Epic series to the live action French segments and Hellshake Yano and the Live Voice acting skit, HELL Pop Team Epic by definition blends both 2D and LIVE ACTION together at times and showing the diverse range of \"animation\" used for an anime short such as this but nonetheless Pop Team Epic's skit based formula was used especially in the animation department is by overall.....diverse and rather great at that, even the OP is amazing!.\\n\\n\r\nHoshiiro Girl Drops needs an fully fleshed out anime!!! wait it's getting a second season REJOICE MOTHERFUCKERS!!...yes the anime short short that had little coverage only at the end of the credits halfway the anime short...Hi Yui Ogura!!!\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is shitposting at it's finest, surreal and WTFery is it's bread and butter with diverse and by the looks of it, high budget for such an anime short ABOUT dank memes it's amazing Pop Team Epic even GOT an anime to begin with, so don't be cynical and watch what is by a definition of the finest quality shitposting in anime form you've seen...that will be dated in no time, thanks Internet!.",

I think the answer must be no but Poputepipikku showed out of nowhere and everyone liked it . Do I think liking somehing is wrong? Of course I don't everyone has his own personal taste . I just don't like Poputepipikku . The reson is the jokes are occasionaly hard to understand . Everything feels like it's repetitive and after a whole lot of shitposting (That's what i do at every social network) it gets boring . It doesn't ruinit's potential I mean a lot of shitpost lovers will going to like this because they have no life and all they do is shitposting everyday (that's sad) . Poputepipikku's main problem is after a while weirdness starts to be boring . Every episode is just only weird nothing more than that . Memes , references and jokes are not good because you can't understand any of them (maybe a lot of Japanese culture will help) . Poputepipikku gets boring after a while and their whole thing becomes pathetic . Basically if you watch 1 episode of Poputepipikku you could count yourself that you watch the whole series . Because that is the only thing there , nothing more . That's why I don't like it . Overall 1/10",

            "content": "Hoshiiro Girldrop came as a surprise this year. What appeared to be nothing more than a generic slice of life series actually ended up being a rather heartwarming experience.\r\nThis review may contain mild spoilers, but I won't go into detail about anything specific past the first episode.\r\nHoshiiro Girldrop follows the antics of our two main characters, Daichi and Sosogu. These childhood friends are reunited in a peculiar way: Sosogu just kinda moved in with Daichi.\r\nApparently Daichi made a promise to her long ago, but he has no recollection of this at all. \r\nNow if I'm being honest, Daichi isn't one of the best protagonists. Hischaracter can come across as bland. His chemistry with Sosogu on the other hand makes the show, mostly because\\n\r\nthey're the most mismatched couple possible. An old standard for romcoms, sure, but why fix what ain't broke.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're looking for a fun romcom/slice of life to pass the time, Hoshiiro Girldrop is definitely a show for you, but so far the show hasn't presented anything to make this a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nI rate Hoshiiro Girl--- NOT!\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Pop Team Epic. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of intensive psychology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer\u2019s head. There\u2019s also Pipimi\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from shitpost literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they\u2019re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Pop Team Epic truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Popuko\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cA H ? Y O U  A R E  M O T H E R F * C K E R ?,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to bkub\u2019s Japanese epic Hoshiiro Girldrop. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Okawa\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Pop Team Epic tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It\u2019s for the ladies\u2019 eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they\u2019re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid \ud83d\ude0e\\n",

The random jokes which could be a hit or miss, the references butthe people making the anime never realized that making a reference wasn't the funny part, it was how it was presented and used which makes it funny, take Gintama for example, that anime has a lots of references but that wasn't why it is funny, it's funny because of how it used those reference in the episodic or even arc episodes after the reference, I was watching the episodes and starting to hope for the IDOL love stuff at the preview to become the actual anime rather than this one specially at the start, the anime.\\n\r\nAlso bob epic team was garbage. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing is probably the cringy stuff that was made during the last 12 weeks that the producers/publishers were doing, for example making the same episode twice because it's a troll XD, broadcasting the same episode 8 times in a row just to make a reference and other cringy stuff that made feel sorry for them for wasting all that money unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the anime is the Opening, it's so good from song to the animation in it, well the animation in the whole anime was amazing tbh.\\n\r\nThere were some jokes that made me funny and references that were used nicely but they were rare which is why the anime wasn't enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give it a generous 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it tbh reading it would be better.",

I gotta rewatch to remember how the bgm sounds to say anything more in depth about it lol.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has nothing to do at all with what makes a standard anime great. There's no character development, there's no deep layering of plot(or plot to begin with), there's no proper pacing, no, none of that from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you are an edgy meme lord that already knows about this anime, chances you'll like it is slim. Though it's nothing like what someone criticized it for \"being random\". This anime HAS NO PLOT.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't need to follow a rule to comedy. I must admit it's quite \"random\" in it's different jokes in the sense that you'll not expect what gags they put out next. \\n\\n\r\nSome are straight up not funny, some are just straight up retarded autism. But it's the fact that I can't guess what's coming up next that keeps me entertained. I don't even get more than half the references they put out. Maybe that's what pushes people away from this anime but if you don't mind and can appreciate poking fun at anything at all, you might like this.\\n\\n\r\nI must say though, those references/what they poke fun at I don't get at all can be really excruciating to sit through. Especially when the skit is like 5 minutes long and you're like wtf throughout it, then have to watch it again(with different voice acting). The anime is basically half as long with the other half being different voice acting, and a subtle change in dialog sometimes if you're attentive enough.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's just a shitpost. If you hate if you hate it. If you love shitpost you'll love it. Of course I'm one of them. I ain't professional so screw my review if you think I make shit sense but yeah just a slice of an apple\\n\\n",

For the first couple of episodes I watched both parts and felt like I was wasting my time. There are only a few minor changes aside from the voice actors being swapped out, and it's just enough to feel like I probably missed a couple good jokes, but not enough to justify watching the whole thing.\r\nStory - 5:\r\nI'm also putting humor in this section since that's basically all this show is. There were times where this show legitimately had me laughing, butmost of the time stuff was happening and it wasn't particularly engaging. I particularly disliked bob epic team.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8:\\n\r\nThey did a really good job at keeping the style of the comics, and there were times where the effects were also really well done, and then there was bob epic team. I didn't like those skits and the art in them was bad, yes it was intentional, but it was still bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is alright, some of the songs are good, most are just alright. There were times in the show where the sound effects were on point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4:\\n\r\nThe characters did what they did for the sake of doing it. I have no particular fondness for either one, but I do like their designs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5:\\n\r\nThere were times I was laughing, but most of the time I was just uninterested.",

Maybe I\u2019m just a low iq idiot who can\u2019t understand the deep themes in pop team epic. Who knows?\r\nThis show was fun for about 1 episode, 2 at max. In the beggining it was kind of like \u201dhaha this is funny because it\u2019s shitposting and that\u2019s not common for anime. Anime of the year amirite LUL.\u201d But then you realize you\u2019re a fucking retard.\r\nIn my mind, this show is built upon three things. Cool gamer references, random=funny humour and 4th wall breaking.  The easiest thing to throw shit atis the random=funny aspect so I\u2019ll start with that. Unless you\u2019re still in the 4th grade you won\u2019t find this funny. That\u2019s just how it is. After you\u2019ve experienced it one time it\u2019s purely annoying.\\n\r\nAnd the cool gamer references are just that. Gamer references. They don\u2019t do anything with it they just put popuko and pipimi in a videogame. Ansolutely hysterical. \\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit though, I did enjoy some of the references but that\u2019s mostly because they were unexpected. And in general, I really like references to other things in media. Just not when it is used in the same way over and over again while also not doing much with it.\\n\r\nAnd the fourth wall breaking (apart from hellshake yano) wasn\u2019t good at all either. It was pretty much also just \u201drandom=funny\u201d. I found the reoccuring french thing especially annoying as every single one of those segments were deadass boring.\\n\r\nArt for the show was alright and I did like the bob epic team segments quite a bit cause I\u2019m a fan of wonky artstyles.\\n\r\nSound was also pretty alright I guess. There are 2 different dubs which give of different vibes so maybe some people will like that. And if you don\u2019t like it you can just skip one.\\n\r\nAnd I would be negative towards how the episodes are so short or whatever but it is a 4 panel manga and it really doesn\u2019t need to be longer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show sucks, don\u2019t watch it unless you\u2019re, as I said, in the 4th grade or lower. Or if you want to hurt yourself idk.",

But as I completed the last episode I began to realize not only did I sit through and watched the series to the end, but I was reaching for aspirin in a first aid kit near by.\r\nPop Team Epic is a show that revolves around Popuko and Pipimi. A show that constantly applies pop culture references and random bits of humor in attempt to create an identityfor itself. What actually is produced is....I'm not sure.\\n\\n\r\nTry to picture explaining what internet memes are to a blind man who also happens to be deaf using nothing but a flashlight to stimulate morse code. What you get is this poorly put together project that attempts to call itself an \"anime\". The segments and humor that is put together displays little to no thought behind them. The combinations of all these thrown together ideas are just appalling. I don't believe I even laughed or smiled during any episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn the show's own right it can be considered a masterpiece. It provokes thought and questions the very definition of art. One of the segments that reoccurs in every episode is called \"Bob Team Epic\", a parody of traditional anime and tropes in the genre. Distorted animated Popuko and Pipimi do what they do best, not much. The animation is unsettling on purpose during these parts, however every other segment aside from this the quality of animation is somewhat great. The animators place a charm and style that is unique to this show, something that Pop Team Epic can really strike an appeal to.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, personally I felt as that was the only thing that kept me watching. The characters, are dull. Music and sound are forgettable. Humor is repetitive, after the first 2 episodes you can see how Pop Team Epic decides to carry itself. The show itself is a parody, so you can never take it seriously, but the creators are so out of touch what a parody is. This attempt of senseless shit posting comedy can only take you so far before the joke gets worn out and the characters become nothing more than names.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when my review was about the focus and enjoyment of this show? Neither do I. Because I lost focus. A simple review can not explain this show. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end this is one of the few anime I have watched that has actually caused me physical pain. The joy I felt after the last episode ended was more enjoyment during any moment watching it. I have gained nothing. Felt insulted. And brought dishonor to my family for having sat through this. Overall this is among the worst experiences I have ever witness. No joke. \\n\\n\r\nI heard there is a 2nd season in the works. I don't want to be around when that happens.",

            "content": "What makes a joke funny? Is it a well-thought build-up, steadily tied up, making us want to hear the punch line established at the end of a gag? Is it the topic a joke tackles, politically correct or, even better, the incorrect one? Is it the way it's presented and conveyed to us, with the use of different signals, voice tone and other small things people telling us the joke want to use in order to increase its impact? Or is it just the timing of it? No matter which of these reasons you choose, all of them are pale in comparison to the mostbasic aspect a pun, by definition, has to have in order to at least try to make an addressee laugh - the intention to be comical. As simply and straightforwardly as it sounds, I found it surprising that Pop Team Epic, an anime which the fans claim to be extremely witty and humorous, did not understand such a concept.\\n\\n\r\nIt looks as if this series' \"brain\" got stuck somewhere in the first grade of the elementary school, where the most random, stupid and nonsensical oneliners were considered to be absolutely hilarious. If you were to look at its episodes as something more than a shitpost, you would notice that within PTE, there are a lot of inconsistencies, among which, the fact that a gigantic portion of its gags, if not every single one of them, come off as undercooked, definitely stole the spotlight and single-handedly ruined every attempt at comedy. The structure of a standard joke consists of 2 elements: the build-up and the punchline, which I briefly referenced at the beginning, yet in this show, there seems to be no such thing as a punchline. As a result of it, the gags end up halfway through the build-up, leaving us without the conclusion. Because of it, quite literally, there's nothing to laugh at. By the end of the skit, the only thing we feel is indifference and abdominal pain because we just consumed something \"raw\". Heck, even though PTE makes a lot of brilliant and imaginative references to various popular movies, games, music or even anime, they simply could not be entertaining by themselves. That's not how references work, goddamnit! \"Play\" with them, mock the source material in a meaningful way, that's not offensive to the work itself, do something that makes at least a little bit of sense and aims at making me, the viewer, giggle. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also 2 \"miniseries\" in PTE, called Bob Epic Team and Pop Team Cooking, and oh boy, they accumulate everything this anime does wrong! Besides the easy to spot lack of care put into crafting the puns, Bob Epic Team, with its atrocious ideas and even worse execution of them is a completely and utterly disgusting abomination. Imagine a terrible paint drawing of a distorted character put into motion mixed with such cringey and lifeless scenes that the only thing you want to do, and in fact your brain forces you to do after witnessing such a travesty, is committing seppuku with a plastic knife doused in hot sauce for the extra spice. Pop Team Cooking, on the other hand, while suffers from the same problem of being lacklustre and inherently bad beyond salvation, is at least somewhat eye pleasant, which didn't lead my internal organs to be dying in an agonizing pain because of what I was seeing on my screen.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of being eye pleasant, the discriminative art style and simplistic animation, mixed with a live-action skit, 3D segments about France, which in all honesty, were mediocre at best, the previously mentioned appaling Paint drawings create a rather distinctive vibe and feel. The same can be said about the sound. The wacky and, to my surprise, lively voice acting, opening theme, different song parodies, for instance, Earth, Wind & Fire - Let's Groove, while they are not right up my alley, I can definitely see their purpose and appeal in such random and senseless series and to be honest, without the okay-ish production values, Pop Team Epic would be even harder to \"digest\" and that says a lot.\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic has its alright features, but at the end of the day, they meant nothing. It is just a terrifyingly awful meme you would find on some shitty website such as 9gag or ifunny and cry like a maniac, because of its quality. It's horrendous, it's shocking, it's unentertaining, but do you know which is the worst part? Some people will label it as an outstanding work because of that.",

Who needs a story. Can\u2019t have a story, if you never had one. It\u2019s just random shit happening on screen because that\u2019s how Pop Team Epic rolls. The series features a variety of humor, ranging from black comedy (i.e. gallows humor \u2013 my favorite type of humor) to surreal humor to anti-humor, and to meta-jokes and parodies.\r\nThe series features many pop culture references, such as: Earth, Wind & Fire, Pok\u00e9mon, Hoshiiro Girldrop, Kimino Na wa, Chrono Trigger, Kemono Friends, My Neighbour Totoro, Metal Gear Solid 3 time paradox, Top Gun, Initial D, Hellshake Yano, YouTube subscribe, Undertale, Donkey Kong, the Shawshank Redemption, etc.\\n\\n\r\nI love how each episode has one long skit, such as sports anime (shogi/racing), science-fiction, murder-mystery, music, haunted house horror, romances, music documentary, etc, and manages to turn it into a parody. Loved every moment of it!\\n\\n\r\nEspecially, the entire Hellshake Yano sequence, in Episode 7; it was amazing and outstanding, considering everything was told through art sketches and the actors actually performing it on live camera. Glorious stuff!\\n\\n\r\nOther original skits include: Bob Epic Team shorts with the main character\u2019s face and body being distorted as hell, Japon Mignon shorts, live action actors and actresses, Pop Team Cooking shorts, POP TEAM 8-BIT, Pop Team Dance, etc. Every single skits was amazing, and well told and executed. I laugh at every single joke, reference, and parody, they displayed on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode contains two similar-looking 12-minute segments that feature different voice actors and other small changes to the skits. I think this idea is extremely unique and makes the anime stand out more compared to other anime series.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be a strange, bizarre, and even crazy, but this series allows numerous animators and content creators to have their creations shown on every medium, such as internet or television. It allows creativity to flow and flourish without any restrictions. And finally, it's not afraid to do what it wants to do. It just does it, and rolls with it!\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nSolid animations. Some of the skits come from the original comic strips, however the majority of them are original animations. The animators make use of a variety types of animations, such as fully 3D animations, CGI, 2D animations, live-action, stop-motion, and idiosyncratic animation from the AC-bu.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Kamikaze Douga is the primary animation studio that does 3D animation as well as the Hoshiiro Girldrop shorts; Space Neko Company does the 2D animations and \u201cPop Team Story\" shorts, i.e. the shorts that reference from the original comic; AC-bu does the idiosyncratic animations for \u201cBob Epic Team\" short; UchuPeople produces stop-motion animation for \u201cPop Team Dance\u201d shorts.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation may be bizarre, especially the idiosyncratic animations (i.e. distorted characters, background objects, and even strange fast-paced animations), it may be realistic (i.e. live-action, or the stop motion animations), or it may be crazy, but who cares, this is Pop Team Epic, where the crazy becomes even crazier.\\n\\n\r\nExcellent character models. Seeing Popuko and Pipimi being drawn in a variety of styles is interesting and dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nExcellent voice acting. The anime incorporates many voice actors and actresses to voice both Popuko and Pipimi. The voice actors for Popuko includes: Masashi Ebara, Y\u016bji Mitsuya, Aoi Y\u016bki, Toshio Furukawa, Y\u014dko Hikasa, Tessh\u014d Genda, Nana Mizuki, Hozumi G\u014dda, etc. The voice actors/actresses for Pipimi includes H\u014dch\u016b \u014ctsuka, Noriko Hidaka, Ayana Taketatsu, Shigeru Chiba, Mamiko Noto, Banj\u014d Ginga, etc. Then, we have french actor/actress, such as Fanny Bloc and Christine Bellier. I believe having many voice actors/actress changes thing up and makes it exciting, fun, and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEvery voice actor/actresses fits their roles and makes everything funnier. The male voice actors make everything twice as funny, especially when they sing songs and create exaggerated sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nExcellent opening song (i.e. \u201cPop Team Epic\u201d) by Sumire Uesaka, so good you get to hear it twice. Also, the first episode\u2019s opening song, titled \u201cTwinkling Star\u201d by Yui Ogura, Inori Minase, and Sumire Uesaka was also really good. The kick-ass opening sets the tone for the rest of the series. Excellent background music sets the mood, atmosphere, and tone for the characters and reactions to specific situations, whether it\u2019s comedy, mystery, drama, etc. The song, \u201cLet\u2019s Pop Together\u201d is an excellent parody of \u201cLet\u2019s Groove\u201d by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nExcellent characters that are funny and entertaining to watch. Background stories, character development, and even goals and motivations be damned; you know why you are watching this, and it\u2019s not for \u201cgreat character development or background stories\u201d. It\u2019s to watch two characters, Popuko and Pipimi, do crazy skits and perform hilarious jokes. I just love how Popuko and Pipimi are able to bounce jokes after jokes off each other.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nI smiled and laughed during every single episode. It doesn\u2019t matter what other people say, just watch for shits and giggles.\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is one of greatest show I ever watched in 2018.\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\\n\r\nChange my mind.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n*Part 2 of Review*\\n\\n\r\n(For those on-the-fence about this show, please enjoy these lovely lyrics):\\n\\n\r\n\"Let's Pop Together\" by Pop Team Epic (Episode 4)\\n\r\n[A parody of \"Let's Groove\" by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]\\n\\n\r\nWe are pop team dance dance go\\n\r\nFor the fans and for the haters alike\\n\r\nDance dance go dance dance go\\n\r\nFor the fans and for the haters alike\\n\r\nYou haters will become fans eventually\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pop together, oh oh\\n\r\nLet\u2019s all live in harmony\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pop together, all night\\n\r\nWe love our fans\\n\r\nBecause they put food on our table\\n\r\nWe don\u2019t care about haters\\n\r\nThey\u2019re ridiculous, pathetic, not worth it at all\\n\r\nThe new manga volume is on sale now, you can buy it online\\n\r\nWhat a waste of money!\\n\r\nYou won\u2019t buy it?\\n\r\nAre you insane?\\n\r\nWe don\u2019t care, piss off\\n\r\nYay, the anime version is airing!\\n\r\nDon\u2019t bother me, I won\u2019t watch it\\n\r\nWhat, you\u2019re not watching it?\\n\r\nAre you stupid?\\n\r\nHow can you say this?\\n\r\nHow long are you going to fight this hater battle?\\n\r\nYou haters will become fans eventually\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pop together, oh oh\\n\r\nLet\u2019s all live in harmony\\n\r\nLet\u2019s pop together, all night\ufeff",

            "content": "*This review will mention a number of jokes from the series, mostly in vague terms to minimize spoilers while still offering a point of reference to those who have already seen it*\r\nAs soon as I committed to watching Poputepipikku (Pop Team Epic), I knew immediately that I wanted to talk about it, whether by discussing it with others or, as I have now done, writing a full review of this strange beast. It was clear that my opinion on it was different from the prevailing thoughts of the community. Of course that\u2019s not a bad thing; differences of opinion or perspective make such discussions farmore interesting, as opposed to a circle of like-minded cult members all chanting \u201cYes, man! Yes, man!\u201d in rhythmic turn.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, in the case of Pop Team Epic, the scenario looks more as if half the members in the circle suddenly turned to demons, the song of the ring an increasingly loud and aggressive \u201cNo, idiot!\u201d with both sides on the verge of slaughtering each other. Pop Team Epic is an unbelievably, viciously polarizing show, with outcries of love and hatred struggling for dominance. What could possibly make something so divisive? It's hard to say for sure, outside of the old saying that comedy is subjective, but it may have something to do with the show\u2019s unorthodox nature and format. Put simply, there\u2019s little else quite like Pop Team Epic, for better or worse. The closest reference point I can imagine would be parody sketch comedies like Robot Chicken, but even this fails to truly capture the format-stretching, meme-generating, self-aware surrealism on display here.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with little comparison to go on, and a product which in many ways defies traditional metrics, it\u2019s easy to become dismissive - to take your first, most basic impression of a title like Pop Team Epic and jump to conclusions about the work as a whole, whether positive or negative. I'll openly admit I did exactly this when I first saw the premiere episode, believing it to exist primarily to troll its audience (which it certainly does at times, but I'd hardly call it the show's sole purpose). Other stances span the full range from \"hilarious collection of memes about pop culture\" to \"insufferable unfunny barrage of nonsensical randomness to amuse the bottom-feeders of the internet\" among others - and to be clear, I'm not saying these specific stances are invalid or necessarily arise from quick dismissal. But if we're not careful, there's the risk of getting swept up in our immediate reactions and forgetting about the craft behind them - of losing perspective of the elements that go into the work as a whole to make it what it is. Pop Team Epic may come off as strange at times, but I believe like all media, it still deserves acknowledgement as an art piece, regardless of one's overall experience with it or eventual stance reached regarding its quality.\\n\\n\r\nSo here we are, as I make a serious attempt at understanding this show\u2019s vision and the tools it uses to pursue it, and then deciding whether or not I liked what I saw and why. All this, because I don't think a work like this should see its weird, experimental nature become an excuse to immediately write off its craft before at least giving an honest and open look at the content on display.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, there IS still the question of whether I personally liked it, so without further ado, I present my honest thoughts on this little oddity:\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is an absurdist sketch comedy starring Popuko and Pipimi, two recurring avatars who go around making all variety of over-the-top events happen, all while screwing with as many characters as possible, including the viewer watching it. It sets itself apart from other such comedies by embracing the concept of meta-humour, but in ways that are far more creative and interesting than the often-seen approach of simply breaking the fourth wall and calling attention to its tropes (some may know this as \u201clampshading\u201d). It also consistently gets creative with its formatting, whether subverting the standard 4-panel setup in various ways to enhance the element of surprise in its jokes, or making use of many alternative formats and styles to keep the variety up. Perhaps most critically, while wildly inconsistent in terms of quality, it shows an ability to tell its jokes without falling into common pitfalls of non sequitur and referential comedies\u2026 most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThat last point is one I\u2019d like to emphasize. Personally, I see more in this show's sense of humour than just arbitrary references for arbitrary references\u2019 sake, and this is coming from someone who typically isn\u2019t fond of non sequitur comedies. To explain why I feel this way, I feel it is helpful to try and break down why exactly I find randomness played for laughs to be ineffectual, as well as a bit about \u201chumour\u201d in general - hopefully, without coming off as conceited; it\u2019s no secret that comedy is a highly subjective affair, so take everything I'm about to say not as any sorts of \"rules\" for comedy, but rather, as an elaboration for why I find Pop Team Epic to work where so many others fail, leveraging my understanding of my personal sense of humour while still respecting the skill displayed by the content at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many theories out there which attempt to explain what makes something funny, but one that generally seems to align with my own sense of humour, and a useful starting point here, is Peter McGraw\u2019s Benign Violation Theory. Those interested in the study of humour are free to explore this and other theories, but to avoid needlessly padding this review, I\u2019ll stick to what\u2019s relevant here: it suggests that something will be funny if it simultaneously a) acts as a violation of what a person believes an aspect of the world \u201cought to be\u201d, and b) be presented in a benign (safe/non-threatening) manner. That's rather abstract, so to make a somewhat more concrete extension of this in the context of anime, one could theoretically achieve this by in some way surprising a viewer - such as by setting up expectations for the show or its universe and then defy them with some kind of \u201cpunchline\u201d, joke, whatever - but in a way such that the result is something the viewer won\u2019t find offensive, annoying, upsetting and so forth. Of course, this will vary from viewer to viewer. This is only one approach and not a perfect explanation by any stretch, nor are these anything close the only variables which may be involved. But it's a helpful springboard for diving into this show's content.\\n\\n\r\nApplying this idea to non sequitur humour, if something incredibly out of place suddenly shows up in a show\u2019s universe, then you\u2019ve defied the viewer\u2019s expectations for that universe, so you might get a laugh once or twice. But by repeating this joke, once it\u2019s been established that weird or arbitrary things can and will happen in this universe, you lose that element of surprise for any future irregular occurrences, and the effect is lost. Worse still, if everything is completely random, without some thread of logic or flow to latch onto, viewers may stop expecting anything aside from this randomness. And, if you keep showing non sequitur after non sequitur, and the viewer interprets that as the joke, it could get incredibly obnoxious.\\n\\n\r\nOne could also say similar things for referential humour; the first reference is an unexpected intrusion on the show\u2019s universe originating from another, but if you keep throwing out bare references, then the viewer begins to expect them.\\n\\n\r\nGiven this predicament, how exactly does Pop Team Epic seem to avoid this pitfall? The answer, I believe, is that Pop Team Epic is not truly random; it would be more accurate to say that the specific subject matter of any one of its mini-skits is seemingly random. By this, I mean that any given skit can have literally any topic of focus, regardless of what the previous one focused on, but on the other hand, most of the individual skits themselves do have their own sense of continuity and strange yet self-consistent logic. What this means is that so long as Pop Team Epic is able to set up and deliver actual punchlines through these self-consistent skits, it can function as an effective comedy despite its apparent randomness of subject matter and the prevalence of pop culture references. Does Pop Team Epic do any of this, with any degree of success?\\n\\n\r\nYes, it definitely does!\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the basics, Pop Team Epic makes use of many commonly-cited forms of humour in amongst all its madness. These include, among many others, comedic shifts in tone (certain \u201cHoshiiro Girldrop\u201d interjections), ironic character actions (the cigarette joke in an idol skit), situations being taken 4 steps further than expected to the point of absurdity (the same idol skit\u2019s conclusion), escalatory repetition (episode 2\u2019s manga speech bubble skit), some puns and wordplay I\u2019m not qualified to evaluate, and, alas, a few instances of seemingly barebones references that don\u2019t seem to have any strings attached. However, those latter types are thankfully a much smaller minority than one might expect. In most cases, there\u2019s a concerted effort to at least add something of substance the the reference in question, even if it\u2019s not always immediately apparent.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, simply having punchlines present isn\u2019t enough on its own. The fact that most of these \u201ctraditional\u201d styles of jokes are condensed into extremely short skits (setting aside some longer-form exceptions with multiple punchlines like the aforementioned idol skit) does pose a challenge for the show in terms of having the time to instill expectations or ideas in a viewer, and then deliver a joke that isn\u2019t completely obvious from the brief setup given. However, I personally found Pop Team Epic\u2019s success rate to be higher than anticipated, perhaps because its variety of material and approaches gave it plenty of options for what direction to take any given skit in, while still maintaining that critical sense of flow to avoid a nosedive into true randomness. It\u2019s a precarious approach - a constant balancing act which didn\u2019t hold every single time - but as far as I\u2019m concerned, it worked well enough.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, this show does make use of some tried and true approaches to telling jokes, and frequently succeeds at maintaining the elements of surprise, buildup and payoff. However, Pop Team Epic is no ordinary comedy, and in addition to these more conventional approaches, it also carries a number of less-common tricks in its grab bag.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, Pop Team Epic will often subvert the standard 4-panel format in order to further enhance its element of surprise, or add even more variety to how its jokes are delivered. 4-panel comedy strips will often spend three panels setting the stage, and then deliver their punchline on the fourth panel. This, of course, also applies to their adaptations, whether or not the boundaries between skits, sections or scenarios remain clear after the transition. In the case of Pop Team Epic, this transition is marked clear as polished glass by voiced-over title cards.\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic, however, often defies this conventional setup by placing an unexpected punchline near the beginning of the skit - what would be equivalent to the first or second panel in its original form - with the remaining panels adding onto it in some way, such as by taking the joke to further extremes or making humorous comments. This further adds to the element of surprise by varying the timing at which a punchline can hit.\\n\\n\r\nIn other cases, Pop Team Epic will flip the idea of the non sequitur card on its head, taking its normally-unrelated skits which the viewer expects to be unrelated in subject matter, and adds unexpected continuity between them to catch the viewer off guard. A good example of this (***brief spoiler for episode 3) is in a skit about Pipimi trying out a car, another person making disclaimers about its red colour and quietness, and Pipimi being satisfied, commenting that they can \u201ckill in silence\u201d and hide the blood on the car\u2019s crimson hue. The skit ends, and the viewer expects the joke to end with it. Then the next skit is about Popuko looking for a job, and Pipimi handing her a suitcase full of cash, a gun, and a hitlist for assassination.\\n\\n\r\n(***end of spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nAt another point, a skit makes reference to a certain piece of media, and then the next skit starts exactly the same way as the first, because the circumstances the first skit ended on would trigger a time reset in the universe being referenced. As a brief aside, this displays what I look for in referential humour. There should be some kind of punchline to go with the reference, and if the reference is necessary to understand the joke, its source should be something fairly recognizable to whatever audience is viewing it. In this instance, these conditions were met, showing that, at least some of the time, Pop Team Epic seems to understand that its frequent references cannot carry the comedy on its own.\\n\\n\r\nOn a more straightforward level, Pop Team Epic will change up the styles and even mediums in which it presents a given skit. Later episodes in particular got especially creative with exploring new formats, including alternate animation styles, various live-action/animation mixtures, and an enthralling segment involving two live-action performers manipulating pages of a sketchbook. This variety alone added a certain degree of entertainment value simply in seeing what the show would come up with next, even setting aside some of the jokes that were told by leveraging these new formats.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s enough about formatting. It\u2019s time to graduate to talking about the show\u2019s attempts at full-on meta-humour that I\u2019ve been building up.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019m usually not the biggest fan of meta-humour, but this has less to do with the concept than it does with the execution. As I mentioned before, I very often see attempts at meta-humour amount to little more than breaking the fourth wall, or a show plainly pointing out what tvtropes.org entry it\u2019s using at that particular moment. My gripes with this type of humour are similar to those of the non sequitur and referencial varieties: in isolation, as a one-off joke or small aside, it can work. However, doing it repeatedly ceases to surprise and can become increasingly annoying when overused. Furthermore, it simply lacks creativity; it takes next to no effort to do it and is far too common an approach. In short: it\u2019s a lazy, done-to-death gimmick.\\n\\n\r\nBut once again, Pop Team Epic steps beyond these trappings! It doesn\u2019t stop at trivial self-awareness or fourth wall breaks. Instead, the fourth wall ceases to exist here, and the show makes use of the viewer's acceptance of its self-aware nature to tell jokes that simply wouldn\u2019t have been the same otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nA character proclaims an action they'll perform in 30 minutes; the show shows them standing there waiting in real time as the ending sequence plays in the background. Viewer comments complaining about an animation quirk in certain segments are read; the show fixes this quirk and lets you witness the humorous results for yourself. Later episodes make sudden, unexpected yet seemingly obvious additions to the opening theme to comedic effect. Even the necessary censorship of copyrighted words leads to a pun that translated shockingly well into English, with the incredibly stupid yet earnest results leaving me rolling! These are just a few of many examples of Pop Team Epic reaching beyond usual approaches to meta-humour. These gags are novel, creative, and often surprisingly witty, leading to arguably some of the show\u2019s best and most unique material.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m saying, in essence, is that for all this show's madness, I do see a method behind it. It has far more tricks to offer than simply throwing snot, superglue, tree sap, maple syrup, sticky notes and other trinkets at the viewer in hopes that something will stick. Furthermore, these tricks are often interesting and creative in their own right, and the show displays a clear ability to make use of them for uniquely comedic effect. Well, most of the time, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, here is where I must address my main gripe with the series: its inconsistency.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I found many of Pop Team Epic\u2019s skits to be a hit, and for others could at the very least see what the joke was, there were also quite a few segments which I simply didn\u2019t understand. Whether it was because I didn\u2019t know a reference, the joke was poorly presented, or because there simply wasn\u2019t a joke at all, I can\u2019t say for sure. Regardless, many of them just seemed to truly be random, have no point, or in rarer cases, simply exist as a reference with no apparent joke attached. Of course, some such segments turned out to simply be setting up for punchlines in later skits (\u201cAre you upset?\u201d, though this one arguably had a punchline to begin with), while others could be seen as planting expectations for a later variation with something in common (the first knitted musical number), continuing the trend of playing with the 4-panel format. Others, however, seemed to lack even this purpose.\\n\\n\r\nFor some of these segments, one could make a case for anti-humour - intentionally skipping the expectation of a punchline as a punchline in and of itself, or perhaps having the punchline be that what\u2019s happening should, in fact, be taken at face value. However, I found that these segments seemingly devoid of a punchline happened a bit too frequently for this to work. As such, they had little impact and forced me to simply give up on trying to figure them out. Congratulations, Pop Team Epic, you've stumped me!\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say this, though: I\u2019d much rather a joke fly over my head completely than have it bashed into my head and get brain damage. But a quick smack to the face is perfectly okay!\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, I\u2019m fine with blunt and over-the-top presentation (which can be found aplenty here), but I tend to dislike it when such presentation is combined with repeating or over-explaining trivial and obvious punchlines in a way that feels unnatural or forced. It comes across as the show being afraid the viewer might be too stupid to get it otherwise, or as some desperate attempt to draw additional laughs from something that\u2019s clearly run dry of them. Thankfully, Pop Team Epic definitively avoids this particular pet peeve of mine. I can think of very few instances of a joke lingering beyond its allotted laugh-span - maybe some of the \u201cHoshiiro Girldrop\u201d material overstayed its welcome. But even in those cases, it didn\u2019t feel like it was forcibly dragged out, but rather, it simply went on as long as one might expect - which happened to be a bit longer than I found it funny - so this generally didn\u2019t bother me much.\\n\\n\r\nIn all other cases, Pop Team Epic, leveraging its 4-panel format, moves at a quick pace, with quick setup, quick delivery of its jokes, and quickly moving on from it, whether you \u201cgot it\u201d or not. This sense of pacing also means that even though many jokes or skits may fail to hit their target, their rate of fire is high enough to minimize long stretches of barren content. There are still some weaker episodes, mainly early on, but I found the series as a whole to fare quite well in holding my interest and keeping me amused.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, I\u2019ve just about covered my reasons for enjoying this show for what it is. For those brave or curious enough to give it a shot, a few things are worth noting in deciding how to watch it. First, if using official subtitles, I recommend going for Hidive\u2019s over Crunchyroll\u2019s. Many of the jokes contain nuances present in the former but lost in the latter. Funimation's English dub may also be a worthy alternative, but I can't speak on this personally. Secondly, Pop Team Epic has an unusual albeit suitable quirk in which every 12-minute episode is broadcast twice in a row, with the second adding extra context or substance to many of the jokes while giving Popuko and Pipimi different voice actors (usually a gruff male set for the second, adding to the surrealism). I myself usually preferred to skip to the 11:50 mark of each episode and just watch the more detailed second version, but how one chooses to respond to this quirk is up to them.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, most of us watch comedies primarily for laughter, and no matter how many types or theories of humour we may discuss to explain our enjoyment or lack thereof, in the end, laughter is personal, which all but guarantees that titles with wildly diverging opinions like this one will show up from time to time. So for those who enjoy the show as a collection of memes for forum boards, or simply as \u201cShitpost: The Anime\u201d, that\u2019s fine; keep doing so. Likewise, if you find the show insufferable to watch, there\u2019s no need to force yourself into thinking otherwise. But by the same token, whether watching it casually or going for further analysis, love or hate it, appreciate or despise it, let's not sit here and pretend that our own viewpoint or experience is the only legitimate one, that everyone in the circle who disagrees must be idiots, or that the work sitting in the middle is somehow beneath us.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my opinion, I enjoyed Pop Team Epic, both as a novelty act and as its own standalone product. Despite being more than a bit inconsistent, it still has its share of funny and memorable moments thanks to its straight-to-the-point attitude, creative use of meta-humour and blunt delivery of surreal gags, while mostly avoiding potential pitfalls of abusing non sequitur and referential humour. While it certainly won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, the show is also wholly committed to its unusual vision and shows a degree of skill in using its varied material, structuring and formatting to sell its unique brand of absurdity, For that, I respect it.",

            "content": "Before anyone can answer the question: \"What is Pop Team Epic?\" I believe a more pressing question is more like \"Why in hell am I writing a serious review of this shit post?\"\r\nActually, I have an answer to that question, unlike the first one. First of all, I love my absurd and nonsensical Chinese cartoons; I have a special place in my heart (and in some case my Top 10) for shows like Nichijou, Daily Lives of HS Boys, and of course, Gintama. That said, I don't really think Pop Team Epic can really stand up to those shows when we are talking about howentertaining they are, disregarding how much meaning or (non)sense they have integrated into their identity. \\n\\n\r\nI understand these are all big words, so I'll simplify it for those who only care for this anime because it's a shitpost:\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is a funny shitpost... but it gets old pretty quick. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I have to say, this show almost convinced me that I should think otherwise, as this show isn't really trying to be anything grander than a shitpost.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is- while I can get lost watching vines, cracks and just plain memes on YouTube all day, I really can't say the same for Pop Team Epic. \\n\\n\r\nI understand I am only on the fourth episode of the anime as I am making this review, however, I am already bored of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the anime is that random bullshit doesn't always equal entertainment for the audience. Bullshit needs consistency in its logic (unfortunately), or else it just becomes aimless, incoherent and pointless. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not like the anime is trying to parody one thing either. If it dedicated it's entire runtime to parodying JRPG anime like SAO (for example), then at least there would be something there for people to refer to for humor. It's a simple case of knowing what they are referencing, and the joke accurately making fun of the concept in a refreshing way. \\n\\n\r\nParody anime like Gintama have mastered this effectively- I'm not going to give spoilers, but a recent example of how Gintama plays with concepts found in its genre (shounen) and then shits on it while making it genuinely entertaining, is a scene from one of the latest episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe scene was of negotiations. On \"our\" side, we had the Shogun, whom now has bowel problems (it makes sense why he has bowel problems in context) and of one of the enemy leaders who was requested to negotiate with. The bowel problems in a normal shounen would be similar to that of \"butterflies in the stomach\", however, the joke doesn't stop there as it builds on itself. The shogun tries to subtly hint at his need to go to the bathroom without being direct about it, the enemy takes his references out of context and interprets them as threats. Without ruining the joke by saying what happens next, essentially the enemy leader understands by the end that the Shogun needed to shit, and \"negotiations\" end there. Both are embarrassed, to say the least, and all misconceptions between the two sides are adjourned. That is literally how you shit on negotiations.\\n\\n\r\nNow after reading that somewhat competent explanation of a joke you probably didn't understand, tell me, when does Pop Team Epic do something like that?\\n\\n\r\nInitially, I thought Pop Team Epic was a parody of the slice of life genre, much like Nichijou, by taking scenarios you would see in real life and pushing the joke to 11. I haven't read the 4-Koma manga, but I remember a few strips that would support that claim- as I saw that Popuko was giving the middle finger in a scenario you really wouldn't because of social norms. I thought when I saw this \"This would really be funny because that's what we all want to do\", so where is all of this in the anime?\\n\\n\r\nI suppose it can be later down the road, but why do we also have to do a parody of video games (that really doesn't make sense), horror movies, anime, manga, Hollywood blockbuster films intermixed with random nonsense that both looks ugly and makes no sense, AND THEN having the entire episode repeat itself before having time to comprehend it?\\n\\n\r\nThere's such a thing as overload, and Pop Team Epic doesn't seem to understand that you can't be funny without something like a breather. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the lack of consistency in both the animation and stories themselves damages all suspension of disbelief. That said, I never had any, nor did it need suspension of disbelief, because the purpose of this anime is to shit on other media. \\n\\n\r\nAll Pop Team Epic needed to do was shit on others right. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it didn't.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm sure that something will change in the span of the next 9 episodes, actually, I am practically guaranteeing that they'll do something crazy for their finale. But right now I am just bored of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is Pop Team Epic? I suppose Pop Team Epic is just... too much of everything.",

            "content": "There are certain anime series that get you wondering \"what the actual frigging hell am I watching\"...Pop Team Epic is an epitome of that kind of series. Even though it is meant to be a shitposting kind of series, shitposting doesn't actually mean good comedy (I'll go into a bit more detail about that in my review). It had me to the point where I was questioning even why this became an anime series in the first place. I'll be frank with this, even though I'm probably gonna anger some crazy fans: this thing is actually qualified as TRASH.\r\nI'll try to be brief with thisreview, cause even with just reviews, it's hard to really input anything decent about this series.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Story? Plot? HAHA, what plot? What story? In pretty much every decent to great series, you need to have some sort of story or settings implemented. Pop Team Epic had none of the sort...to me, at least, it is basically the Japanese version of Robot Chicken, but much worse. The parodies, skits, references, whatever the joke may be...that's ALL there really is to this series. Oh yeah, about the Hoshiro Girldrop tease and then the hi-jacking, it IS funny, I'll admit, but for the most part, it's just one cringy joke after another, and honestly, that kind of stuff can get bland after a while. When people tell me this series is very philosophical, I think it's more so of how it gets you thinking philosophically as to why this series is one of the most absurd things you'd have ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nART: I don't really have much to say about the art other than the fact it's the kind of art (excluding some parts) that you'd see in anime specials/shorts or in those wacky-looking Western cartoons. The chibi looks and all that for the two main characters, though...doesn't make them look any good whatsoever. I guess it's sorta okayish, but barely anyone is really gonna praise it or even be attentive to it, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Well, not much to say about it. I will admit that some of the ending themes were done pretty well, but for the most part, whatever soundtracks are featured will depend on the respective joke or parody, and even then are very subpar and mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: So the main characters here: a yellow haired shortie that gets easily triggered (sometimes for no reason) and a blue haired lanky quiet girl. Popuko and Pipimi are just really there with their rather contrasting personalities to set up each joke and play it out in the most absurd and ridiculous of fashions. Knowing that, I don't see how one can really like them as a character in general. The only way one would be able to like any of them is for the fact that they are at least the perfect fit, in terms of their personality, to make the jokes as outrageous as possible.\\n\r\nAs for character development...considering what this \"series\" is, there is none, and none needed. The supporting cast? Really depends on what the joke/parody/reference/gag is, honestly. The only truly recurring members are the ones that are part of the Hoshiro Girldrop skit, that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Now here's the part I really want to try to make clear. My level of enjoyment is usually mid-ground, but it purely depends on the jokes with each different episode. I do want to point out early that each episode is really just two copies of the same stuff placed together in the same 30 min timeframe...so it's more like 12-15 of just ridiculousness followed by another 12-15 minutes of the exact same damn thing...it's as if the staff thinks we can't get enough of it, for pete sakes.\\n\r\nI personally couldn't find myself really entertained after the first episode...in fact, the jokes eventually felt dry and bland, or just straight up cringe that doesn't turn out funny to me. Honestly, I'd get more kick out of watching classic Western/American cartoons or live TV shows where they have a similar sort of format, but a better display of hilarity and jokes. In short, enjoyment level for this series REALLY depends on how funny or stupid the comedy is, and for me, it's middle-ground. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Beware, as this series can be a mentally exhausting experience. Honestly, this is a kind of series that people would only support for the lols (OR LOL attempts). Even the artist contributions don't even really have much worth for it at all. Even Futurama, Family Guy, and American Dad actually had much better examples of random (though mostly inappropriate) comedy.\\n\r\nAs one who has suffered them and survived to tell the tale, I advise one with their sanity still intact to just avoid this like a god damn plague....however, if that you're THAT bored to where you're only entertained by ridiculousness and absurdity, I guess this series may fit your bill, but even then, you may eventually find it boring if the jokes don't rub you the right way. Granted, at least it's not something like Ousama Game, Boku no Pico, School Days, or Mars of Destruction.\\n\r\nAnd on that note, my rant of this \"series\" is done.",

I at least chuckled a couple times, so I've seen worse comedy anime. This is still pretty damn bad!\r\nPlot?\r\nThe plot is that random pop culture references happen. Oh look they referenced Skyrim! Oh look they referenced Dark Souls...and that's the joke. They referenced something. At least in Kobayashi's Dragon Maid when they parody Dark Souls, the joke is that a 5,000 year old, all powerful dragon is becoming addicted to a video game and acting like an otaku.The joke isn't just that they alluded to the game in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nTwo girls who are drawn absurdly poorly make references and flip you the bird. This show is really making me miss Super Milk Chan. I NEVER thought I would have to say that.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nWell...at least it isn't all CG. Also it looks slightly better than President Trap Kun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I saw the first episode I had a feeling of sheer dread in my stomach. I felt certain that MAL was going to rate this show over 8.5 and make it the ironically overrated series of the year. We did it with Pingu in 2017. Haha the joke is that it isn't really an anime. Remember how funny it was when Papa Franku made this same joke about FOUR FUCKING YEARS AGO! We did it with Food Wars. I personally don't see what makes Nichijou and Gintama THAT much better than this shit, but I don't need to understand MAL's taste. I'm just so proud of you guys right now. It's a shit series and it's rated like shit! Praise be to God!",

            "content": "Pop Team Epic is the name. Offering jokes that make no sense its game. Like it or not, it's all the same. Your sense of humor is to blame. \r\nPhilosophers, fools and shitposters all around the globe have been asking this question recently, but also since the dawn of tragicomedy: What makes a joke funny? Is there a single factor that answers to this question? Everything can be funny as long as it is presented in the preferred way. Much like with anime series, it is all about the execution. But this is still all about personal preferences, perspective and knowledge. How can a popculturereference deliver if one does not know what is is referring to? The original question has been answered already hundreds of times: The funny was inside you all along. #deep  #derp\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is a series thats target audience is the whole internet culture. Its jokes varie greatly from parodies to live action interviews. From original content to ridiculously bad coaxed into a snafu-tier memes. It's even familiar with taiwanese puppet shows, obscurities of all sort, and awkward elevator music. The series has a bit of everything, and for this reason its writing is full of quality differences. It's nearly impossible for every joke appeal to all viewers. Almost every joke in it can be understood in different ways and found to be funny/not funny for different reasons. This is quite original for comedy series and part of the reason why I found the series to be worth of my time so much that I watched it twice. There has been quite a few obscure comedies in the past, such as Masuda Kousuke Gekijou, Gag Manga Biyori and Tensai Senshi, but none of them successful. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual idea behind the series production is fairly interesting. It shows us how much voice actors can change the tone of the series and the aspects of jokes. Every episode is approximately 24 minutes long, but in practice it is just 12 minutes of either identical or highly similar content. The main difference are the voice actors. Other half is presented with male seiyuus and the another with female seiyuus. The male version typically also comes with extras such as quest analysis, voice-over live action reaction to the joke, and whatever else. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series for its uniqueness, different approach, and scenes such as flip-cover live action music show presented by 2 members of the production team. There is simply no other anime in existence that would even try to do content like this. It alone is worth of something: worth of giving Pop Team Epic a go.",

It is a cultural celebration of anime as a whole from the adapted works of Bkub Okawa into many reaches of genre, style and presentation, and it's pretty shitty!\r\nThere's absolutely no need to dawn any thinking caps, judgemental barometers or even acquired tastes to appreciate everything Pop Team Epic has to offer, from the prospective yet tastefully dated memes and references, to the plethora of genres it covers from comedy to action, horror to romance, sci-fi to thriller etc., to the gunbelt array of studios and producersof each segment all representative of the vast styles of anime such as olden, CGI, modern, experimental, and everything in between, leads like Kamikaze Douga (haha snuck in some JoJo), Space Cat Company, Thibault Tresca, the immensely talented Makoto Yamashita and of course, the awe inspiring AC Department, all who've each handed well respected and unforgettable adaptations and original content.\\n\r\nFollowing suite to the meat of this review, Pop Team Epic is graded under the usual criteria but under the circumstances of its genre and meaning:\\n\\n\r\nStory -/10\\n\r\nEach encounter is completely unaffected by the last and helps portray the randomness and non-linear coherse plot that this anime obviously does not have. A simple story regarding the ominous shadow lords does encapsulate itself in the beginning, but you have to watch the show to find out what happens afterwards though~ \u2665\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nWhether spot on manga recreations, free liberty of Bob Epic Team, or the wonderful CGI portrayal, each representation is beautifully done to their own accord and some background art even having more right than needed be to look as good as they do for a show such as this. Only the best here.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music 10/10\\n\r\nAll effects are mastered well, both sides of repeating episodes featuring male and female voice overs were spectacular, (another bonus point, what show can you name off the top of your head that does this revolutionary thing) nobody is inaudible unless needed to be and the music is absolutely glorious, from OP to ED, in different styles and singers, and especially the OST capturing moods perfectly. Eisaaai! Haramasukoi!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nEveryone and thing is just so cute ohmigoooooooo-\\n\r\nNo doubts here, all main and supporting cast are destinctive, expressive, and most importantly, memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Pop Team Epic is fantastically enjoyable to nearly everyone who's finna woke at any time or situation, barring short term dated memes. Make no mistake, it is a shitty anime, everyone thinks so too, but it's undeniably a show that will withstand time and harbour memories of reliving the golden ages of anime as a whole, while bringing whole communities together, old and new. 10/10.\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading!",

That is all Pop Team Epic has to say. It just reminds you that better media exists, but in ways that are disrespectful and offensive to the time of the unfortunate viewer.\r\nPop Team Epic is a dreadful product. It is anti-art. It is anti-comedy.It is a middle finger to those who produce art because Pop Team Epic is devoid of creativity, vision, and passion; or to put it simply, something that is not art but wishes it was, and so instead it has to violently lash out towards.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation quality is awful. It is a poor adaptation of the source material, as the production staff was so obviously unaware of the differences between print and animated mediums. The sound is exceptionally poor. Normally a production like this would not be given the OK, but in the case of Pop Team Epic, it was allowed to pass because it was not a serious artistic product, but a way to sell merchandise to easily manipulated consumers through viral 24 minute commercials under the guise of of art.",

So for an anime short that doesn't give a shit, well for LA, LA might as well go with the crowd with it and LA enjoyed immensely or sometimes just utterly baffled in some skits with how this anime short just didn't give a shit with almost no sign of low quality baiting (Bob Team Epic is bloody taking the piss out of it you realize?) thus doing it well for the most part from the aforementioned pop culture references to the out of animation skits...though there are some flaws with that mainly the weirdness of Bob Team Epic series and those French segments which is...just WTF for LA but still it's Pop Team Epic.\\n\\n\r\nOk ok so the obvious is that if you don't like dank memes like these then you can unsubscribe to this anime short because that's really is what Pop Team Epic is, you wanna change whatever Pop Team Epic is from a trolling anime short into....into what?...then it's no Pop Team Epic either way. It's shitposting in the form of anime at it's finest. WHY do you think Pop Team Epic had a 22 minute run time but had only the first 10 minutes REPEATED TWICE just with different voice actors and some small changes here and there?, because Pop Team Epic being a full fledged anime series was a jab at those people who didn't think it would be possible and Pop Team Epic banked on it and WORKED.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well the \"animation\" is the say the least as even though the animation done by Kamikaze Douga is there in it's varieties of 2D to 3D animation, from the intentionally poor quality work of Bob Team Epic series to the live action French segments and Hellshake Yano and the Live Voice acting skit, HELL Pop Team Epic by definition blends both 2D and LIVE ACTION together at times and showing the diverse range of \"animation\" used for an anime short such as this but nonetheless Pop Team Epic's skit based formula was used especially in the animation department is by overall.....diverse and rather great at that, even the OP is amazing!.\\n\\n\r\nHoshiiro Girl Drops needs an fully fleshed out anime!!! wait it's getting a second season REJOICE MOTHERFUCKERS!!...yes the anime short short that had little coverage only at the end of the credits halfway the anime short...Hi Yui Ogura!!!\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is shitposting at it's finest, surreal and WTFery is it's bread and butter with diverse and by the looks of it, high budget for such an anime short ABOUT dank memes it's amazing Pop Team Epic even GOT an anime to begin with, so don't be cynical and watch what is by a definition of the finest quality shitposting in anime form you've seen...that will be dated in no time, thanks Internet!.",

I think the answer must be no but Poputepipikku showed out of nowhere and everyone liked it . Do I think liking somehing is wrong? Of course I don't everyone has his own personal taste . I just don't like Poputepipikku . The reson is the jokes are occasionaly hard to understand . Everything feels like it's repetitive and after a whole lot of shitposting (That's what i do at every social network) it gets boring . It doesn't ruinit's potential I mean a lot of shitpost lovers will going to like this because they have no life and all they do is shitposting everyday (that's sad) . Poputepipikku's main problem is after a while weirdness starts to be boring . Every episode is just only weird nothing more than that . Memes , references and jokes are not good because you can't understand any of them (maybe a lot of Japanese culture will help) . Poputepipikku gets boring after a while and their whole thing becomes pathetic . Basically if you watch 1 episode of Poputepipikku you could count yourself that you watch the whole series . Because that is the only thing there , nothing more . That's why I don't like it . Overall 1/10",

            "content": "Hoshiiro Girldrop came as a surprise this year. What appeared to be nothing more than a generic slice of life series actually ended up being a rather heartwarming experience.\r\nThis review may contain mild spoilers, but I won't go into detail about anything specific past the first episode.\r\nHoshiiro Girldrop follows the antics of our two main characters, Daichi and Sosogu. These childhood friends are reunited in a peculiar way: Sosogu just kinda moved in with Daichi.\r\nApparently Daichi made a promise to her long ago, but he has no recollection of this at all. \r\nNow if I'm being honest, Daichi isn't one of the best protagonists. Hischaracter can come across as bland. His chemistry with Sosogu on the other hand makes the show, mostly because\\n\r\nthey're the most mismatched couple possible. An old standard for romcoms, sure, but why fix what ain't broke.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're looking for a fun romcom/slice of life to pass the time, Hoshiiro Girldrop is definitely a show for you, but so far the show hasn't presented anything to make this a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nI rate Hoshiiro Girl--- NOT!\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Pop Team Epic. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of intensive psychology most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer\u2019s head. There\u2019s also Pipimi\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from shitpost literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they\u2019re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Pop Team Epic truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Popuko\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cA H ? Y O U  A R E  M O T H E R F * C K E R ?,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to bkub\u2019s Japanese epic Hoshiiro Girldrop. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Okawa\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Pop Team Epic tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It\u2019s for the ladies\u2019 eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they\u2019re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid \ud83d\ude0e\\n",

            "content": "Not every manga or a novel can be turned into an anime and Poputepipikku is one of those anime that shouldn't have been adapted.\r\nMost of the people who watched Poputepipikku did that because it was very popular as a shitposting manga rather than a normal one, it never had a story and was always random with stuff sometimes being funny, wholesome or annoying depending on how you personally feel, it was like a meme machine and it should have stayed like that, the anime was disappointing because of a lot of reasons. The random jokes which could be a hit or miss, the references butthe people making the anime never realized that making a reference wasn't the funny part, it was how it was presented and used which makes it funny, take Gintama for example, that anime has a lots of references but that wasn't why it is funny, it's funny because of how it used those reference in the episodic or even arc episodes after the reference, I was watching the episodes and starting to hope for the IDOL love stuff at the preview to become the actual anime rather than this one specially at the start, the anime.\\n\r\nAlso bob epic team was garbage. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing is probably the cringy stuff that was made during the last 12 weeks that the producers/publishers were doing, for example making the same episode twice because it's a troll XD, broadcasting the same episode 8 times in a row just to make a reference and other cringy stuff that made feel sorry for them for wasting all that money unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about the anime is the Opening, it's so good from song to the animation in it, well the animation in the whole anime was amazing tbh.\\n\r\nThere were some jokes that made me funny and references that were used nicely but they were rare which is why the anime wasn't enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give it a generous 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it tbh reading it would be better.",

            "content": "Okay everyone knows it's shit posting. Either you like it or you don't. Comedy of course. If you're looking for an anime with a coherent story, get out now. If you like memes, retarded jokes, you'll probably love it.\r\nThere ain't a narrative, no story no nothing. Nothing like Nichijou or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. So don't expect much running gags or the gags forming a satisfying story line like Nichijou.\r\nArt style seems pretty okay with it changing quite dynamically. Not your standard style of cutsie anime characters, they aren't meant to look that way. Might seem crude to some.\r\nSound effects are pretty good, opening songis pretty damn catchy. I gotta rewatch to remember how the bgm sounds to say anything more in depth about it lol.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has nothing to do at all with what makes a standard anime great. There's no character development, there's no deep layering of plot(or plot to begin with), there's no proper pacing, no, none of that from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you are an edgy meme lord that already knows about this anime, chances you'll like it is slim. Though it's nothing like what someone criticized it for \"being random\". This anime HAS NO PLOT.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't need to follow a rule to comedy. I must admit it's quite \"random\" in it's different jokes in the sense that you'll not expect what gags they put out next. \\n\\n\r\nSome are straight up not funny, some are just straight up retarded autism. But it's the fact that I can't guess what's coming up next that keeps me entertained. I don't even get more than half the references they put out. Maybe that's what pushes people away from this anime but if you don't mind and can appreciate poking fun at anything at all, you might like this.\\n\\n\r\nI must say though, those references/what they poke fun at I don't get at all can be really excruciating to sit through. Especially when the skit is like 5 minutes long and you're like wtf throughout it, then have to watch it again(with different voice acting). The anime is basically half as long with the other half being different voice acting, and a subtle change in dialog sometimes if you're attentive enough.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's just a shitpost. If you hate if you hate it. If you love shitpost you'll love it. Of course I'm one of them. I ain't professional so screw my review if you think I make shit sense but yeah just a slice of an apple\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overall - 5:\r\nThis anime has many flaws and one of the biggest ones is the way they split every episode into two parts. For the first couple of episodes I watched both parts and felt like I was wasting my time. There are only a few minor changes aside from the voice actors being swapped out, and it's just enough to feel like I probably missed a couple good jokes, but not enough to justify watching the whole thing.\r\nStory - 5:\r\nI'm also putting humor in this section since that's basically all this show is. There were times where this show legitimately had me laughing, butmost of the time stuff was happening and it wasn't particularly engaging. I particularly disliked bob epic team.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8:\\n\r\nThey did a really good job at keeping the style of the comics, and there were times where the effects were also really well done, and then there was bob epic team. I didn't like those skits and the art in them was bad, yes it was intentional, but it was still bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is alright, some of the songs are good, most are just alright. There were times in the show where the sound effects were on point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4:\\n\r\nThe characters did what they did for the sake of doing it. I have no particular fondness for either one, but I do like their designs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5:\\n\r\nThere were times I was laughing, but most of the time I was just uninterested.",

Maybe I\u2019m just a low iq idiot who can\u2019t understand the deep themes in pop team epic. Who knows?\r\nThis show was fun for about 1 episode, 2 at max. In the beggining it was kind of like \u201dhaha this is funny because it\u2019s shitposting and that\u2019s not common for anime. Anime of the year amirite LUL.\u201d But then you realize you\u2019re a fucking retard.\r\nIn my mind, this show is built upon three things. Cool gamer references, random=funny humour and 4th wall breaking.  The easiest thing to throw shit atis the random=funny aspect so I\u2019ll start with that. Unless you\u2019re still in the 4th grade you won\u2019t find this funny. That\u2019s just how it is. After you\u2019ve experienced it one time it\u2019s purely annoying.\\n\r\nAnd the cool gamer references are just that. Gamer references. They don\u2019t do anything with it they just put popuko and pipimi in a videogame. Ansolutely hysterical. \\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit though, I did enjoy some of the references but that\u2019s mostly because they were unexpected. And in general, I really like references to other things in media. Just not when it is used in the same way over and over again while also not doing much with it.\\n\r\nAnd the fourth wall breaking (apart from hellshake yano) wasn\u2019t good at all either. It was pretty much also just \u201drandom=funny\u201d. I found the reoccuring french thing especially annoying as every single one of those segments were deadass boring.\\n\r\nArt for the show was alright and I did like the bob epic team segments quite a bit cause I\u2019m a fan of wonky artstyles.\\n\r\nSound was also pretty alright I guess. There are 2 different dubs which give of different vibes so maybe some people will like that. And if you don\u2019t like it you can just skip one.\\n\r\nAnd I would be negative towards how the episodes are so short or whatever but it is a 4 panel manga and it really doesn\u2019t need to be longer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show sucks, don\u2019t watch it unless you\u2019re, as I said, in the 4th grade or lower. Or if you want to hurt yourself idk.",

But as I completed the last episode I began to realize not only did I sit through and watched the series to the end, but I was reaching for aspirin in a first aid kit near by.\r\nPop Team Epic is a show that revolves around Popuko and Pipimi. A show that constantly applies pop culture references and random bits of humor in attempt to create an identityfor itself. What actually is produced is....I'm not sure.\\n\\n\r\nTry to picture explaining what internet memes are to a blind man who also happens to be deaf using nothing but a flashlight to stimulate morse code. What you get is this poorly put together project that attempts to call itself an \"anime\". The segments and humor that is put together displays little to no thought behind them. The combinations of all these thrown together ideas are just appalling. I don't believe I even laughed or smiled during any episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn the show's own right it can be considered a masterpiece. It provokes thought and questions the very definition of art. One of the segments that reoccurs in every episode is called \"Bob Team Epic\", a parody of traditional anime and tropes in the genre. Distorted animated Popuko and Pipimi do what they do best, not much. The animation is unsettling on purpose during these parts, however every other segment aside from this the quality of animation is somewhat great. The animators place a charm and style that is unique to this show, something that Pop Team Epic can really strike an appeal to.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, personally I felt as that was the only thing that kept me watching. The characters, are dull. Music and sound are forgettable. Humor is repetitive, after the first 2 episodes you can see how Pop Team Epic decides to carry itself. The show itself is a parody, so you can never take it seriously, but the creators are so out of touch what a parody is. This attempt of senseless shit posting comedy can only take you so far before the joke gets worn out and the characters become nothing more than names.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when my review was about the focus and enjoyment of this show? Neither do I. Because I lost focus. A simple review can not explain this show. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end this is one of the few anime I have watched that has actually caused me physical pain. The joy I felt after the last episode ended was more enjoyment during any moment watching it. I have gained nothing. Felt insulted. And brought dishonor to my family for having sat through this. Overall this is among the worst experiences I have ever witness. No joke. \\n\\n\r\nI heard there is a 2nd season in the works. I don't want to be around when that happens.",

Nothing more. Nothing less. Don't put too much thought into the characters.\r\n- Art -\r\nThere are lots of different animations there. From the usual animation, to stop motions, retro 8-bit style and intentionally bad ones. I usually don't care too much about the quality of the animation as long as the anime is enjoyable. So I'd say it's fair.\r\n- Sound -\r\nEach episode (Including the rebroadcast) changes voice actors/actress for Popuko and Pipimi. While Idon't see the reason why I have to give it credit that they did a great job voicing these two. Nothing strikes me as unique in the music department though.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment -\\n\r\nHere's the thing, being intentionally trash is still a trash anime.\\n\r\nI'm not sure what they are trying to do. Most of the segments are just memes and random stuff that aren't even funny. The only time where I laughed is the first episode and other anime references. It fails as a comedy and a parody. The rebroadcasts are either changing voice actor/actress or adding subtitles for those French-speaking sections so that you have to sit through another 12 minutes. It feels cheap and a complete waste of time.",

Even if that was definitely intentional, I still don't really find it funny and get disappointed whenever it's on.\r\nVoice acting is great, I've been personally listening to the female voice actors because that's just my preference but I've seen clip of the older male voice actorswhich is honestly just as good and funny as the other version. Visuals can be iffy as said above but I think it excels best in the 8-bit animations shorts. The opening itself is beautiful, catchy and bizarre like the rest of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo far, probably one of my favorite animes this winter.

I thought it was Pop Team Epic\", \"I don't think any kinda anime would work without a solid story\", \"Do these 4-panel comedy manga's even work as a successful anime?\", etc. etc.)\r\nLuckily, I caught up with this series up until the release of episode 2. I wanted to give the series a chance (actually,because of curiosity), and LOVED it. The reasons were mainly because of the memes, parodies, and over-all randomness. Because of that, I waited in hope for the future episodes with high expectations to only sink in despair. It wasn't what I thought it'd be like.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my hype for the series dying down, it's still a pretty great anime. Would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who likes memes, Western pop culture, and just for the overall randomness.\\n\\n\r\n(I'll probably write a more critical review once the series is finished, kinda depends if it's a negative or a positive one, though)",

It rates so well for me only because I am reviewing it for what it is, a comedy. A comedy isn't necessarily held to the same standards as other shows which is likely why a comedy show will always have a place in anime's best shows of their respective seasons. \r\nThere is really no plot in Pop Team Epic. The show is anadaptation of a 4 panel comic that uses reference to Traditional Japanese culture, Pop culture, and strange non-sequitur to make it's jokes. The show fills around a 12-13 minute block with a bunch of shorts (many based on the comics source material) rolls credits and then takes an extremely odd and unique turn by airing the exact same episode AGAIN with different voice actors and sometimes minor changes to the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an artistic point of view the show has been harshly criticized. My critique would be of the portions of the show where cg models are implemented as it just feels lazy to me. Many portions of the show are drawn, live actions, or made out of stop motion which is visually unique enough to earn a lot of respect from me. Taking risks and making something that's interesting is very different from making something that looks bad. On that note the Bob Team Epic skits that take on an absurd Japanese Street Pop art style the likes of which one would expect to see from the Garo Sengan music video or Katamari Damacy are an absolute delight to be subjected to.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise the anime's OP is amazing and was a strong competitor with Yuru Camp's [Shiny Days] as a favorite for the season. The ED was also very fun as the many changing voice actors that were used episode to episode often do the vocals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Pop Team Epic should appeal to anyone who likes Japanese comedy like Gaki no Tsukai. The show itself should also appeal to anyone with a reasonable amount of knowledge about animation or the anime industry. The many guest voice actors used episode to episode and the strange breaks of the 4th wall add to an experience that could have been a rather bland adaptation. Instead, the studio took the nature of the property they were working with and ran with it to make it something extremely faithful to it's source material by stretching the very limits of the medium they were presenting it in.",

It is what could be described as either and adaption or a tribute to the long running webcomic of the same name. It has no coherent narrative and the main consistancy is the two main charactors and a handful of sketches. Just as the webcomic, it makes parodies and refereces to real world events, popular culture and  as well creates its own brand of humor. Althought it might sound pretentious, it's self aware and in some instances could be described as being meta ironic,parodying itself. \\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is highly creative and makes use of many varied styles as well as mediums. I will go over a few examples. \"Bob Team Epic\" is a mini show within it which is intentionally poorly draw while also going toward a creepy almost surreal atmosphere and style. There is a 3D CG animation done entirely in french by a French animator, who does his own interpretation of the style of the webcomic and has free reign on how he depicts it. There are also miscellaneous skits, such as a almost flipbook live action sequence and a puppet sequence. \\n\\n\r\nI agree that the humor isn't for everyone, and I can see how it could be seen as a lowbrow \"lolrandomXD\" show- much like Bobobo (just reading reviews emphasizes that). That being said, I very much disagree with those sentimates/opinions. If you go into this show bitter, looking for a story or consistant plot, you will be dissapointed. If you go in with an open mind looking for a creatively done  show which makes heavy references to just about everything while not taking itself seriously, I'm sure you will like it.",

The closest I have to compare to this prior to the show airing would be Ai Mai Mii, a similarly surreal 4koma series also published by Takeshobo. However, Ai Mai Mii was 3 minutes long and somehow Pop Team Epic was to fill up 30 minutes of airtime. How could they do it? And so, on the faithful day it aired, everyone glued themselves to their screens and waited for the golden moment\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOnly to be greeted with an anime adaptation of Hoshiiro Girldrop, a joke 4koma series by the author meant to serve as a prelude to Pop Team Epic Season 2 (of the manga series). Once the opening credits were over, Popuko, in a voice that isn\u2019t Komatsu Mikako\u2019s, but that of Ebara Masashi\u2019s suddenly interrupted the show. And Pop Team Epic finally began\u2026\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic consists of several different smaller skits, which sum up to fill up roughly 15 minutes of airtime, before the show repeats but with a different cast for the main girls. As such, I will be looking at each segment individually in this review.\\n\\n\r\nOriginal Sketches:\\n\r\nEach episode would typically begin with an original sketch that references certain scenes from the original 4koma, but is not a direct adaptation of them. Typically they would be themed around a certain arc, such as a Yakuza parody or a Detective Mystery. While they may not seem to have a common similarity, they do share a common plot arc that connects each episode with each other. Essentially King Records (yes, the main sponsors of this anime) wants to achieve seasonal supremity, and essentially churn out low effort, highly referential skits starring Popuko and Pipimi to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It\u2019s pretty meta and self-deprecating. Fortunately the actual segments themselves are fairly enjoyable, they do not suffer from pacing issues due to being formatted to fit their respective airtimes. \\n\\n\r\nStraight Adaptations:\\n\r\nThese, on the other hand, are fairly hit-and-miss for me. The original 4koma was structured around brevity and hard-hitting punches in a short period of time. Whereas these segments, I feel, can drag on for too long, leading to pacing issues. Some of them are lengthened with original content to make up for pacing issues, such as the Katsudon 4koma and the \u201cAre you mad?\u201d 4koma. However these are few and far between, and are, I feel, one of the weaker moments in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nBob Team Epic:\\n\r\nI honestly didn\u2019t know what I expected with this. The off-model drawings with a very weird animation style is off-putting at first. However, I grew to love and look forward to this segment every week. Unlike the straight adaptations, Bob Team Epic always expands on the original material and such does not suffer from pacing issues. The surreal art style also complements the absurdist humour nicely. My favourite of the bunch has to be their take on the \u201cHellshake Yano\u201d segment. It has to be seen to be believe.\\n\\n\r\nJapon Mignon:\\n\r\nJapon Mignon is an oddity. It\u2019s a sketch made by a Frenchman living in Japan who doesn\u2019t understand Japanese (if the interviews are to be believed). So his interpretations of the series are of the girls being in France, voiced by French actresses. The humour is clean and simple, but it offers a nice break from the crazy and absurd.\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Cooking:\\n\r\nA cute series. They offer proper cooking advice that this reviewer has followed for their recipes. (That was a lie, but Pop Team Cooking is a cute enjoyable little diversion from the rest of the show.)\\n\\n\r\nPixel Art Sketches:\\n\r\nPersonally, I felt these are the weakest of the bunch. Not too big on these, they always felt full of noise and lacking in a central theme or joke. Give them a pass.\\n\\n\r\nMusic Videos:\\n\r\nThese are really cute segments where felt dolls of the main duo come to life and sing cute songs. The songs are sung by iM@S veterans, so they are of considerable quality and are pretty funny too. It\u2019s always surreal and wonderful to see the iM@S Producers sing these.\\n\\n\r\nSo you may ask, what\u2019s worth sticking around for? Well, the show is more than the sum of its parts, and the seiyuu performances are absolutely top notch. It\u2019s where the series differentiates itself from the rest of its kin, each episode features the talents of 2 male seiyuu and 2 female seiyuu for the main duo. As someone who\u2019s a follower of seiyuu performances, this series is a joy to follow; to see characters you recognize take on the persona of Popuko and Pipimi is great. I personally find the male seiyuus more fitting for the duo than the female ones, that and their tendencies to ad-lib more works well for the series.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Pop Team Epic is not for everyone, but it sure is a fun series to follow. It\u2019s entertaining especially if you follow seiyuu performances, the show is basically a seiyuu vehicle with all your favourites and more.\\n\\n\r\n Give it a watch, or else I\u2019m coming for ya. \\n\\n\r\n*ding dong*\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n*REBROADCAST*\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic est un kusoanime autoproclam\u00e9 (kuso signifie merdique et anime signifie anime). C'est un peu spectaculaire en soi. En fait, rien ne peut surpasser l'accumulation et le battage m\u00e9diatique qui ont conduit \u00e0 cela. (A / N: si vous n\u2019aimez pas les sentiments de watashi, n'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 passer les 2 prochains paragraphes de l\u2019examen).\\n\\n\\n\r\nImaginez, ne sachant absolument rien sur l'adaptation anime au-del\u00e0 de 2 bandes-annonces (dont quelques personnes dans la rue sont interview\u00e9es), Uesaka Sumire et Komatsu Mikako sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme le duo principal (malgr\u00e9 le manga qui se moquait de louer des seiyuu dispendieux pour jouer). duo), et que les br\u00e8ves bandes de 4koma sont en quelque sorte adapt\u00e9es au format 30 minutes. Le plus proche que je puisse comparer \u00e0 cela avant la diffusion de l'\u00e9mission serait Ai Mai Mii, une s\u00e9rie \u00e9galement surr\u00e9aliste de 4koma \u00e9galement publi\u00e9e par Takeshobo. Cependant, Ai Mai Mii durait 3 minutes et Pop Team Epic devait remplir 30 minutes de temps d'antenne. Comment ont-ils pu le faire? Et ainsi, le jour fid\u00e8le de la diffusion, tout le monde s'est coll\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9cran et a attendu le moment d'or\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSeulement pour \u00eatre accueilli avec une adaptation anime de Hoshiiro Girldrop, une s\u00e9rie de blagues 4koma de l'auteur destin\u00e9e \u00e0 servir de pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 Pop Team Epic Season 2 (de la s\u00e9rie manga). Une fois le g\u00e9n\u00e9rique d\u2019ouverture termin\u00e9, Popuko, d\u2019une voix qui n\u2019est pas celle de Komatsu Mikako, mais celle d\u2019Ebara Masashi interrompit soudainement le spectacle. Et Pop Team Epic a finalement commenc\u00e9\u2026\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic se compose de plusieurs sketches plus petits, qui totalisent environ 15 minutes de temps d\u2019antenne, avant que l\u2019\u00e9mission ne se r\u00e9p\u00e8te, mais avec une distribution diff\u00e9rente pour les filles principales. En tant que tel, je regarderai chaque segment individuellement dans cette revue.\\n\\n\r\nCroquis originaux:\\n\r\nChaque \u00e9pisode commence g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par une esquisse originale faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 certaines sc\u00e8nes de 4koma d\u2019origine, mais n\u2019en est pas une adaptation directe. Typiquement, ils seraient th\u00e9matiques autour d'un certain arc, comme une parodie de Yakuza ou un myst\u00e8re de d\u00e9tective. Bien qu'ils puissent ne pas sembler pr\u00e9senter une similitude commune, ils partagent un arc de terrain commun qui relie chaque \u00e9pisode entre eux. Essentiellement, King Records (oui, les principaux sponsors de cet anime) veut atteindre la supr\u00e9matie saisonni\u00e8re et produire essentiellement des sketches tr\u00e8s r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiels mettant en vedette Popuko et Pipimi afin de faire appel au plus petit d\u00e9nominateur commun. C'est joli m\u00e9ta et auto-d\u00e9valorisant. Heureusement, les segments eux-m\u00eames sont assez agr\u00e9ables, ils ne souffrent pas de probl\u00e8mes de rythme en raison de leur formatage adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs horaires respectifs.\\n\\n\r\nAdaptations droites:\\n\r\nCelles-ci, par contre, sont assez al\u00e9atoires pour moi. Le 4koma original \u00e9tait structur\u00e9 autour d'une bri\u00e8vet\u00e9 et de coups durs dans un court laps de temps. J\u2019ai le sentiment que ces segments peuvent s\u2019\u00e9terniser trop longtemps, ce qui entra\u00eene des probl\u00e8mes de rythme. Certains d'entre eux sont allong\u00e9s avec un contenu original pour compenser les probl\u00e8mes de rythme, tels que le Katsudon 4koma et le \"\u00cates-vous fou?\" 4koma. Cependant, ils sont rares et constituent, \u00e0 mon avis, l'un des moments les plus faibles de l'anime.\\n\\n\r\nBob Team Epic:\\n\r\nHonn\u00eatement, je ne savais pas ce \u00e0 quoi je m'attendais. Les dessins hors mod\u00e8le avec un style d'animation tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange sont d\u00e9concertants au d\u00e9but. Cependant, j'ai appris \u00e0 aimer et \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer ce segment chaque semaine. Contrairement aux adaptations simples, Bob Team Epic \u00e9tend toujours le mat\u00e9riau d'origine et ne souffre pas de probl\u00e8mes de rythme. Le style artistique surr\u00e9aliste compl\u00e8te bien l'humour absurde. Ce que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re dans le peloton, c'est sans doute leur interpr\u00e9tation du segment \u00abHellshake Yano\u00bb. Il faut le voir pour le croire.\\n\\n\r\nJapon Mignon:\\n\r\nJapon Mignon est une curiosit\u00e9. C\u2019est un croquis r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par un Fran\u00e7ais vivant au Japon qui ne comprend pas le japonais (\u00e0 en croire les interviews). Donc, ses interpr\u00e9tations de la s\u00e9rie sont des filles \u00e9tant en France, exprim\u00e9es par des actrices fran\u00e7aises. L'humour est clair et simple, mais il offre une belle pause du fou et de l'absurde.\\n\\n\r\nCuisine Pop Team:\\n\r\nUne s\u00e9rie mignonne. Ils offrent des conseils de cuisson appropri\u00e9s que ce critique a suivis pour leurs recettes. (C'\u00e9tait un mensonge, mais Pop Team Cooking est une jolie petite d\u00e9viation agr\u00e9able du reste de la s\u00e9rie.)\\n\\n\r\nCroquis d'art de pixel:\\n\r\nPersonnellement, j'ai senti que ce sont les plus faibles du groupe. Pas trop gros sur ceux-ci, ils se sont toujours sentis pleins de bruit et manquaient d'un th\u00e8me central ou d'une blague. Donnez-leur un laissez-passer.\\n\\n\r\nVid\u00e9os musicales:\\n\r\nCe sont des segments vraiment mignons o\u00f9 des poup\u00e9es de feutre du duo principal prennent vie et chantent de jolies chansons. Les chansons sont chant\u00e9es par des v\u00e9t\u00e9rans d'iM @ S, elles sont donc d'une qualit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable et sont assez dr\u00f4les aussi. C\u2019est toujours surr\u00e9aliste et merveilleux de voir les producteurs iM @ S les chanter.\\n\\n\r\nPour conclure, Pop Team Epic n\u2019est pas pour tout le monde, mais c\u2019est une s\u00e9rie amusante \u00e0 suivre. C\u2019est amusant, surtout si vous suivez les performances de seiyuu, le spectacle est essentiellement un v\u00e9hicule seiyuu avec tous vos favoris et plus.\\n\\n\r\n Fais-lui une montre, sinon je viens pour toi.\\n\\n\r\n*bzzzt bzzzt*\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n",

            "content": "Comedy anime are almost always divisive. Humour is subjective and it's hard to make shows that throw plot out the window and focus almost exclusively on the jokes. As such, Pop Team Epic has been one of the most argued about anime of 2018. Some see it as absurd, unfunny memes that rely on references. Others see it as an exciting new approach to anime and a hilarious show. I think I'm one of the few people in the middle. \r\nI was absolutely pumped to watch PTE. The manga had me hooked and I eagerly awaited the chance to see my favourite strips come tolife. My expectations were high. When I watched the first episode, Pop Team Epic lived up to them. A fakeout beginning that completely tricked me, short skits that encapsulated the manga's frantic energy - everything that made the manga good was here, made even better. Despite only catching about half the references the episode was great. However, as I continued to watch, I found myself seeing more and more issues. So, I will first go through what I liked about PTE, what I disliked, and why I gave it an overall rating of 4.\\n\\n\r\nTHE GOOD:\\n\\n\r\n- The recurring skits: Bob Team Epic, Hoshiiro Girldrop and Pop Team Cooking to name a few. Bob Team Epic, while horrific to look at, is hilarious and I love the voice actor. The live action paper scene was the best, and I was blown away by the dedication and hard work put in. I liked Hoshiiro Girldrop, too - which seems to be an unpopular opinion after reading others' thoughts. I enjoyed seeing the characters get up to silly anime antics, and the extreme escalation episode made me laugh out loud. Pop Team Cooking, while not as funny, was a nice respite from longer skits.\\n\\n\r\n- The songs. There are a couple songs in PTE and all of them are amazing. PTE is an anime that begs for spectacular, over the top antics - and how much more spectacular can you get than felt dolls of pipimi and popuko dancing to a ripoff of 'Let's Groove'?\\n\\n\r\n- The short skits. In my opinion PTE is at its best when the jokes are short. The shorter skits more often mirrored the manga, were more punchy, escalated faster, and - if they were duds - were over before you got tired of them. \\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD:\\n\\n\r\n- The long skits. Some episodes of PTE are nearly unwatchable, because half of them are the. same. joke. The shogi and romance skit grated on me especially. They were far too long, while not having enough comedic value to be taking up that much space. Some scenes didn't even feature Popuko and Pipimi that much, which I didn't like. More humanoid characters don't look good in the PTE style, so I don't want to sit here watching them bumble about for five minutes.\\n\\n\r\n- The episode repeating. When this happened the first time, I thought it was a novelty joke just for the first episode. When it happened the second time, I could feel the dread creeping into my soul. The repetition is boring! No way in hell am I watching the same jokes just because the voice actors are different. The minor changes in each side were NOT enough to keep me watching. Instead, I ended up missing Hoshiiro girldrop sometimes because I didn't watch the male voiced version. This was a huge detriment to the show IMO.\\n\\n\r\n- Japon Mignon. I liked the idea of it, at least - but the jokes aren't that funny, the slightly off animation is offputting, and they're speaking in French. Which is funny the first time. Not so much the third.\\n\\n\r\nWHY I GAVE POP TEAM EPIC A 4/10\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is unusual. In some ways it excels. In others it's mediocre. In the end I felt that it would be disingenuous to rate PTE on anything other than comedy. Out of the whole season, around half the scenes were funny to me. Only a couple actually made me laugh out loud. It would be a 5/10 in my eyes if the episodes didn't repeat. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, Pop Team Epic has too many disappointing issues for me to truly enjoy watching it. I hope there's a second season, and I hope they improve on the mistakes of season 1. Until then, I'm sticking to the manga.",

            "content": "Pop Team Epic is an incredibly dividing series. People either write joke reviews about how it's \"saving anime\" and is \"absolutely perfect\", and some claim it to be nothing more than poorly executed jokes and bad shitposting. There doesn't seem to be a center view of this series. I, personally, actually really respect Pop Team Epic and think it's pretty good, but only to the right people. Let me explain.\r\nSTORY: 3\r\nLet's not beat around the bush here - it's' vignettes. It has no semblance of a story. There's not really a continuity. There are parts of the episode that are longer than the rest thatdo have plots, but they're not connected and don't really service each other at all.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nLook, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \"You're actually giving Art such a high score for a vignette series of shitposts\"? And the answer is absolutely yes. The main reason why I respect Pop Team Epic and what it does so much is because of how much it throws things at the wall and does surreal things. Art is absolutely no exception to this rule. Throughout the series, Pop Team Epic does an absolute shitload of different art styles and animation styles. There's 2D animation in several art styles, 3D animation, Stop-Motion Animation, Puppetry, Sand Art, Live-Action Skits, and I think a lot more if I were to give myself more time to think. Hell, the episode \"Hellshake Yano\" has a long, creatively animated scene where well-cut and layered pages in notebooks are the animation for the segment, and it's unironically incredible to watch due to just how well-executed it is. Similarly to The Amazing World of Gumball, a show airing in the West, I hold it very close to my heart and find it incredibly cool to see so many different forms of animation and art in one show. It shows that the creators are having a lot of fun, and I really like that.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nJuuuust like my Art section, the main reason why I put this on here is due to just how much they do with sound in this series. Pipimi and Popuko each have at least 10 different Seiyuus in both the male and female voice acting camp. And these aren't just interns looking for their big shot in the world - these are voice acting veterans who have worked on big shows like One Piece or Dragon Ball. It makes me cackle with delight when I recognize a voice actor as they say some stupid shit coming out of the mouth of a schoolgirl. Not to mention, they also throw in things like music videos and even French, spoken by actual French voice actors. Another part of the show I really like is when they throw in flubbed lines or voice actor laughs - You hear it a lot from the male seiyuus in transitions between vignettes. These vignettes can also have different lines, jokes, or comedic delivery depending on the male or female versions, giving them more surprising comedic moments as well. It also has a suuuper good OP and a cute ED, and the great thing is that it also throws in remixes of the Opening, Sound-Versions like a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Opening, even alternate songs for openings like in episodes 1 and 11. There's a lot done on the sound and visual front alike, so I believe they deserve the same score.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5\\n\r\nOkay, so there's no real character writing here. Characters are here solely to set up jokes. While Pipimi TENDS to be the more stoic, voice of reason character over the bombastic and crude Popuko, it's not exactly consistent.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nWhile not all the jokes landed, I had an absolute blast watching this series. I was watching one episode with a friend who claimed he had never heard me laugh that loud before after, like, 3 years of friendship or so. (By the way, that was episode 2. Episode 2 is absolutely a riot.) I also do understand a tad bit of Japanese, so maybe I could catch something in a Japanese pun that most people wouldn't get, but not consistently. It's a grab bag of comedy that, in my opinion, hits far more than it misses.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is a mixed bag of comedy that has a lot of love poured into it, and you can tell the team behind it is having a ridiculous amount of fun. While its fast-paced, surrealist, vignette-style comedic scenes may not be funny to some people, I had a lot of fun while watching this.",

It follows the everyday adventures of two (kind of cutesy drawn) girls, Popuko and Pipimi with absurd comedy that has a LOT of references and parodies. The story is there but it's so complicated and has such and amazing character development that you will be thrilled every time. The artstyle, while simplistic at times, is beautifully drawn and animated giving an air to the characters. And the soundtrack is simply amazing with an awesomely crafted opening and ending.I enjoyed every second of it and I'm sure you will enjoy it too.\\n",

From episode one, we have all these amazing references and jabs to other popular animes, and in episode twelve, we have jabs to the people who made the series themselves.\r\nThe series uses a wide variety of animation styles, from the usual ones by Kamikaze Douga to the amazingly bad Bobunemimimmi ones, which I say is amazingly bad because it literally satirises itself.\r\nThe ending theme halfway through the series changes from the normal ending to Popuko and Pipimi dissing the series before going on and singing. That's another key in this satirical genius.\r\nThe voice acting changes from thestandard female voices to male character voices, which again, is amazingly great at satirising the series. And not only that, the voices actors are also connected, so the voices you hear come from another series, which is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kinda amazing how that King Records hasn't been sued over this yet, especially since there are so many jabs at other series.",

            "content": "Pop Team Epic is a wild experience.\r\nIf I learned anything while watching, it\u2019s that anime is made for Japanese people by Japanese people. Even though I\u2019m not a \u65e5\u672c\u4eba, I love this anime very much and it\u2019s one of the funniest ones I\u2019ve seen in years. Not because it\u2019s dumb (even though it really is), but because it\u2019s also smart (and it really is). It\u2019s easy to dismiss Pop Team Epic as being nothing more than a meme-fest, trolling piece of junk, but by assuming that you would be doing yourself and this series a big disservice. It\u2019s ridiculous and while virtually all anime are,this one uses its lunacy for its advantage. Every facet of this anime is bursting with creativity, references, weirdness, and joy.   \\n\\n\r\nHoshiiro Girldrop immediately welcomes the viewer and gives way to this colorful world. The catchy OP by Sumire Uesaka in episode 2 sets the perfect tone for what the anime is about. Combined with the simple art style, strong voice acting and humor, my interest in the series has only grown stronger and will keep me rewatching, just to experience it one more time. 2018 is without a shadow of a doubt a wonderful year because of this show\u2019s existence.  \\n\\n\r\nLike the manga it\u2019s based off of, there is no central story. Instead, there is an abundance of skits involving two junior high school girls, Popuko and Pipimi. They both have an attitude, tend to not follow any form of logic and flip people off. While there is variety regarding the skits, most of them involve references to anime, tropes, video games and Japanese pop culture. There are even times when Pop Team Epic references itself. Some of them are probably not going to be recognizable to anyone outside of Japan. There are some widely known ones though such as Totoro, Earth, Wind & Fire, Skyrim (there\u2019s a Pipimi mod out there now), Guardians of the Galaxy, Pokemon, and Super Mario.    \\n\\n\r\nThe actual time of the show is a little bit deceiving. While it is 20 something minutes, the episodes are repeated so it\u2019s actually about 12 minutes long, just with different voice actors. One segment features Popuko and Pipimi with male voices and the other with female. While the true voices are actually the women, viewers might ask \u201cwhy do men voice the main characters?\u201d. Because in the manga, there\u2019s a strip where Popuko and Pipimi muse about who should voice them if they get an anime adaption. They decide it should be two famous male voice actors because of how absurd it would be if it happened. This is probably the only constant, but there\u2019s a routine of a different pair of voice actors for every episode. It does give a different approach to the same premise. There definitely is a large pool of talent and if you\u2019ve watched a lot of anime, most of them will be recognizable. One example is Ryusei Nakao and Norio Wakamoto who are the voices of Freiza and Cell in Dragon Ball Z, respectively. It might seem like a waste of time to watch the exact same thing twice, but if you\u2019re fan you should already have known what you were in for. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an infamous segment called Bob Team Epic. It\u2019s drawn/animated in such a hideous and offmodel manner, but strangely, it doesn\u2019t feel out of place. It actually has its own charm and even expands on the manga strips in its own unique way such as the \u201cAre you angry?\u201d skit where Popuko repeatedly punches Pipimi. Only this one doesn\u2019t end with the former punching the latter, she not only repeatedly punches her, she punches her harder, slams her and eventually turns her into pickled radish. When asked again if she\u2019s angry, Pipimi still isn\u2019t. What\u2019s the point of this? I don\u2019t know, but what I do know is if everyone was as stoic as Pipimi the world would be a better place.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the art, the animators really capture Bkub\u2019s style down to a T. The animation is diverse and crisp and my favorite parts involve the felt toy dance sequences of the girls singing to pop songs. Other styles used are CGI, in real life events and the aforementioned Bob Team Epic\u2019s rough art. The sound is also off the wall. The are times when dulcet dramatic music plays in the background during what is supposed to be the most mundane events. The experimentation is able to give the anime more of an identity and despite all this randomness in technique, I\u2019m surprised how everything still manages to fit together so well.\\n\\n\r\nThe cover of the first volume of the manga shows both girls giving the viewer a double one finger salute, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how the strangest anime duo view anyone who hates the series. Pop Team Epic is so self aware that it doesn\u2019t care if you love it or if you hate it, you\u2019re still going to be taking the time out of your day talking about it regardless. It\u2019s pure, unadulterated fun. It doesn\u2019t always make sense, but it doesn\u2019t have to. That\u2019s also one of its greatest strengths, it just doesn\u2019t care and does whatever it wants. That\u2019s something I can wholeheartedly respect when it comes to anyone or anything really. \\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is a breath of fresh air. It is the cure to the humdrum times that\u2019s been around for a number of anime seasons. Not only is it the highlight of 2018 of anything, it is truly an achievement in the medium and the kind every generation to come should experience. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. However, there\u2019s a ton of material that can be made and a multitude of ideas to go through so this anime can go on for a long time if it wanted to. Washu-kamisama bless you, Bkub Okawa! And may she also bless Pop Team Epic forever and ever. Amen.",

It would honestly be some kind of miracle if a comedy that relied on sketches could maintain the same level of quality all the way through. It does at least have more \"hits\" than a lot of American sketch comedies, especially if you're a fan of nonsensical humor.\r\nBut then I imagined Popuko reading my review, tearing through the screen, and asking me \"Ah, you are motherfucker?\"\r\nSo I'm just going to goahead and tell you that Poputepikku is worth a watch, especially if you're bored with traditional anime comedy. Some sketches might have just flown over my head - I highly recommend going for HIDIVE's subtitles rather than Crunchyroll/HorribleSubs' if you're going to watch the sub. I saw screencaps of HIDIVE's version that were way funnier.",

            "content": "I notice a lot of people either give this anime a stellar review or tend to just shit post all over it. I can agree that this anime is very polarized in that you either love it or hate it and there really is no middle ground.\r\nI want to just start off by saying that I read the description and was intrigued by the description of it as an \"absurdist\" work. So I turned on episode one and asked myself \"What in the name of Hell am I watching?\" and I almost dropped in right then. It wasn't at all what I was expecting andI thought it was a trainwreck that had already happened. But I followed my general rule and waited for the next two or three episodes to come out and see where it went. Over that time I grew to accept what the anime was trying to do, and I also feel that the anime has come a long way in really figuring out how it needs to execute itself for maximum effect. I give it an overall seven out of ten because, while I seriously enjoy watching this, there really isn't much else past being an absurdist comedy piece. No, there is no linear storyline. If you watched through the episodes, you'll notice that it's supposed to resemble short comic strips, with the anime being a series of small skits rather than one long continuous story. The intro even has a couple segments where the background is like a pile of newspaper comic section clippings featuring the characters of the anime. I really like how this was executed on screen and I feel they did a good job of it. However, this kind of thing is very limited in terms of what it can do, and eventually it becomes just short skits over and over again every week, even if I do get a good laugh each episode. The reason the score is low for me has nothing to do with the animation, which fits well with the intention of the anime, or with lack of a plot, which is the entire point and the anime wouldn't be as good if it had the same goal but with a single coherent plot, but the low score is attributable to the fact that there isn't any room for growth and development, so the anime eventually stagnates and gets repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThere are definitely better anime this season and this past year, much better comedies and the like. If you want a serious recommendation from me for a comedy this season, I might recommend something like Mitsuboshi Colors or Slow Start, but I will say that this anime is one that shouldn't be looked over simply because of a bad review or because it isn't the best of the season. I think it deserves a chance, and because I gave it one I ended up actually enjoying it, and I think you might enjoy it as well.",

            "content": "Pop Team Epic is a very polarizing anime. Right off the bat, you either like the show or you don't like the show. It's humor is very specific and might not resonate with everyone who watches it. It's definitely not a 'universal' show that anyone can pick up and enjoy.\r\nThat being said, I think if do enjoy what Pop Team Epic does with its humor and style, then you'll end up loving the show.\r\nStructure:\r\n  Pop Team Epic is structured a lot like old Adult Swim comedy shows or bumps: quick (most of the time), bizarre, and with a punchline that can last less thana second. Being that it's based on a four panel manga strip series, a lot of the segments are short and to the point. Some segments might last longer, with the majority of the longer running ones really just being short segments under the same narrative, but for the most part the segments are over before they outstay their welcome. This is to the benefit of the show, as, because if the type of humor the show has, the segments can be hit or miss. I found myself bored during some segments and laughing hard a few seconds later when it's changed the segment. Because the show is really just a bunch of clips, if one isn't jiving with you there's no harm in skipping it.\\n\r\n  Despite its full anime episode length on Crunchyroll, it's really split in half between the female and male voice actors. This is a very controversial choice and didn't sit well with a lot of people. I remember watching the first episode and getting confused on why I was watching the same clips again. They actually do change some of the dialogue or jokes around between the two halves, so they're not complete carbon copies. The episodes don't feel like they're meant to be watched all the way through, rather you should pick which voice acting you want to listen to and choose that half. If there's a good segment, sometimes it's worth watching it again with the opposite voice actors.\\n\r\n  I heard someone say that this show would work better as TV bumps (like Adult swim) that cycled through the clips and which voice actors they were using. So you might see a clip, and then later in the day see the same clip but with with the different voice actors. That's the unfortunate part about how Pop Team Epic is structured. It doesn't work well being aired tradionally, but that's what they have to work with. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n  A lot of people discredit PTE for being a meme show or just a big 'shitpost' because of its simple style and hit or miss humor, but the show is worth a lot more than that. I do love seeing the little segments posted individually online and because of how relatable some of the humor is the show fits right in gif posts or Facebook reaction posts and just all around jives with the post-Vine internet culture, but a lot of people miss the heart behind the show. It's not just \"lolrandom\" or \"memes\". There's some impressive animation and talent behind the show; some clips have animation that seem like they have no right being that good. There's a few segments where they use custom felted dolls for stop motion, one segment is animated in sand (yes, the beach kind), and a very impressive skit that's animated with two notebooks held by two dudes voice acting at the same time. A lot of creativity is put into the show, and I think it's worth acknowledging.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the two main characters, Popuko and Pipimi, might not seem like anything but vehicles for whatever joke needs to happen, there's a lot of hidden character within them. For one, they love eachother very much (most of the time). This show has some of the cutest scenes of just two people being cute and loving to eachother (and sometimes smacking them across the room). It's hard to get a read on their personalities, given that it's a gag show with no overarching narrative, but both the girls have their own unique personality traits that compliment perfectly with each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this show is fun, quirky, and worth your time if it resonates with you. It can be both bizarre and relatable at the same time, and the gags tend not to overstay their welcome. It's not a perfect show and is t for everyone, but I think it's wrong to discredit all the heart and creativity the show has to offer just because it can come off a certain way.\\n",

            "content": "Y'all ever seen the Eric Andre Show? It's like that but anime. \r\nIt's hard to translate a 4koma into a fully animated feature, its even harder when the 4koma has absolutely no obligation to have any sort of continuity or storyline. Pop Team Epic is what happens when you try to take Vines and internet skits and stretch it into a full 25 min time slot. The timing is incredibly fast past, barely giving the viewer any time to think or react to the scenes occurring. The humor is very Japanese, relying hard on what is assumed to be common background knowledge on common TVand movie tropes. \\n\\n\r\nNothing in this show is to be taken seriously and the show seems to be under no obligation to even explain itself. The best bits are the longer ones, with a set up and pay off. The more polarizing parts are going to be the parts that often rely on wordplay or surrealism to be funny. Some don't even have jokes, with the lack of a punchline being the punchline itself. Bob Team Epic parts are the worst. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not something you should binge watch, you'll get an aneurysm. The episodes are divided into two parts, one with mostly female voice actors and the other with male voice actors. Maybe the voice actors are from famous shows and that's why they don't seem to have the same one twice, but I wouldn't know. \\n\\n\r\nThere are legitimately funny and humorous moments, like the Earth Wind and Fire parody, and the more traditional comedy skits. But if you're looking for a classic comedy you can sit down and watch after a long day, this is the wrong place. \\n\\n\r\nThis show gets better. The first few episodes were rough, but once it gets to about the 4 or 5th episode, it really starts to get into it's stride. Stick with it, it does get better.",

It started off with seeing tons of fan art on Twitter, which was all very cute but I was confused, another one of those art trends? It looks funny, it looks weird. One day someone posted the \"lets pop together\" music skit on Twitter and I though oh that's where its from, its a music video. I told my friend about it and searched it up on YouTube. I then found a series of VERY short skits, then I thoughoh its some kind of YouTuber series of short skits. That's when my friend said wait a minute, its an anime, a whole anime. After constantly being surprised and confused, I was amazed, how the hell is this an anime, seriously? We have to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nI can totally understand why people wouldn't enjoy this show, it's very random out of place humour, all in a line. Some of the jokes are weird and some of them are funny, it all depends on how you look at it. I can say I enjoyed the show a lot with my friend but I really did not like those 'bob team ebic' sections (the ugly paint ones). However some of them were extremely creative and some of the references got to me and made me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no story, the whole show is very short random skits put together. There is a lot of parody scenes and poking fun at other series and you either love it or you hate it. At the end of the day you only need to see one episode to figure out if you'll enjoy the show or not. The episodes are also rather short, which makes them easy to watch since they are 10 minutes long each, one female dub and one male dub, so pick your poison.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy the humour, It is a refreshing show to watch in small 10 minute bursts, if you don't then I think you'd want to drop this one because every episode has different parodies and jokes but follows the same kind of pattern.",

The translation from 4-koma to anime was actually extremely successful, no great changes in tone.\r\nThere's an overarching story which pops in and can be amusing. Yeah, recommended if you like Nichijou, or 4-komas. If you like more sophisticated and built up jokes then it won't be your thing. To be fair the jokes can be hit ormiss, I disliked the in between sections personally.\\n\r\nVoice acting is what can make or break this, there's a huge cast of voice actors from all over who add their voices to the main two female characters, this includes male voices.

            "content": "Story & Characters: 10/10\r\nPop Team Epic's story is a subject of intense speculation and mystery. It's internal workings and deeper ramifications are barely understood, even to the team of neckbearded, waifu-signalling, 4chan-browsing, basement-dwelling troglodytes who conceived it. It is a loose assemblage of obscure pop culture references held together with spit and cum, and the most fitting analogy for the show's humor and flow is a gacha game. Most of the time, you'll be getting shit. But once in a while, you understand an extremely obscure reference or an insanely on-point parody that makes you feel as if the series is counting you in asone of the \"cool kids.\" You keep coming back to get that shot of dopamine that makes your nipples tingle like a furry at the annual American Kennel Club. Your enjoyment of this series is directly proportional to how many references and parodies you catch, which is proportional to how long you've immersed yourself in this cesspool we call a pop culture. One thing for sure, though is that anyone who rates this show lower than a 9 is a mouth-breathing, soy-eating basic bitch boomer who has been living under a rock and does not understand quirky random millennial humor at its very best. It is a meme that has transcended all boundaries of reason and logic, has become so \"\"\"\"\"\"ironic\"\"\"\"\"\" that it is immune to criticism and scrutiny. It doesn't have any proper setup or punchlines because it doesn't need any. It is the beacon of an era; the battle cry of a generation. Just when we thought dank memes cannot get any more obtuse and self-referencing, Pop Team Epic one ups the game by being something akin to a psychedelic social experiment, where the result is a joke that everyone finds funny, but no one understands. Everyone is in on the joke, but no one knows what the punchline is, and I dare not say anymore at risk of ruining the punchline if I haven't already.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative that Pop Team Epic is pushing, while taken at face value, may seem trite and meaningless, but if one were to take a step back and look at the bigger picture, the pieces start clicking into place. In the first place, what is it trying to do? To fuck with the audience at every twist and turn, with every picosecond of its runtime. Why does it fuck with us like this? Because it literally markets itself as an edgy self-aware ironic dank meme. It is an anime that parades and ridicules itself on Twitter with the #kusoanime tag to draw attention to its subversiveness. The key visual for the anime announcement literally has the two main characters saying that the publisher for the manga will regret turning it into an anime. And strangely, this form of marketing worked. Not only did it manage to gather the entire japanese twitter community under its banner of flippant self-awareness, but it has also become something akin to an urban legend on western message boards and forums. It has a nothing short of an abusive relationship with its (ironic) fanbase, where everything it says and does is buried underneath so many layers of irony that its true intentions can never be discerned. Who is in on the meme and who is not? Is the season 2 announcement legit or are they just ironically cockslapping us like they always do? The charm of Pop Team Epic, aka its over-the-top self-awareness, has the mythical quality of being applicable to just about anything it does, suspending fan reactions in indefinite limbo, and fans actually like that. This is absolute genius. Every step of the way was calculated, and the marketing and production committees knew exactly what they were doing, even if the people they were marketing to didn't.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nPop Team Epic toes the line between pissing on our eyelids and showing us colors for the first time. Just when you think it's settled on an artstyle, it cockslaps you with something like Hellshake Yano, which, by the way, is one of the most batshit insane things I've ever seen in all my years of watching anime. Some dudes actually had to write, draw, choreograph, rehearse, and perform that shit. It wholly captures the flippant style and spirit of the manga, and leaves me with no complaints whatsoever. Actually, I do have two complaint: the BobbuNeMiMiMi segments look like dogshit, and the producers pussied out on the episode length and each episode is technically only 10 minutes long. But then again, both of those are not weaknesses but are actually strengths of Pop Team Epic, when you take into account what it's trying to do.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSound is one of the departments where Pop Team Epic really makes the most of its medium. The wildly inconsistent voice acting and sound design kept things interesting, and I actually enjoyed hearing some of my favorite female seiyuus like Mimori Suzuko and Taketatsu Ayana scream, shout, and bark at the top of their lungs for a really expensive shitpost.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

In a way, it reminds me of an anime version of Robot Chicken, in the manner that it's a surreal animated sketch comedy block full of pop culture references and parodies. It's one of those series that's you'll either love or hate, and let me tell you, I loved it! Every episode had me laughing to the point of crying from start to finish, with my favorite segment of them all easily being the one with the Skyline GT-R. With the assortment of different art styles and over-the-top humor, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I also found it reallyinteresting that the block repeated with two different voice actors, and that there were minute differences in dialogue in them that one might not catch upon first viewing unless you're really paying attention. That being said, this one's unique style puts it leaps and bounds in front of everything else in terms of uniqueness. And let me tell you, the experience definitely pairs well with a bottle of Absolut at the ready. ^w^",

I'm going to make an introduction and in the end say why it is so good and why I talk so good about him.\r\n\"HUEHUEHUE\"\r\nIf you use the internet on a daily, you must have seen this strange combination of letters that signify only one thing: A Brazilian has sent it and he's making fun of it. This is called \"Zueira\".\r\n\"Zueira?\" Yeah!\r\nZueira is that set of funny things, memes and etc ... that you see and start sharing with everyone on your social networks and of course, laugh of your friends.\r\n\"What does this have to do with this anime?\"\r\nSimple! Itis the personification of the \"Brazilian zueira\" in anime. This story is totally insane, funny, full of impressibility, fast, slow, full of references to other animes and things, Go go power rangers!, Haduken!, OH MARILYN MONROE! and other totally random things that somehow make fun and make you smile.\\n\r\nI am a Brazilian, I see people sending memes and zueira on social networks every day and I think that in the right way, this is good for everyone. Laugh is good to health.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is magnificent! I never tire of laughing to this day about the things I saw in it. They are very short stories sometimes, sometimes long, you can not predict what will happen. I got stuck in this anime due to such a good comedy and it cheered me up for days with wonderful episodes.\\n\r\nThe duration of this anime is 24 minutes, but the story of the episode ends at 12 minutes, leaving a question, \"what happens in the other 12 minutes?\". The episode repeats with OTHERS seyuus dubbing the characters and small and quick exchanges in the events.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, this anime is magnificent. What!?!? Did not I mention the other features? Have time! The animation is wonderful and unpredictable too. Excellent music themes too. This anime is a masterpiece of comedy.",

            "content": "this AWESOME anime is pretty damn cute! It's basically like when the directors were making it and they decided to oh you know give us memes and other shit. Pop Team Epic is the picasso of our generation. Pop Team Epic cured my cancer, and it cured every disease i had in my body when i watched it, so anyway let's see what it did to contribute to my existence. desu!~\r\nStory 7/10\r\n---------------\r\nThere isn't really a story kind of like in Lucky Star, but it's great none of the less. The whole thing about the pop team comedy club is that atleast it parodieslike a 100000 animes and other media. Including Skyrim, Metal Gear, Kemono Friends, Chrono Trigger, My Neighbor Totoro and even a Jojo reference in between. It was awesome though. Two 14 year old girls going on wacky adventures is my kind of thing. Like Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, but with more comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\\n\r\nReminded me about some old Touhou 4-panel manga i saw back when i was active in the fandom. I never really saw it but because I love Touhou (even when it isn't an \"anime\")\\n\r\nI still really like game series. The Hoshiiro Girldrop segment wasn't even part of most of the anime so I'm gonna leave that shit out here. However, Hoshiiro Girldrop isn't an official anime although the artist behind this made it as well but it was in PTE. It's a bit desu and a bit kawaii.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8.2/10\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\\n\r\nI love when girls have manly voices, not like traps or anything, Traps in anime are men with \\n\r\ngirl voices, sort of like that one kawaii cat \"lady\" in Re:Zero (Rem is best girl who's actually a girl) On the other hand the girl voice acting was okay as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\\n\r\nThere is character development in anime about cute girls doing cute things at least this is not lucky star where the characters are cute moe lolis. (They're 14)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nVery HILARIOUS! I laughed at the joke about Hellshake Yano and the Bob Team Epic acting.\\n\r\nOverall I highly recommend if you're looking for a laugh! WARNING: Dankest of memes ahead!\\n",

            "content": "The man, the myth, the legend, the true art of Pop Team Epic or Poputepipikku. This is an anime that changed the internet for a long time, changed something that was mistaken in anime, and made the internet love this anime. Nothing else, it's about shitpost and meme which be the one thing that internet love, one thing that everybody cannot wait for the first episode, and one thing that make some different opinion on forum discussions. I heard that this anime has the deepest regrets for the director, Jun Aoki, and the staffs because they think this series is one of the most bizarreand most absurd they do. I'm not saying that this anime is not fit to watching by normies or anything and I also didn't forbid those who try to understand it. This is a great anime for everyone to watch and I also get the satirical jokes about something popular on the internet. But, you can not stop the satirical duo of badass.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not like you want to enjoy the story rather than find the plots. If you are looking for something to do with it, this is not your cup of tea. Pop Team Epic takes a lot of various references in the movie as well as something more mainstream or popular but makes it all in a satirical way that's funny and of course is in different contexts. It's about memes and internet that mixed together. In addition, this anime is not self-explanatory which doesn't show it all clearly as if you had some acknowledgment about the internet then you will understand the jokes. In addition, Pop Team Epic is random and sometimes you don't know it because of the weirdness you can't think what really happened. Some of which I notice without looking at reviews or references on the internet are Your Name, Skyrim, My Neighbor Totoro, Guardians Of The Galaxy, The Shining, Undertale, Street Fighter, Ghostbuster, Marylin Monroe, and Chrono Trigger. Initially, I thought that I was wrong when watching this anime on the first or there was a glitch because you'll be shown a typical romance mediocre anime and the stories that I always see in the community. But, it's in satire way at all. In addition, this anime only provides an 11 or 12-minutes collection of segments and eventually it comes the credit. However, they repeat it twice with the same story but little difference in the first half, change the seiyuu and give a satirical impression again. If all anime has a half an hour of each episode, why not repeat the first segment so that the duration is enough? The rest, maybe that's what the author thinks so the director himself also doesn't know what he wants to make.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a sketch comedy with the absurd sketch animation and art. This anime exceeds its own creativity and interest so there are some meta-humors that are also interesting inside. Sometimes, this anime does the breaking of the fourth wall and mocks something related to the rest of the tropes which some of it I don't understand. Sometimes, they come in various forms ranging from painted temporary, stop motion, original, quirky, fresh and others. In addition, they also have special things to do that. One of the segments I like best is when Pipimi fantasizes about a two live-action person that performer manipulating sketchbook pages but in a satirical context. It's so hard to explain how the segment works if you see it right away. The transition also always calls questions when a French animator or something like that tells about the next segment in French speech. It's not self-explanatory, again, because many viewers are trying to understand that too. At last, they come with many creativity and absurd way to make some jokes become on and on for the main focus regardless of how the context is and I agree, this is so random too.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of seiyuu who participates in this project such as Ayana Taketatsu, Yuki Kaji, Aoi Yuuji, Yoko Hikasa, and others. There are so many of which I can't mention one by one and their roles. Even Joey Byzinger a.k.a. The Anime Man participate in this series too and you can see it in episode 9. As I said before, the first segment involving the rest of the seiyuu which is somewhat interesting and the second segment presents the same story, same character, but a few difference in seiyuu- it's being exchanged. Bottom line, it's great to know all of these popular seiyuu participate in this anime but not all can also be noticed one by one and even then you also have to hear it twice.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are you saying about the characters? It's just a duo absurd heroine that does a lot of randomness and satirical things. Popuko the irritable short dude and Pipimi the tall unshakeable. Not much to say about these badass duos who always insinuate with each other. Furthermore, you will see characters from the segment \"Hoshiiro Girldrop\" which is always shown in the post-credit section and the beginning of the first episode but never participated in the story. Yeah, because it's a shitpost and you don't want that non-sense being to participate in the anime. Back again, it's just an anti-mediocre anime, predictable, and fairly recognizable to audience perspective. Love the part when this thing comes out and I can laugh as much as I see the segment.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I know it's so hard to keep up with this anime because I just wanna see how this anime always update their knowledge about the internet. But, I'm also surprised because the author always preparing stories which are the pop culture on the internet. The jokes sometimes I didn't understand but I understand in other contexts because it's funny but not in satirical ways. When I come to something that I know with my knowledge, I laugh as much because I know what they want to mock like The Shining sequences which are made horror but I find it funny, the Aliens sequence, Undertale, and Pokemon. I would never suggest this anime to people who didn't know anything about these references because I know they certainly will not like it. However, Pop Team Epic can actually be seen from various views because understanding in the context of satire will make you hard to get the jokes. Trying to understand the jokes which you don't understand will make you like a fool who tries to look edgy because of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's about the meme, the anti-anime, and the satire. If you don't like satire then you will never like this nonsense. An anime that changes the internet forever and the internet will certainly love this anime. I remember the first time that many people are waiting for the first episode because it is one of them, one of the anticipated anime at the season. It's hard to understand the jokes in this anime because at least you must have some knowledge of something related to pop culture and internet. If you always join on the community, you'll certainly know and understand comedy like this. Some I failed to understand the jokes but once in accordance with my knowledge, I laughed out loud until I forgot all segments before. This is not anime that everyone will enjoy but you might be able to try it and your opinion is up if you say is bad or masterpiece.",

If you have at least minor credentials in online shit-posting, Japanese and Western genres, memes and culture then Pop Team Epic will probably be a delight to you. But if you aren't at least somewhat versed in these things then many of the jokes will pass you byand seem like pure randomness. Even when you do have an extensive knowledge in all things Pop-Culture sometimes the jokes stray a bit too far into random territory or pure reference with no twist to make it interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe show however is always fast paced and fun and if one part doesn't bring you a smile or laugh you won't have to wait long for the next attempt. \\n\r\nI think the show truly comes alive during genre skits. These are usually longer sections where the show picks a genre of film or show and embraces it's tropes while poking fun at them. It's a nice little dissection where you get to see a genre taken to it's silliest and strangest extremes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy meta-humor, references and strangeness then this is a great show for you.",

I've never really got black humour and non-sequitur humour and after watching this, I can safely say that it's not the style of humour I enjoy. \r\nAt the same time, I don't regret watching it. It has areally interesting format and it's something I've never seen before. If you have some time to kill, I'd definitely recommend giving it a go, because there are some pretty cool segments.

But I still urge you to try at least one episode before writing it off. With shows like this it\u2019s important to go in with an open mindset and perhaps it will be the key to enjoyment. \r\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that PTE is an extremely eccentric project. While the manga is made entirely by one person the anime strays from the original to allow many different people the creative freedom to create whatever the hellthey felt like. There\u2019s no pretence or any other form of trying too hard, just genuine expressions from people who love anime and other forms of media and want to show it through creations of their own. Sometimes it leads to hilarious parodies other times references that warp original through the distinct lens of Pop Team Epic. When there\u2019s so much sincerity shining through every seam and frame I couldn\u2019t gather the effort to be annoyed at it even when it wasn\u2019t good.\\n\\n\r\nYou might rightfully point out that I haven\u2019t been talking much about anime itself and more about the approach to it and intention behind it. That\u2019s because I find it impossible to review such a unique project on it\u2019s technical merits. I can describe you the jokes and styles of humour that you will be experiencing throughout the run but that will only serve to ruin the magic of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to technical aspects all I can say is that the show is practically flawless. When PTE looks ugly it\u2019s supposed to look ugly. When it looks cheap it\u2019s cause if it wasn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t be nearly as funny and when it drastically switches the art styles it only serves to remind you that you\u2019re watching a new segment from a fresh team. There\u2019s nothing in it that I could categorize as a flaw cause I wouldn\u2019t be able to prove that it can be improved upon.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for something so pointless but I wanted to get out my personal feelings on PTE and if it convinces anyone to give a shot all the better.\\n",

            "content": "Hoshiiro Girldrop is another one of those animes that seems to be a stereotypical shoujo series about a girl and her senpai. Well, you wouldn't be wrong there.\r\nStory: HG starts us off with Daichi, and how he must live with Sosogu, his childhood friend. The anime is standard, with Sosogu getting into many different situations, and with those, strengthening her relationship with Daichi. However, what this plot presents us is with multiple tropes, which sometimes work, and sometimes don't. The whole idol thing is reminiscent of Love Live, but with the undercover aspect like Magical Girl animes. In a way, HG is a kind oflovechild between idol and magical girl animes with its theme of trying to mask an identity. However, this masking is eventually interrupted when she must show Daichi who she really is. He then basically becomes her coach, and they strengthen their relationship that way, until they reach the final episode, where Daichi has finally remembered who Sosogu was, and the promise he had made.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is fairly standard, maybe being a bit simplistic when compared to animes like it. However, the colours are very vibrant, and stand out, even when compared to the giants like Love Live and Madoka Magica. There isn't much to talk about for the art, but it is pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: HG boasts a great opening, amazing songs for the idol portion, and also a kick ass flute song for its episode previews. Also, Daichi's seiyuu really shows his emotion, especially in the first episode when he questions who Sosogu is. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Overall, the development of character with the relationships between Sosogu and Daichi are great. They start as \"strangers\", and build their way up as lovers. Sosogu's goal is to get the attention of Daichi, and possibly get him to remember who she is, but that only starts to come into play near the end of the first season. By the end, Daichi is willing to sacrifice everything in order to bring her back, which I feel to be a great change from the beginning. Overall, their characters were exactly what was needed, although a bit trope-ish.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What can I say except that HG was very enjoyable. The script was well executed, and full of tropes for me to poke fun at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: HG was a solid anime, picking apart tropes and putting them back together in a way that seems trope-ish itself, but ends up becoming just what the series needed. I would recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: What story?\\n\\n\r\nArt: Pretty standard art, but animations are really fluid for a joke anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Different seiyuus every episode? Ian Sinclair? I'm sold. Also, the opening is pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I can't diss their characters or else they'll come for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Oh? Yeah.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Watch it, unless you don't like memes.",

If you're just want a comedy anime that is all wacky, shortand sweet, this will definitely fit your preference. It's the type of anime that is fill with meme's galore. \\n",

In fact, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen another series utilize as many different styles as Poputepipikku. Some of these segments appear to parody more popular shows/styles while others are completely original. All of them, though, are pretty cool.The music is far from the focus of the series, but it still plays an active role in keeping the audience engaged.\r\nIn short, watching Poputepipikku is like watching a snake slowly devour a mousein your 5th grade science class.You may find yourself wondering \"What is the point of watching any of this?\u201d That\u2019s a good question, but ultimately not important. At the end of the day, you\u2019ll admit that despite the overall bizarreness of the situation, it was kind of cool to see that stereotypical mouse saturated with anime tropes, then swallowed whole by the snake.",

            "content": "It\u2019s said that a monkey produces shit every few minutes. It takes Pop Team Epic just 30 seconds. \r\nPop Team epic is an anime that is frustrating, crude, insane and, most importantly, self-aware. It knows that it relies on comedy that appeals to the lowest common denominator, and you can\u2019t help but laugh along with it. Once you\u2019ve seen the first episode, you\u2019ve seen it all; the series will never get any more profound, or deep, or meaningful. It will still rely on being one long, random meme, and you know what? That\u2019s okay. Not every anime needs to be a grand, beautiful, philosophical venture.Sometimes it can just be stupid fun. And for what it lacks in insightfulness, it more than makes up for with sheer ridiculousness. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodic in nature, each episode consists of two halves; the first has the protagonists, short and tall high-schoolers Popuko and Pipimi, voiced by female voice actors. The second is the exact same content, with minor changes to the skits- the catch being that the girls are voiced by male VAs. It\u2019s obvious that the VAs love what they\u2019re doing, each bringing a different feel to the characters, without feeling like they lose their essence. While the near-identical nature of each half initially felt like a farce, a few episodes in I was glad of it, as I never wanted the wild ride to end. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes are composed of short skits, lasting anywhere from 15 seconds to 5 minutes. Each feels unique (to say the least), even if the short and pointless nature of a fair few left me scratching my head. Various animation styles are used, keeping the content fresh and exciting. In more than one instance, I found myself laughing like a madman, wondering all the while just why (and what) I was experiencing. PTE is best experienced when putting your brain into power saving mode. \\n\\n\r\nWith this anime, there is simply no middle-ground. If you love memes and stupid humour, you\u2019ll love it. If you enjoy lavish animation, complex, thought-provoking plots, and well-written dialogue, you\u2019ll despise it. Normally, it would take a few episodes to know whether you would like an anime or not. Here, it will take just one. Be warned, though; if you only watch one episode, you\u2019ll be missing out on the killer opening, with a song that matches the show's tone perfectly, being an unashamedly pulse-pounding bit of electronica. \\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic is the epitome of \u201cdifferent strokes for different folks.\" Whether you think it\u2019s a gift or affront to the medium, there\u2019s no denying that it is as ambitious as it is lowbrow, an obvious labour of love that deserves to be experienced by any anime fan, even if just for a little while. The best that can be said of it is that it never loses sight of what it wants to be: an absurdist comedy that capitalises on silliness, laughing at itself as much as it provides the laughs for the audience. It\u2019s entirely comfortable in its own skin, and for that, it is worthy of commendation, if not adoration.    \\n",

            "content": "Do you remember going on the internet a couple years ago and seeing bits and pieces of a simplistic manga posted on random forums like tumblr or 4chan, usually they had no context and the jokes seemed very outlandish but not over the top. If you remember that, chances are you already know what Pop Team Epic is.\r\nThe Manga started back in 2014, and 4 years later, we finally get an anime adaptation.\r\nI see a lot of people label this series as \"a shitpost\" but that's really the most general (in my opinion, normie) interpretation of the series. It's subversive, anti-humor style was not somethingmany people were expecting, and due to that, many people are quick to dismiss the strange style of humor as \"lol so random\" or, again, a shitpost. I'd say the best comparison I could make to this show is the Eric Andre Show(and I'm not the first to say this), the show has that out there, over the top feeling that it has, but the humor in the Eric Andre show relies on the \"shittyness\" of it all, the same goes for Pop Team Epic. The manga and anime both constantly acknowledge how dumb the show can get, and take every opportunity they can to poke fun at some of the dumb tropes in anime, like the power of friendship, the cute animal sidekick, and stories that we've seen in other shows(this is usually the Space Cat Company skit in every episode).\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, I would say the series as a whole adapts the absurd style of the manga perfectly, unlike most 4 panel anime adaptations, the bulk of this show is mostly 30 sec. to 1 min. sketches that for the most part are lifted straight from the manga rather than take the characters from 4 panel manga and put them in 23 minute stories. Something that adds to the sporadic nature of the show is the multimedia side of it all with the show seamlessly having 2d and 3d sketches, puppet shows, a flipbook story, watercolor styled sketches, and even French Sketches. \\n\\n\r\nMy main gripe is how lopsided the episodes can feel. Most episodes follow a similar format. You have the opening sketch, the long sketch(usually the Space Cat Company sketch, with the exception of the Bobnemimimmi sketch in episode 7), then the last 4 minutes is a few 30 sec. to 1 minute sketches. Throw in 2 Bobnemimimmi sketches and then you have the first part done, and then they repeat the episode with male voice actors with variations of the sketches we just saw. To the show's credit, they do put enough variation in the second part to justify watching those sketches again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a solid show, and a show I wish I could recommend to others, but it's a very acquired taste show, not something the average anime fan can walk into and think it's good, it's something that you would probably already know going in how to feel since if you like that more absurd, shitty style of humor, you would've already heard of it.\\n",

            "content": "Let's see... If you are a run of the mill seasonal anime fan you probably will not like this anime. As it has no real plot, character development, narrative, or even minuscule fan service. That being said this is one of the most enjoyable anime I've ever watched since it diverges from these cliches, and one thing PTE is, is original and creative. The first episode is chock full of mainstream references and cameos that any person who hasn't been under a rock for the past ten years will understand. Although as the series go on the references become a bit more obscure to thecommon internet goer. This is where PTE really goes all out and they're not afraid of the consequences with lawsuit enticing impressions and characters ripped straight from their franchise. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is always something to be impressed about. Apart from the 2d skits with Popuko and Pipimi, we have others like Hellshake Yano, and the felt dolls, and PTE tales of old, and of course BET (Bob epic team). These all diverge in art styles and a very creative in how the animators use the medium to tell the nonsensical story. Sound plays very closely along the same lines with the audio changing quality to fit the medium its being used in. Also the changing voice every episode and every 12 min segment is a fresh take on character diversity and really how hearing different voice actors from other terrific anime can really bring these two to life.\\n\\n\r\nPopuko and Pipimi are hilarious as a duo and never have a dull moment together. I believe that Pipimi's passive aggressive attitude and (sometimes) nonchalant reactions fit perfect with Popuko's insane short-temper and bloodlust towards every living creature and (inanimate) that annoys her. They are a great diverge from moe high school SOL high school girls we get every season and I hope we got LOTS more of these two in the future.\\n\\n\r\nI never had a dull moment with this show really. The different skits (after which the episode is titled) are always interesting and different every episode. I think anyone can appreciate all the work and dark humor they fit into twelve minutes because quite frankly it's damn impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like dark, nonsensical, extremely meta humor you will love Pop team epic. Don't go in expecting a plot advancement or anything to really \"happen\". Just be ready to kick back and laugh at the absurdity and moxie this show has. Try not to think about Hellshake yano too much. :3\\n\\n",

If you go into this anime not understanding that, don't even waste your time because you will hate this series.\r\nStory: There isn't one. Not even joking. There are some segments that try hash out a quick self contained story and even that may conclude randomly.\r\nAnimation/Art Design: The art style breaks away from the traditional anime style but also gives so many different variances of styles. This being a mishmashof randomness is also reflected in the animation as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Popuko and Pipimi are the main characters and are the prime focus of the series. They are here to carry along the memeable clusterfuck that is Poputepipikku. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 When i started this series, I was very weirded out by what was going on but I eventually grew into understanding that this anime is not meant to be taken seriously in the same light as something like Fullmetal Alchemist and that's ok. You can have the most out of line, far from left field craziness hurled at you within a 10 minute time frame and still pull some enjoyment out of it.",

            "content": "So Pop Team Epic or Poputepipikku finished leaving me with one word.\r\n\"What\"\r\nWhat prompted me to start watching it was the fact that I recognised the characters from Discord emotes used on some servers so I decided to give it a watch. I know I said that leaving Pop team epic left me with the word \"what\" but it was also what I started with. It started off pretending as another anime which in fact caused me to turn it off thinking I was watching the wrong anime as the website showed its Japanese name and not Pop Team Epic as other sites have been referringit to until I saw someone used it's Japanese name and decided to actually watch it. Needless to say it was the Pop Team Epic that it advertised with the title card being interrupted by Popuko yelling: \"I THINK NOT.\" What then drawn me in was the fact that she had a male voice.\\n\\n\r\nI carried on watching and was then surprised by the references it had in the first 5 minutes. From Your Name, Pokemon, Chrono Trigger, Berserk and even Skyrim. As I watched, I learnt that it was sort of like Robot Chicken in the sense that the episode is made of different sketches, some being more absurd than funny however. Oh and then the episode ended 12 minutes in rolling the credits. Then the episode... started playing again? But then their voices were female. I actually skipped over but then learnt that the male and female runs of the episode had slight differences between them. They were there, believe me.... they're just hard to find and just made me think they did it so they could make them 'longer episodes.'\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simple though at some points they disguised the art as another anime for the purpose of making Popuko and Pipimi look out of place for comedic effect which sometimes worked. Sometimes it became deliberately horrifying for the purpose of the 'Bob team epic' sketches.\\n\\n\r\nNow for enjoyment... that all really comes down to your sense of humour. I did find enjoyment in some sketches but found nothing in others for example there were cooking show sketches that made no sense to me. I know that the show was full to the brim with references but I guess I just didn't know them. \\n\\n\r\nI'm giving it a 6/10 mainly because I found the character designs pretty fun looking and enjoyed some of the sketches like the 'Hellshake Yano' sketch which wasn't actually animated but was instead shot with people holding sketchbooks and flipping through them.",

            "content": "It only took me the first episode to know what exactly in the god damn hell is going on in the start of our 2018. However, because I didn\u2019t read the guidelines, my previous review was removed. Fair point, obviously. I originally thought I can give something for this community by creating a review for an anime that I found incredibly unique but I didn\u2019t put so much effort into it and it made my review look more like a trolling rather than serious reviewing in the end. I\u2019m not going to do the same thing with this one now. I know for sure aseries that has 12 episodes in average has to be reviewed after there are 4 episodes broadcasted, but I feel like I need to make this review even though there are only 2 of them airing right now, noted since Saturday, January 13, 2018. With that being said, here goes nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some real happening in the world of anime caused by a culture most famously known as \u2018memes\u2019,which came from our particular world of cyberspace called \u2018The Internet\u2019. Eventually, due to the massive interference of a certain society in the world wide web, it affects the society of real world. From such, it created what appears to be, which is the main point of our review, Pop Team Epic. Be wary of this anime, for this isn\u2019t your average one. This anime is very absurd, if not surreal.\\n\\n\r\n[MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD due to a lack of informations]\\n\\n\r\nYou might be confused by the first episode and dropped the whole show already with all your might. The first minutes of this Episode One we\u2019re talking about doesn\u2019t even show anything remotely close to the premise of this anime, which needless to say, is pretty much an act of \u2018trolling\u2019. It introduced us with the plot of an ordinary, average everyday high-school boy called Taira Daichi, who has a classmate of a girl called Hoshifuri Sosogu, which little did he know, is a celebrity idol. Judging from the animation and the decent 8/10 opening song, it looks like something quite promising. Lord were we fooled, because only a few minutes later, everything turns into a wreck.\\n\\n\r\nOut of nowhere, the animation is completely changed. The characters, which were previously introduced are not there anymore, and instead being replaced by 2 Chibi girl characters wearing high school uniforms: the short one and the tall one, which both are ridiculously voiced by old men. The anime storytelling format changed into something like 2-minutes-per-episode show, where every single scene is played in every two minutes for no obvious reason. Unfortunately, Pop Team Epic doesn\u2019t tell any particular stories whatsoever and just mocking any other anime references in the running while it got the chance; and even if the format looks like 5-to-10-seconds-per-story, the show is actually a 24-minutes broadcast. It generated another question for us: with the way Pop Team Epic goes, how did they manage to fill in the gap through the second half of the episode? The answer might shock you.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the second half is running, they REPEATED the same scene where Daichi first showed up and introduced. They also repeated the same opening song. What we didn\u2019t expect, however, is how they repeated the same scene where 2 Chibi characters showed up and goofed us up: they goofed us harder. They completely use the same EXACT scenes from the first half, only this time they used different voice acting, originally from a couple of baritone-pitched sailormen into a couple of adult voice actresses. They changed ONLY the voice acting. THAT\u2019S IT. Nothing else. Wikipedia said that Mariana Trench is the deepest and lowest place where humanity can sink into. This anime show is evidently the living proof where we can sink even much lower and further than that.\\n\\n\r\nBob\u2019s Epic Tea \u2026\u2026 I mean, Pop Team Epic, is adapted from 4-cells manga. It doesn\u2019t have that much of a premise, nor a point about the show worths to mention, apart from it\u2019s just about 2 characters having fun. It doesn\u2019t serve any purposes except for the comedy and the comedy itself. There\u2019s nothing critical, philosophical and deep about Pop Team Epic. One must not expect anything from this, neither the viewer nor the anime producer, because it looks like even the anime producer is only doing this just for fun while being carefree about what they\u2019re creating. Reminds me of that anime where the guy keeps parodying everything whenever he got the chance. The guy\u2019s called Gin-san, by the way. That being said, here are my scores for the main elements of this show [to find out my opinion about this show, go to the Enjoyment section]:\\n\\n\r\n                                                 Story: ?/10\\n\r\nTruth be told, there isn\u2019t any form of storytelling here in this. As I mentioned before, Pop Team Epic is about 2 characters having fun, randomly and carefreely. Viewers aren\u2019t meant to think nor are they to comprehend anything that\u2019s going on in this show because this anime is doing everything randomly in order to create laughs. The story setting of Daichi and Sosogu called \u201cHoshiiro Girldrop\u201d is a complete lie, but they keep telling in every episode preview at the end that it\u2019s what we\u2019ll get in the next episode. Also, even if it does tell any stories, it\u2019s only 10 seconds long in average with the longest is variative. The last thing one would expect is for all of those stories to be constructed as a whole. \\n\\n\r\n                                             Character: 4/10\\n\r\nThere are 2 characters you need to pay attention to, and the only ones that matters: Popuko, the yellow-colored ponytail-haired short-tempered short girl; and Pipimi, the purple colored long-haired tall girl. Both has the appearance of a high school girl and wear the usual high-school clothing of sailor-themed uniform, except for one thing: they both talked like sailormen. In episode one, we\u2019re introduced to such characters voiced by such actors as the standard, but that\u2019s not so. Because later on, in the second half, the couple of MC\u2019s voice actors changed into a couple of MC\u2019S voice actresses.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the lack of characters is to be said (mainly there are only 2 of it), both voice actors and actresses did a good job on the voice acting most of the time. They might sound pretty lazy and half-assed  at some point while doing it, but for such a half-assed voice acting, I admit they did a good job because their voice-acting is genuine. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be considered notable at all.\\n\\n\r\n                                           Soundtrack: 6/10\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not to be expected. Surprisingly, Pop Team Epic has a small bag of good OSTs. The Opening song is incredibly catchy, whether it\u2019d be the pop idol-ish song of the deceptive and misleading Hoshiiro Girldrop\u2019s or the electronic ravish Pop Team Epic\u2019s. The same can be said to the Ending song. The opening song of Pop Team Epic sounds like the beginning of something visually chaotic and remarkably unimaginable to be served as a form of comedic relief.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of it, clearly they\u2019re not doing anything desultory. Only the thing is, the amount of song tracks used here is quite a few, but when there is one, they composed and created it very well. Either because the anime doesn\u2019t use background OSTs quite often so they wouldn\u2019t have to create too many song tracks and they can focus in perfecting each and every single tracks (if it actually matters to them just as much, looking by the way this anime is presented to be), or they did it on purpose because they\u2019re just so good at it that they\u2019re lazy.\\n\\n\r\n                                           Animation: 7/10\\n\r\nPop Team Epic has a diverse collection of animations. It\u2019s been proven since the first episode where they played the opening song and introduced the arguably most despicable lie in the history of human, Hoshiiro Girldrop, in which the animation clip is beyond mesmerizing and unbelievable and it\u2019d go without saying that each of the heroines in it have the potential of becoming a waifu material. So much efforts put into that opening that it doesn\u2019t even look like anything remotely close to a farce. Not a lot of people know about this, but it also worths a mention that the people from Kamikaze Douga are the animators of Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure\u2019s opening clips. \\n\\n\r\nFrom then on, every single one of their episodes features a variety of clips, Be it the weirdly disgusting animation skit of Bobunemimimmi or the French live-action skit of Japon Mignon. These kinds of efforts shown is Pop Team Epic\u2019s way of telling the viewers how much they\u2019re absolutely capable of doing in creating this anime by that of a smug. Allegedly, much like how it\u2019s portrayed so far that Pop Team Epic looks like it was made by a group of jerkheads, their animation is primarily a professional-ish 2D consists of chibi-looking characters.\\n\r\n                                         Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is enjoyable subjectively. Some would despise it and spit on it, some would love it to the ground. It actually depends on the comedic taste of each person. There\u2019s a name for the kind of comedy Pop Team Epic has, and it is called \u201cAnti-Humor Comedy\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nAs it is called, Anti-Humor comedy does not intend to serve anything humoric to the audience, which is the very intention of the comedy. It indirectly generates laughing materials to enjoy and thus becomes what considered to be a new type of humor for the audience. Mostly, this kind of comedy gives some particular sign of random surrealism in it. Much of it is incomprehensible and not easy to decipher. However, the audiences are not meant to question \u2018why\u2019. There isn\u2019t anything behind it to find out about and there is no use in pointing out the details for the sake of the enjoyment itself. Instead, what they need to do is to question \u2018what\u2019, as opposed to \u2018what is the purpose of them doing this?\u2019 but to \u2018what the heck are they think they\u2019re doing?\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nExamples could be found in the infamous western TV shows such as Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus and The Eric Andre Show. As it premises, almost everything in the show is a part of incomprehensible comedy skits instead of showing any tiny fabric of genuine reality. If we are to take examples from well-known anime, the closest one we could ever get would be Nichijou. The only thing that excludes it from being an Anti-Humor is how any elements in Nichijou is actually quite relatable to us, be it from the characters interactions to each other or the story settings, which makes it \u201cSurreal Comedy\u201d. The similarity of Surreal comedy to Anti-Humor comedy makes Surreal comedy the best foundation to relate to. Despite the similar absurdities, however, Surreal comedy is still understandable and easily laughable to the majority of audience due to the built associations between them and the show. Pop Team Epic obviously shows a huge gap between itself and that.\\n\\n\r\nThey also did many parodying. They parodied  a typical pop idol anime by using fake opening song and intro of one , which is later on to be known as Hoshiiro Girldrop.It doesn\u2019t just stop there, because they parodied many anime shows after that as if it doesn\u2019t care how many 4th walls they break and the consequences of it. Just in episode one, they already parodied and made many references such as Kimi no Na Wa, Pokemon, Berserk, Totoro, and Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThese kinds of comedies are very minor and unpopular because of the incomprehensibility and the nonsenseness of it. Needless to say, Pop Team Epic created a very good one and I\u2019m gladly willing to give this show\u2019s rate of Enjoyment a strong 9/10, for its mutifariousness of anti-humoric jokes and liberties of parodying. However, I have to be objective for the readers of my review. Which is why I can give this 8/10. That's as low as I can get.\\n\\n\r\n                                           Overall: 7.5/10\\n\r\nIn this modern society of 21st century, men-children and women-fujoshis, wherever they are, all participate in it. We live in the very age of raising awareness to infinite possibilities where everything can work. A businessman could become a leader in a country of power, nerds can have friends and become filthy rich, and people can trash each others and talk smack from far far away using the so-called \"Discord Voice Chat\" to establish a person as that of a lisped Ethiopian retard. Eventually, it created Pop Team Epic in the middle of it. This anime is created from memes. It\u2019s stupid, unforgivable, unacceptable, nonsensical, idiotic, abusive, derogative, absolutely low, disrespectful, stupid, world-tier threatening, brain-consuming, carcinogenic, tumoric, hemorrhagic and a source of agoraphobic existential crisis. Have I mentioned that this anime is also stupid?\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, I\u2019m feeling lucky and thankful.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m feeling lucky to start my 2018 with something out of the norm such as Pop Team Epic. It doesn\u2019t want to follow other formulas of comedy anime like Osomatsu-san or Gintama. It\u2019s not afraid to be different. It really wants to stand out as the center of attention like an attention whore it is. It holds a megaphone in hand while butt-naked, being watched by everyone including women and children, and shouts: \u201cI\u2019m f****** retarded!\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m feeling thankful that, after many many ecchi-harem anime later (looking at you, To-Love-Ru and DxD), I finally can have something so special that I can personally look back to and said: \u201cThis is absolutely memorable and historical because it\u2019s not like any others. I shall keep and preserve it\u201d. I could never begin to imagine at any moment that it\u2019d be something I\u2019d grin to, smile to or laugh to.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, we all laugh to our stories and everything that\u2019s around. Whether it\u2019d be about the TV show we watched or about the times when we\u2019re feeling down in high school. The real question is: \u201cwill it be a sad laugh or a heartful laugh?\u201d\\n",

They have names, but that doesn't really matter. This show was very hyped this season. Mostly because of the various memes coming out of it even before its announcement. You know those two girls, one with blue hair, and the one with orange hair but shorter then the other? Both flipping you off? That's what I'm talking about with this show. Just like what we started off with, this show is more of that. This show is like watching memes. There isa lot of different styles in this show, many of which are one offs. These can range to very creative, to very disgusting, but that's depending on what you like. It also gets very meta with itself, depicting references to other things as well as itself. I should also mention that there are effectively 2 versions of the show. There is a version where the girls are voice acted by girls, and another version where the girls are voice acted by men. Just to keep in mind when it plays twice and you don't know why. This adds to the absurdity.\\n\\n\r\nThere are multiple reasons I don't enjoy myself when watching this show. But it mainly boils down to the, \"watching memes\" portion I mentioned earlier. I don't like to watch random absurdity without any structure behind it. One segment is very different from the last. I understand that many people like this sort of thing, but I, for one, do not. In the later episodes, there is a sort of a story within it, which is the only part of the show I enjoy. But after that one off story is over, then it goes back to what it was doing before. Memes. I give Poputepipikku 3 out of 10. I hate it personally, but the greater masses will enjoy it I'm sure. So I recommend it to everyone that likes random things thrown at them. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Poputepipikku.",

            "content": "If you've read Poputepipikku turn up the comedy by a few notches, if you haven't you are not missing much going into the anime.\r\nThe comedy is as mindless as it looks, most skits are short but just about every single one is a reference to pop culture/anime/video games/memes/etc. Some jokes went over my head but still got a chuckle out of me, I imagine everyone felt this way while watching Poputepipikku. Where the show shines in over the 4-panel manga is the animation. Many different studios work on various skits ranging from nicely drawn, poorly drawn, CGI, live acting, and even puppets. The episodes areshort and end at the half-way mark the rest is a re-run with different voice actors (Female first, male second). Some lines are written differently and some skits are done entirely different, so expect to see a gif or two online of a scene you may not recognize as it could have been from the second half of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Poputepipikku isn't terrible if you consume a decent amount of Japanese culture, as you will pick up on some of the jokes. If anything it's a good anime to use for killing time since they're short.",

            "content": "\"Pop Team Epic is greentext turned into anime\"\r\n-Jos\u00e9 Altozano\r\nI'm an arts student. My college education gave me a greater insight of visual media as I returned to anime once again after six years away from it. If I had to make an art analogy of Pop Team Epic, it would be the Jackson Pollock of anime. Pop Team Epic CANNOT be reviewed by the conventional standards of anime because it's an unconventional anime. Trying to talk about \"story\" or \"characters\" in PTE would be like trying to analyze structure, use of color or linear narrative in a Joan Mir\u00f3 painting. It's like saying modern artis bad because even a child can do it. Well, do it then.\\n\\n\r\nPop Team Epic consists of various short sketches made by different studios or creators, and one longer sketch that gives the episode its title. This is not adapting a four panel manga. This is bringing the world together through humor, referential and/or meta; through various styles and creators. Pop Team Epic is about bringing anime to everyone, getting over foreign publishers and shake Hell itself. In a world where anime is becoming mainstream, Pop Team Epic offers itself to the world, not by Netflix or social commentaries, but by what bring us together in the first place: The Internet. Shitposts, absurd, referential, meta humor. None of us would be in this site without the Internet. And neither would be Pop Team Epic. Just look at the opening, where Popuko and Pipimi spin, changing into outfits of various eras and countries.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Pop Team Epic is a declaration of intentions in a new era for anime, defying its own medium, aware of the coming future. It will never be a masterpiece, maybe it won't be remembered, but it's an anime ahead of its time, and I will defend its intentions to the end. Mark my words, one day there will be an anime that will be what Pop Team Epic tried to be, but only because the world will be ready for it. But as long as there are people who underestimate it for being unconventional, we won't be ready.",

The 'Bob Team Epic' thing shouldve never been in the series in the first place. First of all:\r\n-The really sketchy, rushed art style doesn't make it any funnier, it makes it a pain to watch.\r\n-The awkward voice acting doesn't help\r\n- It's cringey, nowhere even close to funny.\r\nIts basically a complete mess- the clips and stories don't really fit together sometimes- if you wantit to flow actually link references, etc. \\n\r\nThe way they tried too hard on the story line is quite appalling- even a basic, slice of life-like story line with a some over-exaggeration would've been effective.\\n\\n\r\nIts a shame because the manga was actually pretty funny- yet they pretty much ruined it.",

I love how they don\u2019t just stick to one style, animation wise. Sometimes they use a fine and neat style and other times, the style is a little sloppy and messy looking like when they do the \u201cBob Epic Team\u201d\r\nThe first episode totally put me off, though! It kinda tricks you into thinking it\u2019s a completely different show then it cuts that all off and then that\u2019s when the weird starts!\r\nI think everyonewill enjoy this one!",
