            "content": "When I started watching this show I couldn\u00b4t help noticing how much similarities between this series and, the hugely popular, Elfen Lied existed. Both were a story about girls that were trapped in an investigation facility, that ended up escaping and then they find a really nice guy who ended up helping them, because, you know, he is THAT nice.\r\nI really wasn\u00b4t much of a fan of Elfen Lied but I gave this show an opportunity anyway, and for the first couple of episodes it wasn\u00b4t that much of a disappointment. Of course, while I was watching the first episodes, which I thought were prettydecent, I forgot that both Elfen Lied and this series are by the same author, Lynn Okamoto, and it seems that he doesn\u00b4t have the ability to learn from her mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show began pretty well in my opinion presenting us with a serious and dark story, and even if it is unoriginal, it is of my belief that an unoriginal story done the right way, can be a really enjoyable show to watch. We get presented to our main characters Murakami and Kuroha, and we also get presented to Kana afterwards in the second episode. I thought the mystery was nicely done and it kept me going back to this show week after week.\\n\\n\r\nI thought Murakami was, at first, a really decent protagonist, he was pretty smart and could formulate some desperate but effective plans to get out of the dangerous situations he got into, but as series went on he ended up being only that REALLY nice guy, who is willing to sacrifice his life for saving others, and then end up being saved by some Deus ex-Machina, because, you know, he is the protagonist. But I will get back to the Deus ex- Machina later.\\n\r\nKuroha was pretty much the typical childhood friend main love interest, she wasn\u00b4t really annoying but she wasn\u00b4t the greatest of the characters either, she didn\u00b4t have much personality either, apart from being the \"I think I\u00b4m in love with the protagonist\" character.\\n\r\nKana was also a so-so character, her personality is pretty much like the typical tsundere, again not really annoying but not great either.\\n\\n\r\nThen another character, Kazumi, got presented and there is when the show took  downward spiral, because around episode four, when they were just in the end of a really serious scene, the scene afterwards, suddenly, out of nowhere, we got fanservice and comedy, and that really took a hit on the show. The sudden changes between serious and light-hearted with comedy and fanservice avoided me from having the ability to take this show seriously. How can I get invested in a dark and serious story if they are trying to get me horny at the same time?\\n\r\nThe main problem here is Kazumi, which is probably the second worst character of the series, she is a pervert that is constantly firting with the main protagonist, Murakami, and is the cause of most of the fanservice scenes that can screw an episode on it\u00b4s entirety.\\n\r\nThis got repeated almost every episode which really made me want to drop this show sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThen in the final episodes that\u00b4s where the REAL nosedive kicks in, as we get presented to other girls, I will focus only in the most important, as the others don\u00b4t really have that much screentime, and aren\u00b4t really interesting. This is where Kotori gets presented. Kotori is the most annoying character of the series following the \"Big tits shy girl\" archetype, and all she really does in the series is saving Murakami from lethal situation, because she has the most useful power, and the other thing she does is stutter, A LOT, it\u00b4s really annoying.\\n\r\nAfter that the show starts to use Deus ex-Machinas a lot of the time with the objective of saving Murakami, pretty much defying physics, logic and human anatomy in the process, it seems as if someone thought I\u00b4m stupid and I wouldn\u00b4t notice this things.\\n\\n\r\nIn the art department nothing much really stands out. The character designs are normal and the color palette is pretty generic. Is constant and it doesnt\u00b4t really take any nosedive, I will give them that, but this is studio ARMS we\u00b4re talking about, they have never been in the peak of digital animation, and with this show, they failed to prove that the can do something actually decent. Apart from that the artwork is just above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, apart from the first OP is pretty forgettable, with nothing much really standing out. I can\u00b4t really judge the voice acting since I don\u00b4t speak japanese, but if there\u00b4s one voice that really annoys me, is Kotori\u00b4s, her loud voice and constant stuttering almost drive me insane.\\n\r\nThe first OP however is quite a piece, is an instrumental techno theme mixed with vocal choirs, and it was that glimmer of hope that made me thought that this show would redeem itself eventually, until it was replace by a death metal song by Fear, and loathing in Las Vegas, which not only didn\u00b4t fit the show, it was badly synchronised with the OP\u00b4s animation. Who had the brilliant idea to change the opening!? I will make sure he suffers when I kill him.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment on the show was ruined by the aforementioned light-hearted comedy and fanservice that doomed this show, and if you add the aforementioned Deus ex-Machina, and what is easily one of the worst ending that I have ever seen, you will have me trying to destroy my head with a shotgun.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Judgement:\\n\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr started with a pretty decent note, and then it entered a downward spiral, teaching me a valuable lesson: \"Never watch an ARMS anime adaptation of a Lynn Okamoto\u00b4s manga ever again.\". Really, does Okamoto even learn from his mistakes? Or he has his head so full of \"Elfen Lied is a masterpiece\" that he just had to write the same thing with the same problems again, adding an alien twist to it?\\n\r\nIt\u00b4s characters range from the forgettable to the utterly annoying, it\u00b4s story cannot be taken seriously due to the amount of stupid comedy and fanservice that it has, added to a shitty ending and Deus ex-Machinas. The art and sound departments are only above average.\\n\r\nA show that ended up being a complete disappointment and is not recommended for those looking something good this season.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been The Neko and I hope that you found this review helpful and that you have a pleasant day, night, or whatever.\\n\r\nThis adorable kitty is leaving the scene.",

            "content": "**UPDATE** Damn this anime is getting bad reviews xD I get that it's similar to Elfen Lied (that's one of my favs) But you should never heavily compare the two even if it is by the same person who wrote it. \r\nThis isn't Elfen Lied. This is a completely different anime. Jeezz people.\r\nHarem & Sci-fi; weird combination, right? But this anime makes it work. I'm usually not a huge harem fan, but this one is a win in my book. Probably because it's not heavily focused on it. I didn't actually expect to like this anime so much. Whether it was the summary or justa feeling; I was wrong. This just blew my expectations!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10- This anime. Wow. Brynhildr has a way of making you think a little. You don't know what's coming next, and when you do, it's twisted into something completely different. Suspense is a high factor in this anime, and it makes it great! There are so many parts you don't expect, but it happens. It could be a funny, perverted scene or a character death. The story never fails to keep you on the edge of your seat!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10- The animation was great. The colors were the basic \"Sci-fi\" type of feel. Nothing is too colorful or bubbly, but more of a darker feel. Which is what you want in an anime like this. Overall fairly simple but pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10- I do admire the OPs very much. The first one was just mysterious music with interesting animation to follow. It really draws you in. the second one isn't probably for everyone since it is almost a metal type. But if you like that genre, than you'll like it too! And the ED is surprisingly cheerful. Which is nice if you have such a dramatic episode. Overall, the music ties everything together.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10- In a mystery themed anime you never really know what to expect in development. But I thought each character had a decent background. Some of the supporting ones are left unchecked, but that's to be expected. The main characters on the other hand, have just enough development that you want to know more about them, but you already have knowledge of them. So it leaves you with more questions than answers, but that's all part of the game, right? >;3\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10- I was about 4 episodes behind before I caught up last week, but woah. This anime hits a home run in everything you expect it to. It shows mystery, hell, the ending definitely does. It's about witches, and as childish as it sounds, the fantasy factor of this anime is anything but child's play. But of course, it is sci-fi themed! The drama will leave you wanting to continue watching to see what happens next. Though there are the perverted scenes, it doesn't seem to fail to make you smile or laugh! In all, this anime was great & probably will only grow in fam ^^ [But at this rate with all the terrible reviews, I'm not so sure]\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10- Loved it and hope many others will agree :3 [they don't lol] But hey, there's over 100 chapters in the manga. So I can only assume another season is heading are way, don't you think? ;)",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this:\r\nI do not like to talk down about anime. I an usually incredibly unbiased and I have an appreciation for every anime released... to some extent.\r\nI don't like to be negative and I don't like to write reviews that could sound hurtful to some people. But with Brynhildr, there is a problem. The problem is that I cannot understand why there are little-to-no contrasting opinions on this anime yet. Everything I've seen/read so far has been generally positive and praising the anime. I don't get it... isn't that unnatural? It's not that great...is it?\r\nNo, it's not. There must besome kind of brainwashing going on here because this is NOT what it's hyped up to be. I have never been so heartbroken by an anime until I started Brynhildr. As early as episode 2 it was already kicking me in the shins. I'm writing this review to protect the rest of you who are anything like me from wasting your time on something that isn't what people say it is.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nWith a writer like Lynn Okamoto (Elfen Lied), I had expectations that this would be a tightly nit, well presented masterpiece with clever and artistic references to various lore and culture. Well... it does that... sort of... but Brynhildr lays it on a bit too thick and really has no idea what it wants to be. I've never seen a story change direction and pace as often and randomly as this. It's way too distracting going from a dark, mysterious, bloodbath, to a cheesy fan-service episode in the next minute like nothing even happened.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of this anime's praise comes from the loyal fans who read the manga. While I haven't read the manga, I can assure you that what they say is true about \"The manga is great! You should read it!\" However... that doesn't change the fact that this is an absolute mess of an adaptation. I haven't read the manga personally, but I can tell this anime has already skipped way too much explanation and jumped to highlights for theatrical effect. With that comes a completely dislodged story line, rapidly introduced characters with little exposition, and a story that just feels cluttered and difficult to follow. It truly is a disaster and I don't know why even the manga fans can't agree that this is not what it was intended to be.\\n\\n\r\nNow maybe you like a story that's got witches and aliens and pharmaceuticals, and sci-fi... and astronomy.... and... happy-go-lucky fanservice, and molesting defenseless paralyzed girls... oh.. and freaking mouth lasers!!! But honestly if they picked ONE concept and stuck with it, this story could have been significantly better. Tasteless is all I can say.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here about the art. It's mediocre. It's not bad but it's definitely not a selling feature. If there's on thing I can compliment, it's that the very median color palette sits right in the middle for the show's dark, bloody aspects and absurd silliness the very next instant. It is exactly average. And it is exactly the kind of hint that what you're getting into is not anything special. At least it's not misleading you by looking absolutely stunning and then delivering a garbage plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nSound effects here and there are sketchy. I hear a decent amount of recycled effects in this anime from cats to gunshots that really don't have a strong feel to them. The music may be the only saving grace with a unique and catchy dubstep-esque OP song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nI really don't want to rant too long about the characters, but all I can say is they are all extremely shallow and not developed enough. They introduce so many characters in the short time this anime is allotted so nobody gets the exposition they deserve. Not even the main character has a convincing back story or motivation for anything that he does involving the characters surrounding him.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the only characters that feel genuine are the girl who's incredibly perverted and lusty. given her short life-expectation I can understand the psychology that would drive her to those decisions. And the paralyzed girl. I'm sure if she could walked, she would've have ditched the other girls by now and found some better friends who don't take advantage of her disability. She seems like the only character who understands the situations that arise, but nobody will give her the credit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nI don't drop anime, ever. I always see it to the end no matter what. But this show tempted me so hard and so early on that I nearly left it at episode 2. As of now, I've only seen 9 episodes, but I plan to finish it out as scheduled. But I don't think these remaining 4 episodes will be strong enough to pull this anime out of the deep hole it's already dug itself into. I can't be swayed any other direction, no matter how amazing the ending might be. I really do not enjoy watching this and I don't see how so many people can claim it's the best of the season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/5\\n\r\nOkay seriously. For me to write a negative review (especially before even completing an anime) is a bad sign. It means something is up. You don't have to agree with my words, but I want you guys to see the other side of the spectrum when all I see is constant glorification for Brynhildr. I simply isn't justified honor. I know there are people out there with similar taste to me and I'm writing this to protect you. I have a group of 5 friends that all watch anime together and we all agree that this is an utter waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nLike me or not, that is what I have to say. I rarely offer my negative opinions, but this needed to be said.\\n\r\nIf you agree with me, I'd greatly appreciate voting this review for helpfulness. If not, I'm sorry I offended you, but there really is no room to only leave positive feedback on something that is clearly not what it's hyped-up to be. Thanks.",

            "content": "I thought overall this was a pretty good series and deserves a decent rating. Not a perfect one but a decent one. I think it suffers most from failing to meet peoples expectations than it does from the product itself. Yes it was rushed but that doesn't make it terrible.\r\nFirst off this isn't Elfen Lied. Yes it's by the same author and has various similarities but it's not meant to be a duplicate and doesn't necessarily appeal to the same crowd. This isn't even really a horror/gore series, Inuyasha had more gore and it isn't considered a gore series. Brynhildr is primarily a dark dramawith light comedy(despite not being tagged comedy).\\n\\n\r\nSecond this series was admittedly rushed and if you read the manga you would have been disappointed that they skipped a significant amount of storyline and character development. Would this series have been better if it was 24 episodes and stuck to the manga? Absolutely, I'd probably be giving it a 10 if that were the case.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the writers perspective it's a toss-up if you were sure you weren't going to get a second season would it be better to make a developed series that stops halfway or a rushed series that's complete. Hard to say, but what I can say is that I've seen complete series that weren't nearly as well developed as this and they weren't getting ratings of 2.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the storyline itself. The basic plot is fairly generic, MC protecting a group of girls from an evil organization of course it has it's own spin on this. Nothing really great or bad there. I do think the blending of comedy and drama was one of the strengths in this series, some may think it was a waste of time in an already rushed series, but that's part of character development. It's the light-hearted comedy moments that endear you to the characters so you actually give a crap when they're about to get killed later. I've seen people complain on other series that all the friends do is rescue each other when they're in danger and never actually have fun so why are they friends to begin with? That's why this series tries to show that they have happy times when they're not fighting to survive. They're lives aren't constant fighting and carnage. If you're looking for nonstop action and gore than your better of watching Deadman Wonderland.\\n\\n\r\nI will say the series had a bit more fanservice than was necessary though I find that to be the case in a lot of series. I thought Murakami was a good lead better than 80% of the MCs I see. He wasn't Lelouch but he was one of the intelligent strategist types and was fairly courageous and competent. Neko was pretty weak and generic overall unfortunately and didn't get much development. I did like Kana and Kazumi in particular both were fairly interesting and had some development. Kazumi in particular lost a lot of development from the manga but still ended up getting more than Neko. Hatsuna on the other hand was introduced at the end and got almost no development. Kotori was pretty annoying, even in the manga, I tend to think the writers didn't bother with her development (for reasons that would be apparent if you watched the series).\\n\\n\r\nThe villains were pretty interesting a stoic mad-scientist trying to play god and a psychotic yandere. Not unprecedented but still intimidating enough to take seriously and a still a better motive than the standard world domination.\\n\\n\r\nI though the art was pretty good again nothing new and amazing but still better than a lot of series. The opening song was a favorite of mine and I thought it fit the series perfectly though the second seemed pretty random and didn't work as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you ignore the manga this is still a good series worth watching, it won't necessarily make your top 10 but its a solid series and still better than most of the stuff out there.\\n\r\nIf you have seen the series I would highly recommend reading the manga because it does have much better pacing and development and very well may make your top 10",

            "content": "From the writers of the famous anime, Elfen Lied, they present you \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\", in my opinion, a failure of an anime for the ages. Have you ever seen an anime that tries to encompass romance, ecchi, psychological, horror, magic action, schi-fi, drama, mystery, and fantasy all in one and fails miserably? Well, look no further, Gokukoku no Brynhildr is certainly one of those anime. One of Gokukoku's many problems was that it couldn't decide which direction they wanted to go with the anime: was it going to be a mystery with love? Or an anime filled with psychological traumas/problems? Or an anime filledwith magic action? Or just a pure ecchi series?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around a simple boy named Ryouta Murakami, who has a photographic memory. As a child, he was in love with his friend, Neko Kuroha who believed in aliens, and claimed to have met them. But Kuroha dies in an accident trying to save Murakami. Filled with guilty, Murakami promises himself not to fall in love with anyone other than his first love and also to find proof of the existence of aliens because of a promise he had made with Kuroneko prior to her death. Then fast forward to the present, and one day, a new transfer student comes to his class, who not only looks a lot like Kuroha Neko, but is named Kuroha Neko and to add onto that, she saves Murakami with magical powers. It turns out that Kuroha along with Kuroha's alliance witches are run-a-way witches who were created by a mysterious organization. These witches need strange pills (that only the organization has) in order to survive, or else their skin melts/spews out blood and they die. Oh, did I mention that the organization is sending other more powerful witches to hunt down the run-a-way witches? Therefore Murakami, who wants to protect Kuroha Neko (and also the other run-a-way witches) in order to find out of Kuroha Neko really is the Kuroha Neko he knew as a child, gets entangled into a witch hunt down death chase.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this type of anime not my favorite to begin with, Gokukoku no Brynhildr really made me cringe. First off, so many unanswered questions. Why did the organization create these witches? No idea. Why did the organization want to hunt them down then? No idea. Okay... Then what was the point of the anime? Um, there was none? I mean it's basically another story that has a few glimpses of terrible, boring magic battle scenes, that shows 2-3 witches swinging their arms around, creating huge explosions, with the addition of Murakami being hit on by all sorts of different girls (witches). I absolutely despise ecchi, and Gokukoku no Brynhildr, a supposedly horror, mysterious anime had tons of it. I don't even want to talk about the ending, because there was no climax, the ending made absolutely no sense, and most importantly, it was unsatisfying to say the least. Overall, the plot jumped around too much, without having a focus point leading to it's messy demise. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't dislike the characters as much as the plot because there was 1 or 2 interesting side characters. But the anime sort of threw out random characters out of nowhere, and then got rid of them just as fast. There was no depth to any characters, except maybe Murakami and Kuroha (but not really). The characters were your average ecchi anime characters. There was the main male character who is an perverted boy that is kind towards other female characters, no matter who they are, therefore causing the other girls to fall in love with him. The main female character who is beautiful, yet reluctant to admit her feelings of the main character. The short, funny, flat-chested female character who messes around the main character (Kazumi, the one character I liked). And, obviously the big-boobed dumb, high pitched voice character that the main character is tempted to \"touch\". The villain and the mysterious organization were nothing really; there was no explanation of them. The entire anime gives us perhaps a 1 minute flashback of the antagonists past that explains absolutely nothing of his intentions or reasons. What happened to the organization in the end? No idea, they just suddenly were dropped at the end of the story, when they were the whole \"mysterious\" focus. And.. in conclusion, I really dislike anime where they make the characters all have different hair color to distinguish upon them; it usually shows the art team's lack of effort to drawing up diversely looking characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay, but it didn't fit the mood of the anime. The anime was supposed to be a horror, mystery anime that maybe had a glimpse of romance between the 2 main characters, yet the art was so colorful, bright, and \"romantic\". I know that some people like the Gokukoku no Brynhildr openings, but I personally did not like the openings, because of it's VERY high pitched dub-step kind of music (1st opening was okay). There is no other worth mentioning soundtrack in the anime. The voicing cast did a decent job, hence giving sound a 5 rating, despite it's lack of any good music.\\n\\n\r\nIn a simple conclusion: I wouldn't recommend this anime to really anyone.",

            "content": "Second chances are not to be wasted, and this is no exception to the anime industry. VAP, Inc. and Arms Corporation took another shot at bringing one of Lynn Okamoto\u2019s works to the big screen and blew its potential once again. Gokukoku no Brynhildr introduces an intriguing mystery and new concept of witches that have a promising start but resulted in something unforgivable with ridiculous plot devices. Because of the eerie OP and attractive plot, it is easy to expect a well-done mystery with proper supernatural aspects. Instead, there are incompetent characters, sorry excuses for villains, and poor pacing that leads to plotholes and alack of character development.\\n\\n\r\nGokukoku\u2019s initial mystery escalates into the supernatural, appearing as something to look forward to. The plot seems suspenseful with a unique concept for witches, who have different powers and live in fear of melting. Unforeseen circumstances brought interest. The characters had their own distinct personalities and unfortunate histories to give high hopes for the story. It was those elements that made me fall for Gokukoku in the beginning, but the show took a turn for the worst. The story became heavily predictable with the same pattern as expected from a harem that consists of a gullible and overly caring male protagonist (Murakami). A so-called powerful witch appears, and Murakami feels the need to persuade her to join the group 90% of the time. This eliminates the potential for suspense and becomes disinteresting. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is so rushed and vague that it ruins the outcome of the mysteries. New info about the MCs is revealed near the end, leaving little time for the viewer to take it all in. A character is supposed to have indestructible powers, but the power is either never shown or is unimpressive with no terrifying element. New characters appear out of nowhere before the current characters have any time to develop. Despite the sudden and distressful situations, there\u2019s no chance to feel sympathy for characters. The finale is extremely disappointing, especially for someone looking forward to a solved mystery. There are several questions left unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing distracts itself with fanservice, resulting in making Murakami a typical love interest. A love triangle develops and creates a silly jealousy game. Virgin talk and awkward erotic moments make the show irresistibly a sight for sore eyes. This withdraws any hope for possible romance within the mystery between Murakami and Neko. The harem aspect is understandable considering the witches' sob stories and dreams of living life as normal human beings instead of experiments. Their interactions with each other and teamwork were enjoyable, especially during drastic moments. However, this progresses into awful characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast made this sci-fi production a complete failure. Villains do not fit the description of someone evil. When they can easily defeat the MCs, they make illogical choices as an excuse to work out in the favor of the protagonist. The majority of the witches introduced as formidable turns out to be harmless. The other characters\u2019 emotions are ridiculous for a serious plot. Either they\u2019re trying too hard to react to a situation or they just don\u2019t care. They sometimes act so calm, cool, and collected that the story doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. They go as far as faking a death with the evidence right beside them. Also, Murakami apparently has such solid gold talents and abilities that he\u2019s invincible to various attacks. One witch became nothing but a dues ex machina character, giving Murakami outside info to further the objective. At that point, the show appears silly and tiring to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent but doesn't help in terms of the story. Character design is fine, and it's good for distinguishing the witches' special features. Some things don\u2019t follow up in the artwork, including the witches standing out as the only students without uniforms. Thanks to a scene with characters using red paint as fake blood, there\u2019s no differentiation between the color of blood and red paint. What\u2019s worse for a series that tries to be all bloody and mysterious? Censorship. So if you want to see a witch melt to the fullest degree, just watch the Wizard of Oz. The animation and action scenes are good, but it becomes pointless to enjoy with the rushed pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST and sound effects are good, but the poor story and characters cause it be plain. Apart from being misleading with the bloody scenes and action, the first OP song is good and a personal favorite. The background music occurred during fighting scenes that ended with characters making stupid moves, so it\u2019s not so memorable. They changed the OP song into a rock song by the 10th episode with the same suspense and action as the first one. By that time, the show is predictable enough to lose any hope of improvement. Characters\u2019 phony reactions disappoint long-awaited moments for mysteries. This is noticeable for scenes that should be highly emotional. Technically, there\u2019s nothing else to say about the seiyuu. Since it becomes normal for wicked witches to develop into sensitive little girls, the changes in their tones fit the script. \\n\\n\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr has countless problems that makes it forgettable. The characters don\u2019t act realistically to situations. The villains make irresponsible decisions that lessens the suspense within the show. More time spent on fanservice than the mysteries results in quick pacing, lack of character development, and a horrible ending. It is a huge disappointment for an interesting mystery. Despite how much VAP and Arms ruined Gokukoku's potential, Lynn Okamoto created an excellent story. Therefore, I recommend reading the manga for better characterization and outcomes.",

            "content": "\u201cJust shut up and show me your armpits\u201d\r\nHaving that as an important and plot relevant quote during the first episode of a show should be more than enough to tell you what you're going to be dealing with for the next 13 episodes. Gokukoku no Brynhildr does not disappoint in that regard. You are treated to a full season worth of ridiculous shenanigans, colorful characters, and downright nonsensical plot devices. Watching this show with your brain turned off is highly suggested since trying to comprehend everything in a logical fashion may turn you into a pile of goo. People who come into this show expectingwell thought out characters and a coherent plot are quite naive in my opinion. One just has to look at the original creator's previous works to understand where it all comes from. \\n\\n\r\nFlashback to 2004...the economy is doing well, we have a strong Republican in the White House, and things seem to moving in the right direction. However, 2004 was also the year that a rather infamous anime aired. Elfen Lied was its name and it has been well known ever since for its excessive usage of nudity, gore, and over the top drama.  Even today it is still discussed by edgy teens and casual anime viewers due to its ridiculousness. Surprisingly, the creator of that has gotten yet another anime adaption. However, unlike Elfen Lied, Gokukoku no Brynhildr lacks much of the over the top drama and suggestive themes. The lack of fetish pandering is another peculiar aspect of this show (provided you don't like armpits), it was highly prevalent in Elfen Lied and is a mainstay in Studio ARMS shows. However, Gokukoku no Brynhildr featured almost none of it. What was also shown was incredibly tame and certainly intended for the more modern TV regulations. In a sense, that would seem to be a huge benefit to the show, but in reality it drags it down to something a bit more plain and mediocre. Skipping out on excessive fanservice or gore in a show like this is a mistake in my opinion since it doesn't have anything else pulling the weight, the usage of cheap tricks such as exploding heads or gratuitous pantyshots are required. Regardless, the story of Gokukoku no Brynhildr shares many likenesses to that of the creator's previous work in the vein of it being young girls with supernatural powers and a shadowy organization behind it all. This is nothing new or groundbreaking so it should be overlooked since it quickly changes from being a backdrop to a main focus in the story throughout the show. Therefore, the story of the show is easily by far the weakest point. It ranges from ridiculous to downright terrible throughout each episode. As previously mentioned, turning your brain off is something that is highly suggested since you can actually enjoy the other parts of the show if you're not focusing on the gaping plot holes and terrible pacing. \\n\\n\r\nIn many cases, characters can make or break a show and in the case of Gokukoku no Brynhildr, they are the one thing holding the show together. The entire cast is likable in their own ways and the interactions between them are enjoyable to watch. However, this does not mean they are without flaws. The characters themselves are poorly thought out and their actions turn the majority of the show into an unintentional comedy. The viewer is often treated to situations where the characters act in downright idiotic ways which can be quite frustrating at times. Regardless, there is a strange sense of charm with the character interactions and it is largely enjoyable. However, as previously stated, the viewer should try to ignore the majority of the plot related character interactions and just focus on the ridiculous shenanigans if you want to enjoy yourself. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to art and sound, Gokukoku no Brynhildr does not stand out in any way. The art feels a bit dated and lacks in detail, most likely due to a mix of budgetary concerns and the source material itself. It is rather inoffensive though and it is on par with what one would expect from a Studio ARMS anime Curiously though, the fanservice that is prominent in ARMS shows is lacking in this show. As previously mentioned, the smut levels have been certainly turned down compared to Elfen Lied and that surprisingly detracts from the overall viewership experience. In addition, the art somehow feels less detailed and cheaper in this more modern show which in itself reinforces the mediocre aura that this anime has. In terms of sound, the seiyuu do a good job in their respective roles and the OST is on point. The sound is something that I will not complain about since it completely acceptable. However, there was a strange change in the opening song starting from episode 10. Some people may dislike hearing the Japanese equivalent of Attack Attack or The Devil Wears Prada, which is completely understandable since can hardly be considered music. For me, it reminded me of the wonderful mid 2000s where I hung around Hot Topic and had glow in the dark pants so I didn't mind it nearly as much. \\n\\n\r\nSaying that you enjoyed something is a tricky situation. Despite all of its glaring flaws, I will admit that I enjoyed Gokukoku no Brynhildr (up until the last episode at least). I probably enjoyed it more than I should have since I actually looked forward to watching it each week. It is certainly a guilty pleasure type show and I would imagine that many other people have a similar opinion of it. I found it to be incredibly funny in parts and the characters were very entertaining. The show was nothing spectacular in any sense, but it was very entertaining even if it was for the wrong reasons. However, if someone asked me if I would recommend watching this show, I would grit my teeth and say no. In the end, memorable shows are either famous or infamous. Gokukoku no Brynhildr is neither of those, I am sure it will be forgotten rather quickly. It just doesn't have enough going for it, negative or positive, to make a mark on the viewer for better or for worse. If you are looking for a coherent sci-fi anime or one with gratuitous fanservice, there are much better options out there.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVEIW**\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr, or \"Bryhildr in the Darkness\", is a Spring 2014 anime brought to us by Lynn Okamoto, the writer of Elfen Lied (which I'll be making a lot of comparisons to), but anyone who has seen Elfen Lied probably would have been able to guess that pretty easily. Why? Because while both of these shows have some great ideas, they are both equally inept when it comes to the concept of tone. They both think that they can show an upbeat fanservice scene centered around jiggling boobs and a brutal/disturbing bloodbath within 2 minutes of each other and act as ifthe transition was seemless. GnB has an interesting story concept and looked to be on the right track at first, but its complete lack of direction prevents it from becoming a good anime; it doesn't know if it wants to be dark and disturbing or happy and upbeat nor does it know what direction it wants to take its plot.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: The story opens with a flashback centered around the protagonist, Murakami, and his infatuation with a girl named Kuroneko, who has an obsession with finding proof that aliens are real. A tragic accident occurs and Kuroneko dies while Murakami is left seriously wounded in the hospital. Years go by and Murakami dedicates himself to finding proof of the existence of aliens in honor of his dead friend. Then, one day, a new transfer student comes to his class, who not only looks a lot like Kuroneko, but is named Kurohaneko. Even though she insists on never having met Murakami before, the girl has superhuman strength and seems to even be able to predict the future; Murikami now has to figure out what the hell is going on.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems with this show is that I feel like I've already seen it; this is basically Elfen Lied with everything toned down. Less fanservice, less \"WTF\" moments, less blood, less action, less everything. They should rename this show Diet Elfen Lied. It maintains all of the same problems that the original had but doesn't have the same shock factor, and since shock factor was basically the only reason to watch Elfen Lied, that is a very bad thing. Additionally, The plot is completely unfocused; it starts with Murakami meeting two witches who are wandering around using their powers to save lives, then that subplot is completely forgotten and the focus switches to trying to keep the witches alive, and then the alien subplot makes a short and random return only to disappear again\u2026 There is simply no direction or consistency to be found in GnB; it comes across as incoherent.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these obvious issues, it should be noted that I actually still liked this show after the first few episodes. It was undeniably flawed, but it was suspenseful and exciting. Now, however, it just feels like a horribly confused Slice of Life show. It has divulged into an extremely predictable hi-jinks-fest as Murakami forms a harem of witches. The plot simply becomes incapable of carrying the show; it transforms into generic fanservice with unbelievably cheesy plot-conveniences at this point (looking at you, episode 9) as Murakami and his harem dick around while creating contrived sexually-awkward situations for comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThat brings us to the characters, who are quite awful. Murakami is the least believable character I've seen in a long time; he has no flaws what so ever and cares about people he just met to an unreasonable extent. To top that off, he has very little personality. Kazumi is just unbelievably aggravating. Her only purpose  is to spew sexual comments and create awkward situations because it's supposed to be funny; it isn't. Kurohaneko is probably the best character, but that's not saying much. She is the only one who manages to both have a personality and not be annoying, so take that for what its worth\u2026 Actually, I take that back; she becomes increasingly annoying because she instantly latches on to every witch she sees and acts like they have been best friends for life despite the fact that they just met and the fact the other witch is, more often then not, trying to kill her. It's not believable in any way and it further perpetuates the fact that the characters have poor chemistry with one another. So in other words, there isn't a single character that I would consider to be good, however there are many I would consider to be bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, GnB tries to take on both serious/mature themes and happy/funny themes at the same time, but ends up with an absolute mess. We have seen shows take on both sides of the spectrum and still be successful before, such as FMA and Darker than Black, but GnB just doesn't seem to know what its doing. I'm often bored watching this show because it fails to illicit any kind of emotional response from the audience at any point; it's not shocking, it's not funny, it's not entertaining (with the exception of a few scenes), it's not anything. Sure, it had a few decently suspenseful moments early on, but there is simply no motivating factor to keep you watching. You could easily just watch Elfen Lied and get the same sort of experience, but multiplied by 5, so what's the point? I don't recommend this show to anyone.",

            "content": "Ah, the age old question: do aliens exist?\r\nIt\u2019s a topic that has been debated for centuries. But for Ryouta Murakami, he\u2019s not looking for aliens to be famous or for science. Rather, he\u2019s looking for aliens because of a childhood past, one that changed his life forever. Gokukoku No Brynhildr (Brynhildr in the Darkness) tells the story of a world involving witches, beings with supernatural abilities that could change everything forever. \r\nFrom the author of the notorious Elfen Lied, Lynn Okamoto puts his ideas to the test once again in this sci-fi and experimental series. The general premise involves the young boy Ryouta who meetsKuroneko, his childhood friend many years ago. For what\u2019s worth, the mystery accelerator kicks in with an event that assumingly killed Kuroneko. In the present, he meets a girl going by the name \u201cNeko Kuroha\u201d with the exact same appearance as his childhood friend. At the same time, it\u2019s known that pursuers from an \u201calien research lab\u201d are going after her. It sets up the cat-and-mouse game where the loser won't get another chance.\\n\\n\r\nEstablishing the show this way easily accomplishes the idea of a cat-and-mouse game. And you\u2019re not wrong if this is your assumption. Throughout the show, their pursuers work ruthlessly to capture Neko regardless of who gets in their way. This is accomplished in various ways either by direct confrontation or sending other witches after them. Either way, the end goal is to bring back witches to their laboratory. Luckily though, the duo gets some unlikely help along the way with other witches such as Kazumi, Kana, and Katori. (the trio K ladies) As witches, each of them possess invaluable abilities that have saved their lives throughout the show. But as a group, they are known as the \u2018Astronomy Club\u2019, founded by Ryouta with the purpose to discover aliens.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall concept of the show is halfhearted to say the least. Given the way the show is planned out, it\u2019s no surprise that some people sees similarity to Elfen Lied. These include the childhood trope, experimentation, and special individuals with abilities. And while the show does have comedy, the dark reality constantly reminds us with the fact that they are being hunted. Initially, there is a prejudice against witches throughout the show. They are viewed as animals, treated like animals, and hunted down like animals. This is all for what they are just for the fact that they have special abilities. In raw form, the show depicts cruel experimentation on the witches behind the background with a twisted sense of horror. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising though given Lynn\u2019s writing. His concepts spawn from the very idea of experimentation with special individuals. What this show focuses on though is how to capture the other witches while Ryouta serves as their guardian. While this seems to be groundbreaking for its portrayal, the show suffers from balance. It\u2019s a clear image the show will have a serious tone such as the OP song featuring bloodied spectrum of character montages. But for delivery, the show indulges itself with awkward comedy. While some of these actually has a purpose with foreshadowing, others are flat out clich\u00e9 with edgy style. Not to mention, sexual innuendos are thrown all over the place with suggestive fan service and cheesy dialogue. In essence, the show makes fun of itself either unintentionally or go over dramatic when it comes to its humor. And this my friends, is not a good idea when adapting a dark story as it\u2019s stupefying in its awkwardness. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the overall setup is the adaptation. With only 13 episodes, the show omits many details based on the manga of the same name. While it doesn\u2019t completely annihilate satisfactory experience to get out of this show, it kills certain aspects of the story through omitting certain characters and story plot. Despite this though, it stays fairly consistent with adapting faithfully. The first episode chooses to deliver a somewhat concise setup with the two main characters introduced and letting the viewers know what they might expect. Hints such as the OP song, various flashbacks, and other dialogues/events gives an impression that the show has other mysteries than meets the eye. These could be related to the mechanics of the show, or more in specifically the machinations of the Witches. Terms such as \u2018harnessed\u2019 (pronounced like \u2018her nest\u2019) and research numbers designates the show as a sci-fi show with experimentation. The witches themselves are also referenced by Norse mythology with their names. But ultimately when it comes down to it, the witches are depicted as clich\u00e9 characters by standards.\\n\\n\r\nThat standard is shown through the relationship that Ryouta forms with them. As a kind and compassionate young boy, he has attracted the attention of the witches he has helped. Even though physically weak, he has the mind of a genius when it comes to devising clever tactics to evade capture. The girls/witches appreciate his efforts and not only earned their respect, but their affections. While some show it innocently with genuine thankfulness, others go with the more aggressive route such as Kazumi. Her ways of trying to get Ryouta to \u201cdo it\u201d is saturated with direct sexual dialogues. On the other hand, Ryouta mostly shows ignorance and passes them off. In most cases, he is focused on survival rather than a relationship. In all though, it\u2019s easy to see who Ryouta is interested in from the beginning just based on the premise. In retrospect, the connection Ryouta builds off with the characters is devoid of characterization but rather with stereotypical characteristics. Even with earnest honesty, the show prides itself with more oddball humor than characterizing its development. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does pass the tests when it comes to action. In essence, the show details battles exclusively with focus on each witch and their potentials. Almost every witch shown in the series shows their ability with emphasis on their strength and weaknesses. The show also depicts them through categories of rankings to even give more consistency. For the action scenes itself, the show focuses on a bit of teamwork and risk. Ryouta is a gambler in the show and can keep viewers at the edge of their seat with his daring moves. In fact, some episodes are cliffhangers that can leave you anticipating what will happen next. Despite this though, some story plot devices are predictable and lacks interest when there\u2019s heavy foreshadowing. Battles are also quick fashioned with a lack of moral sense most of the time except on a few occasions. Nothing to write home about though.\\n\\n\r\nVisually to the eyes, the show is violent when it comes to execution by studio ARMs. Blood is a common sight in the show and as a way to deconstruct some of the innocence of the girls. Other interesting artwork relates to cruel experimentations and the evidence of its shocking factors with extraterrestrial vibes. For character designs, there\u2019s a wide variety as each witch has her own characteristics. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t hide its fan service (besides the censor). Classic onsen episodes are present and jokes are made about boob sizes. To further escalate this concept, characters such as Kotori becomes an epitome of admiration for her \u2018sizes\u2019. We also can\u2019t forget about the jokes that Ryouta has to deal with when it comes to character interactions. How does that tie with service? The witches of course in particular, Kazumi and her mischievousness.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack has some influence on the show although it doesn\u2019t entirely play a huge role. Technical wise, it\u2019s well delivered and takes chances. By that, it means the show mixes comedic tones with darker and somber style for its OST. The result well mixed as the show itself pokes fun at itself. But when it comes to dark, the OP songs are a firm example to stand out on their own. The first OP song (played for the first 9 episodes) is unique with no lyrics but instead illustrate the dark undertone of the show. The second OP song has a similar style but with heavy metal lyrics to again to deliver its message \u2013 to show that the series should be taken seriously in respect. Otherwise, character voice mannerisms are decent. In particular, Kazumi\u2019s kansai accent is noticeable while other times, the show make fun of itself with Kuroneko\u2019s singing. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to adaptations, Gokukoku no Bryhildr is a horrid example for its unsatisfactory balance of comedy and dark fantasy. It\u2019s not mindless entertainment since the show has a premise and follows through it exclusively. But when it comes to humor, the show tries to mutate it into a late night comedy with disastrous effects. On the other hand, the characters offer a diverse category of personalities besides their inadequate development. With an adaptation of only thirteen episodes though, it\u2019s injustice to skip material that should have been there. Ultimately, this show was a bomb, a failure of an experiment.\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I've never seen Elfen Lied so I will not mention that in the review at all. I will review based on just Gokukoku no Brynhildr. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nTo me, the story was very unique. I haven't seen something this new in ages, because most of the anime I've been watching (or re-watching) have been really repetitive. The story wasn't dragging out that much, though there would be happy scenes, then sad/serious scenes repeating in that order (mostly). The anime was very mysterious. I wanted to find out why that happened, or this happened. There is also harem and romance in this anime andthat made the anime a bit better. The comedy (which wasn't tagged in the genres) was mostly about sex and virginity. If you're not into mild gore + romance and harem and you're more into the light-hearted comedy, normal life-type anime, then this anime isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was actually really nice. Very detailed characters, colors were nice and vibrant and smooth animation. Expected for an anime that was produced in 2014. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is played where it's necessary. There's no unnecessary OST playing, or an OST that doesn't mix the scene. The 1st OP fits the dark theme of the anime (the OP vid is really interesting) but I liked the 2nd OP better. I haven't heard an OP without vocals for a while. The ED is calm, to take off the dark theme from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMurakami Ryouta, the male protagonist. He's smart and has a special ability where if he sees something, he will remember that in full detail, like a scanner. He's very kind and would sacrifice his life to save another. \\n\\n\r\nKuroha Neko, a girl that doesn't know a lot like her multiplication tables (lol) and still getting #1 on the finals. As time goes on, she starts to like Murakami. She's really pretty.\\n\\n\r\nSchlierenzauer (sch-ly-ren-za-oo-er i think) Kazumi, a girl who is a really good computer hacker and is smart. As she spends more time with Murakami, she starts to 'want' him sexually. She's really kind and funny too.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana Kana, the girl who can't move anything other than her left hand.\\n\r\nShe communicates with a keyboard. She calls mostly Murakami a molester but occasionally calls Kazumi a rapist. \\n\\n\r\nTakatori Katori, a woman who is fit to be a house wife because of her cooking skills. On first impressions, you will think she is a bad person but inside, she's a very kind girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why, but I would be skipping to parts of the anime. It wasn't boring at all, but I guess I'm really used to skipping. I would've watched this anime in one sitting, but of course I have to sleep too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very nice, even though it's getting bad reviews. Would I re-watch it? Definitely.",

            "content": "Gokukoku no Brynhildr or Brynhildr in the darkness is the anime adaptation of a manga created by the same mangaka who did the famous Elfen Lied. The show talks about an \"ordinary boy\" who comes in contact with girls called witches. Witches have some kind of power, every witch has it's own. So basically this guy meets a witch that looks like his lost childhood friend tries to help her and gets a harem.  \r\nStorry: The story is basically just like elfen lied only the girls have different powers, there is not much originality and much things are not clearly explained. The guy whofirst looks like an ordinary boy turns out to have photographic memory and stuff. The pacing is off and the switches between \"tragic\" moments and harem/comedy moments were too random and ruined the mood (that was not great to begin with). Latter on the story just becomes inconsistent, things come out of fuc*** nowhere just for the \"shock factor\" but at that point the whole thing is already so stupid you don't care anymore.  \\n\r\n1/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound : The only thing in the show I have no complains about. I mean it was not something great but it was not bad either. The sound was ok I guess, nothing memorable. The first OP was good the second one was pure trash, the OP was even used as part of the soundtrack. I forgot every single OST 30 min after completing the show, that shows how good it was.  \\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : Ordinary teenager with photographic memory which makes him immune to memory erasing? He suddenly comes up with amazing strategies that makes him look smart or some shit. He was the classic alpha male who gets bitches by acting as a hero. The girls were classic stereotypes , not much personality, the only thing I will remember of them is their naked bodies .  \\n\r\n2/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Probably the worst anime I have ever seen and I have seen about 800 at the time  am writing the review. This was worse then Mars Of Destruction and I am not kidding, this show is pure trash that should never be watched.  1/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall : Really bad show with stupid asspulls annoying characters and a story that does not make sense 70% of the time( the other 30% is the fanservice/harem moments)  \\n\\n\r\n1/10 - Don't touch this piece of poo.",

            "content": "Gokukoku no Brynhildr is a very cleverly disguised harem in the skin of a bleeding magician.\r\nThe show is a clear example of a unique set of characters with great potential placed at the mercy of a poorly written plot and forced to move with it. This is evident in multiple parts of the anime whenever a plot point is introduced only to be glossed over. While this isn\u2019t entirely noticeable at first glance, it becomes a reoccurring phenomenon that leaves the audience wondering \u201cwhy?\u201d \r\nOne of the weakest points of the show is the lack of impact the supporting cast (Kogorou, Chisato, Nanami, etc) hason the state of mind and motivational force of the main character. Almost every time they are introduced the main characters neither learn nor gain anything other than restating their raison d\u2019etre and passing them off with little reflection. Furthermore, one of the worst offenses is having them being reduced to a simple plot device to conveniently move the main cast in a certain direction. When the show takes a turn toward the darker end of the spectrum the supporting cast seem to be conveniently present at times where the main characters need them the most. Then, as if to add salt onto the wound, emotional thresholds become melodramatic and seemingly misplaced. The main characters, namely Murakami, Kuroha, and Kazumi start acting as if they are on a checklist to cry at a given point of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to call GnB dark and grim especially when we have death left and right. Though, the blood, melting, and secret organization are only a pretense to call it a \u201cdark\u201d show. Unfortunately, the show\u2014in its vain attempt to show us tragedy\u2014doesn\u2019t build the right emotional motivation for us to feel attached to their characters. Because while supporting cast have attachments to the main cast, they served to do little in expressing the latter\u2019s growth, thereby preventing the audience from vicariously feeling the main character\u2019s loss. This is due to the poorly-written plot not making use of the supporting cast. In the end, the show leaves their deaths as an afterthought that forces us to simply accept the outcome and think \u201cThank god it wasn\u2019t ______ who died.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show isn\u2019t unique\u2014and I\u2019m sure many have seen the clich\u00e9 of the \u201cstubborn MC\u201d who will \u201cdo all he can to protect these people\u201d from some \u201cevil organization\u201d bent on doing some sort of \u201cevil on the world.\u201d What the story does do a good job of is making a common theme their own by twisting it into something familiar, yet new. It piques the audience\u2019s curiosity by introducing a variety of powers specific to certain \u2018magicians\u2019 and having them categorized by strength. What makes the story more redeeming is Murakami and the group\u2019s combination of their weaker powers to overcome seemingly impossible odds, not simply relying entirely on ass pulls. And though the planning stages, as well as the transparency of their plans aren\u2019t always revealed immediately (which at first seems to set itself up as an ass pull) becomes a refreshing sight to see how things do work out when they pool their assets. \\n\\n\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr vainly introduces far too much to create their world and it resulted in disaster. Towards the end we are left with a bitter taste in the mouth with many loose ends and far too little questions answered. \\n",

            "content": "One of the less appealing animes which was adapted poorly from a manga. This is from the point of view of a person who was previously reading the manga before the anime was announced. \r\nTHIS REVIEW WILL BE STRICTLY BASED OFF OF THE ANIME!\r\nStory: The plot is not very well defined and is easily misinterpreted, I was lost multiple times watching this anime and it constantly felt like there were missing gaps as I watched the anime. The plot is an static plot of basically 1 antagonist who have many underlings who will do their bidding pressuring the existence of the main protagonist. Don't getme wrong this main sound very boring and done multiple times but the character development happening during roughly the first 7 episodes are pure gold. After the beginning where every thing was nice, then the downfall of the anime occurs. They attempt to finish as much as they can within the 13 episode time frame causing difficulty understanding the anime as they have to ignore the important parts which helped the anime succeed after a while (character development).\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style really suits the anime in my opinion, but it is average in general.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The timing for the background music was very well done and I really enjoyed it all, I did have a slight problem with their choice of opening theme songs as I personally prefer songs that have singing. Other than that slight problem it was well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There was a lack in character development in my opinion,  the entire story was too rushed for many development to occur. Also there were so many missed opportunities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed the first 7 episodes or so, it was amazing to finally be given a chance to watch one of my favourite mangas turn in to anime. The timing for a good portion of the events were well timed and the use of music within the scenes came together really nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The anime is very unfriendly to their viewers as it provides: \\n\r\nLiittle to no character development occurs due to the fact that the wanted to fit as much as they could in the small time frame given. Normally this wouldn't be as BIG as a problem but what they did was executed poorly due to the anime needing character development as it is one of the main selling points of the anime...\\n\\n\r\nRushed events that are difficult to understand once again this is due to their given time constraints but if I were to suggest an idea, I would have stopped earlier within the anime but added more character development through small events.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest for all who has watched this anime to give the manga the chance if you really enjoyed the anime and want more.\\n",

            "content": "Brynhildr of THE DARKNESSS Review:\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nA top secret military base who are super evil, experiments on females to make Super Aliens to do a bunch of random errands. One of the girls trying to escape some how ends up in our generic protagonists astronomy club, then he hunts more of them. Soon enough, poof! Harem happens- obvious fact. Now whose ready for SHOCK FACTOR!\r\nREVIEW:\r\nLets start of with what most people flip there Kenichi's about... the gore factor... AKA- SHOCK FACTOR: \r\nAt least in Elfen Lied they show fully uncensored gore and nudity, it was special back then because the gore mixed with the portrayal of nudityand emotions of the characters with there harsh situations allowed us to at least sympathize with what there forced to do. Violence in present, have become mainstream of the years which looses it effect. In Brynhildr, they censored it because it was aiming for that mainstream garbage! It shows no respect of the audience as the characters have some crazy super powers to be used as plot armour, in fact, there completely one liner or worded and 100% archetype designed personalities is sufficient evidence that the show puts over there cool super powers over personalities which doesn't make anyone care! It maybe cool at first, but hear me out:\\n\r\n Don't know what\u2019s going to happen next? See into the future! About to die? Regeneration! About to get killed? use Mind Control! All of this makes everything feel very forced and lack maturity. It lacks the realism and grey morality compared towards its older sister, at least the Horn Girls in Elfen kill people for survival as they are all being mistreated by man kind, which is totally understandable, but in here! The girls don't attack anyone because being captured means they're being tortured and experimented in this unethical manner if they come back to secret HQ laboratories. So they insist to runaway! As there only option, which limits a lot of interesting possibilities to make the show, \u201cBetter\u201d\\n\\n\r\nComparing towards the show's fan service terminology:\\n\r\nAt least in Elfen we had the girls stripped to show an excuse that they are in physical or psychological torture, girl gets sexually abused by step Dad, girl gets horribly experimented on scientists through torture to advance technology etc. In Brynhildr's mind, we had to throw Boob Jokes, Forced Bath Scenes, and girl wants to sleep with guy naked but no hentai. Because, harem, as this show is trying to make us sympathize from the harsh lives of the characters? Or trying to turn us on? Oh, wait, its both. (doesn't mix well btw)\\n\\n\r\nAt least our Harem lead in Elfen (though very generic) seems to be an incredibly kind person, nor he is the brightest or the most cunning; he's just this vanilla guy that all chicks are forced to live. The Murakami dude is a douche! He apparently seems to appear very smart and has well thought out plans but turns out that he's entire thought process was completely retarded as almost every plan fails, it feels as if he's actually getting dum! He also makes boob jokes and trying to always tries to look smarter than everyone else for every chance he gets. He is at first, calm, sophisticated and intellectual, but turns out to be rather pretentious. The first opening was good, having some refreshing dubstep, but then I listen to ear rape like ten episodes in which was completely unnecessary for a 12 episode series! Aesthetically, its just some action and nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nVERDICT:\\n\r\nIn a nutshell its just plain stupid logic... Unlike its older sister which had a decent amount of depth and respect towards audience, Brynhildr is STUPID, all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n6/10 Nothing special at all... It gets the job done in an above average manner.\\n\r\n5/10 Completely forgettable OST except for the 2 openings which saves me for giving it a minus point.\\n\r\n2/10 For super stupid characters!\\n\r\n2/10 By via forced storytelling.\\n\r\n1.5/10 With absolutely no redeeming factor except for the slightest deviants...\\n\\n\r\n2/10 For the obvious reasons!",

            "content": "tl;dr: Garbage story, so bad its like how you can't help but watch a trainwreck. Only reason to watch this show is if you like harem anime since the characters are awfully designed, but still very interesting and entertaining to watch.\r\nThis show's story is one of the worst things I've ever seen. So many plotholes, illogical decisions, and unreasonable situations even if there's people with superpowers involved. Most of the series is spent on fanservice rather than the plot so at this point, I might as well rate it as a harem and just ignore the story they seem to pretty much ignore for alarge portion of the show. It doesn't help that the overall plot they're trying to tell is convoluted as all hell with more twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It eventually becomes so bad, you want to see how much worse they can make it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are pretty good, consistent with about what you'd expect from a good anime, which, with this show's plot, is actually amazing in comparison. There's no spectacular CGI or 60 FPS animation or anything of that sort, its just the regular stuff done well.\\n\\n\r\nI can't even recall if there were any pieces playing other than the OP and ED. The ED was relatively generic so I chose to ignore it. The first OP was kinda of good, at least it was interesting since most anime have lyrics and not pseudo-dubstep for their OPs. The second OP, which started like 8 or 9 episodes into the series for some reason, literally assaulted me, that's all I have to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly if you look at this show as a harem and not a show with any sort of meaning or story what so ever, it becomes rather enjoyable as the characters are rather well designed and one character in particular has a very unique and, uh, \"passionate\" personality that is probably the only reason I'm still watching this show. The MC is oblivious as all hell like in most harems but at least he has a favorite and can make a choice, thank god.\\n\\n\r\nSee tl;dr for overall opinion.",

            "content": "Before I continue this review, I'd like to point out the fact that I have, indeed, read the manga up to the point at which the story in the anime ended, and I will try my best not to compare the two, though it is near impossible, considering how much better it could have been with a true-to-the-manga following, instead of the anime original ending we have at hand.\r\nFirst, let me go into some brief background. Gokukoku no Brynhildr, better known as Kiwaguro no Brynhildr, which is the name of the manga series that served as the source material the anime was based on, waswritten by the same author who wrote Elfen Lied. As a result, many people can see how similar the concepts that are used, as well as the character archetypes that are expressed in the two series's. Elfen Lied suffered from a terribly executed anime original ending, and whereas Gokukoku no Brynhildr should have learned from this original mishap, it suffers from a arguably worse anime original ending than Elfen Lied did, and coupled with the numerous other defects present in its almost jokingly terrible plotline and execution, it deserves a much lower score than its predecessor and accomplished much less.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move onto the categories.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nLet's begin with an analysis of the plotline. The main character, Murakami-kun, is a genius with photographic memory, and comes upon a \"witch\" that resembles his childhood friend, and he chooses to save this witch from persecution from the laboratory from which they escaped, along with multiple other witches. The backstory isn't bad, and is actually fairly interesting. It makes you question: What is the mystery of the lab that we are about to find out, and how is it related to why these witches are being persecuted?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with further delving into the events that happen during the plot, you find that Brynhildr only devolves into a pseudo slice of life with gore in it, during which the only interesting things that happen include listening to Kazumi's heavily accented voice and her proclamations of how horny she is and how much she wants to have Ryota's children.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was another giant factor that becomes the downfall of this anime series - after dillydallying in the world of Kotori-chan's breasts and Kazumi's nonexistant ones for numerous episodes while providing minimal main plot development, the series tries to wrap itself up in the final 2 and a half episodes, cramming about 30 chapters of work into roughly an hour of showtime. As a result, the ending was inevitably rushed, and changed from the original manga arc's ending, cutting away important developments, like Ryota's presence right beside Kotori as she was ejected, or Kana's part in saving Neko and Ryota from Valkyria.\\n\\n\r\nAnother blaring issue that the storyline had was the completely forced and manufactured plot. Rather than letting events unfold, and letting characters deal with problems as they normally would in an intelligent way, a tragedy happens, a character gets godlike status, and the problem is solved. This same formula is repeated numerous times throughout the episode, with deus ex machinas being pulled again and again and again from the writer's toolbox. I admit, this isn't just an issue with the anime adaptation, the manga suffered from it as well, whether it be Ryota's unerasable photographic memory, or Kotori's ability to stop all kinetic energy of the person she switches with when she switches places with someone using her teleportation ability. These scenes, however, show how stupid and contrived the plot actually is, which makes any plot progression feel forced and unrealistic, along with just plain uninteresting, because the audience can just assume that some character will exhibit some extreme new aspect of their power that will be able to easily solve any problem thrust in the main character's way, time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art was decent. The version I saw incorporated censoring in the form of fog in all the gory scenes (like the melting scenes or cut up bodies), that was almost as terrible as the Funimation censoring used for Freezing, but most other elements were handled fairly well. Certain scenes did feel awkward, however, and the characters did appear bland and uninteresting at times when actual plot development happened, leading me to believe most of the budget was spent on the unnecessary fanservice present throughout the entire length of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe sound quality was decent, and the opening sequence for the first 10 or so episodes was actually quite catchy, as dubstep openings aren't as prevalent in the Japanese music industry in general. The second opening, with its more heavy metal air, was also fairly interesting, and the ending provided a sense of calm after the gory events that happened in the episode. There wasn't anything particularly special about the OST- it was basically what you would expect from any other science fiction anime title with explosions and laser beams. The voice acting, however, was fairly subpar - none of the emotions that the characters felt that should have been communicated to the audience got through, and at times when some screaming and emotion should have been prevalent, the screaming and name-calling just felt noisy, and might have been better off with just silence and streaming tears. As a direct reference to one of these scenes, when Murakami was sliced in two in episode 12, Kana's fervent typing (which translates to speech through her superintelligent text to speech converter device) didn't serve much purpose, and actually distracted (and annoyed) me from a supposedly shocking scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nThe worst portion of the anime. Unique and interesting characters drive the plot of the anime, and without these, the plot simply can't function to be anything intellectual or even seemingly interesting. Every single character written in the series only had one of two purposes. 1. To be part of Ryota's harem or 2. To be killed brutally and horribly. All those who were part of the harem cannot act, or think for themselves - they are merely piles of meat that idolize Ryota and dream of mating with him - as literally and clearly expressed by Kazumi multiple times throughout the series's length. All those who die, end up as terrible emotional triggers that are supposed to attract the gore fetishists, or pull at the heartstrings of the sensitive - neither of which is possible with the terrible censoring and insignificance of any individual character that appears to die in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nNo doubt, my interest in the manga, and the failed expectations I had for the show before I entered it influenced my enjoyment levels, but nonetheless, if you don't enjoy random fan pandering and cardboard characters in your serious piece of science fiction with a dark plot and atmosphere, then you probably won't enjoy this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThis show suffers from the same problem that Elfen Lied did, except it doesn't solve this problem - it only makes it worse, in the worst way. All the calm and peaceful slice of life that happened in the show, much like the slice of life present in Elfen Lied, serves little to no purpose, and none of the characters are likable enough to feel emotion for when he or she happens to be caught up in tragedy. The show tried to juxtapose the gory and dark elements of the show's main plot, with the lighter elements of the show, but it was a doomed project from the beginning, and would have been much better off holding the male hormone tease and spending more time with the main storyline and illustrating all the mystery aspects it promises to address in the first episode, up till the last. At least with Elfen Lied, there was a sense of \"oh, wow, that was an intense ending, left open for us to wonder at and reflect on our own what the show was supposed to represent.\" With Gokukoku no Brynhildr, the only thought I'm left with is \"What the heck happened I don't even know what I'm supposed to be feeling Can somebody take me to the doctor please The manga was 1000% better even though I didn't even like the manga that much please Brynhildr what happened to Kazumi you didn't even tell me at the end Why did Neko have to lose her memories Why is Ryota so unkillable and such a badass and Why did I even choose to watch this adaptation.\"",

            "content": "Huge disappointment, possibly the biggest of the year. \r\nI'd previously written a more positive review of this one as I was about 6 episodes in. Even then I'd seen troubling signs that it could turn out terrible, but I thought it could fix itself before the problems grew to become excruciating. It took a 100% dive.\r\nThe first episode leads off nicely, and the second one stirs up even more suspense and seems to get some character progression going. \r\nFrom here it seems to really lose all direction. \r\nThere are some nice elements setting up for alot of possibilities but it's like the writer didn't knowwhat to do with it or realized the plot wouldn't be able to fit in just 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually not easy to point out exactly where we run off track with the story and the story just ends up following the characters' random ways of life. Characters which are stereotypes to the core, and the main character comes off as this pretentious image that the writer tries to glorify themself in. The only real character traits you can say he has, are that he's got photographic memory and he just wants to selflessly protect and save these girls. A forced white knight protagonist, devoid of any shade of identity. Oh, and important to mention, is that all his crying moments are so cringeworthy, your toe nails could dive into your skin and grow out in-between your teeth. These characters and especially the protagonist are so painfully pretentious and one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls... Besides that they're obvious stereotypes, the real offender is their interaction with eachother, and namely while the protagonist is in the room.\\n\r\nI'd tell you to pay attention to the way they talk, and notice how it feels like looking at otaku's in a small chat trying to establish themselves as these stereotypes IRL. \\n\r\n\"I think I'm more like X character, 'cause in my mind, my daily life just like that. I'm totally like this character. That is until I watch another anime and think I'm like Y character in that one.\"\\n\r\nBasically everyone goes; \"I can out-otaku you any day\".\\n\\n\r\nI do kinda still commend it for at two instances breaking an old and grating tease so often seen in anime... But then again, in hindsight, that might also just be to please the writer's ego.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame, 'cause it actually led off with an interesting start but it just became more like a bad fan fic. \\n\r\nWatching it, I so often feel like I'm actually just looking at the writer masturbate profusely while spouting their self-proclaimed excellence. \\n\r\nAnd what supports this, is the fact that this short anime has two openings, with the second one feeling very rushed and ill fitting. It's really crammed in with the last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is the first opening theme, which is quite interesting. It also feels like this was written, inspired by said theme. Especially with the soundtrack within the show seeming to rip it off.\\n\r\nAnd talk about ripping off... The first opening sequence really feels like it's taking alot from Mirai Nikki, and the main 'love interest' of the show, is really by design just a blue haired Makise from Steins;Gate, in an outfit that looks like it's borrow from Homura from Puella Magi. But it might just be me imagining things.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really not much good to point out in this one. You can safely skip it.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nGokukoku was written by Lynn Okamoto, the same mangaka that wrote Elfen Lied and was animated by Studio Arms, which also produced Elfen Lied. Is Gokukoku no Brynhildr The second coming of Elfen Lied? In a word...no. If you loved Elfen Lied, you will hate Gokukoku. If you thought Elfen Lied was terrible, you will think this is worse. If you were impartial towards Elfen Lied, you will hate Gokukoku. This series fucking sucks!\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story begins with our young protagonist Murakami and his childhood friend Neko out watching the stars. Neko is an unusual little girl that believes in aliens and wishes to provetheir existence to the skeptical and logical Murakami. While playing on the face of an old dam, Murakami falls and accidentally pulls down Neko with him. He wakes up in the hospital and is told that she died. Devastated by this news, he devotes his life to proving aliens exist in her honor. This is an odd vow for a supposedly logical and brilliant character to make, since he doesn't believe in aliens, but the story hasn't actually begun to get bad yet at this point! An evil government organization is creating super human magic users creatively called \"witches\". Each witch gains her power from a device in her neck called a harness, which contains an alien parasite. If the device is removed, the witch melts into goo as an homage to the wicked witch of the west. Witch after witch keep escaping the facility and finding Murakami, who takes them in to protect them. On the surface, this seems to be a rather similar plot to Elfen Lied, but if you look closer you will notice some differences. In Elfen Lied the director of the clandestine government group wishes to wipe out humans because he is actually a mutant and wishes to be the God of a new race that he views as superior. He is a mix of Magneto and Hitler. However, most of the other government members in Elfen Lied are unaware of this plot and truly believe that they are protecting mankind from the mutants, who often do lash out at humans. The mutants aren't evil, but are realistically what you  would expect from psychologically damaged children with dangerous super powers. In Gokukoku the government group is simply evil and wishes to wipe out humans for no discernible reason. For the lulz I guess. There is no level of moral ambiguity or complexity. In Elfen Lied we had the moral struggle of Kurama, but here we just have a sick bastard named Director Ichijiku who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The witches have been tortured and experimented on their entire lives, but only a few lash out in anger and use their powers to get revenge. Most of the witches are extremely pure and un-corruptible, and give the government no reason to hunt them, other than the fact that the government is evil. Once again, there is no level of complexity, nothing remotely thought provoking, no questions on the nature of good and evil. The series simply goes on with more and more bland and forgettable chicks arriving at the observatory. The manga is still going, so the anime had to create its own ending. Elfen Lied chose to end with an open ending and leave several points up to viewer interpretation with only subtle hints to help. Gokokoku tries to wrap everything up in a couple episodes and becomes an incoherent mess of nonsense with one of the worst, most anti-climactic endings I have ever seen in the history of animation! The only competition would be from some of the old Soviet cartoons where the State Film Department would simply pull the budget at random and give the animators a few days and a few hundred bucks to make an ending. That's what this fucking looked like! Of course not quite as epic as the final battle in The Snow Queen (1957), which consists of a little girl shouting \"Go Away!\" Villain disappears with cheap dissolve effect, END. Gokokoku was made in 2013 with a substantial budget though, so I won't go easy on it by comparing it to a cartoon from the Stalin Era Soviet Union.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Murakami, who is one of the best students in Japan. He has a photographic memory and is devoted to xenobiology. He is a pure good guy with no real internal struggles and nothing that actually makes him interesting. He is simply very bland. The main heroine is Kuroha Neko, who at times goes into \"tsundere mode\" for a tired comedy gag that is repeated ad nauseum, but mostly is just boring. She knows she faces imminent death, but simply shrugs it off with an inexhaustible level of optimism that would baffle even Vanille from Final Fantasy 13. Vanille is a deep, compelling, and tortured character compared to Neko. We have Kana, who is quadriplegic, speaks with a voice simulator, and exists solely as a plot device that predicts future events and allows our heroes to escape trouble. We never hear about how her condition effects her attitude or learn about her struggles. She is simply given ZERO development! She would at least have gotten a few laughs if they had used the Stephen Hawking voice program for her character, but that would require Gokukoku actually doing something right. The worst character though is Kazumi, who exists only for fan service in a series that is afraid to show any nudity. To make matters worse, she is one of the most obnoxious characters in all of anime. Yuka in Elfen Lied was quite obnoxious at times, but at least she was following a childhood crush and actually realizes her own flaws. Yuka also acts as part of a love triangle and has a purpose within the framework of the shows plot. Kazumi on the other hand, simply has no reason to exist.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is sort of decent, but many of the characters look the same. The animators just change the hair color and boob size. That's it. All vehicles are done with HORRENDOUS CGI that at least adds unintentional hilarity to this otherwise bland series. The animation is not very fluid and is quite lackluster. This came out in 2013 and looks FAR worse than Elfen Lied did in 2004. What the FUCK happened Studio Arms!!? You will also notice that any nudity and gore is edited out with a distracting bright, white light that burns your eyes and completely removes you from the show. If you are going to painfully edit in a style that would make 4kids blush, why bother having gore and nudity in the first place! The nude scenes don't add anything to the series and could easily be taken out, but they are mysteriously left in and completely fail to accomplish their purpose of erotica and fan service because they are so severely edited. This makes about 1 hour of a 5 hour series completely un-watchable, with vague silhouettes and a bright light borrowing into your eyeballs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are no good openers or closing themes. The best thing I can say is that one opening is unintentionally funny by clashing death metal growls with the cutely animation of this series. It is clearly trying to be like the 2nd death note opening and failing at an EPIC level. The background music is so bland and forgettable that I have seen porn with a better soundtrack! Elfen Lied had Lillium, one of the best opening themes in all of anime. It had also had some chilling, disturbing tracks that sounded like Arnold Schoenberg composed them. Elfen Lied had an A+ soundtrack, Gokukoku has a D- at best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes look like this series might at least be mildly enjoyable. Afterwards this series is about as fun as repeatedly punching yourself in the throat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nGokukoku is absolutely wretched, but I have actually seen far worse. What makes this series painful is that I actually loved Elfen Lied and expected something a shit load better than this! The problem is that Lynn Okamoto by himself is actually a pretty bad writer. He has some good ideas, but without a good editor he can't execute them. With Elfen Lied he also stole characters and plot points from X-men, Crime and Punishment, and Phantom of the Opera. That was essentially what actually made Elfen Lied good in the first place. It felt like a modern variant of an 1800s psychological drama/gothic horror mixed with X-men. It was a delightful potpourri that actually worked thanks to the editing and vision of the brilliant series Director Mamoru Kanbe. In Gokukoku, Okamoto stole from himself and tried to reuse parts of his previous plot without adding any of the themes, struggles, or messages that made Elfen Lied work. Gokukoku actually had a highly esteemed director named Imaizumi that also directed Mushishi and Ano Hana, which are both extremely praised on this site. However, Mr. Imaizumi's style completely clashed with Okamoto's writing and Imaizumi was not able to take the salvageable parts and create his own vision like Kanbe did. Gokukoku is like the hollow shell of Elfen Lied that has lost its very soul. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you REALLY hate that person!\\n\\n",

The characters are static and flat, plot threads that should have been wrapped up quickly continue onto the last few episodes, and the art seems almost barbaric when comparing it to more visually stunning shows that aired simultaneously. It has the tropeof harem where it doesn't necessarily need one, there's a significant amount of ecchi scenes that seem awkwardly jumbled into the rest of the series, and all the women are literally helpless without the main character. Yes, the show is sexist and strives to enthuse the male audience. The only person I have to blame for this one is you. This is exactly what you asked for.\\n\\n\r\nWithout all the sex and violence that sells Blu-Rays and DVDs, this anime wouldn't be a blip on any consumer's radar. There's nothing to separate Shingeki no Kyojin and this anime. The writing is about the same, leading the viewer on with very obvious plot threads only to confirm them true after 12 episodes of meandering. There's intense gore at the expense of our poorly-fleshed out cast, and the hyperviolence depicted in this series only continues to prove Elfen Lied's point that it so desperately tried to make ten years ago. People want to be shocked. They want to watch something that leaves them agape. This show lets people watch something dark and primal. It's the closest thing to sweet sweet revenge like Lucy got in response to her dog \"prank\" in Elfen Lied. And it's just winking enough to let the viewers be okay with it. The only thing Brynhildr is missing is the top notch visuals. If Brynhildr had the budget Shingeki no Kyojin did, it could be what SnK is right now - unquestioningly popular.\\n\\n\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr is endlessly entertaining. It's edgy and brooding in all the comical senses of the words. People don't just die in Brynhildr, their bodies bleed to death, then melt to oblivion, and then an alien carcass crawls out of them only to be squashed like a pesky bug. It's absurd! The show borrows all sorts of Sci-Fi concepts for it's main heroines, from predicting the future, to body swaps, to cybernetic transformation and secret underground facility conspiracies, and never ever apologizes about it. That might be why I'm so partial to Brynhildr. It's swaggering and confident. It's never pretentious and always is self-aware. In fact, when explaining to the main character why the main female lead has superhuman strength she simply tells him, because of \"surgery and drugs.\" That's all I really needed. The script is justifiably quip.\\n\\n\r\nBrynhildr is the hyperviolent, misanthropic, edgy grimdark show you want to hate yet the writing works in such a way that you feel slightly optimistic for the cast, for the show, and for the world. Brynhildr isn't new, and as many critics have ingeniously surmised, it's incredibly close to Elfen Lied. Yet there's an X factor in Brynhildr, and that X factor is that small bit of hope, that at the end of the tunnel there's happiness for these characters that seem to repeatedly have the deck stacked up against them. You can tell this show is unforgiving walking into it and characters will suffer. You just want to know which ones. You hope and hope that something happens so that they're ALL spared, and can have a normal school life. Your favorite parts of the episode are probably when the ecchi things happen, giving you a moment of relief - an aside from all the death talk and inevitable decay of the cute girls on screen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is what this show is about. It dangles it's serene and oversexed nymphs in front of you like a worm to a fish, and you're on the hook. It pulls the misanthropic bait away and you're left in the dark ocean again to witness the murder, the decaying flesh, the real teen angst of it all. And you're mad again. You hate the ecchi scenes! You hate the dark edginess! You hate the whole goddamn thing and there's nothing to like about this show at all! But there is and you keep coming back. You just hope that these misfits on screen achieve some sort of rational happiness. And whether they do or not doesn't matter in the end, I guess, but as long as you're watching think about that. Think about why you're appalled or entertained and how this show treads that thin line.\\n\\n\r\nIf you hated it all, good. You're a good person. If you liked it all, why? Are you a bad person?\\n\\n\r\nAnd, ahem, did you like Shingeki no Kyojin?",

            "content": "When I started watching this show I couldn\u00b4t help noticing how much similarities between this series and, the hugely popular, Elfen Lied existed. Both were a story about girls that were trapped in an investigation facility, that ended up escaping and then they find a really nice guy who ended up helping them, because, you know, he is THAT nice.\r\nI really wasn\u00b4t much of a fan of Elfen Lied but I gave this show an opportunity anyway, and for the first couple of episodes it wasn\u00b4t that much of a disappointment. Of course, while I was watching the first episodes, which I thought were prettydecent, I forgot that both Elfen Lied and this series are by the same author, Lynn Okamoto, and it seems that he doesn\u00b4t have the ability to learn from her mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show began pretty well in my opinion presenting us with a serious and dark story, and even if it is unoriginal, it is of my belief that an unoriginal story done the right way, can be a really enjoyable show to watch. We get presented to our main characters Murakami and Kuroha, and we also get presented to Kana afterwards in the second episode. I thought the mystery was nicely done and it kept me going back to this show week after week.\\n\\n\r\nI thought Murakami was, at first, a really decent protagonist, he was pretty smart and could formulate some desperate but effective plans to get out of the dangerous situations he got into, but as series went on he ended up being only that REALLY nice guy, who is willing to sacrifice his life for saving others, and then end up being saved by some Deus ex-Machina, because, you know, he is the protagonist. But I will get back to the Deus ex- Machina later.\\n\r\nKuroha was pretty much the typical childhood friend main love interest, she wasn\u00b4t really annoying but she wasn\u00b4t the greatest of the characters either, she didn\u00b4t have much personality either, apart from being the \"I think I\u00b4m in love with the protagonist\" character.\\n\r\nKana was also a so-so character, her personality is pretty much like the typical tsundere, again not really annoying but not great either.\\n\\n\r\nThen another character, Kazumi, got presented and there is when the show took  downward spiral, because around episode four, when they were just in the end of a really serious scene, the scene afterwards, suddenly, out of nowhere, we got fanservice and comedy, and that really took a hit on the show. The sudden changes between serious and light-hearted with comedy and fanservice avoided me from having the ability to take this show seriously. How can I get invested in a dark and serious story if they are trying to get me horny at the same time?\\n\r\nThe main problem here is Kazumi, which is probably the second worst character of the series, she is a pervert that is constantly firting with the main protagonist, Murakami, and is the cause of most of the fanservice scenes that can screw an episode on it\u00b4s entirety.\\n\r\nThis got repeated almost every episode which really made me want to drop this show sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThen in the final episodes that\u00b4s where the REAL nosedive kicks in, as we get presented to other girls, I will focus only in the most important, as the others don\u00b4t really have that much screentime, and aren\u00b4t really interesting. This is where Kotori gets presented. Kotori is the most annoying character of the series following the \"Big tits shy girl\" archetype, and all she really does in the series is saving Murakami from lethal situation, because she has the most useful power, and the other thing she does is stutter, A LOT, it\u00b4s really annoying.\\n\r\nAfter that the show starts to use Deus ex-Machinas a lot of the time with the objective of saving Murakami, pretty much defying physics, logic and human anatomy in the process, it seems as if someone thought I\u00b4m stupid and I wouldn\u00b4t notice this things.\\n\\n\r\nIn the art department nothing much really stands out. The character designs are normal and the color palette is pretty generic. Is constant and it doesnt\u00b4t really take any nosedive, I will give them that, but this is studio ARMS we\u00b4re talking about, they have never been in the peak of digital animation, and with this show, they failed to prove that the can do something actually decent. Apart from that the artwork is just above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, apart from the first OP is pretty forgettable, with nothing much really standing out. I can\u00b4t really judge the voice acting since I don\u00b4t speak japanese, but if there\u00b4s one voice that really annoys me, is Kotori\u00b4s, her loud voice and constant stuttering almost drive me insane.\\n\r\nThe first OP however is quite a piece, is an instrumental techno theme mixed with vocal choirs, and it was that glimmer of hope that made me thought that this show would redeem itself eventually, until it was replace by a death metal song by Fear, and loathing in Las Vegas, which not only didn\u00b4t fit the show, it was badly synchronised with the OP\u00b4s animation. Who had the brilliant idea to change the opening!? I will make sure he suffers when I kill him.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment on the show was ruined by the aforementioned light-hearted comedy and fanservice that doomed this show, and if you add the aforementioned Deus ex-Machina, and what is easily one of the worst ending that I have ever seen, you will have me trying to destroy my head with a shotgun.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Judgement:\\n\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr started with a pretty decent note, and then it entered a downward spiral, teaching me a valuable lesson: \"Never watch an ARMS anime adaptation of a Lynn Okamoto\u00b4s manga ever again.\". Really, does Okamoto even learn from his mistakes? Or he has his head so full of \"Elfen Lied is a masterpiece\" that he just had to write the same thing with the same problems again, adding an alien twist to it?\\n\r\nIt\u00b4s characters range from the forgettable to the utterly annoying, it\u00b4s story cannot be taken seriously due to the amount of stupid comedy and fanservice that it has, added to a shitty ending and Deus ex-Machinas. The art and sound departments are only above average.\\n\r\nA show that ended up being a complete disappointment and is not recommended for those looking something good this season.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been The Neko and I hope that you found this review helpful and that you have a pleasant day, night, or whatever.\\n\r\nThis adorable kitty is leaving the scene.",

            "content": "**UPDATE** Damn this anime is getting bad reviews xD I get that it's similar to Elfen Lied (that's one of my favs) But you should never heavily compare the two even if it is by the same person who wrote it. \r\nThis isn't Elfen Lied. This is a completely different anime. Jeezz people.\r\nHarem & Sci-fi; weird combination, right? But this anime makes it work. I'm usually not a huge harem fan, but this one is a win in my book. Probably because it's not heavily focused on it. I didn't actually expect to like this anime so much. Whether it was the summary or justa feeling; I was wrong. This just blew my expectations!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10- This anime. Wow. Brynhildr has a way of making you think a little. You don't know what's coming next, and when you do, it's twisted into something completely different. Suspense is a high factor in this anime, and it makes it great! There are so many parts you don't expect, but it happens. It could be a funny, perverted scene or a character death. The story never fails to keep you on the edge of your seat!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10- The animation was great. The colors were the basic \"Sci-fi\" type of feel. Nothing is too colorful or bubbly, but more of a darker feel. Which is what you want in an anime like this. Overall fairly simple but pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10- I do admire the OPs very much. The first one was just mysterious music with interesting animation to follow. It really draws you in. the second one isn't probably for everyone since it is almost a metal type. But if you like that genre, than you'll like it too! And the ED is surprisingly cheerful. Which is nice if you have such a dramatic episode. Overall, the music ties everything together.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10- In a mystery themed anime you never really know what to expect in development. But I thought each character had a decent background. Some of the supporting ones are left unchecked, but that's to be expected. The main characters on the other hand, have just enough development that you want to know more about them, but you already have knowledge of them. So it leaves you with more questions than answers, but that's all part of the game, right? >;3\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10- I was about 4 episodes behind before I caught up last week, but woah. This anime hits a home run in everything you expect it to. It shows mystery, hell, the ending definitely does. It's about witches, and as childish as it sounds, the fantasy factor of this anime is anything but child's play. But of course, it is sci-fi themed! The drama will leave you wanting to continue watching to see what happens next. Though there are the perverted scenes, it doesn't seem to fail to make you smile or laugh! In all, this anime was great & probably will only grow in fam ^^ [But at this rate with all the terrible reviews, I'm not so sure]\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10- Loved it and hope many others will agree :3 [they don't lol] But hey, there's over 100 chapters in the manga. So I can only assume another season is heading are way, don't you think? ;)",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this:\r\nI do not like to talk down about anime. I an usually incredibly unbiased and I have an appreciation for every anime released... to some extent.\r\nI don't like to be negative and I don't like to write reviews that could sound hurtful to some people. But with Brynhildr, there is a problem. The problem is that I cannot understand why there are little-to-no contrasting opinions on this anime yet. Everything I've seen/read so far has been generally positive and praising the anime. I don't get it... isn't that unnatural? It's not that great...is it?\r\nNo, it's not. There must besome kind of brainwashing going on here because this is NOT what it's hyped up to be. I have never been so heartbroken by an anime until I started Brynhildr. As early as episode 2 it was already kicking me in the shins. I'm writing this review to protect the rest of you who are anything like me from wasting your time on something that isn't what people say it is.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nWith a writer like Lynn Okamoto (Elfen Lied), I had expectations that this would be a tightly nit, well presented masterpiece with clever and artistic references to various lore and culture. Well... it does that... sort of... but Brynhildr lays it on a bit too thick and really has no idea what it wants to be. I've never seen a story change direction and pace as often and randomly as this. It's way too distracting going from a dark, mysterious, bloodbath, to a cheesy fan-service episode in the next minute like nothing even happened.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of this anime's praise comes from the loyal fans who read the manga. While I haven't read the manga, I can assure you that what they say is true about \"The manga is great! You should read it!\" However... that doesn't change the fact that this is an absolute mess of an adaptation. I haven't read the manga personally, but I can tell this anime has already skipped way too much explanation and jumped to highlights for theatrical effect. With that comes a completely dislodged story line, rapidly introduced characters with little exposition, and a story that just feels cluttered and difficult to follow. It truly is a disaster and I don't know why even the manga fans can't agree that this is not what it was intended to be.\\n\\n\r\nNow maybe you like a story that's got witches and aliens and pharmaceuticals, and sci-fi... and astronomy.... and... happy-go-lucky fanservice, and molesting defenseless paralyzed girls... oh.. and freaking mouth lasers!!! But honestly if they picked ONE concept and stuck with it, this story could have been significantly better. Tasteless is all I can say.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nNot much to say here about the art. It's mediocre. It's not bad but it's definitely not a selling feature. If there's on thing I can compliment, it's that the very median color palette sits right in the middle for the show's dark, bloody aspects and absurd silliness the very next instant. It is exactly average. And it is exactly the kind of hint that what you're getting into is not anything special. At least it's not misleading you by looking absolutely stunning and then delivering a garbage plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nSound effects here and there are sketchy. I hear a decent amount of recycled effects in this anime from cats to gunshots that really don't have a strong feel to them. The music may be the only saving grace with a unique and catchy dubstep-esque OP song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nI really don't want to rant too long about the characters, but all I can say is they are all extremely shallow and not developed enough. They introduce so many characters in the short time this anime is allotted so nobody gets the exposition they deserve. Not even the main character has a convincing back story or motivation for anything that he does involving the characters surrounding him.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the only characters that feel genuine are the girl who's incredibly perverted and lusty. given her short life-expectation I can understand the psychology that would drive her to those decisions. And the paralyzed girl. I'm sure if she could walked, she would've have ditched the other girls by now and found some better friends who don't take advantage of her disability. She seems like the only character who understands the situations that arise, but nobody will give her the credit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nI don't drop anime, ever. I always see it to the end no matter what. But this show tempted me so hard and so early on that I nearly left it at episode 2. As of now, I've only seen 9 episodes, but I plan to finish it out as scheduled. But I don't think these remaining 4 episodes will be strong enough to pull this anime out of the deep hole it's already dug itself into. I can't be swayed any other direction, no matter how amazing the ending might be. I really do not enjoy watching this and I don't see how so many people can claim it's the best of the season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/5\\n\r\nOkay seriously. For me to write a negative review (especially before even completing an anime) is a bad sign. It means something is up. You don't have to agree with my words, but I want you guys to see the other side of the spectrum when all I see is constant glorification for Brynhildr. I simply isn't justified honor. I know there are people out there with similar taste to me and I'm writing this to protect you. I have a group of 5 friends that all watch anime together and we all agree that this is an utter waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nLike me or not, that is what I have to say. I rarely offer my negative opinions, but this needed to be said.\\n\r\nIf you agree with me, I'd greatly appreciate voting this review for helpfulness. If not, I'm sorry I offended you, but there really is no room to only leave positive feedback on something that is clearly not what it's hyped-up to be. Thanks.",

            "content": "I thought overall this was a pretty good series and deserves a decent rating. Not a perfect one but a decent one. I think it suffers most from failing to meet peoples expectations than it does from the product itself. Yes it was rushed but that doesn't make it terrible.\r\nFirst off this isn't Elfen Lied. Yes it's by the same author and has various similarities but it's not meant to be a duplicate and doesn't necessarily appeal to the same crowd. This isn't even really a horror/gore series, Inuyasha had more gore and it isn't considered a gore series. Brynhildr is primarily a dark dramawith light comedy(despite not being tagged comedy).\\n\\n\r\nSecond this series was admittedly rushed and if you read the manga you would have been disappointed that they skipped a significant amount of storyline and character development. Would this series have been better if it was 24 episodes and stuck to the manga? Absolutely, I'd probably be giving it a 10 if that were the case.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the writers perspective it's a toss-up if you were sure you weren't going to get a second season would it be better to make a developed series that stops halfway or a rushed series that's complete. Hard to say, but what I can say is that I've seen complete series that weren't nearly as well developed as this and they weren't getting ratings of 2.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the storyline itself. The basic plot is fairly generic, MC protecting a group of girls from an evil organization of course it has it's own spin on this. Nothing really great or bad there. I do think the blending of comedy and drama was one of the strengths in this series, some may think it was a waste of time in an already rushed series, but that's part of character development. It's the light-hearted comedy moments that endear you to the characters so you actually give a crap when they're about to get killed later. I've seen people complain on other series that all the friends do is rescue each other when they're in danger and never actually have fun so why are they friends to begin with? That's why this series tries to show that they have happy times when they're not fighting to survive. They're lives aren't constant fighting and carnage. If you're looking for nonstop action and gore than your better of watching Deadman Wonderland.\\n\\n\r\nI will say the series had a bit more fanservice than was necessary though I find that to be the case in a lot of series. I thought Murakami was a good lead better than 80% of the MCs I see. He wasn't Lelouch but he was one of the intelligent strategist types and was fairly courageous and competent. Neko was pretty weak and generic overall unfortunately and didn't get much development. I did like Kana and Kazumi in particular both were fairly interesting and had some development. Kazumi in particular lost a lot of development from the manga but still ended up getting more than Neko. Hatsuna on the other hand was introduced at the end and got almost no development. Kotori was pretty annoying, even in the manga, I tend to think the writers didn't bother with her development (for reasons that would be apparent if you watched the series).\\n\\n\r\nThe villains were pretty interesting a stoic mad-scientist trying to play god and a psychotic yandere. Not unprecedented but still intimidating enough to take seriously and a still a better motive than the standard world domination.\\n\\n\r\nI though the art was pretty good again nothing new and amazing but still better than a lot of series. The opening song was a favorite of mine and I thought it fit the series perfectly though the second seemed pretty random and didn't work as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you ignore the manga this is still a good series worth watching, it won't necessarily make your top 10 but its a solid series and still better than most of the stuff out there.\\n\r\nIf you have seen the series I would highly recommend reading the manga because it does have much better pacing and development and very well may make your top 10",

            "content": "From the writers of the famous anime, Elfen Lied, they present you \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\", in my opinion, a failure of an anime for the ages. Have you ever seen an anime that tries to encompass romance, ecchi, psychological, horror, magic action, schi-fi, drama, mystery, and fantasy all in one and fails miserably? Well, look no further, Gokukoku no Brynhildr is certainly one of those anime. One of Gokukoku's many problems was that it couldn't decide which direction they wanted to go with the anime: was it going to be a mystery with love? Or an anime filled with psychological traumas/problems? Or an anime filledwith magic action? Or just a pure ecchi series?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around a simple boy named Ryouta Murakami, who has a photographic memory. As a child, he was in love with his friend, Neko Kuroha who believed in aliens, and claimed to have met them. But Kuroha dies in an accident trying to save Murakami. Filled with guilty, Murakami promises himself not to fall in love with anyone other than his first love and also to find proof of the existence of aliens because of a promise he had made with Kuroneko prior to her death. Then fast forward to the present, and one day, a new transfer student comes to his class, who not only looks a lot like Kuroha Neko, but is named Kuroha Neko and to add onto that, she saves Murakami with magical powers. It turns out that Kuroha along with Kuroha's alliance witches are run-a-way witches who were created by a mysterious organization. These witches need strange pills (that only the organization has) in order to survive, or else their skin melts/spews out blood and they die. Oh, did I mention that the organization is sending other more powerful witches to hunt down the run-a-way witches? Therefore Murakami, who wants to protect Kuroha Neko (and also the other run-a-way witches) in order to find out of Kuroha Neko really is the Kuroha Neko he knew as a child, gets entangled into a witch hunt down death chase.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this type of anime not my favorite to begin with, Gokukoku no Brynhildr really made me cringe. First off, so many unanswered questions. Why did the organization create these witches? No idea. Why did the organization want to hunt them down then? No idea. Okay... Then what was the point of the anime? Um, there was none? I mean it's basically another story that has a few glimpses of terrible, boring magic battle scenes, that shows 2-3 witches swinging their arms around, creating huge explosions, with the addition of Murakami being hit on by all sorts of different girls (witches). I absolutely despise ecchi, and Gokukoku no Brynhildr, a supposedly horror, mysterious anime had tons of it. I don't even want to talk about the ending, because there was no climax, the ending made absolutely no sense, and most importantly, it was unsatisfying to say the least. Overall, the plot jumped around too much, without having a focus point leading to it's messy demise. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't dislike the characters as much as the plot because there was 1 or 2 interesting side characters. But the anime sort of threw out random characters out of nowhere, and then got rid of them just as fast. There was no depth to any characters, except maybe Murakami and Kuroha (but not really). The characters were your average ecchi anime characters. There was the main male character who is an perverted boy that is kind towards other female characters, no matter who they are, therefore causing the other girls to fall in love with him. The main female character who is beautiful, yet reluctant to admit her feelings of the main character. The short, funny, flat-chested female character who messes around the main character (Kazumi, the one character I liked). And, obviously the big-boobed dumb, high pitched voice character that the main character is tempted to \"touch\". The villain and the mysterious organization were nothing really; there was no explanation of them. The entire anime gives us perhaps a 1 minute flashback of the antagonists past that explains absolutely nothing of his intentions or reasons. What happened to the organization in the end? No idea, they just suddenly were dropped at the end of the story, when they were the whole \"mysterious\" focus. And.. in conclusion, I really dislike anime where they make the characters all have different hair color to distinguish upon them; it usually shows the art team's lack of effort to drawing up diversely looking characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay, but it didn't fit the mood of the anime. The anime was supposed to be a horror, mystery anime that maybe had a glimpse of romance between the 2 main characters, yet the art was so colorful, bright, and \"romantic\". I know that some people like the Gokukoku no Brynhildr openings, but I personally did not like the openings, because of it's VERY high pitched dub-step kind of music (1st opening was okay). There is no other worth mentioning soundtrack in the anime. The voicing cast did a decent job, hence giving sound a 5 rating, despite it's lack of any good music.\\n\\n\r\nIn a simple conclusion: I wouldn't recommend this anime to really anyone.",

            "content": "Second chances are not to be wasted, and this is no exception to the anime industry. VAP, Inc. and Arms Corporation took another shot at bringing one of Lynn Okamoto\u2019s works to the big screen and blew its potential once again. Gokukoku no Brynhildr introduces an intriguing mystery and new concept of witches that have a promising start but resulted in something unforgivable with ridiculous plot devices. Because of the eerie OP and attractive plot, it is easy to expect a well-done mystery with proper supernatural aspects. Instead, there are incompetent characters, sorry excuses for villains, and poor pacing that leads to plotholes and alack of character development.\\n\\n\r\nGokukoku\u2019s initial mystery escalates into the supernatural, appearing as something to look forward to. The plot seems suspenseful with a unique concept for witches, who have different powers and live in fear of melting. Unforeseen circumstances brought interest. The characters had their own distinct personalities and unfortunate histories to give high hopes for the story. It was those elements that made me fall for Gokukoku in the beginning, but the show took a turn for the worst. The story became heavily predictable with the same pattern as expected from a harem that consists of a gullible and overly caring male protagonist (Murakami). A so-called powerful witch appears, and Murakami feels the need to persuade her to join the group 90% of the time. This eliminates the potential for suspense and becomes disinteresting. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is so rushed and vague that it ruins the outcome of the mysteries. New info about the MCs is revealed near the end, leaving little time for the viewer to take it all in. A character is supposed to have indestructible powers, but the power is either never shown or is unimpressive with no terrifying element. New characters appear out of nowhere before the current characters have any time to develop. Despite the sudden and distressful situations, there\u2019s no chance to feel sympathy for characters. The finale is extremely disappointing, especially for someone looking forward to a solved mystery. There are several questions left unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing distracts itself with fanservice, resulting in making Murakami a typical love interest. A love triangle develops and creates a silly jealousy game. Virgin talk and awkward erotic moments make the show irresistibly a sight for sore eyes. This withdraws any hope for possible romance within the mystery between Murakami and Neko. The harem aspect is understandable considering the witches' sob stories and dreams of living life as normal human beings instead of experiments. Their interactions with each other and teamwork were enjoyable, especially during drastic moments. However, this progresses into awful characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast made this sci-fi production a complete failure. Villains do not fit the description of someone evil. When they can easily defeat the MCs, they make illogical choices as an excuse to work out in the favor of the protagonist. The majority of the witches introduced as formidable turns out to be harmless. The other characters\u2019 emotions are ridiculous for a serious plot. Either they\u2019re trying too hard to react to a situation or they just don\u2019t care. They sometimes act so calm, cool, and collected that the story doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. They go as far as faking a death with the evidence right beside them. Also, Murakami apparently has such solid gold talents and abilities that he\u2019s invincible to various attacks. One witch became nothing but a dues ex machina character, giving Murakami outside info to further the objective. At that point, the show appears silly and tiring to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent but doesn't help in terms of the story. Character design is fine, and it's good for distinguishing the witches' special features. Some things don\u2019t follow up in the artwork, including the witches standing out as the only students without uniforms. Thanks to a scene with characters using red paint as fake blood, there\u2019s no differentiation between the color of blood and red paint. What\u2019s worse for a series that tries to be all bloody and mysterious? Censorship. So if you want to see a witch melt to the fullest degree, just watch the Wizard of Oz. The animation and action scenes are good, but it becomes pointless to enjoy with the rushed pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST and sound effects are good, but the poor story and characters cause it be plain. Apart from being misleading with the bloody scenes and action, the first OP song is good and a personal favorite. The background music occurred during fighting scenes that ended with characters making stupid moves, so it\u2019s not so memorable. They changed the OP song into a rock song by the 10th episode with the same suspense and action as the first one. By that time, the show is predictable enough to lose any hope of improvement. Characters\u2019 phony reactions disappoint long-awaited moments for mysteries. This is noticeable for scenes that should be highly emotional. Technically, there\u2019s nothing else to say about the seiyuu. Since it becomes normal for wicked witches to develop into sensitive little girls, the changes in their tones fit the script. \\n\\n\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr has countless problems that makes it forgettable. The characters don\u2019t act realistically to situations. The villains make irresponsible decisions that lessens the suspense within the show. More time spent on fanservice than the mysteries results in quick pacing, lack of character development, and a horrible ending. It is a huge disappointment for an interesting mystery. Despite how much VAP and Arms ruined Gokukoku's potential, Lynn Okamoto created an excellent story. Therefore, I recommend reading the manga for better characterization and outcomes.",

            "content": "\u201cJust shut up and show me your armpits\u201d\r\nHaving that as an important and plot relevant quote during the first episode of a show should be more than enough to tell you what you're going to be dealing with for the next 13 episodes. Gokukoku no Brynhildr does not disappoint in that regard. You are treated to a full season worth of ridiculous shenanigans, colorful characters, and downright nonsensical plot devices. Watching this show with your brain turned off is highly suggested since trying to comprehend everything in a logical fashion may turn you into a pile of goo. People who come into this show expectingwell thought out characters and a coherent plot are quite naive in my opinion. One just has to look at the original creator's previous works to understand where it all comes from. \\n\\n\r\nFlashback to 2004...the economy is doing well, we have a strong Republican in the White House, and things seem to moving in the right direction. However, 2004 was also the year that a rather infamous anime aired. Elfen Lied was its name and it has been well known ever since for its excessive usage of nudity, gore, and over the top drama.  Even today it is still discussed by edgy teens and casual anime viewers due to its ridiculousness. Surprisingly, the creator of that has gotten yet another anime adaption. However, unlike Elfen Lied, Gokukoku no Brynhildr lacks much of the over the top drama and suggestive themes. The lack of fetish pandering is another peculiar aspect of this show (provided you don't like armpits), it was highly prevalent in Elfen Lied and is a mainstay in Studio ARMS shows. However, Gokukoku no Brynhildr featured almost none of it. What was also shown was incredibly tame and certainly intended for the more modern TV regulations. In a sense, that would seem to be a huge benefit to the show, but in reality it drags it down to something a bit more plain and mediocre. Skipping out on excessive fanservice or gore in a show like this is a mistake in my opinion since it doesn't have anything else pulling the weight, the usage of cheap tricks such as exploding heads or gratuitous pantyshots are required. Regardless, the story of Gokukoku no Brynhildr shares many likenesses to that of the creator's previous work in the vein of it being young girls with supernatural powers and a shadowy organization behind it all. This is nothing new or groundbreaking so it should be overlooked since it quickly changes from being a backdrop to a main focus in the story throughout the show. Therefore, the story of the show is easily by far the weakest point. It ranges from ridiculous to downright terrible throughout each episode. As previously mentioned, turning your brain off is something that is highly suggested since you can actually enjoy the other parts of the show if you're not focusing on the gaping plot holes and terrible pacing. \\n\\n\r\nIn many cases, characters can make or break a show and in the case of Gokukoku no Brynhildr, they are the one thing holding the show together. The entire cast is likable in their own ways and the interactions between them are enjoyable to watch. However, this does not mean they are without flaws. The characters themselves are poorly thought out and their actions turn the majority of the show into an unintentional comedy. The viewer is often treated to situations where the characters act in downright idiotic ways which can be quite frustrating at times. Regardless, there is a strange sense of charm with the character interactions and it is largely enjoyable. However, as previously stated, the viewer should try to ignore the majority of the plot related character interactions and just focus on the ridiculous shenanigans if you want to enjoy yourself. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to art and sound, Gokukoku no Brynhildr does not stand out in any way. The art feels a bit dated and lacks in detail, most likely due to a mix of budgetary concerns and the source material itself. It is rather inoffensive though and it is on par with what one would expect from a Studio ARMS anime Curiously though, the fanservice that is prominent in ARMS shows is lacking in this show. As previously mentioned, the smut levels have been certainly turned down compared to Elfen Lied and that surprisingly detracts from the overall viewership experience. In addition, the art somehow feels less detailed and cheaper in this more modern show which in itself reinforces the mediocre aura that this anime has. In terms of sound, the seiyuu do a good job in their respective roles and the OST is on point. The sound is something that I will not complain about since it completely acceptable. However, there was a strange change in the opening song starting from episode 10. Some people may dislike hearing the Japanese equivalent of Attack Attack or The Devil Wears Prada, which is completely understandable since can hardly be considered music. For me, it reminded me of the wonderful mid 2000s where I hung around Hot Topic and had glow in the dark pants so I didn't mind it nearly as much. \\n\\n\r\nSaying that you enjoyed something is a tricky situation. Despite all of its glaring flaws, I will admit that I enjoyed Gokukoku no Brynhildr (up until the last episode at least). I probably enjoyed it more than I should have since I actually looked forward to watching it each week. It is certainly a guilty pleasure type show and I would imagine that many other people have a similar opinion of it. I found it to be incredibly funny in parts and the characters were very entertaining. The show was nothing spectacular in any sense, but it was very entertaining even if it was for the wrong reasons. However, if someone asked me if I would recommend watching this show, I would grit my teeth and say no. In the end, memorable shows are either famous or infamous. Gokukoku no Brynhildr is neither of those, I am sure it will be forgotten rather quickly. It just doesn't have enough going for it, negative or positive, to make a mark on the viewer for better or for worse. If you are looking for a coherent sci-fi anime or one with gratuitous fanservice, there are much better options out there.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVEIW**\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr, or \"Bryhildr in the Darkness\", is a Spring 2014 anime brought to us by Lynn Okamoto, the writer of Elfen Lied (which I'll be making a lot of comparisons to), but anyone who has seen Elfen Lied probably would have been able to guess that pretty easily. Why? Because while both of these shows have some great ideas, they are both equally inept when it comes to the concept of tone. They both think that they can show an upbeat fanservice scene centered around jiggling boobs and a brutal/disturbing bloodbath within 2 minutes of each other and act as ifthe transition was seemless. GnB has an interesting story concept and looked to be on the right track at first, but its complete lack of direction prevents it from becoming a good anime; it doesn't know if it wants to be dark and disturbing or happy and upbeat nor does it know what direction it wants to take its plot.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: The story opens with a flashback centered around the protagonist, Murakami, and his infatuation with a girl named Kuroneko, who has an obsession with finding proof that aliens are real. A tragic accident occurs and Kuroneko dies while Murakami is left seriously wounded in the hospital. Years go by and Murakami dedicates himself to finding proof of the existence of aliens in honor of his dead friend. Then, one day, a new transfer student comes to his class, who not only looks a lot like Kuroneko, but is named Kurohaneko. Even though she insists on never having met Murakami before, the girl has superhuman strength and seems to even be able to predict the future; Murikami now has to figure out what the hell is going on.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems with this show is that I feel like I've already seen it; this is basically Elfen Lied with everything toned down. Less fanservice, less \"WTF\" moments, less blood, less action, less everything. They should rename this show Diet Elfen Lied. It maintains all of the same problems that the original had but doesn't have the same shock factor, and since shock factor was basically the only reason to watch Elfen Lied, that is a very bad thing. Additionally, The plot is completely unfocused; it starts with Murakami meeting two witches who are wandering around using their powers to save lives, then that subplot is completely forgotten and the focus switches to trying to keep the witches alive, and then the alien subplot makes a short and random return only to disappear again\u2026 There is simply no direction or consistency to be found in GnB; it comes across as incoherent.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these obvious issues, it should be noted that I actually still liked this show after the first few episodes. It was undeniably flawed, but it was suspenseful and exciting. Now, however, it just feels like a horribly confused Slice of Life show. It has divulged into an extremely predictable hi-jinks-fest as Murakami forms a harem of witches. The plot simply becomes incapable of carrying the show; it transforms into generic fanservice with unbelievably cheesy plot-conveniences at this point (looking at you, episode 9) as Murakami and his harem dick around while creating contrived sexually-awkward situations for comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThat brings us to the characters, who are quite awful. Murakami is the least believable character I've seen in a long time; he has no flaws what so ever and cares about people he just met to an unreasonable extent. To top that off, he has very little personality. Kazumi is just unbelievably aggravating. Her only purpose  is to spew sexual comments and create awkward situations because it's supposed to be funny; it isn't. Kurohaneko is probably the best character, but that's not saying much. She is the only one who manages to both have a personality and not be annoying, so take that for what its worth\u2026 Actually, I take that back; she becomes increasingly annoying because she instantly latches on to every witch she sees and acts like they have been best friends for life despite the fact that they just met and the fact the other witch is, more often then not, trying to kill her. It's not believable in any way and it further perpetuates the fact that the characters have poor chemistry with one another. So in other words, there isn't a single character that I would consider to be good, however there are many I would consider to be bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, GnB tries to take on both serious/mature themes and happy/funny themes at the same time, but ends up with an absolute mess. We have seen shows take on both sides of the spectrum and still be successful before, such as FMA and Darker than Black, but GnB just doesn't seem to know what its doing. I'm often bored watching this show because it fails to illicit any kind of emotional response from the audience at any point; it's not shocking, it's not funny, it's not entertaining (with the exception of a few scenes), it's not anything. Sure, it had a few decently suspenseful moments early on, but there is simply no motivating factor to keep you watching. You could easily just watch Elfen Lied and get the same sort of experience, but multiplied by 5, so what's the point? I don't recommend this show to anyone.",

            "content": "Ah, the age old question: do aliens exist?\r\nIt\u2019s a topic that has been debated for centuries. But for Ryouta Murakami, he\u2019s not looking for aliens to be famous or for science. Rather, he\u2019s looking for aliens because of a childhood past, one that changed his life forever. Gokukoku No Brynhildr (Brynhildr in the Darkness) tells the story of a world involving witches, beings with supernatural abilities that could change everything forever. \r\nFrom the author of the notorious Elfen Lied, Lynn Okamoto puts his ideas to the test once again in this sci-fi and experimental series. The general premise involves the young boy Ryouta who meetsKuroneko, his childhood friend many years ago. For what\u2019s worth, the mystery accelerator kicks in with an event that assumingly killed Kuroneko. In the present, he meets a girl going by the name \u201cNeko Kuroha\u201d with the exact same appearance as his childhood friend. At the same time, it\u2019s known that pursuers from an \u201calien research lab\u201d are going after her. It sets up the cat-and-mouse game where the loser won't get another chance.\\n\\n\r\nEstablishing the show this way easily accomplishes the idea of a cat-and-mouse game. And you\u2019re not wrong if this is your assumption. Throughout the show, their pursuers work ruthlessly to capture Neko regardless of who gets in their way. This is accomplished in various ways either by direct confrontation or sending other witches after them. Either way, the end goal is to bring back witches to their laboratory. Luckily though, the duo gets some unlikely help along the way with other witches such as Kazumi, Kana, and Katori. (the trio K ladies) As witches, each of them possess invaluable abilities that have saved their lives throughout the show. But as a group, they are known as the \u2018Astronomy Club\u2019, founded by Ryouta with the purpose to discover aliens.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall concept of the show is halfhearted to say the least. Given the way the show is planned out, it\u2019s no surprise that some people sees similarity to Elfen Lied. These include the childhood trope, experimentation, and special individuals with abilities. And while the show does have comedy, the dark reality constantly reminds us with the fact that they are being hunted. Initially, there is a prejudice against witches throughout the show. They are viewed as animals, treated like animals, and hunted down like animals. This is all for what they are just for the fact that they have special abilities. In raw form, the show depicts cruel experimentation on the witches behind the background with a twisted sense of horror. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising though given Lynn\u2019s writing. His concepts spawn from the very idea of experimentation with special individuals. What this show focuses on though is how to capture the other witches while Ryouta serves as their guardian. While this seems to be groundbreaking for its portrayal, the show suffers from balance. It\u2019s a clear image the show will have a serious tone such as the OP song featuring bloodied spectrum of character montages. But for delivery, the show indulges itself with awkward comedy. While some of these actually has a purpose with foreshadowing, others are flat out clich\u00e9 with edgy style. Not to mention, sexual innuendos are thrown all over the place with suggestive fan service and cheesy dialogue. In essence, the show makes fun of itself either unintentionally or go over dramatic when it comes to its humor. And this my friends, is not a good idea when adapting a dark story as it\u2019s stupefying in its awkwardness. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the overall setup is the adaptation. With only 13 episodes, the show omits many details based on the manga of the same name. While it doesn\u2019t completely annihilate satisfactory experience to get out of this show, it kills certain aspects of the story through omitting certain characters and story plot. Despite this though, it stays fairly consistent with adapting faithfully. The first episode chooses to deliver a somewhat concise setup with the two main characters introduced and letting the viewers know what they might expect. Hints such as the OP song, various flashbacks, and other dialogues/events gives an impression that the show has other mysteries than meets the eye. These could be related to the mechanics of the show, or more in specifically the machinations of the Witches. Terms such as \u2018harnessed\u2019 (pronounced like \u2018her nest\u2019) and research numbers designates the show as a sci-fi show with experimentation. The witches themselves are also referenced by Norse mythology with their names. But ultimately when it comes down to it, the witches are depicted as clich\u00e9 characters by standards.\\n\\n\r\nThat standard is shown through the relationship that Ryouta forms with them. As a kind and compassionate young boy, he has attracted the attention of the witches he has helped. Even though physically weak, he has the mind of a genius when it comes to devising clever tactics to evade capture. The girls/witches appreciate his efforts and not only earned their respect, but their affections. While some show it innocently with genuine thankfulness, others go with the more aggressive route such as Kazumi. Her ways of trying to get Ryouta to \u201cdo it\u201d is saturated with direct sexual dialogues. On the other hand, Ryouta mostly shows ignorance and passes them off. In most cases, he is focused on survival rather than a relationship. In all though, it\u2019s easy to see who Ryouta is interested in from the beginning just based on the premise. In retrospect, the connection Ryouta builds off with the characters is devoid of characterization but rather with stereotypical characteristics. Even with earnest honesty, the show prides itself with more oddball humor than characterizing its development. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does pass the tests when it comes to action. In essence, the show details battles exclusively with focus on each witch and their potentials. Almost every witch shown in the series shows their ability with emphasis on their strength and weaknesses. The show also depicts them through categories of rankings to even give more consistency. For the action scenes itself, the show focuses on a bit of teamwork and risk. Ryouta is a gambler in the show and can keep viewers at the edge of their seat with his daring moves. In fact, some episodes are cliffhangers that can leave you anticipating what will happen next. Despite this though, some story plot devices are predictable and lacks interest when there\u2019s heavy foreshadowing. Battles are also quick fashioned with a lack of moral sense most of the time except on a few occasions. Nothing to write home about though.\\n\\n\r\nVisually to the eyes, the show is violent when it comes to execution by studio ARMs. Blood is a common sight in the show and as a way to deconstruct some of the innocence of the girls. Other interesting artwork relates to cruel experimentations and the evidence of its shocking factors with extraterrestrial vibes. For character designs, there\u2019s a wide variety as each witch has her own characteristics. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t hide its fan service (besides the censor). Classic onsen episodes are present and jokes are made about boob sizes. To further escalate this concept, characters such as Kotori becomes an epitome of admiration for her \u2018sizes\u2019. We also can\u2019t forget about the jokes that Ryouta has to deal with when it comes to character interactions. How does that tie with service? The witches of course in particular, Kazumi and her mischievousness.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack has some influence on the show although it doesn\u2019t entirely play a huge role. Technical wise, it\u2019s well delivered and takes chances. By that, it means the show mixes comedic tones with darker and somber style for its OST. The result well mixed as the show itself pokes fun at itself. But when it comes to dark, the OP songs are a firm example to stand out on their own. The first OP song (played for the first 9 episodes) is unique with no lyrics but instead illustrate the dark undertone of the show. The second OP song has a similar style but with heavy metal lyrics to again to deliver its message \u2013 to show that the series should be taken seriously in respect. Otherwise, character voice mannerisms are decent. In particular, Kazumi\u2019s kansai accent is noticeable while other times, the show make fun of itself with Kuroneko\u2019s singing. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to adaptations, Gokukoku no Bryhildr is a horrid example for its unsatisfactory balance of comedy and dark fantasy. It\u2019s not mindless entertainment since the show has a premise and follows through it exclusively. But when it comes to humor, the show tries to mutate it into a late night comedy with disastrous effects. On the other hand, the characters offer a diverse category of personalities besides their inadequate development. With an adaptation of only thirteen episodes though, it\u2019s injustice to skip material that should have been there. Ultimately, this show was a bomb, a failure of an experiment.\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I've never seen Elfen Lied so I will not mention that in the review at all. I will review based on just Gokukoku no Brynhildr. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nTo me, the story was very unique. I haven't seen something this new in ages, because most of the anime I've been watching (or re-watching) have been really repetitive. The story wasn't dragging out that much, though there would be happy scenes, then sad/serious scenes repeating in that order (mostly). The anime was very mysterious. I wanted to find out why that happened, or this happened. There is also harem and romance in this anime andthat made the anime a bit better. The comedy (which wasn't tagged in the genres) was mostly about sex and virginity. If you're not into mild gore + romance and harem and you're more into the light-hearted comedy, normal life-type anime, then this anime isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was actually really nice. Very detailed characters, colors were nice and vibrant and smooth animation. Expected for an anime that was produced in 2014. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is played where it's necessary. There's no unnecessary OST playing, or an OST that doesn't mix the scene. The 1st OP fits the dark theme of the anime (the OP vid is really interesting) but I liked the 2nd OP better. I haven't heard an OP without vocals for a while. The ED is calm, to take off the dark theme from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMurakami Ryouta, the male protagonist. He's smart and has a special ability where if he sees something, he will remember that in full detail, like a scanner. He's very kind and would sacrifice his life to save another. \\n\\n\r\nKuroha Neko, a girl that doesn't know a lot like her multiplication tables (lol) and still getting #1 on the finals. As time goes on, she starts to like Murakami. She's really pretty.\\n\\n\r\nSchlierenzauer (sch-ly-ren-za-oo-er i think) Kazumi, a girl who is a really good computer hacker and is smart. As she spends more time with Murakami, she starts to 'want' him sexually. She's really kind and funny too.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana Kana, the girl who can't move anything other than her left hand.\\n\r\nShe communicates with a keyboard. She calls mostly Murakami a molester but occasionally calls Kazumi a rapist. \\n\\n\r\nTakatori Katori, a woman who is fit to be a house wife because of her cooking skills. On first impressions, you will think she is a bad person but inside, she's a very kind girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why, but I would be skipping to parts of the anime. It wasn't boring at all, but I guess I'm really used to skipping. I would've watched this anime in one sitting, but of course I have to sleep too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very nice, even though it's getting bad reviews. Would I re-watch it? Definitely.",

            "content": "Gokukoku no Brynhildr or Brynhildr in the darkness is the anime adaptation of a manga created by the same mangaka who did the famous Elfen Lied. The show talks about an \"ordinary boy\" who comes in contact with girls called witches. Witches have some kind of power, every witch has it's own. So basically this guy meets a witch that looks like his lost childhood friend tries to help her and gets a harem.  \r\nStorry: The story is basically just like elfen lied only the girls have different powers, there is not much originality and much things are not clearly explained. The guy whofirst looks like an ordinary boy turns out to have photographic memory and stuff. The pacing is off and the switches between \"tragic\" moments and harem/comedy moments were too random and ruined the mood (that was not great to begin with). Latter on the story just becomes inconsistent, things come out of fuc*** nowhere just for the \"shock factor\" but at that point the whole thing is already so stupid you don't care anymore.  \\n\r\n1/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound : The only thing in the show I have no complains about. I mean it was not something great but it was not bad either. The sound was ok I guess, nothing memorable. The first OP was good the second one was pure trash, the OP was even used as part of the soundtrack. I forgot every single OST 30 min after completing the show, that shows how good it was.  \\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : Ordinary teenager with photographic memory which makes him immune to memory erasing? He suddenly comes up with amazing strategies that makes him look smart or some shit. He was the classic alpha male who gets bitches by acting as a hero. The girls were classic stereotypes , not much personality, the only thing I will remember of them is their naked bodies .  \\n\r\n2/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Probably the worst anime I have ever seen and I have seen about 800 at the time  am writing the review. This was worse then Mars Of Destruction and I am not kidding, this show is pure trash that should never be watched.  1/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall : Really bad show with stupid asspulls annoying characters and a story that does not make sense 70% of the time( the other 30% is the fanservice/harem moments)  \\n\\n\r\n1/10 - Don't touch this piece of poo.",

            "content": "Gokukoku no Brynhildr is a very cleverly disguised harem in the skin of a bleeding magician.\r\nThe show is a clear example of a unique set of characters with great potential placed at the mercy of a poorly written plot and forced to move with it. This is evident in multiple parts of the anime whenever a plot point is introduced only to be glossed over. While this isn\u2019t entirely noticeable at first glance, it becomes a reoccurring phenomenon that leaves the audience wondering \u201cwhy?\u201d \r\nOne of the weakest points of the show is the lack of impact the supporting cast (Kogorou, Chisato, Nanami, etc) hason the state of mind and motivational force of the main character. Almost every time they are introduced the main characters neither learn nor gain anything other than restating their raison d\u2019etre and passing them off with little reflection. Furthermore, one of the worst offenses is having them being reduced to a simple plot device to conveniently move the main cast in a certain direction. When the show takes a turn toward the darker end of the spectrum the supporting cast seem to be conveniently present at times where the main characters need them the most. Then, as if to add salt onto the wound, emotional thresholds become melodramatic and seemingly misplaced. The main characters, namely Murakami, Kuroha, and Kazumi start acting as if they are on a checklist to cry at a given point of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to call GnB dark and grim especially when we have death left and right. Though, the blood, melting, and secret organization are only a pretense to call it a \u201cdark\u201d show. Unfortunately, the show\u2014in its vain attempt to show us tragedy\u2014doesn\u2019t build the right emotional motivation for us to feel attached to their characters. Because while supporting cast have attachments to the main cast, they served to do little in expressing the latter\u2019s growth, thereby preventing the audience from vicariously feeling the main character\u2019s loss. This is due to the poorly-written plot not making use of the supporting cast. In the end, the show leaves their deaths as an afterthought that forces us to simply accept the outcome and think \u201cThank god it wasn\u2019t ______ who died.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show isn\u2019t unique\u2014and I\u2019m sure many have seen the clich\u00e9 of the \u201cstubborn MC\u201d who will \u201cdo all he can to protect these people\u201d from some \u201cevil organization\u201d bent on doing some sort of \u201cevil on the world.\u201d What the story does do a good job of is making a common theme their own by twisting it into something familiar, yet new. It piques the audience\u2019s curiosity by introducing a variety of powers specific to certain \u2018magicians\u2019 and having them categorized by strength. What makes the story more redeeming is Murakami and the group\u2019s combination of their weaker powers to overcome seemingly impossible odds, not simply relying entirely on ass pulls. And though the planning stages, as well as the transparency of their plans aren\u2019t always revealed immediately (which at first seems to set itself up as an ass pull) becomes a refreshing sight to see how things do work out when they pool their assets. \\n\\n\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr vainly introduces far too much to create their world and it resulted in disaster. Towards the end we are left with a bitter taste in the mouth with many loose ends and far too little questions answered. \\n",

This is from the point of view of a person who was previously reading the manga before the anime was announced. \r\nTHIS REVIEW WILL BE STRICTLY BASED OFF OF THE ANIME!\r\nStory: The plot is not very well defined and is easily misinterpreted, I was lost multiple times watching this anime and it constantly felt like there were missing gaps as I watched the anime. The plot is an static plot of basically 1 antagonist who have many underlings who will do their bidding pressuring the existence of the main protagonist. Don't getme wrong this main sound very boring and done multiple times but the character development happening during roughly the first 7 episodes are pure gold. After the beginning where every thing was nice, then the downfall of the anime occurs. They attempt to finish as much as they can within the 13 episode time frame causing difficulty understanding the anime as they have to ignore the important parts which helped the anime succeed after a while (character development).\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style really suits the anime in my opinion, but it is average in general.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The timing for the background music was very well done and I really enjoyed it all, I did have a slight problem with their choice of opening theme songs as I personally prefer songs that have singing. Other than that slight problem it was well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There was a lack in character development in my opinion,  the entire story was too rushed for many development to occur. Also there were so many missed opportunities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed the first 7 episodes or so, it was amazing to finally be given a chance to watch one of my favourite mangas turn in to anime. The timing for a good portion of the events were well timed and the use of music within the scenes came together really nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The anime is very unfriendly to their viewers as it provides: \\n\r\nLiittle to no character development occurs due to the fact that the wanted to fit as much as they could in the small time frame given. Normally this wouldn't be as BIG as a problem but what they did was executed poorly due to the anime needing character development as it is one of the main selling points of the anime...\\n\\n\r\nRushed events that are difficult to understand once again this is due to their given time constraints but if I were to suggest an idea, I would have stopped earlier within the anime but added more character development through small events.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest for all who has watched this anime to give the manga the chance if you really enjoyed the anime and want more.\\n",

One of the girls trying to escape some how ends up in our generic protagonists astronomy club, then he hunts more of them. Soon enough, poof! Harem happens- obvious fact. Now whose ready for SHOCK FACTOR!\r\nREVIEW:\r\nLets start of with what most people flip there Kenichi's about... the gore factor... AKA- SHOCK FACTOR: \r\nAt least in Elfen Lied they show fully uncensored gore and nudity, it was special back then because the gore mixed with the portrayal of nudityand emotions of the characters with there harsh situations allowed us to at least sympathize with what there forced to do. Violence in present, have become mainstream of the years which looses it effect. In Brynhildr, they censored it because it was aiming for that mainstream garbage! It shows no respect of the audience as the characters have some crazy super powers to be used as plot armour, in fact, there completely one liner or worded and 100% archetype designed personalities is sufficient evidence that the show puts over there cool super powers over personalities which doesn't make anyone care! It maybe cool at first, but hear me out:\\n\r\n Don't know what\u2019s going to happen next? See into the future! About to die? Regeneration! About to get killed? use Mind Control! All of this makes everything feel very forced and lack maturity. It lacks the realism and grey morality compared towards its older sister, at least the Horn Girls in Elfen kill people for survival as they are all being mistreated by man kind, which is totally understandable, but in here! The girls don't attack anyone because being captured means they're being tortured and experimented in this unethical manner if they come back to secret HQ laboratories. So they insist to runaway! As there only option, which limits a lot of interesting possibilities to make the show, \u201cBetter\u201d\\n\\n\r\nComparing towards the show's fan service terminology:\\n\r\nAt least in Elfen we had the girls stripped to show an excuse that they are in physical or psychological torture, girl gets sexually abused by step Dad, girl gets horribly experimented on scientists through torture to advance technology etc. In Brynhildr's mind, we had to throw Boob Jokes, Forced Bath Scenes, and girl wants to sleep with guy naked but no hentai. Because, harem, as this show is trying to make us sympathize from the harsh lives of the characters? Or trying to turn us on? Oh, wait, its both. (doesn't mix well btw)\\n\\n\r\nAt least our Harem lead in Elfen (though very generic) seems to be an incredibly kind person, nor he is the brightest or the most cunning; he's just this vanilla guy that all chicks are forced to live. The Murakami dude is a douche! He apparently seems to appear very smart and has well thought out plans but turns out that he's entire thought process was completely retarded as almost every plan fails, it feels as if he's actually getting dum! He also makes boob jokes and trying to always tries to look smarter than everyone else for every chance he gets. He is at first, calm, sophisticated and intellectual, but turns out to be rather pretentious. The first opening was good, having some refreshing dubstep, but then I listen to ear rape like ten episodes in which was completely unnecessary for a 12 episode series! Aesthetically, its just some action and nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nVERDICT:\\n\r\nIn a nutshell its just plain stupid logic... Unlike its older sister which had a decent amount of depth and respect towards audience, Brynhildr is STUPID, all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n6/10 Nothing special at all... It gets the job done in an above average manner.\\n\r\n5/10 Completely forgettable OST except for the 2 openings which saves me for giving it a minus point.\\n\r\n2/10 For super stupid characters!\\n\r\n2/10 By via forced storytelling.\\n\r\n1.5/10 With absolutely no redeeming factor except for the slightest deviants...\\n\\n\r\n2/10 For the obvious reasons!",

            "content": "tl;dr: Garbage story, so bad its like how you can't help but watch a trainwreck. Only reason to watch this show is if you like harem anime since the characters are awfully designed, but still very interesting and entertaining to watch.\r\nThis show's story is one of the worst things I've ever seen. So many plotholes, illogical decisions, and unreasonable situations even if there's people with superpowers involved. Most of the series is spent on fanservice rather than the plot so at this point, I might as well rate it as a harem and just ignore the story they seem to pretty much ignore for alarge portion of the show. It doesn't help that the overall plot they're trying to tell is convoluted as all hell with more twists than an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It eventually becomes so bad, you want to see how much worse they can make it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are pretty good, consistent with about what you'd expect from a good anime, which, with this show's plot, is actually amazing in comparison. There's no spectacular CGI or 60 FPS animation or anything of that sort, its just the regular stuff done well.\\n\\n\r\nI can't even recall if there were any pieces playing other than the OP and ED. The ED was relatively generic so I chose to ignore it. The first OP was kinda of good, at least it was interesting since most anime have lyrics and not pseudo-dubstep for their OPs. The second OP, which started like 8 or 9 episodes into the series for some reason, literally assaulted me, that's all I have to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly if you look at this show as a harem and not a show with any sort of meaning or story what so ever, it becomes rather enjoyable as the characters are rather well designed and one character in particular has a very unique and, uh, \"passionate\" personality that is probably the only reason I'm still watching this show. The MC is oblivious as all hell like in most harems but at least he has a favorite and can make a choice, thank god.\\n\\n\r\nSee tl;dr for overall opinion.",

            "content": "Before I continue this review, I'd like to point out the fact that I have, indeed, read the manga up to the point at which the story in the anime ended, and I will try my best not to compare the two, though it is near impossible, considering how much better it could have been with a true-to-the-manga following, instead of the anime original ending we have at hand.\r\nFirst, let me go into some brief background. Gokukoku no Brynhildr, better known as Kiwaguro no Brynhildr, which is the name of the manga series that served as the source material the anime was based on, waswritten by the same author who wrote Elfen Lied. As a result, many people can see how similar the concepts that are used, as well as the character archetypes that are expressed in the two series's. Elfen Lied suffered from a terribly executed anime original ending, and whereas Gokukoku no Brynhildr should have learned from this original mishap, it suffers from a arguably worse anime original ending than Elfen Lied did, and coupled with the numerous other defects present in its almost jokingly terrible plotline and execution, it deserves a much lower score than its predecessor and accomplished much less.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move onto the categories.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nLet's begin with an analysis of the plotline. The main character, Murakami-kun, is a genius with photographic memory, and comes upon a \"witch\" that resembles his childhood friend, and he chooses to save this witch from persecution from the laboratory from which they escaped, along with multiple other witches. The backstory isn't bad, and is actually fairly interesting. It makes you question: What is the mystery of the lab that we are about to find out, and how is it related to why these witches are being persecuted?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with further delving into the events that happen during the plot, you find that Brynhildr only devolves into a pseudo slice of life with gore in it, during which the only interesting things that happen include listening to Kazumi's heavily accented voice and her proclamations of how horny she is and how much she wants to have Ryota's children.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was another giant factor that becomes the downfall of this anime series - after dillydallying in the world of Kotori-chan's breasts and Kazumi's nonexistant ones for numerous episodes while providing minimal main plot development, the series tries to wrap itself up in the final 2 and a half episodes, cramming about 30 chapters of work into roughly an hour of showtime. As a result, the ending was inevitably rushed, and changed from the original manga arc's ending, cutting away important developments, like Ryota's presence right beside Kotori as she was ejected, or Kana's part in saving Neko and Ryota from Valkyria.\\n\\n\r\nAnother blaring issue that the storyline had was the completely forced and manufactured plot. Rather than letting events unfold, and letting characters deal with problems as they normally would in an intelligent way, a tragedy happens, a character gets godlike status, and the problem is solved. This same formula is repeated numerous times throughout the episode, with deus ex machinas being pulled again and again and again from the writer's toolbox. I admit, this isn't just an issue with the anime adaptation, the manga suffered from it as well, whether it be Ryota's unerasable photographic memory, or Kotori's ability to stop all kinetic energy of the person she switches with when she switches places with someone using her teleportation ability. These scenes, however, show how stupid and contrived the plot actually is, which makes any plot progression feel forced and unrealistic, along with just plain uninteresting, because the audience can just assume that some character will exhibit some extreme new aspect of their power that will be able to easily solve any problem thrust in the main character's way, time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art was decent. The version I saw incorporated censoring in the form of fog in all the gory scenes (like the melting scenes or cut up bodies), that was almost as terrible as the Funimation censoring used for Freezing, but most other elements were handled fairly well. Certain scenes did feel awkward, however, and the characters did appear bland and uninteresting at times when actual plot development happened, leading me to believe most of the budget was spent on the unnecessary fanservice present throughout the entire length of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe sound quality was decent, and the opening sequence for the first 10 or so episodes was actually quite catchy, as dubstep openings aren't as prevalent in the Japanese music industry in general. The second opening, with its more heavy metal air, was also fairly interesting, and the ending provided a sense of calm after the gory events that happened in the episode. There wasn't anything particularly special about the OST- it was basically what you would expect from any other science fiction anime title with explosions and laser beams. The voice acting, however, was fairly subpar - none of the emotions that the characters felt that should have been communicated to the audience got through, and at times when some screaming and emotion should have been prevalent, the screaming and name-calling just felt noisy, and might have been better off with just silence and streaming tears. As a direct reference to one of these scenes, when Murakami was sliced in two in episode 12, Kana's fervent typing (which translates to speech through her superintelligent text to speech converter device) didn't serve much purpose, and actually distracted (and annoyed) me from a supposedly shocking scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nThe worst portion of the anime. Unique and interesting characters drive the plot of the anime, and without these, the plot simply can't function to be anything intellectual or even seemingly interesting. Every single character written in the series only had one of two purposes. 1. To be part of Ryota's harem or 2. To be killed brutally and horribly. All those who were part of the harem cannot act, or think for themselves - they are merely piles of meat that idolize Ryota and dream of mating with him - as literally and clearly expressed by Kazumi multiple times throughout the series's length. All those who die, end up as terrible emotional triggers that are supposed to attract the gore fetishists, or pull at the heartstrings of the sensitive - neither of which is possible with the terrible censoring and insignificance of any individual character that appears to die in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nNo doubt, my interest in the manga, and the failed expectations I had for the show before I entered it influenced my enjoyment levels, but nonetheless, if you don't enjoy random fan pandering and cardboard characters in your serious piece of science fiction with a dark plot and atmosphere, then you probably won't enjoy this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThis show suffers from the same problem that Elfen Lied did, except it doesn't solve this problem - it only makes it worse, in the worst way. All the calm and peaceful slice of life that happened in the show, much like the slice of life present in Elfen Lied, serves little to no purpose, and none of the characters are likable enough to feel emotion for when he or she happens to be caught up in tragedy. The show tried to juxtapose the gory and dark elements of the show's main plot, with the lighter elements of the show, but it was a doomed project from the beginning, and would have been much better off holding the male hormone tease and spending more time with the main storyline and illustrating all the mystery aspects it promises to address in the first episode, up till the last. At least with Elfen Lied, there was a sense of \"oh, wow, that was an intense ending, left open for us to wonder at and reflect on our own what the show was supposed to represent.\" With Gokukoku no Brynhildr, the only thought I'm left with is \"What the heck happened I don't even know what I'm supposed to be feeling Can somebody take me to the doctor please The manga was 1000% better even though I didn't even like the manga that much please Brynhildr what happened to Kazumi you didn't even tell me at the end Why did Neko have to lose her memories Why is Ryota so unkillable and such a badass and Why did I even choose to watch this adaptation.\"",

            "content": "Huge disappointment, possibly the biggest of the year. \r\nI'd previously written a more positive review of this one as I was about 6 episodes in. Even then I'd seen troubling signs that it could turn out terrible, but I thought it could fix itself before the problems grew to become excruciating. It took a 100% dive.\r\nThe first episode leads off nicely, and the second one stirs up even more suspense and seems to get some character progression going. \r\nFrom here it seems to really lose all direction. \r\nThere are some nice elements setting up for alot of possibilities but it's like the writer didn't knowwhat to do with it or realized the plot wouldn't be able to fit in just 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually not easy to point out exactly where we run off track with the story and the story just ends up following the characters' random ways of life. Characters which are stereotypes to the core, and the main character comes off as this pretentious image that the writer tries to glorify themself in. The only real character traits you can say he has, are that he's got photographic memory and he just wants to selflessly protect and save these girls. A forced white knight protagonist, devoid of any shade of identity. Oh, and important to mention, is that all his crying moments are so cringeworthy, your toe nails could dive into your skin and grow out in-between your teeth. These characters and especially the protagonist are so painfully pretentious and one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls... Besides that they're obvious stereotypes, the real offender is their interaction with eachother, and namely while the protagonist is in the room.\\n\r\nI'd tell you to pay attention to the way they talk, and notice how it feels like looking at otaku's in a small chat trying to establish themselves as these stereotypes IRL. \\n\r\n\"I think I'm more like X character, 'cause in my mind, my daily life just like that. I'm totally like this character. That is until I watch another anime and think I'm like Y character in that one.\"\\n\r\nBasically everyone goes; \"I can out-otaku you any day\".\\n\\n\r\nI do kinda still commend it for at two instances breaking an old and grating tease so often seen in anime... But then again, in hindsight, that might also just be to please the writer's ego.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame, 'cause it actually led off with an interesting start but it just became more like a bad fan fic. \\n\r\nWatching it, I so often feel like I'm actually just looking at the writer masturbate profusely while spouting their self-proclaimed excellence. \\n\r\nAnd what supports this, is the fact that this short anime has two openings, with the second one feeling very rushed and ill fitting. It's really crammed in with the last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is the first opening theme, which is quite interesting. It also feels like this was written, inspired by said theme. Especially with the soundtrack within the show seeming to rip it off.\\n\r\nAnd talk about ripping off... The first opening sequence really feels like it's taking alot from Mirai Nikki, and the main 'love interest' of the show, is really by design just a blue haired Makise from Steins;Gate, in an outfit that looks like it's borrow from Homura from Puella Magi. But it might just be me imagining things.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really not much good to point out in this one. You can safely skip it.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nGokukoku was written by Lynn Okamoto, the same mangaka that wrote Elfen Lied and was animated by Studio Arms, which also produced Elfen Lied. Is Gokukoku no Brynhildr The second coming of Elfen Lied? In a word...no. If you loved Elfen Lied, you will hate Gokukoku. If you thought Elfen Lied was terrible, you will think this is worse. If you were impartial towards Elfen Lied, you will hate Gokukoku. This series fucking sucks!\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story begins with our young protagonist Murakami and his childhood friend Neko out watching the stars. Neko is an unusual little girl that believes in aliens and wishes to provetheir existence to the skeptical and logical Murakami. While playing on the face of an old dam, Murakami falls and accidentally pulls down Neko with him. He wakes up in the hospital and is told that she died. Devastated by this news, he devotes his life to proving aliens exist in her honor. This is an odd vow for a supposedly logical and brilliant character to make, since he doesn't believe in aliens, but the story hasn't actually begun to get bad yet at this point! An evil government organization is creating super human magic users creatively called \"witches\". Each witch gains her power from a device in her neck called a harness, which contains an alien parasite. If the device is removed, the witch melts into goo as an homage to the wicked witch of the west. Witch after witch keep escaping the facility and finding Murakami, who takes them in to protect them. On the surface, this seems to be a rather similar plot to Elfen Lied, but if you look closer you will notice some differences. In Elfen Lied the director of the clandestine government group wishes to wipe out humans because he is actually a mutant and wishes to be the God of a new race that he views as superior. He is a mix of Magneto and Hitler. However, most of the other government members in Elfen Lied are unaware of this plot and truly believe that they are protecting mankind from the mutants, who often do lash out at humans. The mutants aren't evil, but are realistically what you  would expect from psychologically damaged children with dangerous super powers. In Gokukoku the government group is simply evil and wishes to wipe out humans for no discernible reason. For the lulz I guess. There is no level of moral ambiguity or complexity. In Elfen Lied we had the moral struggle of Kurama, but here we just have a sick bastard named Director Ichijiku who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The witches have been tortured and experimented on their entire lives, but only a few lash out in anger and use their powers to get revenge. Most of the witches are extremely pure and un-corruptible, and give the government no reason to hunt them, other than the fact that the government is evil. Once again, there is no level of complexity, nothing remotely thought provoking, no questions on the nature of good and evil. The series simply goes on with more and more bland and forgettable chicks arriving at the observatory. The manga is still going, so the anime had to create its own ending. Elfen Lied chose to end with an open ending and leave several points up to viewer interpretation with only subtle hints to help. Gokokoku tries to wrap everything up in a couple episodes and becomes an incoherent mess of nonsense with one of the worst, most anti-climactic endings I have ever seen in the history of animation! The only competition would be from some of the old Soviet cartoons where the State Film Department would simply pull the budget at random and give the animators a few days and a few hundred bucks to make an ending. That's what this fucking looked like! Of course not quite as epic as the final battle in The Snow Queen (1957), which consists of a little girl shouting \"Go Away!\" Villain disappears with cheap dissolve effect, END. Gokokoku was made in 2013 with a substantial budget though, so I won't go easy on it by comparing it to a cartoon from the Stalin Era Soviet Union.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Murakami, who is one of the best students in Japan. He has a photographic memory and is devoted to xenobiology. He is a pure good guy with no real internal struggles and nothing that actually makes him interesting. He is simply very bland. The main heroine is Kuroha Neko, who at times goes into \"tsundere mode\" for a tired comedy gag that is repeated ad nauseum, but mostly is just boring. She knows she faces imminent death, but simply shrugs it off with an inexhaustible level of optimism that would baffle even Vanille from Final Fantasy 13. Vanille is a deep, compelling, and tortured character compared to Neko. We have Kana, who is quadriplegic, speaks with a voice simulator, and exists solely as a plot device that predicts future events and allows our heroes to escape trouble. We never hear about how her condition effects her attitude or learn about her struggles. She is simply given ZERO development! She would at least have gotten a few laughs if they had used the Stephen Hawking voice program for her character, but that would require Gokukoku actually doing something right. The worst character though is Kazumi, who exists only for fan service in a series that is afraid to show any nudity. To make matters worse, she is one of the most obnoxious characters in all of anime. Yuka in Elfen Lied was quite obnoxious at times, but at least she was following a childhood crush and actually realizes her own flaws. Yuka also acts as part of a love triangle and has a purpose within the framework of the shows plot. Kazumi on the other hand, simply has no reason to exist.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is sort of decent, but many of the characters look the same. The animators just change the hair color and boob size. That's it. All vehicles are done with HORRENDOUS CGI that at least adds unintentional hilarity to this otherwise bland series. The animation is not very fluid and is quite lackluster. This came out in 2013 and looks FAR worse than Elfen Lied did in 2004. What the FUCK happened Studio Arms!!? You will also notice that any nudity and gore is edited out with a distracting bright, white light that burns your eyes and completely removes you from the show. If you are going to painfully edit in a style that would make 4kids blush, why bother having gore and nudity in the first place! The nude scenes don't add anything to the series and could easily be taken out, but they are mysteriously left in and completely fail to accomplish their purpose of erotica and fan service because they are so severely edited. This makes about 1 hour of a 5 hour series completely un-watchable, with vague silhouettes and a bright light borrowing into your eyeballs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are no good openers or closing themes. The best thing I can say is that one opening is unintentionally funny by clashing death metal growls with the cutely animation of this series. It is clearly trying to be like the 2nd death note opening and failing at an EPIC level. The background music is so bland and forgettable that I have seen porn with a better soundtrack! Elfen Lied had Lillium, one of the best opening themes in all of anime. It had also had some chilling, disturbing tracks that sounded like Arnold Schoenberg composed them. Elfen Lied had an A+ soundtrack, Gokukoku has a D- at best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes look like this series might at least be mildly enjoyable. Afterwards this series is about as fun as repeatedly punching yourself in the throat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nGokukoku is absolutely wretched, but I have actually seen far worse. What makes this series painful is that I actually loved Elfen Lied and expected something a shit load better than this! The problem is that Lynn Okamoto by himself is actually a pretty bad writer. He has some good ideas, but without a good editor he can't execute them. With Elfen Lied he also stole characters and plot points from X-men, Crime and Punishment, and Phantom of the Opera. That was essentially what actually made Elfen Lied good in the first place. It felt like a modern variant of an 1800s psychological drama/gothic horror mixed with X-men. It was a delightful potpourri that actually worked thanks to the editing and vision of the brilliant series Director Mamoru Kanbe. In Gokukoku, Okamoto stole from himself and tried to reuse parts of his previous plot without adding any of the themes, struggles, or messages that made Elfen Lied work. Gokukoku actually had a highly esteemed director named Imaizumi that also directed Mushishi and Ano Hana, which are both extremely praised on this site. However, Mr. Imaizumi's style completely clashed with Okamoto's writing and Imaizumi was not able to take the salvageable parts and create his own vision like Kanbe did. Gokukoku is like the hollow shell of Elfen Lied that has lost its very soul. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you REALLY hate that person!\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Elfen Lied comparison complaint, grumble grumble, fanservice, grumble grumble, I'd pardon this if it was cool like Shingeki no Kyojin but it's not, grumble, I'm so much smarter than the Sci-Fi genre.\"\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr is exactly what you expected it was; An action-based thriller prematurely adapted from a manga by the same person who wrote Elfen Lied. So why are you so upset? The characters are static and flat, plot threads that should have been wrapped up quickly continue onto the last few episodes, and the art seems almost barbaric when comparing it to more visually stunning shows that aired simultaneously. It has the tropeof harem where it doesn't necessarily need one, there's a significant amount of ecchi scenes that seem awkwardly jumbled into the rest of the series, and all the women are literally helpless without the main character. Yes, the show is sexist and strives to enthuse the male audience. The only person I have to blame for this one is you. This is exactly what you asked for.\\n\\n\r\nWithout all the sex and violence that sells Blu-Rays and DVDs, this anime wouldn't be a blip on any consumer's radar. There's nothing to separate Shingeki no Kyojin and this anime. The writing is about the same, leading the viewer on with very obvious plot threads only to confirm them true after 12 episodes of meandering. There's intense gore at the expense of our poorly-fleshed out cast, and the hyperviolence depicted in this series only continues to prove Elfen Lied's point that it so desperately tried to make ten years ago. People want to be shocked. They want to watch something that leaves them agape. This show lets people watch something dark and primal. It's the closest thing to sweet sweet revenge like Lucy got in response to her dog \"prank\" in Elfen Lied. And it's just winking enough to let the viewers be okay with it. The only thing Brynhildr is missing is the top notch visuals. If Brynhildr had the budget Shingeki no Kyojin did, it could be what SnK is right now - unquestioningly popular.\\n\\n\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr is endlessly entertaining. It's edgy and brooding in all the comical senses of the words. People don't just die in Brynhildr, their bodies bleed to death, then melt to oblivion, and then an alien carcass crawls out of them only to be squashed like a pesky bug. It's absurd! The show borrows all sorts of Sci-Fi concepts for it's main heroines, from predicting the future, to body swaps, to cybernetic transformation and secret underground facility conspiracies, and never ever apologizes about it. That might be why I'm so partial to Brynhildr. It's swaggering and confident. It's never pretentious and always is self-aware. In fact, when explaining to the main character why the main female lead has superhuman strength she simply tells him, because of \"surgery and drugs.\" That's all I really needed. The script is justifiably quip.\\n\\n\r\nBrynhildr is the hyperviolent, misanthropic, edgy grimdark show you want to hate yet the writing works in such a way that you feel slightly optimistic for the cast, for the show, and for the world. Brynhildr isn't new, and as many critics have ingeniously surmised, it's incredibly close to Elfen Lied. Yet there's an X factor in Brynhildr, and that X factor is that small bit of hope, that at the end of the tunnel there's happiness for these characters that seem to repeatedly have the deck stacked up against them. You can tell this show is unforgiving walking into it and characters will suffer. You just want to know which ones. You hope and hope that something happens so that they're ALL spared, and can have a normal school life. Your favorite parts of the episode are probably when the ecchi things happen, giving you a moment of relief - an aside from all the death talk and inevitable decay of the cute girls on screen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is what this show is about. It dangles it's serene and oversexed nymphs in front of you like a worm to a fish, and you're on the hook. It pulls the misanthropic bait away and you're left in the dark ocean again to witness the murder, the decaying flesh, the real teen angst of it all. And you're mad again. You hate the ecchi scenes! You hate the dark edginess! You hate the whole goddamn thing and there's nothing to like about this show at all! But there is and you keep coming back. You just hope that these misfits on screen achieve some sort of rational happiness. And whether they do or not doesn't matter in the end, I guess, but as long as you're watching think about that. Think about why you're appalled or entertained and how this show treads that thin line.\\n\\n\r\nIf you hated it all, good. You're a good person. If you liked it all, why? Are you a bad person?\\n\\n\r\nAnd, ahem, did you like Shingeki no Kyojin?",

            "content": "Oh well Gokukoku no Brinhyldr, what can I say? Well like most viewers what drew me at first to this anime was it was spawned from the creators of Elfen Lied, therefore one usually infers it'll be on par with an anime as great as Elfen Lied. The truth however is that despite some similarities between the two these anime should not be used at all when assessing its rating, for the most part.\r\nStory \r\nThe overall story as a series of events, is in fact quite mediocre. Sure the plot was presented in a not so flawed way and had considerably less plot holes thanmany more anime out there. However, the plot development is  very bland and its action points become extremely anticlimactic as the story progresses. Whenever a problem is introduced the overall sequence will be the same. Problem, no solution (everyone is gonna die), Plan, plan fails, no solution, Oh well, miracle we're all saved. When a series does this repeatedly it is very harmful to its plot development basically because it negates change and continues as if nothing had happen, which leads to that precise feeling. Due to this the overall story can be considered pretty mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was in my opinion superb and very well adjusted for what the creators were portraying. The only point that was off was probably the simple point that the female characters could be distinguished by their facial features just as easily as by their respective cup sizes. (Note* FanService will be discussed in the Enjoyment section)\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nOpenings and Ending are pretty decent overall, though the soundtrack throughout the anmie is able to fit with the the respective moods of the scene in which they are played it is not overly great. Unlike in its anime sister Elfen Lied, you will not be moved by the soundtracks used and they play no key role in the perception one gets of the scene in which its played there fore giving a rating of 6 (fair).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are mostly female and there is only one main male character. As expected from this setup there is a form of love triangle going on even if its not the main focus of the anime. Characters however have a very slow and steady development that differs lightly from their initial sight on the world when you think about it. Any devlopment that was made available in other character by events such as death are quickly negated as the death reverts itself. Do to this type of loops there is very little character development and it leads to a feeling of blandness and lack of progress. Due to this the characters in this series are very plain and poorly constructed relying on one or two ideas for each characters entire foundation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime although short, provides a steady stream of entertainment which can only be described as a grin factor. This means that although bland and lacking depth one is able to enjoy the which is should in all instanced, be it comedic, dramatic, or in a few cases even romantic. A key port of the grin factor in its comedic portions is that some of them are founded quite clearly of FanService (FS), although this series is full of FS it incorporates it into what little character development it has allowing for its digestion as something other than just beautifully animated boob physics. Although usually this type of FS is considered distracting and unnecessary this series manages to squeeze it in a \" Its just out there be mature about it\"  sort of way.  Because reasons such as this one is able to thoroughly enjoy this greatly entertaining series allowing for a 9/10 rating.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nThere is little depth to characters in the show, there are plot holes all over the place, key events are anticlimactic. Due to this Gokukoku no Brynhildr is a great series to watch WHEN you just want to take your mind of something and dwell in a fictional universe. That being said if you plan on watching this series with dedication and want to analyze it , sorry to say this but you are going to have a bad time. Taling this into consideration I give this anime a 7/10 as it watchable, enjoyable, lacks supersaturation of FS yet still has it present,  and just sufficiently far fetched to allow you to mildly believe in it.",

            "content": "Ok so this is my first ever review. I felt after reading so many reviews slating this anime i had to put my 2 cents worth in. I have read up to the latest chapter in the manga but i will try not let that effect my review on the anime.\r\nIf you are looking for an anime that will make you laugh uncontrollably 1 second, and then be almost in tears the next, then this anime is for you.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nMany people going into this anime thought that this show was going to be purely just a SciFi mystery anime, and i dont blame them.I think this is why so many people were shocked when it turned very haremy. The story itself is very good and doesn't have many plotholes, although the pacing is a bit off at some places due to the anime being 13 eps long when it really should of been 26. The anime also left out probably one of my favourite arcs of the story from the manga which was a big shame, but i still found the story enjoyable. There are quite a few fanservicey scenes which may put some people off, personally i found them enjoyable and funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing i keep reading in reviews is how the main male protagonist Ryouta is obnoxious, arrogant and rude person, mainly due to how he is with Kazumi. I want to first talk about a little thing i don't think many people get called \"banter\". The formal definition of banter is \"the playful and friendly exchange of teasing remarks\". The scenes where Ryouta and Kazumi are playfully teasing each other are some of the funniest scenes i have ever seen in anime. I dont see how Ryouta was being rude at all, it was all in good fun.\\n\\n\r\nI really felt the characters were the strong points in the anime. The really close knit bond that the main group make is awesome. Kuroneko in general was the cutest thing ever, the main male protagonist was actually really smart and funny in my opinion, but for me Kazumi was the bright spark in this anime. She definately showed the most character development throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Art - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints about the sound and the art. I felt the background music during serious situations was perfect (for example, the piano version of the op song softly playing in the background) although during the fanservicey scenes i felt the music was kinda annoying. The art was beautiful\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSure, the anime has some flaws with its pacing, but i can definately say i enjoyed this anime a lot. I do wish they had made it longer so it wasn't rushed, but you cant have everything you want in life can you? If you are looking for a funny new anime with an actual decent storyline and characters, then Gokukoku is your boy.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Duh.........Ok another 2014 spring anime has ended, and I guessing another anime with the same harem plot is in the works for the upcoming summer season, so, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category: \r\nMediocre 5:\r\nStory- Pretty much a typical sci-fi anime where it involves the usual science project who is trying to escape, and the usual harem type where it involves guy getting involve with the harem's predicament. Also, there is that misused terminology where I would never understood as to why the original creator used it, let's not for get that this anime's title is \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\" where thepronoun \"Brynhildr\" means shield-maiden or Valkyrie in German, if one is observant enough, one will notice that the anime's title doesn't correspond to the anime's story plot, if it were me I would have title this anime \"Akatsuki no Mahou\" or witches of the dawn, it would have been a better fit for this anime because it signifies the escape witches who wanted to see the light of freedom.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- just like the title the series' original creator, Okamoto, Lynn didn't used the proper term to describe the girls and instead used the generic word \"witches\" to describe them girls, now like I've mentioned the series's title is \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\" he should have used \"Brynhildr\" to best describe the girls instead of the word \"witches\" where we all know that them girls are a product of a certain organization's science project, but that just me expressing my opinion, so why did I gave this category such score? Here's why.\\n\\n\r\n Ryouta Murakami- basically a protagonist where one would already knew as to what he portrays and what role will he play with his harem.\\n\\n\r\nKuroneko- also another predictable character, one look at her and nobody would be surprise as to who she is.\\n\\n\r\nKazumi Schlierenzauer - basically a one of the members of the harem who is a tease and in competition for the guy's affection.\\n\\n\r\nKana- as always no harem would be complete with out a tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nKotori- what can I say, she is the quintessential bimbo in a harem.\\n\\n\r\n Chisato Ichijiku- as usual any sci-fi anime with action has to have a antagonist and he is that quintessential antagonist and so as Mako his bitch.\\n\\n\r\nSo with all the usual, why shouldn't I give this category a 5?\\n\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3.\\n\\n\r\nArt-  I can never understand about  Okamoto, Lynn's decision to have them girls to not sport the same school uniform that their classmate were wearing?\\n\\n\r\nGood 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- What makes it enjoyable was basically the part where one would empathize with the escape witches where one would feel a certain uneasiness as to who will try to capture them and how will they fare off if they are up against those cruel  science guy who would want them back, there is also that part where one would be concern for the guy's safety since he has gotten himself in such deep shit. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Thought the opening theme and the closing were unique, one part of me likes it and another part of me doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-  It maybe enjoyable, but I just can't ignore the series's creator's lack of creative judgment of using the proper term to describe them witches, also, it was pretty obvious that some scene where pretty random and some parts that were rushed...given that this anime was only 13 episode long, not that I have some fuss over it, but overall it's not bad, but not that good either, I know about the manga co'z I'm yet to go over it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It tells the story off without any spoilers, witches who are controlled by a secret organisation, they have to run away and some manage to and now have to survive! Now the way they have to, nope not saying. But the story is filled with very good drama, action and mystery.You know when an anime is good at mystery when you've watched it like 5 times and the ending still surprises you... Yeah it honestly does.   \\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nVery good also! Now again not anything mind blowing but good. Just your typical art style of a village set in the hills and shrines and darkness and such. \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nVery good also! I love the characters the most! Even some who you see for just an episode really, they connect. You want them to succeed on their mission! The main guy is a bit cliche but still really good! The character that shines the most I think would have to be the main girl. Really stern but has a total innocent cute side to her. \\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWant a Dub, Harem, Action, Mystery, Horror and a really fun anime to watch at night? Well knock knock because this anime is here!",

            "content": "Gokukoku no Brynhildr started off decently, but took a deep plunge quite early on in the series and, in my opinion, never got back off its feet.\r\nFor a start, let me say I appreciate that this is an adaptation from a generally highly-regarded manga by none other than Lynn Okamoto, however the series needs to be taken at face value rather than drowning it in seas of fans who won't dislike anything about it regardless of its flaws.\r\nStory - 6/10.\r\nAt first, I probably would have given the story a higher mark - it began well, dark and interesting and it honestly looked promising. We startoff being introduced to Murakami with views into his past, then we meet Kuroneko. However after the first few (four, I think) episodes, the cast starts to grow, and so the story declines - dark, mysterious or gory scenes were juxtaposed with fanservice and gags, poor attempts at comedy that really did not fit into the atmosphere they tried to create in the episodes. What could have been an interesting sci-fi drama becomes a show trying too hard to please its fanbase, with random sections within almost every episode becoming pure fanservice nonsense. And towards the end there is a LOT of deus ex machina, not subtle at all and which will make you think, \"wha? how did that even happen?\". If a more realistic pattern had been followed Murakami would have been dead long before the latter third of the series. The story is just trying too hard, introducing too many twists and turns, different genres and different ideas - it's shoved in your face like \"here, have loads of stuff, this is making this really interesting and deep right?!\", which it doesn't. It doesn't know where it wants to go or what it wants to be but still manages to act pretentious about it, it is confused and comes across as really artificial as the story has no flow to it. And I won't say much about the ending except it was heavily anticlimactic and weird, I was left thinking \"huh? is that the end? what is happening I don't understand\".\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10.\\n\r\nLittle more than average. A very generic anime style now, done in a \"meh, that looks okay I suppose, it's not awful...\" way. I felt the palette was not very expressive especially when taking into account the dark scenes put next to the comedic/gag/fanservice scenes, the transition will leave you reeling. Character designs were pretty generic, you have the pink haired one, the blonde one, the dark mysterious one, the big-boobed shy one...all of the characters had defining features but sadly that was mostly the colour of their hair. Special effects were not special, in fact they were pretty cookie cutter and uninventive, which baffled me. They had loads of girls with loads of different powers, and they couldn't make it look cooler than it did.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10.\\n\r\nThe first OP of Brynhildr was okay, although it can't actually be classed as \"music\", it was punchy and it had a good beat and set you up for the episode and the sci-fi feel of it. However the second OP I skipped as it went from a pleasant alien-ish sounding dubstep track to a screamo hardcore track I just couldn't bear. It completely shattered any mood whatsoever (which I think is pretty important for the OP to do) and I guess it was to try and make it seem more epic? No idea...The sound in general was okay I guess, as usual I didn't really notice any of the actual background music or effects, but I didn't notice anything hugely out of place. The character voices were okay too, I wish they had made Kana have a more believable machine-voice instead of the \"moe\" voice she was given, Kotori's voice was kind of predictable given her \"the shy one with big boobs\" status, Kazumi's voice was actually good to listen to - although I did not like her character generally, she had a more unique voice. Kuroneko's voice was kind of generic too. The seiyuu did a decent job but I just don't think the material gave them much to work with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10.\\n\r\nI can't give character more than a 6 (and was considering lowering my mark, however...). Let me start by listing a few stereotypes here - the Gary Stu, the unmemorable \"every guy\" guy who, for no real good reason, takes on caring for a harem of dangerous girls and trying to save them because he's just that nice. Oh and he had a tragic past or something so he wants to save everyone. Despite discarding even a scrap of realism for his character they still attempt to make us care about him and his motives. *facepalm* The childhood love interest, who has the Mysterious Amnesia. The shy, big-boobed one who can barely form a sentence. The perverted one. And the mysterious antagonist doing bad things to poor innocent girls for his own weird motive. That covers pretty much every main character in the series, except Kana, who doesn't really fit into much of a stereotype, I guess she's the overly fragile one who thinks people are trying to take advantage of her all the time. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I digress. There's really no depth to the characters at all. Poor Murakami suffers from Incredible Lack of Realism disease, which means he is almost impossible to relate to - we are given a rushed \"explanation\" as to why he wants to save all the things, however as I previously stated introducing every character type ever to the story and his harem was totally at the expense of any actual depth and realism in the characters. I found that even as characters died, I just sat looking at the screen thinking \"meh, that's sad, I should care about this but I can't\" because there is absolutely NO realism or real story telling behind them. We get \"here, have some characters\", and a manipulative plot which tries to make you care about them (for example Kotori's suicidal thoughts, which then mysteriously disappear.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\r\nAlthough the series took a serious nosedive about a third of the way through and became almost unwatchable during the last third, it was an okay watch if you don't expect much. I essentially muscled my way through it (which was hard, believe me) without wanting to actually watch any more of this confused mess within the last 4/5 episodes, however previous to this it was an ok watch, flaws are obvious but before the major asspulls begin it presents some decent episodes (namely the first 3/4).\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say I'd recommend this anime unless you KNOW what you're getting into, you know that it's a mediocre adaptation of Lynn Okamoto manga and that you know it will go downhill soon after the first third.\\n\r\nIf you want something with an interesting premise then by all means watch it just don't expect this show to deal with any actual issues, show any real depth or conclusion, the only thing which kept me going sometimes was the mystery shrouding the girls and the simple \"I don't really care, but WILL HE SAVE THESE GIRLS?!\" feeling, more of a curiosity than anything. That and wondering how much worse they could make it.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. Don't expect much/anything in terms of realism or storytelling from this anime and you might be able to tolerate it somewhat.",

            "content": "Before I start the review, I would just like to state that this show should be watched with an open mind, there seem to be a lot of negative reviews lately, so ill give my unbiased take on things.\r\nWhen I had first started this show, it was on a whim, I was just browsing and the summary of the show seemed to capture my attention. It goes like this, \"When he was a child, Murakami was infatuated with a girl he called Kuroneko. She insisted on knowing about aliens and having met them, but no one believed her, even young Murakami was skeptical. One day,she decides to show him the aliens, but an accident occurs and Kuroneko dies while Murakami is left seriously wounded in the hospital. Years go by and Murakami obsesses on finding proof of the existence of aliens because of a promise he had made with Kuroneko. Then, one day, a new transfer student comes to his class, who not only looks a lot like Kuroneko, but is named Kurohaneko\"\\n\\n\r\nFrom the summary itself it seemed very interesting as I have come across very few anime with this sort of space like or even alien theme- so I gave it a shot. The first episode is more or less the summary explained in a 20 minute sequence and from there on it moves on.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Murakami, is the main person of the small harem that builds up through the show. We will meet various other \"witches\" ( i cannot go into details as to why they are called this without spoilers) who will all have various different powers that will allow them to tackles various situations. These powers while simple, come in handy in tricky situations and it is the way that Murakami makes the witches utilise them that makes for great viewing.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot in a nutshell, without giving away very much is that Murakami is trying to protect the witches from the lab where they escaped and the whole story is based on their struggle to survive but also make the best use of their time. There are times where the show can get a little fan servicey, which personally, I think the show could've done without since it would help to make the show a bit more serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I really liked about the show would be how there are various different sorts of emotions portrayed through different characters and the various themes that are explored. Questions such as what is life? How far are we willing to go to protect someone- even if it means going into the wrong? How can we trust people? What is selflessness really? These and many more common themes of sacrifice, leading normal lives and others are explored- so full marks on that front. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme and ending are both pretty good, I prefered the opening as even though it had no lyrics it really gave that upbeat feeling after it was over. The show uses sound to a good effect, but perhaps could do with a bit more relevant stuff during some sequences. The art style is definitely quite good, with a nice sharp tone to it and the background is also fleshed out in most areas.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the show is not faultless. The first thing which is evident when you finish the show is that 13 episodes is really not enough, this show needed 24. As a result of being cut short some scenes  and plot lines seemed a little rushed and could have prospered had it been longer. The second is the harem typical relations, it could've done without every new character somehow becoming attracted to Murakami in some way since it sort of takes away from the story and at times doesn't let you take some interactions or relationships very seriously, which is a problem when the show is only 13 episodes long. You do get attached to many characters but sometimes you feel as if there isn't enough time to really get to know them that well and there is a feeling that something has been left incomplete- however the characters you do grow attracted to have a fair amount of development. Some could have done with a bit more in hindsight. \\n\\n\r\nOverall though, the show always seems to have a cliffhanger at every turn and there are many scenes where  things do not always go as you might expect, right down to the last minute. It is certainly a very enjoyable show that for the 13 episodes has you on the edge of your seats and there is never a dull moment. I would wholly recommend this show to anyone who likes a little bit of mystery or thriller action, but please keep in mind to watch it with an open mind and judge the show for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading the review and I hope you enjoy the show.",

            "content": "Gokukoku no Brynhildr (A.k.a Brynhildr In The Dark) is an anime which, depending on whether you've read the manga or not, is either a fairly average, enjoyable show or a rushed, patchy one which tries to stuff 100+ chapters into the space of 13 episodes.\r\nI've never read the manga myself, so when I review this anime I review it as a stand-alone title which is my first introduction to the series (which I feel will be useful for those who watch the anime before reading the manga).\r\nThe basic story follows Ryouta Murakami, a high-school boy who is the sole member of the astronomy club. Murakamiis haunted by the memory of a girl who he called 'Kuroneko' (as he did not know her real name), who died when she fell, trying to save Murakami who slipped. Years have passed and one night, Murakami meets a mysterious girl who looks exactly like Kuroneko and happens to be called Kuroha Neko. Murakami, assuming Kuroha's identity, is overcome with joy but soon he finds out the Kuroha is much more than an ordinary transfer student.\\n\r\nThe story in itself is rather basic, with amnesia being a main roadblock with most conflicts with the plot. The story would be a box-standard harem, and still slightly is, but for the background plot. The background plot, which comes more to the foreground in later episodes, gives the show it's dark tone. The threat of death is always hanging in the air and many characters do die over the course of the anime, some who care about, others not.\\n\\n\r\nThis moves us onto characters. Murakami has the traits of most male protagonists in the harem genre. He's oblivious to people's affection and always seems to find himself in situations that involve either seeing the female cast's assets or otherwise embarrassing/sexual situation. He by no means is the most powerful member of the crew but his reasoning is sound, if not out of the box and that tends to get them out of trouble more often than not, combined with the abilities of the rest of his team.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast follow suit. The amnesiac, the tsundere, the lolita etc. And while they are standard the dialogue between characters is entertaining and heart-wrenching at times and the relationships between characters does develop in a meaningful way so that you do feel sad when something bad happens to them or someone they know.\\n\r\nThe villain does his job well, though he really only becomes a character in the final few episodes of the show, leaving a bad taste in your mouth purely because of his lack of concern for human life.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound is okay. The animation is decent enough, with some well-designed locations and enough of a color pallet to stop boredom. Both openings are noteworthy to me because of their lack of lyrics. The openings are dark electric with a tune that gets you ready for the conflict that will arise in the next episode. The ending is significantly lighter in terms of tone, which can be both a comfort when a conflict is resolved or slightly sinister when the episode ends with a conflict, much like hearing a soothing song at a funeral. The rest of the music is good, though there were few recognizable tracks which I could remember.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime quite a bit, though dark fantasy such as this and Elfien Lied has never been my favorite genre. I felt sad when sad things happened, but I never cried, which to me is a bit disappointing. The funniest ,and best, parts of the show were when the female cast, because of heir lack of knowledge of the outside world, completely own the other high-school kids and Murakami.\\n\r\nSo, on calculation, Brynhildr in the dark gets a 6.4 out of ten. It's a fair anime from the perspective of someone who has not read the manga and I think it will be best for people to view if they have not read the manga or if they don't mind it being patchy in places.",

            "content": "So, this is my first review. \r\nIn short: a mediocre adaptation, getting worse toward the end. Premise was interesting, but the pacing was one of the worst i've seen. BTW I've kept up to date on the english translations, and rather enjoy the manga, which is the only reason I watched all 13 episodes.\r\nSound and art: nothing really stood out, I enjoyed the first OP, second one was...strange. And not necessary. Art wasn't bad.\r\nStory and characters: Characters were varied yet cliche, but overall I actually thought they were ok. The thing that bugged me the most is the story, especially the horrendous pacing. It startedoff good, and kept close to the manga, but i noticed early that there was no way that, at the rate it was going, it couldn't get very far into the manga. I wondered how this was going the be dealt with; I was very disappointed-they cut out numerous important scenes, including a whole manga arc. Unlike Elfen Lied (same author), they didn't really change the storyline. The few modifications were bad in my opinion and almost killed the emotional impact.The ending was when any idea of pacing was thrown out of the window. They crammed like 30 chapters into 2 episodes. If i didn't read the manga I would be utterly clueless by the end of the anime. Plus the final fight(anime) scene was almost entirely cut, abd together with the confusion the ending was anticlimatic. I would rather have the storyline changed to fit rather than compressing it until it is an incoherent mess that makes little sense. And the 5 min beach \"episode\" wtf they should have cut the whole thing. It lost its much of its humour compressed and wasted valuable time.\\n\\n\r\nI still found it enjoyable for the most part. Sorta. I'm rather easy to please so\\n\r\n 6/10 from me is kinda bad.\\n",

            "content": "Underrated, Unpredictable and Unfortunate.\r\nThere are the 3 words that come to mind when watching Brynhildr in the Darkness, Below I will explain my thoughts, opinions and why I think Brynhildr is an anime worth your time. This review will contain as little spoilers as possible. First off, this show is not Elfen Lied. For the sake of being fair, and not setting a bar of expectation I will not be comparing the two. \r\nExpectations have caused this anime to be somewhat underrated and really; a hidden gem. The dark story is a big contrast to harem Murakami shares with his group of female companions knownas \u2018Witches\u2019. The only drawback to being surrounded by these lovely ladies is that for whatever reason, they were brought back from the brink of death now with unique powers. The trade-off is, they must take a pill to ward off the death inside them, otherwise they will melt and die in the most grotesque why you can imagine. \\n\\n\r\nIn a way the shenanigans seen in your everyday generic harem/ecchi anime is comic relief from the evil been enacted upon the witches who Murakami, a normal highschool student has befriended. Though this anime can be looked at as a harem and ecchi I felt they were simply a distraction to the main draw of Brynhildr in the Darkness, which is the story. I cannot help but feel everytime the story starts to go well, and the characters are finally enjoying themselves we are thrown often back into the harsh reality of the witches\u2019 lives that Murakami is wrapped up in. Due to the unpredictability we are often left feeling uneasy and how these witches lives\u2019 hang by a thread, or should I say a pill! Due to this, we take enjoyment in seeing them develop their bonds and in essence, having a break from the reality that haunts them. \\n\\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that we were only given 12 episodes, with such interesting characters and a story with so many characters involved in it I come away from finishing Brynhildr just wanting to know more about the characters in it! There are too many unanswered questions! Why were these innocent girls made witches? What is their backstory? How did they die in their previous lives? Who will Murakami choose as his woman? Will Kazumi get laid? Can we get to see these witches live out a daily life and make a total mess out of it? Much like the kick ass opening OST of this anime, which gives off this crazy mysterious aura and build up, there are so many things that are left a complete mystery. I shall now take to the manga and look for my answers. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime looks great, sounds great and has the potential to be great. I felt the voice acting (JAP) was well represented for each individual characters personality and the mood at the time. If you\u2019re into Mystery anime, or into anime where innocent person gets pulled into a world unbeknown to him then you are definitely missing out. Thanks for reading!\\n",

I fell in love with each character, they have their own unique so called \"charm\" point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed every episode with the Echiness, Fan Service, Romance and Horror style. Every episode is a mystery. You don't know what's coming next, you just want to watch the next episode to know more about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIt's a good one, but not a fan of the ending. Could be better on telling explaining stuff. I enjoyed it, it's something different I normally watch.",

Starting with a good dose of suspense and mystery, a solid system and motivation. Then it felt like a sand castle, that suddenly is being targeted by the neighbors kid. Random destruction of all the elements that might have made this series special.\r\nThe ugly (plot holes):\r\nI couldn't believe that the series went south until I hit the last episodes.\r\nI mean I did have the manga up to around EP 6 and they kept close to it in the anime, but thelast episodes, especial the final confrontation doesn't make sense  and feels more then just rushed, it feels like some random and p***-poor decision. \\n\\n\r\nWhy build a solid \"magic system\", if everyone can bypass it's limitations? If the ability is in cooldown, you should not be able to use it, but you see more then one example where not only they keep using them, but even work miracles. No explanation either. What was the purpose of a cooldown if not preventing the user from overextending themselves which would cause serious harm? If one ability is a defense ability that is centered in oneself, why can you use it on others? That ability would be called something else and could not have been used in time for a certain incident. \\n\\n\r\nYou get a perfectly easy explanation about the beacon and the harness, how they are connected and what happens when it is forcefully removed, then a beacon got cut and simply falls off without any incident or damage to the harness? What about the 3 clamps and the fail-saves?\\n\\n\r\nWhile there was some awesome voice acting (kansai+german? Made the character actually more human like - especially if you concider that said person knows that she only will live a few days longer) and some great foundation, the whole motive, the whole driving factor and the relationship model just went random. Without spoiling too much, Chisato is the perfect example. While clearly stating what his motivation is, he does confirm it in more then one instance, then acting against his very nature (and his motive why he even started with all this). Chisato would not act that way, if you are that driven by something, you would stick to it and not stating it, and five seconds later undo all of the work/ambition with an action that he calls foolish in the first place. Also why does he need to walk out of his own house when he could have used the same manner of transport as he used before?\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Mako who holds a perfect reasonable grunge, but doesn't act on it even though she knew it all along that she was *spoiler*. Mako killed for less. She might make a little sense if they had worked a little on her character, but as they have done it, she doesn't act at all the way she should. She tries to protect someone, then turns on her even though that someone didn't even attack her?\\n\\n\r\nOr the other party involved. You can't declare war for the worlds sake, then act like nothing matters. Especially on that event with their comrade. Why would that comrade act in that fashion if the goal was something else entirely?\\n\\n\r\nAnd lets not forget the final fight. Everyone ever watched  a little more physics orientated material will tell you that the effect would be the opposite of what was intended. \\n\\n\r\nMy last hope is, that the manga will have a different plot, because as it ended in the anime I would like to unsee everything and forget that it ever existed beyond the point of the church event. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nNot recommended, at least past EP6. A real pity, because I thought that for once they would bring some more serious plot with a good system and relationship model to balance out the usual fanservice.",

This is how I see this anime after I watched it.\r\nStory(7/10): The anime has a good plot with little twists and mysteries and some fanservice, but the main focus is not really on the story, but the characters and their feelings and developments.\r\nArt(8/10): I think the art was quite good, nothing disturbingly ankward appeared, though I have seen better ones. The graphics was perfect for the anime's plot. It greatly resembled how the story would unfold.\r\nSound(9/10): There wasn't really any problem with the sound that would affect the overall feeling.\r\nCharacters(9/10): I think themain characterteam is a bit childish, but oh well they're japanese high-schoolers in their early education. Otherwise every character seem to be okay both in sanity and heart.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10): The plot twists made me watch episodes after episodes each time to find out I have to watch the next one!\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10): The overall picture of this anime was quite good, I really had fun and what is more, you can really see how misarable, unfortunate and bittersweet one's life can be, founding happiness in the most common part of their life, which gives you the perspective on how you should cherish your life and enjoy it to the fullest. The anime shows how the main and main-support characters think, what they feel, so you can ride the feeltrain with them!\\n\\n\r\nRecommended.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler:\\n\r\n\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI was a bit disappointed on the ending.. bittersweet memory it shall be.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains some spoilers. You have been warned.\r\nWhere to begin. I started watching this show expecting something good, since the sypnosis sounded thrilling and suspenseful.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe first 3.5 episodes were great (7.5/10).. It seemed a lot like Elfen Lied (One of my favorites). It had the same concept of a bunch of girls with superpowers escaping from a testing lab. The pacing was a little bit rushed but still within the watchable range. But from there, it only went downhill. Fan service took over the rest of the show. The story kept rushing on due to fan service hogging a lot of screentime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThe animation was on par.\\n\r\nBut the placing of soundtracks was horrible. There was no good OST during thrilling moments. On the contrary, it was totally silent. It made zero sense.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters got pretty pathetic after episode 3.\\n\r\n- Neko got upset everytime a girl tried to get close to Ryouta.\\n\r\n- Kazumi, a girl only with the team to try to get laid with Ryouta.\\n\r\n- Kana, your generic Tsundere.\\n\r\n- Kotori, your clumsy, big-boobed \"pig\" as Kazumi called her.\\n\r\n- Lets not forget Ryouta, the guy who acts mighty and tries to shelter every girl he finds, which inturn leads to all of the cast liking him. (But he doesn't date anyone in the end)\\n\\n\r\nYou get the idea. It turned from a good thriller to a generic Ecchi/Harem.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\n5/10 only because the first 3 episode were on par. The rest of the Harem shit makes me sick.\\n\\n\r\nThank You for reading this review, more of a rant though.",

            "content": "To be honest, I liked the anime a little bit, the plot is good, atleast. It's one of those animes where it's not THAT good but you like it for some reason and can't stop watching. I think this is my first review so bare with me.\r\nCharacters: (6/10) I don't think a lot of the characters have much of a personality..I think Kuroneko has the most personality out of everyone. Kotori has some personality, Kazumi just spits out perverted stuff a lot, then gets tsundere..She's pretty unique but that's not as much as a personality that anime characters should have. Like one moment she talksabout sex and all that stuff, and keeps making moves on Murakami, then gets all shy and backs up.  Murakami doesn't have much of one, and I think Kana should of talked and done more in the anime. Kuroneko has a lot of character though, and I haven't seen on like her.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10) I'm more used to most animes where there's song lyrics and everything for the opening, instead of just instrumental. The music didnt match the anime at all. It should of maybe had a sad, or calming tune? The voice actors were pretty good, although Kazumi's voice actors could be a little bit better. They match the characters though. Like how Kuroneko's voice is calm and mature, it fits her kind and quiet personality. Kazumi is a tsundere, so her voice was pretty much good, it just doesn't sound feminine enough for her cute tsundere moments.  Kotori's voice actor was pretty good, the high pitched-uneasy voice fits her moe personality well. The other voice actors are okay.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (5/10) I think the art was okay, but it didnt match the anime well. I think maybe the artist of Another or The Irregular of Magic High School's art would of fit the anime more. Also, the characters look pretty weird when they cry, and if you look closely and avoid the hair, Kazumi's face looks like a guy.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (9/10) The plot was really good, with Murakami's backstory with Kuroneko connecting everything to the witches. But there are extra details like at the beginning when Kuroneko used Kana's power to see future visions to save people. She did that on the first episode, but she stopped doing it. I think they rushed it a bit and totally forgot that. Also, the also episode disappointed me a lot. The battle between Valkyria and Kuroneko was too boring, with not enough action. They should of shown a better fight, with more powers used. I thought Kuroneko's power would be more brilliant, with tons of comeback moves. But there was barely any combat in the battle. And also, it didnt say much about stars in the anime. I thought it would. And I didn't see a point in Nanami. I know she helped him, but she should of appeared more. And Murakami cares too much about one person when he's only known them for a day or less. So side characters should show up more. And at the point where the characters think they're gonna die in a week, they should of been more sad about it instead of joking around. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (7/10) I did like the anime, for some reason. Maybe because of the plot, or maybe because I just like the fact that the anime and to do with death, since I'm a horror fan. I liked Kuroneko and Murakami's unique past. Most anime, characters pasts are like \"my parents died in a fire\" or something, so I like his unique past. It was pretty good, I guess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7/10) I really wanted to see Kuroneko's powers, so I kept watching, although I got disappointed in the end. The first few episodes got me interested. They introduced Kuroneko well, and had a good explanation of the plot and everything in the first episode. The anime was pretty rushed, and had some pretty bad details to it, but it has it's good points. Most of it is pretty average.\\n",

            "content": "Alright so Gokukoku no Brynhildr (Brynhildr in the Darkness)\r\nThe music was just really weird. We'll start with that. The first OP is dubstep for some reason and it really doesn't fit the mood of the show at all which is supposed to be kind of dark mixed with some happy scenes. Then the first OP stays throughout the show until the last like 4 episodes and it turns to metal which still doesn't fit the show. The ending theme was a nice little thing that absolutely did not fit the show. The OP and ED vids were appropriate though. The first OP showed bloodon the young girls' bodies which was a sure indicator that there was more to come. \\n\\n\r\nThe themes of the show were very weird. I started it thinking that it was a normal show and there'd be blood but not many deaths. Actually more people die than I thought and some people that you don't want to die, do. The lack of deus ex machina actually does this show justice because it doesn't turn the show completely into a teenage witch killer show. Lots of ecchi in the show for no reason. I think they were trying to create an uneasy atmosphere by juxtaposing really sad and dark moments right next to happy scenes with nudity. \\n\\n\r\nLOTS of ideas were taken from Elfen Lied. You could say that this show was heavily influenced and probably created after someone read the manga or saw the show. Actually this is crappier Elfen Lied. For kids.\\n\r\nBodies split in half, blood, theatrical breakdowns where the main character screams as if in agony and appears to lose his mind every time someone dies. And let's not forget that these witches are all girls who were experimented on from a young age. Add changes of heart in least expected characters, scientists, the main bad guy trying to reincarnate someone from long ago- blah blah blah Elfen Lied (closer to manga actually now that I think of it.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are actually pretty likeable. No character development whatsoever except on the male lead and on the female lead though. One of the witches is paralyzed except for her left hand which types out words for her which is funny because during sad scenes it goes to everyone's face for their reaction and hers is always the same and luckily they added in the typing sounds consistently. The male lead is very smart but he's not OP in fact he gets his ass kicked and cries all the time.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: If you liked Elfen Lied, you'll like this. Just not nearly as much.",

            "content": "Brynhildr in Darkness was something I was anticipating after watching the second OP a few times. I feel as a 13 Episode anime it was portrayed pretty well but there was a few things that really didn'ts it well with me in the end.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nI feel the story was accomplished but not really executed in a very good way. The first episodes had very good flow and was really interesting. Around episode 10 is where they start cramming in way too many things. It wasn't really healthy at all to be quite honest. Also the ending was very rushed and didn't feel very complete atall, it feels almost like a cliff hanger. As in regard to the actually events however, it was entertaining but felt too much like Deadman Wonderland with the whole \"pills to survival\" thing and they crammed the aliens in as a more \"WTF\" sort of feel which wasn't great at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the art style quite a bit. It was very pretty but one thing though was why did they have to lens flare every sight of nudity. It was very annoying and I wish they never would have done that. Also they did do some minor CGI effects that wasn't very good either.  The prime example being the bus in some episodes. Didn't really fit the animation style at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nOST was actually very impressive and was the main reason I wanted to watch this anime. Only downside was the second OP was not used enough. You only get to hear it for 4 episodes and thats it. Kind of shitty if you ask me but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nI liked the  characters in this anime but being so short there was really no time to develop any of the load of characters they introduce every episode. It would have been better to get more back story for more of the characters but just with the time it didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nThis was no way a bad anime. A lot of people said the ending was bad and yes they were all right. But It is still worth the watch. It was very interesting but this had so much potential to be an amazing anime but sadly, it wasn't compromised on.

            "content": "Well this anime was just terrible, its exactly what the 1 says: pathetic. I actually thought it was going somewhere from the first episode but then it went way down into a hole and just stayed there, buried. i really only enjoyed 3 minutes of each episode, the openings and endings.\r\nStory - Magical witches that have a harnest on there neck and have superpowers and need pills to survive. and also have aliens inside of them that people were trying to revive to take over the world. wow sounds great, not. about 6 episodes was kazumi making a sexual joke about murakami and her wantingto not be virgin the rest her left and wanting to do it with murakami. And the other few episodes were murakami saying ill protect you guys over and over, and we here the girls say \"murakami! murakami!\" which got rather annoying. the story was a complete joke, also the ending was one of the worst ever i thought. hey there is fanservice though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters were all pointless, no development from any characters except for murakami which still didnt have that much, none really interested me, is was basically a harem after the girls met murakami and instantly fell in love with him, except for a few of the girls. the characters and their development can relate to the level of infinite stratos's level of character development, unless if you thought infinite stratos had good character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound - now this was something i loved of the anime, the op's were awesome, fit the series nice, and ed was nice and relaxing and liked it, ost was pretty cool throughout the anime. this is probably the only reason i kept watching this anime\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - was alright.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - dont waste your time with this show, youll think its getting better and the story is moving on but it never does, its just one more girl to the harem, and murakami saying he'll protect the girls every 5 minutes, only watch the op's and ed if you really want to. honestly they could of done a much better job with this anime, but i just couldnt take it seriously, sorry if i bashed on this anime too much.",

(If you haven't noticed this is Elfen Lied 2.0)\\n\\n\r\nTHE REAL ANIME is Murakami literally trying to find out about \"muh childhood friend\" while dodging Kazumi who wants Murakami's virginity while all the other girls either want his virginity or are too stupid to want his virginity. But this is no harem series this is a Sci-Fi series where all the girls use magic because they're Witches and everything wants to kill them. \\n\\n\r\nThis is series is probably for people who like Katawa Shoujo and stuff like that because mostly all the girls have a disability like being an idiot, paralysis, and fat because of doughnuts.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 It's okay but there's a lot of QUALITY in Episode 10",

            "content": "Gokukoku no Brynhildr or Brynhildr in the darkness is a good example of an anime which had potential but failed to deliver in the end. A show which could have been exceptionally good but turned out to be just another average release of the season.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe only reason I'm giving the story a 6 is because of its concept and the atmosphere which the show achieved in the first half of the series. The show was rushed and horribly paced mainly through the second half of the series. The dark atmosphere which the created wished for was virtually non-existent in the show except for certain,very small points in the show. The show mainly failed due to it being rushed and not much time was given for character development and allowing the viewers to get interested in the story and characters but this was expected considering the manga had over 100 chapters and the entire anime was only 13 episodes but this could be different in the case that there may be more to come as I haven't read the manga yet.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Gokukoku no Brynhildr was average and didn't really have any exceptional moments but it did suit the anime and not much can be complained about. More work could have been put into the fight scenes between the witches. The most extravagant part of the artwork was the scenery which I felt was much better than what we usually get in most anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nSound is the strongest point about this series and really did a good job in setting the right mood. The first OP was really good with its mix of instrumental and dubstep and was really different compared to what we usually hear in anime. The second OP I felt fit the anime but I personally did not like it much and felt that there was no need for a change of OP for a 13 episode series.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in the show was non-existent as I mentioned earlier and was one of the key reasons for this show getting such negative feedback. Our protagonist Murukami at first felt like a good MC with him being super smart, kind and willing to do anything to protect those he cares about but eventually after his insistent whining and confusion throughout the show with him needing help from every female in sight, he began to get quite annoying. The main female characters were also not very great with the exception of Kazumi who was the only character which I felt had a little spunk and an interesting attitude. Some of the support characters like Nanami had more character development than the mains and were much better also. Overall if they put more effort into character development, the characters may have been more pleasing and the show would have been much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started this show it was quite enjoyable with its story and gory scenes which were unexpected but after a while it wasn't as enjoyable as it should have been but more into that would be spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is for those who like good plots but you would have to be willing to look over most of its flaws. I would say this is a watch but not of much priority. Go read the manga instead.\\n",

            "content": "*May include some spoilers\r\nGokukoku no Brynhildr is just another anime that had the potential to be great but turned out to be mediocre.\r\nTheres only one thing that has made me continue watching this, and thats the story. There are what could be called unnecessary, filler-ish episodes (though not many), and endless/pointless characters being introduced, but the actual idea of the story stands out.\r\nWhat pulled me in at first was the idea of Kuroha being Kuroneko. I kept asking myself, 'how could that be?' 'when will we find out if Kuroha is Kuroneko?' 'if Kuroha is Kuroneko, how did that happen? I thought Kuroneko was dead!'\r\nWe'renow 12/13 episodes in, and I'm still wondering about the Kuroha/Kuroneko story, especially since we're introduced to Valkryia, who looks uncannily like Kuroha and somehow knows her from the past.\\n\r\nWe're also told that Kuroha hasn't unleashed her full power - something I'm looking forward to seeing. All in all, the plot keeps you wondering, and it's what has kept me watching this show. I don't know how they're going to tie it all up in one episode, though. Guess we'll have to wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the weak part of Gokukoku no Brynhildr is none other than its characters. \\n\r\nTo me, characters make up a very important part in an anime, and it's hard to watch something that doesn't have at least a couple of decent characters.\\n\r\nThat's what has bothered me in Gokukoku no Brynhildr. Although they try to build up the characters with short backstories, everyone still seems so one dimensional. The only people with real personalities would be some of the supporting characters, and Kazumi and Kana. Even though they do have 'personalities', they aren't very good ones. Kazumi oversexualizes everything and wants to lose her virginity. Its played off that shes a 'tryhard' whos cute when you get to know her, but in reality she just seems so annoying.\\n\r\nKana, on the other hand, would be fun to watch if she wasn't plastered to her seat all day (although I understand WHY they did that, it's just kind of annoying that one of the interesting characters can't even move.)\\n\r\nApart from their personalities, the other thing that bothers me is the half-assed melodrama. \"Why would you give up your life to save me?\" says Murakami, with a straight face. Two seconds later, he decides to have a normal conversation with one of his girls. There shouldn't be so much death if they can't even play off a proper, shocked reaction from the characters.\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are Gokukoku no Brynhildrs weak point. If they were done well, the anime would be close to perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art are both decent. I liked the first opening song a lot, but other than that not much stood out.\\n\r\nThe art is alright. The character designs are done well, and all in all the scenes give of a 'feel', but the art is very generic - not anything you cant see in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 7.",

            "content": "Just finished re-watching this series and just thought, \"Man, what's wrong with the anime? That was a pretty good watch yet the ratings looks like the total opposite.\" Yes it was rushed, but this is an adaptation, and the source material is entirely a different story. \r\nThe story is generic yet unique, it is something refreshing and has a strong potential to become an amazing sci-fi. Themes such as romance, childhood tragedies, mystery, suspense, fanservice, and harem are all in one package. It's not a very good idea though, because the execution is quite flawed because of lack of focus in one aspect of itsthemes. It doesn't know where it stands at times, because of distractions such as drama scenes then unnecessary ecchi fanservice scenes then it turns out to be a comedy then a cheesy romance that has dark tones surrounded by glitters. The strong point though is the amount of fresh mysteries and thrilling suspense, which can guarantee your satisfaction with the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow I can't deny the fact that the art is pretty good, we've got a lot of of sights here. Background sceneries are very pleasing to the eyes, character designs are simple yet what makes them pretty is the use of colors, high quality animation is always present most of the time. Their eyes are very detailed, I haven't seen any anime that has these unique beautiful eyes. See for the cover. It has a dark atmosphere with slight dark tones in it. It can set the mood of the show with different scenes, whether it's bright or dark, the art is good quality work. Animation is always solid and crisp, but it's just  nearly as perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, I really loved both the openings, they really fit for the anime's themes perfectly, but I'll just say that the second opening was unnecessary. It could have stayed at the original opening, but the second one is not bad either. The ending is catchy and fits the sad and soft side of the show, plus it's nice to hear the whole girl cast singing. Soundtracks are just so good, it plays a role to the scene which can either give you tension, feels, easiness or goosebumps. The voice acting were decent and I think it's still above average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very interesting and played their respective roles all throughout the series well. I can't deny the fact that Ryouta is another generic harem lead character. But his role doesn't just stop there. He has unique traits that make him a well generic character, with good character developments and good backstory execution, his character was written very well. Obviously for a harem, we have a main girl. Kuroha is quite dense and an airhead, but her personality blends well with her chemistry with Ryouta. The other girls are decently written as well, they each have individual screentime to showcase themselves. The only problem is probably the ones that show up in the later half though, as they didn't get developments or screentime which means they can't get any sympathy or you won't care when they get hurt or die. I won't mention those characters so see for yourself. They're just like plot devices but when you see it outside the box they all have roles to achieve success in the show. \\n\\n\r\nI think I really enjoyed the anime so much that I put it on my favorites despite it's flaws and flops. But don't get the wrong idea here, my favorites are a different story, and it's mostly based on enjoyment and not biased. This is entirely different from Elfen Lied. The amount of suspense in a single scene can make you go crazy during cliffhangers, and crave for more. Lastly I would say that the anime is VERY different from the manga on how it is adapted, but let's think that this is anime and it shouldn't be compared with its source material by any means. Gokukoku no Brynhildr has above average production values, and overall I think it was a very unique sci-fi with drama and romance undertones. It is unpredictable, and knows how to handle mystery elements well and present it gracefully to the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nNote : I ANALYZED THOROUGHLY BY RE-WATCHING THE ANIME AND CAN'T FIND MAJOR PLOT HOLES. IT IS NOT A BUTCHERED ANIME, BUT THE ADAPTATION DIDN'T GO WELL. IT IS NOT A BAD ANIME.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8 (Interesting premise and a promising plot)\\n\r\nArt - 9 (Solid and detailed. Can't see any flaws and just near as perfection.)\\n\r\nSound - 8 (Appreciable, good, and moving. Not bad but not the best either.)\\n\r\nCharacter - 8 (Well written and developed except for a few supporting characters.)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 (VERY enjoyable from start to finish. Can make you stay at the edge of your seats.)\\n\r\nOverall - 9 (Excellent watch. High production values.)",

            "content": "The presence of (somewhat like) alien threats periods ago which will affect the existence of humanity makes the principals disburse researchers to run a project in a hidden laboratory to observe and develop humans who are planted the gene of the alien on the back of their neck by a switch. Only girls are capable to be planted the genes and thus be guinea pigs for the damn dehumanizing project. Those girls later called as \"Witches\".\r\n    This inhuman deeds from principals and researchers got refuses from the girls. They try to escape when on the way to transferred into another base. KurohaNeko who is a fled witch, the one who resembles main hero (Murakami Ryouta)'s childhood friend then meet the main hero in his class as the transfer student. This meeting is the beginning of every puzzles about the observation and the true identity of Kuroha Neko.\\n\\n\r\n    The first meeting with Kuroha Neko is like a blissful night full of shooting stars for Murakami Ryouta. By the regret and memories he keep as long as he lives, provoke his stubbornness more to help Kuroha Neko and others, risking himself. With the super power, the witches are having from the planted monsters, we will entertained by the action and supranatural power with a good animation. Tho' it's not a superb one, the animation still brings joy to our eyes, plus the gore scenes added, sliced up, stabbed, detached parts of body, and many more. Also few fanservices here that sadly I think feels off. I like it way more gore than mingled with ecchi-ness. Even if it's both harem and ecchi, the amount of those genres just like ads, not much presented.\\n\\n\r\n    For me the characters aren't developed enough, few hidden truths behind every of them still didn't make their characters undergo any significant change. However, the vibe of the mysterious facts is well-done. If I projected the story, it has profound meaning about how to appreciate life, sometimes we throw up our options and giving up hope by troubles in life but it isn't that hard actually if we want to compare it with the life of those witches being used, manipulated, haunted, killed ruthlessly. We aren't living in that world, we aren't living with supranatural powers, but sustain our lives from tons of problem will do the same as their fights to get living rights. Do not make the tightrope itself by just thinking without doing anything, until you really did to try your best.\\n\\n\r\n    The OP theme is an instrumental, with a creepy melody making the series seems darker. The OP theme title is \"BRYNHILDR IN THE DARKNESS -Ver. EJECTED-\" by Nao Tokisawa. And for the one-third OP theme is \"Virtue and Vice\" by Fear, and loathing in Las Vegas. The ED theme is slower, mellow song but just an average. The seiyuus of Neko Kuroha, Kana Tachibana, Kazumi Schlierenzauer, and Kotori Takatori characters sung the ED song titled \"Ichiban Boshi (\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3093\u661f)\".\\n\\n\\n\r\n    The series is quite interesting for me, and it makes me put 7.5 for it. Looking at the number it's just a bit better than average but there's something in this series that keep me watching it 'til the end. Why don't you try it yourself?\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nGore scenes or I should say the awful & sense of terror\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nEcchi-ness is off\\n\r\nSometimes it's a bit too dramatic",

            "content": "This anime series was created by Lynn Okamoto, the creator of Elfen Lied one of my favorite animes ever so I was pumped to watch this. It revolves around high school boy Ryouta Murakami, who cannot forget his female childhood friend whom he let die in an accident. Feeling that he must fulfill their promise of proving the existence of aliens, he has continuously looked up at the starry sky as a member of the astronomy club. One day, a girl named Neko Kuroha who looks exactly like his childhood friend appears as a transfer student who also turns out to be a witch. Okaythis series, I enjoyed it as a whole. The plot is fairly simple, which for you could be a good thing but for me it held this show down. Things just happen here, it tries to convey emotional weight to scenes and they just fall flat which falls mostly on the characters. I didnt like many characters in this anime. The main character Murakami, is a typical main character that does everything as he should and completely throws his life in disarray for these girls he barely knows. Neko, the second lead in this anime is one of the most bland characters I've ever seen in an anime. Nothing she says or does for the most part is interesting and honestly if she was a more compelling character I may have enjoyed this anime more. Most of the characters were average and didn't have much to them and when they died I didn't affect me much. On the other hand, Kazumi was great, I grew to love her brass attitude and perverted ways and to me she was the highlight of this anime. Art and sound were good but nothing special to me. The villains were weak and had uninteresting motives as is because they weren't given much depth in the story. The best thing in this anime was a scene with time travel that I wont spoil but it was really well executed and had me in a frenzy watching it. But the weight and purpose of that scene was undermined later in the anime with something anticlimactic that I guess they had to rush because of the short 13 episode run time. Also the twist ish plot development near the end of the anime felt like a let down and characters just appear out of nowhere and  have no real purpose except for plot exposition and to get the important characters from point A to point B. Overall a decent series that had highs that were fun to watch but mostly just slightly above average and not much compared to Okamoto's previous masterpiece Elfen Lied.",

            "content": "In the beginning, this seemed like it could have been something more...but then it fell flat on its ass and then just stayed there.\r\nSTORY: At first, the story seemed unique. This idea of aliens and beings from another world. Girls being experimented on and not knowing what and why they're experiments and can't just live normal lives. Then it turns out to be your typical scifi anime involving girls with big boobs and no common sense who depend on a guy for help and guidance. It starts out to become something dark and depressing, filled with endless struggles, but every time a problem arises, itis usually fixed with your basic scene of fanservice. Cause going from witnessing someone die to shirtless girls is what we all need to feel touched by this anime's story.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nART: There really isn't anything stunning about the art. Nothing stands out. The colors aren't too wild and don't seem to draw you in.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The OP in the beginning of the series was somewhat decent, its not everyday you get a dubstep opening that helped fill the mood of what the anime would be like, but then further down they decided to change the OP to some poor excuse of Rock music that doesn't fit the mood. Nothing really stands out of the BGM. Sometimes you even forget that there is a soundtrack to this anime. \\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Characters in this anime will start out being something promising, until an episode later when you realize that they're just boobs and air. The main character makes no sense, as there seems to be nothing wrong with him. Besides the constant crying and blushing....\\n\r\nThen there's the side characters. The girls who could be something great, but are more worried on whether they can lose their virginity or not. Instead of having them use and develop their skills for the better, you just keep piling on side character after side character who only helps benefit the Main Character.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I thought this was an awful anime to watch. The only reason why I finished it was because I hate having anime pile up. What could have been something great fell dead flat. The story could be something amazing, but whats a story when the Main characters don't even seem like they should be in this anime. \\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Let the review speak for itself\\n\r\n5/10",

An evil organization is after them so the male character steps up to help. \r\nWhat is really refreshing about this anime is the male lead. In your typical harem the guy has no likable qualities,has the luck of the gods and is in no danger whatsoever. \\n\r\nIn GnB however, the male lead wants to help and fight for these witches. He is not a wimp who complains a lot and is actually very useful in certain situations. \\n\\n\r\nNow this is a huge con:\\n\r\nIf you have read the Manga and loved to see the VA follow it then you're so gonna be disappointed. \\n\r\nThe anime is 13 episodes long so you can't expect it to complete the manga. However, in the first 10 episodes, 30 chapters were completed which is reasonable. BUT in the last 3 episodes it covered over 60 chapters. Just like that. \\n\r\nThe ending is rushed as heeeeeeeellll. \\n\r\nThe only way to actually enjoy this is to see what you get. Don't think about anything else. \\n\\n\r\nStory 7\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\nSound 8 (the opening is quite good even if it is just music)\\n\r\nCharacter 7 \\n\r\nEnjoyment 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\n\\n",

Of course every single anime could have something better, but Gokukoku no Brynhild's story development is a joke. There's a billion things that could have been developed. For example, look at Hexenjad (they appear in ep 12 I believe):I barely knew where they came from, what were they doing... I wish they would pull a FMA/FMAB type thing and just rewrite the show and add more episodes. To me, 13 episodes weren't enough lol. In terms of art/animation,I though it was great (even tho the eye style wasn't my fav)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, loved the concept, hated the way it was put out there.",

            "content": "The past cannot be changed or forgotten. That's why to hold on the past always creates suffering, although once it was really wonderful.\r\nBrynhildr in the Darkness is an anime based on a manga by Lynn Okamoto known for his infamous work - Elfen Lied. First impression on Elfen Lied? The one that full with bloody and messy gore scene that even go as far to introduce pedophilia, cruelty, sexuality and nudity. To be honest, it was quite shocking when this anime came out. I nearly think it's as a new version of Elfen lied when it comes to the gore scene. Still, there are quitegore scenes you can't evade. You can't escape from gore if you're going to watch this anime series. Better think carefully. Nevertheless this anime is definitely not a new Elfen Lied version or something like that. Don't compare them! It's wrong! Both anime have its owns greatness. But this anime is so full with new comedy, new concept of story and a good character development involving past and present. \\n\\n\r\nSide note, I already watch and complete this anime when all of the episodes are already out. Regretfully, I just think to write a review about it just now. Yet, I'm still can feel the enthusiasm about this anime. Let's get back to the story shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nRomance. I'll tell it's directly that this anime have a really good romance inside. Watch this if you a romance genre fans. You will love it! Back to the story. The story of anime itself is pretty amazing. It's slowly build up and the effort has been paid up after the ending of the series. I think it's the fresh one after so many clich\u00e9 anime I've watched. The theme of memory loss and choosing dark tones is the one of the fact that brings out this anime potential far better. The story tells us about Ryouta, a boy who remembers the promise he had with his childhood friend\u2019s Kuroneko. Nightmare happened when Kuroneko died while saving Ryouta. Full of regrets after the incident that occurs. Ryouta chooses not to forget it and keeps the promise. Yes, to find the real alien. Ryouta keeps up his promise up until his life as a high school student. But, one day, fates change everything when he meets a new transfer student name Kuroha Neko. The past will unfold with the destiny Ryouta never expect. Better take a seat mate. You will love this story. A really good performances by all the character. A big applause please.\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nYou will like it. The art of this series play an important role to show you. It has been shown a great one as darker feeling in it. Animation inside will startled you. Why not see this for yourself? You can ensure it better this way.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nHonestly, I love the Ops. It's so great while those songs bring this uneasy feeling with darker theme yet fantastic. On the opposite, the ending is quite catchy and might catch your attention before you even realize it. But the ops, I can say it's really fabulous. How fabulous? It\u2019s like Bitch please, I'm fabulous. That one is a quote.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nI also love the character. Kuroneko is so cute! The expressions she makes is simple marvelous. I will keeps saying it's marvelous and marvelous until you get bored of it. The others girl also cute but I think I pick kuroneko! Ehehe. Just thinking it back made me sound a creepy laugh and grin to ear. If I show this face at public. No doubt I will get arrested by police in no time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nSadly, I want to give this anime a masterpiece but I can't. Since in the last episode I feel like it was way too rushed. You know the feeling when you still eating food at cafeteria but the ring of your school's bell is already ringing. Yea, bullshit man. Other than that, this anime is really a fine piece. While I do feel the shame for comparing both the Elfen Lied (EL) and Gokukoku no brynhildr (GnB) series at first, I had absolutely no idea how excellent it is these two series excel with their different aspects.  In conclusion, everyone can find at least one series that they truly can enjoy as it\u2019s worth a season's worth of anime. As for me, clearly this is the one. Gokukoku series also has its own flaws but the demerit doesn\u2019t stop this show from being a personal favorite of mine.\\n",

            "content": "I am a bit conflicted about this anime.\r\nThis anime was brought to us by Arms and directed by the guy who directed Elfen Lied.\r\nSTORY (3):\r\nI honestly don't know how to begin. The story is about Ryouta Murakami who has a childhood friend called Kuroha Neko, who was killed in an accident. 10 years later, Ryouta Murakami forms the astronomy club that is basically a club that deals with science and astronomy. \r\nHonestly, it took a while for me to try to understand the plot. However, the plot is about Ryouta Murakami forming a relationship with the magicians who are girls. If you are wondering whyI didn't do review of the remaining spring anime is because I have nothing interesting to say about them. Like for example Black Bullet & Isshukan friends. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no mystery which will make me figure out how and why it happened. That is sad.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I always see anime build tension in the later episodes, just like revealing the main villain in the later episodes. Even Noragami, also did the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nAt least Elfen Lied showed torment in character. However, this anime failed to show any of these qualities.\\n\\n\r\nART (5):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is all right.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (5):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending song is ok.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the voice acting is good. Risa Taneda portrayed a good voice as Kuroha Neko.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (4):\\n\\n\r\nAt least the characters never show me any annoying traits. However, the problem is the characters aren't properly flashed out. Some characters have 1 episode backstory and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nI did like their Ryouta's relationship with the girls however, it wasn't enough.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta Murakami is bland and forgettable especially the rest of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nI think that's all I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (4):\\n\\n\r\nYou know, I really hate it when anime always ends with \"Go read the manga\" ending. This is one prime example. The end fight was very anti-climactic, the fight was very quick. I don't think I want to go into more detail.\\n\\n\r\nI've got nothing more to say. Overall, this anime had potential but due to its rushed pacing and ending, especially characters that are bland. It comes off as forgettable. So I give this anime a 4 out of 10.",

            "content": "*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS AND I AM NOT LIABLE OF ANY ACCUSATIONS, VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED\"\r\nI started watching Gokukoku no Brynhildr anticipating it will be a mystery-drenched anime dealing with aliens and riddles. After reading one of the anime's story summaries, I realized it's rated R17+, implying there has to be some sort of violence and action-based scenes. My curiosity piqued at that moment and I decided to watch the whole of GnB starting from episode 1. Initially, the pilot episode sent chills down my spine, and established a nice, perplexing atmosphere .To me, these first few episodes were a breath of fresh airfor these sci-fi fantasy genres. After the 4th or 5th episode however, things started to spiral downwards, especially because of the sheer amount of fanservice and *tits* the anime suddenly bashes the viewers with. I honestly don't get the point of bringing up a dark and foreboding plotline if the next thing that comes out is 2 girls 1 cup. On the bright side, the raw story of GnB is worth watching, if you\u2019re into the sci-fi mystery and genre. \\n\\n\r\nMany people would compare GnB with Elfen Lied simply because GnB and Elfen Lied are made by the same creators, and obviously because of this they will have similarities. In my opinion, GnB's storyline/plot derives from Elfen Lied, except this time they removed a lot of gore and it isn't as frightening to see as a whole. Furthermore, they added an unneeded amount of romance which essentially transformed this anime into a light harem, and consequently applied a fatal blow to this particular anime, at least in my opinion.  \\n\\n\r\nI've also read a few parts of the manga version of Gokoku no Brynhilder, and initially this anime had a LOT of potential to be as successful as some of the biggest animes out there such as Shingeki no Kyojin. However and most unfortunately, the anime produced is NOTHING compared to the manga version. The content last episode for example, included literally a THIRD of what's supposed to be in the manga. Sure, anime's aren't supposed to have everything - things get missed out. BUT, some important nitty-gritty has been missed out, and the main arc is given like literally 2 episodes, which resulted in plot holes, ESPECIALLY in the last episode. For example, during that episode, the fight between Kuroha and her evil older sibling, Mako, lasted literally 30 seconds. Furthermore, the final scene with Kotori and Ryouta is cut short, and most of it is just Ryouta weeping and crying.To summarize, so much is left untold, and it seems as if the creators just flippantly squeezed the whole of the manga in 13 frickin episodes leaving the whole story muddied up and ruined. \\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints to make amount this anime\u2019s sound. Even though the soundtrack doesn\u2019t stand out completely compared to other animes, it has definitely set the mood and the type of story quite well and the OP of GnB is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art involved in this anime was okay. The art style is relatively bland, and it doesn't really give any appeal - in a way it makes the anime seem rather old. Basically regarding the art, the anime doesn't live up to the standards of a lot of modern animes but hey it gets the job done. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characterization, the anime did decently well. Ultimately Ryouta (the main character) is portrayed as a mildly introverted, perceptive and soft hearted person. Occasionally his personally tips off a bit and becomes too arrogant and reckless which heavily contrasts his thought-to-be collected, logical and docile self. I mean, he's putting his LIFE on line for a few girls that might just die in a few weeks. Furthermore at most times there are situations that are WAY too serious for Routa to doze off and become a major boob critique. Moving on, Kuroneko acts as a distant, poker-faced protagonist who fights alongside with the other witches and Ryouta. I thought that they handled Kuroneko pretty well - they made it clear how she isn't accustomed at all to realistic \"human\" feelings, and her whole journey consists of unlocking different emotions that are completely new to her. It really sucks how in the last episode, she loses all her memories AGAIN, and the my sense of achievement while watching that part evaporated in thin air. I wouldn't exactly classify Kuroneko as a tsundere, because she wasn't exactly hostile to begin with, save for a few brutal scenes. I feel Kazumi is the main problem of this anime - she's a thirsty, young tsundere girl who is filled with sexual innuendos and craves nothing but Routa's virginity. She serves a purpose of disrupting Ryouta and Kuroneko's lovey dovey relationship, but hey it made the initial bland romance more interesting. Kotori is an overly shy girl with serious stuttering problems and MASSIVE tits. I honestly don't have any problems with her other than the fact that the artists emphasized the hell out of her tits and her personality is so frickin dull and annoying. As the show begins to explore her however, things start getting interesting and it seems she served a purpose at the very end. The antagonists of this show seems to stand out and sink in at the same time. The main one, mr. Chisato is particularly interesting. At first he is portrayed as a ruthless, emotionless \"evil scientist\" type person, stopping at nothing to capture all of the stray witches. His personality itself emanates an evil aura, making him a typical evil mastermind very similar to Kaiyaba Aihiko from SAO. The most peculiar moment is during one of the final scenes of the last episode, when he very abruptly saves Valkyrie's life, which evokes a powerful message of what it means to be human - you simply cannot take away the \"human\" part of all of us, regardless of how evil you may be. Although many may have viewed this moment very negatively, and I may sound very subjective but I thought that it gave him more of a unique flair that no other evil mastermind antagonist has. Valkyrie, on the other hand, is a complete sadistic bitch that has minimal character development and is OP as fuck. \\n\\n\r\nWhat am I supposed to feel after watching the whole of Gokukoku no Brynhildr? Satisfied? Overwhelmed? Sucks to say this but rather, I feel disappointed. There's a limited amount of character development, and some of the characters serve such a narrow purpose they shouldn't even exist i.e. Kotoro. The storyline in it's initial phase was awesome, but then it deteriorated into a fanservice-stained sci-fi, which is not a good blend AT ALL.    I honestly don\u2019t get what the point of putting fan service in non-hentai animes \u2013 it\u2019s a stupid way of attracting perverted attention. Anyways, I have yet to see if any improvements could be made in the future of GnB, but for now I am completely scrapping it, to avoid any serious injuries I could be going through. I could ramble on forever about how GnB to me was a complete let down but you know what? It wasn't all that bad and at the very least it was ENJOYABLE to some extent. \\n",

            "content": "I have to say that this is my first time writing a review. So it could be pretty shitty, however I just thought that I need to write something about this anime.\r\nFirst of all, I haven't seen Elven Lied or any other closely related anime, so the plot was actually kinda original to me. That said, I also have to say that the start of the anime (4-5 episodes) was decent as it introduced you into a dark story about laboratory modified people, who need help. \r\nLet's first talk about the first couple of episodes, as it was pretty much the only good thing Ican said about the anime. Like I said, the introduced story is interesting, as it starts pretty dark and full of mysteries. Even the introduced characters are not as bad at the beginning. You have a cute main girl, main hero who is not dumb and the other chicks are not bad aswell. So you think that this might end up a little better than you expected, but oh no... don't you dare think that!!\\n\\n\r\nThe show turns into shit somewhere around episode 5-6, when one of the future main characters, Kotori, is introduced. I dont really know why, but with her arrival, the bad things the characters and the anime itself had, suddenly started to show more and more. One of those things is that at the start cute chicks turned into a bunch of no-brainers and the only thing they did for the next 5 eps was show the viewers some titties. Which is not really my style of enjoying anime.\\n\r\nNext thing is, the creators actually seemed like they saw this dramatic decrease of IQ and decided to make the main hero the biggest genius on the planet, to even things out. As expected, that hurt the show even more, because now instead of a fine main hero you had an annoying guy who was simlpy too smart for this anime, while also being too nice to every character and made every girl in the show fall for him (while still being very annoying). I personally find it very hard to like these types of characters, as they are just too perfect = annoying for me.\\n\r\nThe only reason I was still watching the anime, the story, also starts to fall down as the creators expanded it too much, while not explaining the unanswered questions at the beginning. And as the last bonus, you have one of the must borring villans I've ever seen in my life. \\n\r\nWin-win situation? Not really if you ask me...\\n\\n\r\nThe art was not bad (I've seen worse), but the sound was bellow average, as I can't remember any songs from the anime, which rarely ever happens to me.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's sum this up. This anime starts all-right, but then turns into a shit show. The only likeable character in the show is Kana and the only good thing about the whole anime is the interesting premise of the story, which was ruined in the middle of it. Definetly not recommened.",

            "content": "Gokukoku no Brynhildr, another classic example of source material is more important then the anime. The anime did incredibly well up to episode 10, it honestly felt as if the creators intended to make this an 20+ episoded series, but got the bad news they had to cut episodes.\r\nNot to mention the ending- most likely the reason why people give this anime such a low score.\r\nAnyhow- let's get to the review.\r\nStory ( 8/10 )\r\nMurakami, an average boy who experienced a traumatic experience by losing his best friend Kuroneko. After almost 10 years a girl transfers in his school, a girl who remarkably looks alot likeKuroneko. Strange events start happening after she transfered in, and this is where it all starts.\\n\r\nTo be fair- this premise might not seem interesting, but what happens after really shocked me. The story gets alot more depth with multiple mysteries that the anime presents. It builds up to the point where you are wondering 'how did this all happen'.\\n\r\nSadly for whatever reason this excitement is pushed in 2 episodes, this highly anticipated moment is ruined as a result of this.\\n\\n\r\nArt ( 9/10 )\\n\r\nTo be fair, the art was fantastic. It had a dark underground tone to show that this wasn't your typical harem/romance anime. The character design was pretty good aswell, really nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound ( 8/10 )\\n\r\nI honestly don't listen to openings nor endings that often, the sound that interests me the most is the sound being played during the episodes themselves. Gokukoku no Brynhildr seems to nail the battle scenes and also has perfect soundtracks to give that 'little extra'.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ( 9/10 )\\n\r\nThis is honestly where the anime shines. Even while I don't think that any character is unique, I feel that every character has it's own purpose.\\n\r\nKeep in mind that this anime can be considered as a harem, which means that in most cases one guy ends up with multiple girls, of which only one actually is important.\\n\r\nIn the case of gokukoku no Brynhildr every character is important up to the very end of the anime. This obviously due to the supernatural aspect of the series, but nonetheless a nice change to see every character being important for once.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ( 8/10 )\\n\r\nGranted, this anime isn't perfect, but what it did well was entertain me up to the very last second. The ending made the show worse though, not to such an extend that I am giving this show a lower score then it deserves, but I feel that if they took a bit more time and didn't rush it as much it would of been more acceptable. That aside- the story was alot more in depth and had alot more gore than I expected it to have. \\n\\n\r\nOverall ( 8/10 )\\n\r\n(The ending and other small aspects aside) This anime is really good. It's nothing like your average harem and has a nice dark undertone aswell.\\n\r\nTo be fair- to get the full experience it is recommended to read the manga to continue the story. The anime ends at chapter 100, while at this point the manga is at chapter 160 or so. The manga will give more closure to those who hate the ending.\\n",

            "content": "Whenever people pick up new anime to begin their seasonal run through, a good first impression of a show is always good.  Common elements like mystery and horror are often a good start, as both of those genres can differ in many different ways.  In Spring 2014, we have Gokukoku no Brynhildr, a show that for me, grasped my attention, but failed to maintain it for a long amount of time.\r\nStory (5.95/10):  The story of this anime is essentially this.  Our main protagonist Ryota Murakami, a second year in high school, is in a bit of a conundrum.  Due toa tragic incident that occurs about 10 or so years prior to the anime's beginning, a tragedy befell on his childhood friend in whom he called Kuroneko.  Now in high school, a girl with the same name comes into his class, looking like the exact same girl that he knew from years ago but much older with motives that seem...uncertain.\\n\\n\r\nNow this concept sort of grasped me into what I thought was going to be quite a well thought out show.  The possibility of a good mystery anime combined with a possibility of romance made me quite happy to see what could come out.  While the show throughout had actually some pretty nice central themes like \"what is the worth of a life?\" and \"what is more important, your life or someone you care about?\" but really apart from that, there's not really too much else.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the show did do good on was trying to make itself seem tragic.  Which in a way, it did.  As well as presenting with a pretty decent mystery/supernatural idea and storyline that for me, sparked interest, it also made created quite a gruesome way of dying that to me looked quite terrifying and gave me a sort of shock that I really wanted from this series.  It presented us internal conflicts with its characters while, as minute as some of them might be, were decently executed in some way shape or form.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Brynhildr had quite a few number of flaws.  Most noticeably, its pacing and the structure of the anime.  Brynhildr is quite frankly a mess of epic proportions.  Whenever a plot point comes up that actually has a good chunk of significance to the story or when a new character or mysterious object comes into play, they don't really last very long.  To put it in short, Brynhildr tried to do too much in too little time.  The whole story lacked quite a bit of story cohesion as there was no real smooth transition from one thing to another, and the points that the show did focus more on were more or less the more boring or unnecessary parts.  I.E. Comedy and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing it had a problem with was plot focus.  The story had a lot of potential to expand and create a deeper and more meaningful plot with its ideas of secret government projects, aliens, the witches, and the motives behind the antagonists, but it just never got off the ground from where it really started.  To put it simply, the entire series focuses on finding out how to get freaking pills.  While yes the pills do have a lot of significance to the story, it was really all they focused on and it kind of felt stupid to watch a series about kids trying to find prescription drugs no matter how much emphasis they put on the importance of it.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have the end.  This series had the most dissatisfying end I could think of for really any series.  There was absolutely no resolution at all.  Simply put, nothing really changed.  If you watched the first episode and the last episode back to back, there will be absolutely no change to the characters overall.  (aside from additions to the cast.)  While I wouldn't discourage the series for trying to end on a happy note, (since I am a sucker for happy endings), nothing really felt resolved and it bugs me, as since there was no real character development, the whole series felt like a middle finger to the audience.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that the series focused way to much on the more unnecessary romance aspect of the show rather than the more prominent and interesting supernatural/mystery portion which in the end, was quite unexplained and broken.  While yes, this show had quite a good story base idea to it, its execution was yet to be determined.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great story idea\\n\r\n-   Focused too much on unnecessary plot points\\n\r\n-   Many points were unexplained\\n\r\n-   Disappointing ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5.96/10):  The character in this series are a mixed bag at best.  For me, I found the side characters more interesting than the actual main characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nRyota Murakami is our main protagonist of this series.  To me, he's more or less a play by play cardboard cutout character that doesn't seem to do much beyond what he does.  Aside from having a photographic memory (which seemed way too convenient for when he began talking about it), he doesn't have any outstanding qualities about himself that make him different from any other protagonist in a supernatural harem show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Kuroha Neko.  Our main female protagonist.  There's not really much to say about her.  Aside from having a more or less moral compass about saving the people around her rather than herself, there's not really too much to her.  Throughout he series, she does practically one thing, and that is to put herself in danger for the sake of others.  For a while, it was an interesting trait, as development like this is not what you would normally see in an anime filled to the brim with females, but as time went on, her traits became redundant and she didn't really seem to have anything else in terms of character traits.  Aside from that, what made me really angry about her character is the sort of spoiler thing in episode 3.  Because of plot convenience, (or inconvenience I should say), something that came up as an important plot point, which actually solved an important mystery in the story, became known to the audience, but not known to the characters.  (Even if it was the most obvious thing ever.)  The reason this is upsetting is because of the fact that they play this entire guessing game for practically the rest of the series, and as a viewer that knew this the whole time, it just felt quite stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the main cast, well, we have what I call the fill-ins.  The rest of the main cast are essentially harem members that don't have much significance beyond making ecchi moments and fanservice moments (Kazumi) that I felt the show did not need.  Like seriously, it was completely unneeded and a waste of time for the show.  They didn't have a terrible amount of character exploration to them, so they felt sort of unneeded aside from the points in the story in which their \"magical power\" came in handy.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting cast, this series had a lot of lost potential here.  A great deal of the supporting cast I felt, were interesting characters.  Characters from a mad scientist whom in his original character intro was quite fascinating, to other witches in the series with character traits and backstories that seemed more interesting to a good majority of the \"main\" witches in the series.  Another thing that the series I felt did poorly wrong were its deaths.  The deaths of the characters didn't feel meaningful in any way.  The reason being for this is because of the fact that the characters that will die usually last for about an episode or two before just dropping dead.  Aside from having a minute inverse effect on our main characters as well as popping up as ghosts when the plot demanded, there was really no point in them at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting side characters\\n\r\n-  Bland main characters\\n\r\n-  Lost of potential in characters\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.35/10 and 3.33/10):  In terms of art, the series actually looked rather well done.  The characters themselves had quite nice designs and fit well with the mysterious theme of the show.  There was always this dark undertone to the colors that I felt added to what the show was trying to do with its dark and twisted themes.  The backgrounds were the same way with a very detailed looking look to it that was rather quite pleasing to the eye.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of fanservice, the show does use quite a bit of it.  Mostly, the show references breast size, a lot, and does a lot of female stripping from time to time, even to point of having a character that was totally cool with letting a guy see everything which I felt the show did not need.  The fanservice didn't completely take over the show, but I felt that quite a lot of it was unnecessary to the story overall.  (Mostly about Kazumi and her bust complex.)\\n\\n\r\nNow, the sound.  The music in this show was just...jarring to listen to.  The OP's for the show were quite frankly terrible.  The first one for the show was essentially ambience music.  There were no lyrics, there were no memorable parts, it was essentially a loop of the same sound for about a minute or two that was so very boring.  To add to the flame, the show had an unnecessary second opening that for me, was the farthest thing that fitted the show for an opening.  To explain it in short, it was heavy metal music.  It did not fit with the show at all, it was quite terrible to listen to actually, and I had never skipped a piece of music in anime so fast in my life.  (I would've preferred to listen to School Day's OP than this.)  As far as the ending song goes, well, it's cute.  It's generic, but it sounds nice, and it's cute.  What made me dislike it was how little it had to do with the tone of the show.  It sounded like a track that fitted more with either a Shojo or more romance oriented anime than this one about witches, aliens, and pills.  For me, it wasn't a good fit for the show's tone overall.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very nicely detailed art\\n\r\n+  Good backgrounds\\n\r\n-   Just....terrible music.  Just terrible\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (5.89/10):  This show had a great deal of flaws.  No matter how well the idea of the show may seem, the execution is what really makes the idea of the show, show out more.  The execution for me was less than average.  The show rushed through everything too much for my taste, nothing that had plot significance was ever really explained, (like the \"fertilized alien egg\" that never made an appearance again after it was dropped off), and it continued to drop in new characters like bombshells, each one of them receiving less plot significance and frankly, less care from me as we went on.  (Seriously.  They drop like 4 completely new character in the last two episodes that seemed pretty damn important.)  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did not have a pleasant experience from watching this show.  While I did have some chilling moments which made me writhe in fear a little bit from watching this series, (that's a good thing), the majority of it made me raise a bunch of questions that just were never answered.  Gokukoku no Brynhildr is a pretty poor adaptation to the original series, and once again proves that things are not always what they seem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: (5.40/10)",

            "content": "****SPOILER WARNING****\r\nThis show was a tease, in every sense of the word.  The premise, and the first episode or two, really piqued my interest- a show about a bookish guy trying to search for aliens in memory of his presumably dead childhood friend.  Then enters the childhood friend, or at least a doppleganger thereof, and we get another plot element.  Add magic, and we're set for a great-sounding show!  However, this gets thrown out the window by episode four at latest, when our male protagonist becomes a walking, talking plot contrivance, with a new non-magical skill popping up basically as theplot demands it.  This problem is compounded by piss-poor character development, opting instead for a new female character showing up practically every episode, and either joining Murakami's harem, or getting killed in 'combat' with this ever-growing harem.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, I have very low tolerance for harem as a genre, but I do understand its basic appeal, if on nothing but an intellectual level- we're supposed to identify with Murakami, and enjoy having a practical army of cute girls fawning over him in the most fanservicey ways possible.  Brynhildr manages to fail even on this basic level by over-censoring the erotic elements, and detracting from the supposed budding romance between former childhood friends Murakami and Kuroha.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter each character makes their initial appearance, they start to fade into obscurity, rather than actually develop personalities beyond the superficial.  In fact, I can even perfectly identify each character by nothing but trite anime cliches:  Kuroha the shy childhood friend, Kana the tsundere, Kazumi the sexually aggressive pettanko, Kotori the easily embarrassed, busty one.  The worst part is that they did introduce a few characters near the end that weren't total stereotypes, but they each only lasted an episode or two before they were axed from the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all, this show is a meandering mess that even harem-lovers would dislike.  I'd give it a skip, if I were you.",

            "content": "When I read the summary of this anime, I was immediately interested.  The first episode had me hooked. The others? Damn, what were they a mess.\r\nSTORY-----3\r\nIf you're familiar with Elfen Lied, you will notice there are a lot of similarities between that and this anime. Don't worry it's not a rip-off, it's made by the same author and it's both about young girls locked away because they have dangerous powers. However, I hope they will learn they can not fit the manga Gokukoku no Brynhildr into 13 episodes. The plot was very slow, confusing and they just... 'threw' everything at you with no explanation.And I'm going to admit, I don't mind if a dark/depressing show has some fanservice every now and then. As long as it doesn't ruin the atmosphere, it's alright. But here? They just randomly threw in big boobs and sex jokes at the most inappropriate moments. They serve no purpose at all and were a waste of time they could spend on the actual plot. And also, don't watch this anime if you expect brave heroines. The male lead always saves the day, and the girls barely every use their power. As I said before, if you didn't read the manga this anime is confusing as hell. They randomly threw in stuff without explanation. In the last episodes, a new organization shows up, but without explaining why or what their purpose is. A lot of other things also remain completely unexplained. And the end... what kind of mess was that?\\n\\n\r\nART-----6\\n\r\nFair enough. Nothing special, cute girls but everything lacks detail. Also, the eyes in this anime are super creepy. They all look like robots to be honest. The colors are dark, and nothing really bright which fits the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-----7\\n\r\nThe first opening was great, and fitted the anime. The 2nd opening? AMAZING! I only mean the song itself. It was way too brutal for this anime, especially because this has a lot of fanservice. Voice actors are simple and nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER-----5\\n\r\nI must admit, I like the goal of our male lead. His childhood friend died and he wanted to honor her by proving aliens exist. He is somehow very good in remembering stuff, but never really explained why. (It doesn't need much explanation though) He -afcourse- always saves the day and all girls like him. This anime is not really a harem though, because he is in love with Kuroha and she with him, and only some sex-obsessed girl who somehow dies and comes back to life in the end without explanation is also in love with him. Honestly, I could care less for the other characters. Some of them were really cool, but they served no role in the plot expect for fanservice or being an asshole to Murakami. It did like how some of their deaths were unexpected, and quite sad. Like I said, only some of them were cool, others were these typical cliche characters (Shy girl with big tits, etc...) The villains in this show though...ugh. Never explained why they are evil, make dumb decisions and wait for every character to give their speech instead of killing them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT------5\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dark show, despite some of the moments, you are wrong here. Way too much fanservice, plotholes and boring moments. While some of the characters are interesting, most of them are pretty poorly written and serve no role. Despite some of the deaths, a lot of things were  predictable and each episode your questions just pile up. The end simply sucks. If you're watching this because of Elfen Lied, don't. While this has gory moments, they're very limited and ruined by fanservice. No really epic battles neither, as you couldn't see them most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL----.....6\\n\\n\\n",

I'm an ordinary watcher who doesn't have a trace who the author was or what his / her background. I'll just voiced out again what i considered in this anime apart FROM the manga itself or the anime which is the same as this one, ELFEN LIED)\r\nIMO:\r\nAs we know much of the story line, it is quite your typical show that has a main character that forgets / loosed a childhood friend then later on having it transferred on thesame school or place.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this anime is really or pretty interesting, having an ambience of a dark / comedy / tragic aura. The battle scenes won\u2019t get you so worked up or so the development of the story won\u2019t get you sweaty because of the tense. It\u2019s a simple tragic story that exist between a cruel of destiny knowing that they might die (the main Heroine or SO).\\n\\n\r\nWhat I could say: \\n\r\nIt\u2019s not really something that everyone would look forward to but I guess for a first timer or someone that wants a good simple story, it\u2019s is something. It may not be a masterpiece (for me like Code Geass I guess?) but it\u2019s good enough to have it remembered. If you would or want to enjoy something dark (I know and it\u2019s creepy especially the OP), Go watch this. It\u2019s definitely a go!\\n\r\nBut if you\u2019d read the manga (and I haven\u2019t), you may be disappointed in this one as what you could read on most of the reviews; this anime was rushed. Some are lacking from the original perspective but as far as it goes in the production, it didn\u2019t turn into something else, just lacking some details but not destructive as you think it would be \uf04a\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rated it 8.5 \u2013 9.\\n\r\nGood Luck \uf04a\\n",

            "content": "A dark anime that's part-harem, part-action... interesting.\r\n-Overall\r\nEverything about this anime is, for the most part, just average. The story, while interesting, isn't anything special. The premise is explained quite well, but the plot is straightforward and just... average. The art is also pretty standard, as well as the sound. The characters are pretty bad though. They all seem somewhat forced, especially during comedy scenes, and so appear to be unnatural andd therefore unrelatable. Character that you can't relate to won't immerse you into the anime as much. However, despite that, the action and some of the dark scenes immersed me enough for me to enjoythis anime a great deal.\\n\r\nStory: 7.3\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 3.6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 6.58\\n\r\nThis show is fair, nearly good, but not quite. More details down below:\\n\\n\r\n-Story\\n\r\nThe story revolves around these characters who escaped from a lab, and the problems they face because of this. This sometimes means fighting much stronger \"witches,\" as they're called, or just finding a specific type of sustenance the witches need to survive. It's dark and brutal, so I guess the story's interesting enough. It's not dull, at least.\\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\nIt looks pretty standard in comparison to contemporary works. Nothing really stands out, although overall it seems to have a more realistic art style in terms of background and coloration.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nIt's all pretty standard. Nothing really stands out as amazing as far as audio goes. The opening(s) aren't really catching, as one is completely instrumental (which is interesting) and the other is extremely hard-metal (which is also interesting... in a way) The ending's catchy though.\\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nThe characters seem somewhat forced, as they act ridiculously abnormal to fit their \"role\" during comedy scenes. Other times, the characters act over-dramatic during the emotional scenes, which makes me laugh really hard in a scene where I should be close to tears. Murakami is stereotypical good guy main character center-of-harem person. Kuroneko is childhood friend person that's sorta just there until the final episode. Kotori is stereotypical nice polite girl. Kana is just... dumb. I don't like her. And Kazumi is overly sexual. I guess Kazumi's sexual-ness is supposed to be funny, but it's just awkward and \"wtf?\" most of the time, since her sexual remarks just come out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\r\nDespite that, I found myself enjoying the anime quite a lot. The dark side of the anime is immersive, and the action scenes are pretty good.",

            "content": "To be honest when I bought this anime I had no idea what to expect. But when I saw that this was created by the same guy that created Elfen Lied I just couldn't say no!\r\nThe Plot\r\nThe story follows Ryouta Murakami. Ten years ago he had a best friend Kuroneko. Together they set out to prove that aliens exists, but a accident happened and Kuroneko died because of it. Now he has dedicated his life in trying to prove that his friend was right (he joined the astronomy club and searches for aliens) Fast forward a few years a new transfer student enters his schoolnamed Kuroha Neko and she looks very much like his childhood friend Kuroneko. She denies being Ryouta's friend. She somehow aced a difficult test to transfer in, but doesn't know her multiplication tables. She possesses inhuman strength and strange abilities. And strangest of all, she predicts death.\\n\\n\r\nThe story really reminded me of Elfen Lied (shocker) it's a pretty good story though not as good as Elfen Lied. It has a very lighter tone to it as well. A few bloody scenes here and there but nothing major. Note there are also a bit of mild nudity. I still enjoyed the series very much. Only problem I have with it is that it needs a season 2 or some form of a continuation.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\r\nThe first Opening fit the series very well and then for some reason they changed it near the end. Although I have no problem with the second opening it didn't really fit in with this series. The sound track to wasn't really anything amazing nothing really stood out to me. That's just my opinion though\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation\\n\r\nThe animation was good. I wouldn't say it was as great as it could've been but it wasn't really terrible either I'd say average at best. But it did do some of the scenes justice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. The story was good the characters were very likeable. Again it reminded me a lot of Elfen Lied there was even a little easter egg from Elfen Lied. Basically if you enjoyed Elfen Lied you most probably will enjoy this as well.\\n",

Most of the time, this ruins the plot development.

If people keep watching animes just for the sake of female characters we are gonna keep on getting stuff like this season after season.",

            "content": "Before starting, I should admit that I just made a MAL account in order to defend this anime. So without further ado, here is my review.\r\n__________________________\r\nI think one of the main reasons that this show has received such low scores is that people, especially the manga fans, expected too much. They foresaw an exciting anime that followed the manga exactly, had great character development, a steady pace, and great action. However, with such a mindset, Gokukoku no Brynhildr was already doomed to fail. In order to even rate an anime, one must keep in mind that the people who make the anime and the mangakawho made the manga have two completely different perspectives. These perspectives might coincide, but in the case of Gokukoku no Brynhildr, they did not. Therefore, please rate an anime based on what it is. Understand that there were episode limits. Understand that some scenes had to be cut. Understand that the anime production company did what it thought was best in mind, even if it didn't come out as planned.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of that, let's admit it. The anime wasn't perfect, nor was it close. It had it faults. A major problem beingpacing. As the anime neared its end, the producers just tried to finish the story, a whole lot of it, in a small amount of space. A 13 episode adaptation was definitely wrong in the first place. Not only did it leave viewers with wanting more, it also diluted the plot and action entirely. Only the absolute key points were shown, which weren't enough all together. For those of you who have finished, the final clash was reduced to seconds, was it not? And the conclusion? Let's not speak of how quick that was. And there were so many things left unanswered that I, personally, wanted answers to. Yes, it wasn't great. Yes, it could have been much more. But that's all there is to it. Let's move on to the positives.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that Gokukoku no Brynhildr did perfectly was keep up the suspense. From the first episode, I was drawn in to the entire story. Witches? Special Powers? Aliens Childhood connections? Pills? \"Hanesuto\"? All this led me into the next episode. It truly was an enjoyable experience being thrilled like that. The first 6 or 7 episodes were definitely the highlight of the series. Not only were they exciting, but they were touching and heartbreaking at times too. It's rare for an anime to evoke so many emotions. Not to mention, some chuckles here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, let's get on to the probably the most \"detested\" part of this anime: the fanservice. For those who hate it, I will warn you that there is plenty of it in there. The main initiator being Kazumi. She is the one who is always after Murakami. They had some pretty interesting encounters too. But, Kazumi, in my opinion, gets too much hate. Yes, she made the show a bit more lighthearted. Is that bad? I found it nice to have a comic relief here and there. While I will admit that it did get pretty annoying at times, overall it wasn't bad. In fact, I think the changes from fanservice to the serious plotline  really helped emphasize the emotions of the characters. And what about Kotori? Yes, she is the generic shy girl who has been blessed very graciously. But I find that to be the highlights of Gokukoku no  Brynhildr. It has incorporated so many character types that the show doesn't get boring. While the development might be nonexistant, the variety of character types slightly makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the art and sound. Not much to say here, actually. The art was simple but it really suited the sort of grim, serious tone of the anime. The sound was really good in my opinion. While the second OP was really, really bad, the first OP and the ED were amazing in my opinion. They both really highlighted the show's two parts: the sci-fi mystery and the romantic drama. The OST, in general, was great (with the exclusion of the second OP because it did not suit the anime at all).\\n\\n\r\nSo, lastly, I would like to say that everyone should give it a try. I personally found it to be a highly enjoyable show despite its big downfalls in certain areas. For those who are looking at Gokukoku no Brynhildr's MAL page and are staring at the low score and some of the negative remarks, please don't get too much into them. I was a victim of it once and because of it, I had decided not to watch many anime that were actually very enjoyable and interesting. I am glad that I did not do so for Gokukoku no Brynhildr.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First and foremost you should know the following: this is one of those adaptations that moves along at an unhurried pace and then tries to wrap up everything in the last episode. Obviously since there are only thirteen episodes this attempt is an utter failure, with the only solace perhaps being that there is a manga version to read if you want more, and I think you will, if only out of frustration.\r\nThe CONCEPT was interesting in my opinion, especially because I didn't fully grasp it right away, and it didn't try to force a bunch of flimsy science down my throat. This series dealsmore in the emotions of the characters, and there are quite a few bloody (albeit well censored) battles to pass the time between plot developments.\\n\\n\r\nThe ART is solid, but I must reiterate that this is HEAVILY CENSORED. The SOUND is pretty... bad. Sometimes a show can make a simple conversation or activity seem creepy and foreboding with the right score playing in the background. This show often does the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThe CHARACTERS are okay, but they also usually come with a tiring amount of cliches and (again, with only 13 episodes) there is little in the way of character development.\\n\\n\r\nYour ENJOYMENT of this depends entirely on how demanding you are of the plot. This show tends to give you a lot of juicy concepts and usually it fails to capitalize on them. One thing this show does fairly well is to keep the possibility of pain and death very real from episode to episode, and from moment to moment. If you enjoy that and a harem structure with a lightweight plot and some unconventional battles and that's most of the enjoyment factor.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL this show could've turned out very, very differently. You may notice that the average opinion on this show changed drastically after the last episode, with good reason. I disagree with the criticism that this show had no real plot and too many outlandish twists, if only because a lot (and I mean a LOT) of other, very popular shows can't really claim to be any different. I only think that this show could've pulled off an epic second season, with many a glorious battle, more witches, and a whole lot more plot development, leading to a much more consumer-friendly resolution. Seeing as this show didn't do that, it is unfortunate, but very true, that this show is a teaser at best and a bunch of whiny bloody girls at worst. \\n\\n\r\nReview in a sentence: This show is worth watching if you want some gory depressing scenes with a plot that fizzles out at the worst possible moment. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "My score is possibly based on the first ten episodes rather than the climatic finish (which was anti-climatic) (This is my first review so please take it into consideration).\r\nI was so disappointed with the ending of the anime.\r\n They clearly rushed it missed out the epic battle\r\nThis was rushed or rather the last three episodes were rushed and very disappointing.\r\nThe manga is great at all proportions and yet the anime just seems to be a trailer for the manga. If you ask me some anime adaptations towards mangas are bad but the last three episodes to this anime sums it up and leaves brutal plotholes.\\n\r\nWhat happens to each character at the end is so poor and i am basing this on the manga.The characters react so differently at the end compared to the manga.\\n\r\n This has left a sweet bitter taste in my mouth. I really wish they could have left it on a cliffhanger if they are planning on a season two.\\n\r\nBut the anime creators decided to go with an original ending it would seem which makes the anime seem so poor towards the end,\\n\r\n Elfen lied ended on a cliffhanger gave rumor to suggest a possible season 2. Bu the anime to that went with its own ending, which is seemed as more acceptable (although the manga is a far cry better).\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nI am solely basing this on the first ten episodes as it goes along with the manga quite nicely although surely the creators of the anime would have figured out that there is too much content to cram all the chapters to this point in 13 episodes. So as the for the first ten episodes the story gets a 9, however the lowered ratings suggest that how badly rushed the story was towards the end it almost had 2 halves to the series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 8/10\\n\r\nOST for series are really vital for me the set up the certain moments of the stories and create the mood to how the audience should interpret what is happening or about to happen. There were one or two hiccups along the way but apart from that i thought the OST was quite solid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nThis is highly opinion based as my favorite character in the series only got the spot light for 3 episodes (mako chan aka valkryia despite having the credits solely on her at the beginning to suggest she would be the main antagonist) The main characters don't really appeal to me much apart from Kazumi i guess. hence why the rating\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\r\nSolid animation one or two faults i guess but you get that along the way with any series\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nBasing on the first ten episodes it has so much potential but then ruined but the last part. I wouldn't be put off by this as it is very entertaining and is probably a good starting point before reading the manga.",

            "content": "I overall liked this anime, cause it has an interesting concept to it. A lot of people talk down to how this story has a similar feel to Elfen Lied (which is probably cause they share the same writer for the manga) but I didn't mind it- although that's probably because I haven't seen Elfen Lied yet. \r\nThe beginning and end sequences were nice to watch. I quite liked it. The animation style was interesting and I didn't mind looking at it as much.\r\nThe story of Ryouta Murakami was interesting. I liked his determination to find out if Kuroha was actually the person he waslooking for. However his character annoyed me to no end, especially his naivety and lack of ability to do much. He's, although smart, a little bit 1 dimensional at times.\\n\r\nWhilst the characters were quite diverse in personalities and what traits they have, I felt there was a lack in male character variety, especially how all but a few male characters were actually seen as ''good'' characters as opposed to ''dark'' characters. I could be wrong though.\\n\r\nI felt like some details with certain plot devices were quite inconsistent, such as how Murakami forgot something, even though when another character (i'm not going to say who cause spoilers and that) attempted to erase his memory he was still able to remember everything.\\n\r\nI felt like the characters seemed a bit lacking in development. They remained pretty much the same people throughout. Although at times Kuroha seemed to improve in things and develop slightly, and Ryouta seemed to make better decisions and seemed ever so slightly stronger in character (to be fair he cried in pretty much every episode), Kazumi didn't seem to develop at all, neither did Kana (but she's unable to move, I'll give her that one- though her character is interesting). Kotori did show some development, however which I liked.\\n\r\nI thought that Valkryia needed more in her character. Maybe an extra episode or something. I'm unsure if she got that in the manga, cause I never read it, but it'd be nice to know more about her. We didn't get that as much.\\n\r\nThe ending seemed a bit rushed. You don't learn much about what happened between the end fight and the end scene. I like how they thought about Kotori though.\\n\r\nOverall I did like, but it isn't in my list of favourite anime to say the least.",

The other part of me just wants to tell you not to waste your time.\r\nStory: 6  Art: 6 Sound: 6\r\nAs story line goes, it had so much potential. In the beginning I was genuinely excited to explore the characters, and learn more about the world. But the story line, quite literally, drops off. It's fairly easy to get lost, and too many things, IMPORTANT things, had been rushed.  As art goes, it was alright. It fit well with the show,but other than that it has nothing special too it. At point's it was painful to watch because characters emotions wouldn't match up with their facial expressions. As far as sound goes, the series has two different openings. The first you hear is actually pretty great, it gives you the science fiction feel the show was going for. But the second opening is a joke. I understand what they were trying to do, but as a fan of that kind of music, even I wanted nothing to do with it. As for the music in the show itself, I felt like it was always spot on, and worked really really well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:2 Enjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were rushed, and not properly developed. Murakami, from the beginning was rather obnoxious and it only grows worse and worse through out the show. As the main character, you want to cheer him on, but he is such a sucker that you can't. The leading ladies I had more hope for, and they still fell flat. New characters enter too quickly and immediately become attached, and you really aren't given time to like any of them, considering the fact that you learn so little about them. My enjoyment level of this anime can be compared to that of watching a car crash. It's horrible, but you can't look away. I kept thinking it was going to get better, and eventually towards the end the story picks back up and you begin to think that it wasn't half bad. But still in the end, it falls short of the line.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\n I wouldn't watch it again, and when friend's have asked if I would recommend it I say no. The story is too rushed, you are left with to many unanswered questions, and with an unsatisfying ending. I am giving it a six because it does have it's glimmering moments. In the beginning and in the last couple of episodes, almost to the very end. You really feel like the story is going somewhere, and that you may get the opportunity to learn more. Even with characters being as undeveloped as they were, the story could have won. But they rushed it, and it makes the whole show itself bland and disappointing.",

Unfortunately, probably too few funds, often painting collapse, although not picky harmless. Producers also seems unknown animation company. Quality perspective, \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\" is weak compared with the same period of the works.\r\n2 roles, personal evaluation: 9 points.\r\nActress Kuroha Neko very cute! One of my favorite female character animation. Several singing are sprouting bleeding. Especially for the first time before the singing, has behaved a little cold, a littlefunny song that deliberately unexpected contrast Moe.\\n\r\nIQ-type actor also loved the protagonist, not a lot of anime hero no brain open plugs, the story can increase attraction. In fact, the film exploring the IQ is not enough.\\n\r\nLying motionless tongued sister early scenes are more then a few basic lines of late gone. Porn sister(XD) Kazumi\u2018s nude scenes, in the animation medium, personal feeling slightly too.\\n\\n\r\n3 nude scenes, personal rating: 7 points.\\n\r\nMeat lens please let the audience see the mass of course happy, but it undermine the overall aesthetic. As for Episode 11 \"Seaside welfare\", sorry, I've seen many animations, picture style than the \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\" fine and delicate plenty. \"Seaside welfare\" This story really does not matter to us old otakus. Please do you do a complete story.\\n\\n\r\n4 stories, personal evaluation: 9 points.\\n\r\nDarkness to the plot, this is my first fan to see this momentum and early impression. But deep atmosphere is sold Meng Meng sister malicious break up almost finished. Not to say that selling Meng bad, God has been hailed as the most animated, there are many easy comedy interspersed details. But too much weight, it seems contrary to the purpose. Taking away adorable sister, in fact, the story itself is not enough darkness degrees.\\n\\n\r\n5 story jumps degrees, personal evaluation: 5 points.\\n\r\nAs we all know, the general comic book movies,comics 2-4 sets adapted into an episode of animation, comic publishing more than 100 sets, and animations 13 episodes would be finished? According to these sales will be difficult in the second quarter. Whether or main plot details are danced too much, especially Episode 10, Episode 11.\\n\\n\r\n6 Depth of connotation behind, personal evaluation: 5 points.\\n\r\n\"Elfen Lied\" is the reason why many viewers called to God works, not just lots of  plasma, the girl's nudity and brush funky musical values, as well as giving the thinking behind the story about humanity, love, awareness, discrimination against vulnerable groups. But unfortunately \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\" has nothing to do with these, just a good story.\\n\\n\r\n7 Music, Personal evaluation: op1: 9 points, op2: 0 points.\\n\r\nOn Bgm \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\" just so-so, did not give deep impression.\\n\r\nIn any animation, effects of op1 are enormous. Pure music op1 of \"Gokukoku no Brynhildr\" has good melody, in slightly mysterious. In Bilibili in China (like Nico in Japan) this \"close to Divine Comedy\" level op brings a great popularity for the animation.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have to say, op2 is really holy shit! Not to mention the 13 episodes of the animated, There is no need to replace the original good op1, Why take such a silly fork lousy song for a youthful cartoon? Aesthetic sense of the producers have lost into dustbin?  Producers do not think about how to use the money to improve the script's quality, from time to time to avoid the painting collapse, have made such a thing? Do they have to make this style of song, in order to reflect on the revolt fighting against fate of the protagonists?\\n\r\nThe majority of the people having said when looking Episode 10 , we can skip \"op\" now when watching this movie .\\n\\n\r\n(i'm a Chinese student with poor English. I spend nearly 3 hours writing this review with aid of Google Translate. I hope my work can be audited. Thank you very much! )\\n",

The premise sounds generic, but the execution is below that.\r\nIt's a mix of Dark drama and Harem. And Sci-Fi. And Fantasy. Also don't forget the Comedy.\r\nTo be honest, it's a mess\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nThe story revolves around Murakami Ryouta. When he was a kid, he befriended a girl he call Kuroneko. She said that she had met aliens. But before she can prove that, she got involved in an accident and died.\r\nPresumably...\r\nYears later, he met a girl that looks exactly like her, but her name is Kuroha Neko. After a fewmisunderstandings, he helps her and her friends who are being chased by an evil organization that has something to do with aliens and artificial magic.\\n\\n\r\nIf that doesn't sound generic, then you probably have some unique taste.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, this anime has bad pacing. Particularly near the end. So many things are happening after another I completely lost track of what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, bad plot. Mostly the plot points. Generic is one thing, but this plot just throws sense out of the window. One moment they're talking about something that's supposedly important, the next minute everybody forgets it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, sucky plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe graphic isn't special. It has it flaws, but mostly good.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this I can actually like. Especially the OP, it doesn't have any lyrics, but it captures that gritty feeling just right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThey're basic character archetypes. what more can I say?\\n\\n\r\nMurakami wants to protect the girls. Neko wants to protect everyone. Kana has a sharp tounge. Kazumi tries to be perverted. And Kotori is the gentle soul.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really lackluster. It tries to do too much on such a short time. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and the ending contains no sense at all. It left many, MANY unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nLike, \"What the hell is this?!\" \"What the hell is that?!\" \"Who the hell is she?!\" \"What the hell just happened?!\" \"Why the hell did that happen?!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's ending is basically saying \"READ THE MANGAS, FOOLS!!\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the manga though, you might enjoy watching this, because you'll know what the hell is going on.

            "content": "I don't know, this series is just bland as hell..anyways since I have a lot of criticisms in this series I'll just do a positive/negative review.\r\nPositive\r\n1. I'll first start with the ONLY Character that Single handedly carried the show (for me) and that's KAZUMI, she first starts as a character who is just there but out of everyone she has the best character development.\r\nheck even her willingness to give up her virginity is has a reason, (manga spoilers)\r\nanyway from a filler character she became the most caring and exciting to watch, and I do feel that her feelings are genuine.\r\n2. I do like the conceptabout the pills that witches need to take, if only they could have just focused there then things would turn out okay I think.\\n\\n\r\n3. Murakami though I still dislike him does prove himself to be a useful character, yeah he doesn't have any powers but he's doing something \\n\\n\r\nBonus: I do think Kana is an Okay Character, Nanami as well It's just sad that her death was just out of nowhere thus making it look and feel forced\\n\\n\r\nNEgative (since that's all I can think off)\\n\\n\r\n1. THERE ARE FULL OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS...I mean just watch the series...I can't really say anything because a lot occurred during the FINAL episode..like\"WHY REVEAL NOW!!!!!\" ...It just feels forced and so out of place..they would spend times on fanservice and just puts the serious stuffs for later\\n\\n\r\n2.Almost all of the characters feels forced..I'll state why for example: Kotori..she just appears out of nowhere barely gets screentime  and suddenly she becames this VERY IMPORTANT character which makes no sense \\n\r\nanother thing is Neko she's just so bland and just a version of a typical shounen MC..Kana has forcast powers and there are times where she knew she was going to die but what...she still do that she MUST do..then she'll tell others not to die...shit.\\n\\n\r\nHatsuna appears in episode 11 only to die in episode 12 WTF..then in the epislogue\\n\\n\r\n3. The Romance is bland as hell..It's obvious that Neko is the main love interest but there was no buildup to her and murakami's relationship..It's all Neko reminds Murakami the kuroneko shit..\\n\\n\r\n4. THIS IS NOT HORROR..IT'S HAREM..\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy the series but really as it progresses it's becoming more boring and it has one of the worst finales I've ever scene..but If you're fine with a cliche anime then this is good I guess",

            "content": "Brynhilder In The Darkness\r\nArt: The art style was pretty generic when it came to character design. I did enjoy the colors and the shading that made the characters at least a little unique. I found that each character style however was pretty stereotypical. I mean you had your shy, quiet, dark haired girl, a Lolita girl with some kind of affliction, the ditzy one with big breasts, and a main guy who can\u2019t seem to get anything to work quite right, but more on that later. I did like that there was good amount of background images and the art of space were truly gorgeousto look at. While there was a bit of nudity and fan service, the version on Crunchyroll blocks it out mostly, but not in the white beam of death, more like an extra steamy bath.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: So the first thing you hear is the intro song and while the first one is an awesome dubstep jam, the second opener is a death metal song. I have to say I have never experience that in an anime and it was really awesome to see the liberty that they chose to have with this show.  As for the other sounds and music i felt that it went mostly unnoticed, and this could be because it blended so well with the story. I did notice a few times where the story would take a turn and the music would change drastically to accommodate that. For this I really found that the music made the show easy to listen to and the sound of certain things happening (I won\u2019t spoil it) made me feel like i was really present with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory: This show picks up after a tragic accident from the childhood of Ryouta Murakami, where his best friend fell to her death. 10 years later he is still searching the stars for alien life in her honor. Then, one day, a girl who looks exactly like his late best friend transfers into his class. Neko continually denies not being the friend that had passed away, but Murakami wants to be sure. Then, when she uses special magic powers to save his life from a massive bolder, it comes out that she is a Witch, or at least a person who has been given powers through dangerous experiments. Throughout the show Murakami picks up more than just Neko, and soon a whole harem of \u201cwitches\u201d who have escaped the experiments have joined him as he vows to protect them. There is a lot of sadness, and quite a bit of romance between the girls and Murakami, but we always seem to root for one.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: I put this show on my list almost a year ago, mostly because I had heard that there was a lot of fan service. But as I began to watch anime more critically I found that this kind of entertainment, while enjoyable to watch, is not what makes a show good or bad. While the fan service was not really a major part of it at all, I found that the constant back and forth that Murakami and Neko have of weather or not she is or she isn\u2019t his deceased best friend got to be drawn out and tiring. I kept having to put this show on hold for various reasons, one of them being I had other shows to watch that did a better job of holding my interest. While this is by no means a bad show, I found that the story line was somewhat predictable and it could have used more dramatic twists and turns. I mean by the last episode I could have guessed each event individually and would have been 95% right. If you enjoy shows that are both generic and enjoyable, Brynhilder in the Darkness is for you!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7/10",

            "content": "Note: This review contains some mild spoilers, but shouldn't be more detailed than what you would find in an MAL synopsis. \r\nWatching Gokukoku no Brynhildr is like riding a train, when you know there is a train wreck coming up, but you stay on board anyway because the staff keeps serving you such delicious snacks. If you like anime that are full of the audio/visual equivalent of delicious snacks and don\u2019t get too preoccupied with the nuances of its overall execution, you might really like this anime. If you are very particular, and only like thoroughly fleshed-out characters, realistic relationships, and calculated story arcs, thenit might be safe to pass this one by.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you can\u2019t handle a bit of gore, just turn around now and walk away.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, this anime is likely more enjoyable than many of the others in its genre. The series itself falls into a hybrid harem/ecchi/thriller/sci-fi category. There is a single male protagonist who is introduced in various quirky ways to various quirky females, who each have various quirky hairstyles, clothing choices, and levels of physical endowment.  \\n\\n\r\nOh, and they\u2019re all being targeted by some sinister, evil organization. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and they\u2019re all in constant danger of suffering horrific, mind-numbingly gruesome deaths.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and they're all demonstrating strange, inexplicable superpowers. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and one of them may-or-may-not be the reincarnation of the protagonist\u2019s childhood friend, who is supposed to be very, very dead. \\n\\n\r\nBut other than that they are perfectly normal teenagers living perfectly normal (albeit ecchi-infused) teenage lives in an observatory at the top of manicured, lonely, grass-covered hill. Of course, the young women quickly become romantically interested in the (mostly) pure-hearted protagonist. And while I won\u2019t go into too many details on the story\u2026 suffice to say that when the protagonist meets them, the girls are all alive, and the story is about making sure they get to stay that way. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is well done, if sometimes unimaginative. It is clean and modern and approachable, an excellent choice for a bargain-bin harem anime. Don\u2019t expect anything too ornate, and don\u2019t expect anything too minimalistic. It strikes a good balance, and uses some great backgrounds, which I appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP for this anime is actually very impressive, and was one of my favorites during the season that it aired. Beyond that, the pacing of the dialogue is occasionally off in my opinion, and some of the music is a bit cheesy, but overall the sound is fine for an anime of this caliber. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize my opinion of the show, you should know that I watched the whole thing, and enjoyed the majority of it. Ecchi anime are often made to be fluffy, stimulating, and easy to consume. Gokukoku no Brynhildr is all of those things, with an added air of mysterious tension. Though I can\u2019t rate it highly as a whole, that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t worth watching. It\u2019s a good time-waster, a good anime to fall back on when there\u2019s nothing catching your interest. Through all its faults, the authors definitely got a few things in the show right, and those things can make the experience worth it for their viewers. Overall, this anime is above average for harem anime of its kind; and if you wind up watching, I sincerely hope you enjoy it.",

            "content": "This is my first review, but it won't be my last. \r\nOkay so first off, this anime is straight up average. Yes it has that plot twist, but it wasn't amazing or spectacular to begin with. Although it did have some good character charisma, there wasn't any major feelings or aspect that caught my eyes. \r\nStory - 6/10 Linear storyline. Not much choices expect to do certain things or anything mind blowing. You have the Villian, the Hero, and the Victims. Typical Harem-action anime. Plus the story isn't too interesting. The only thing that was interesting is the ending. Which was disappointing. The ending isshort and I've felt like they missed stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10 Good vivid colors. Not incredible like No Game No Life or Kawai Complex. Nice style for a 2014 anime series. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 5/10 Did not really adapted the mood of anime sometimes. The opening was alright. The ending songs were okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10 I felt like they rushed it. You didn't really get all the character and why they did some stuff. I felt barely any remorse for the main protagonist and for the girl. Dang. Just wow. I wish they would extend the background story for all of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10 I really did like the suspense, but what the messed up was the phase when a character should make an appearance. Like come on, we knew she was coming from the beginning!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10 Average anime. Wasn't great or bad. It's a good anime to just watch how the story turns out. Not to be emotional or feel a connection between two characters. Also the story doesn't make sense after the ending. It's just a cliffhanger and a lot of foreshadowing.",

            "content": "~NOTE~\r\n- I have not read the manga to compare to the anime.\r\n- May contain spoilers.\r\nIf I were to describe Gokukoku no Brynhildr in one word, it would be \"Potential.\" This anime has so many bad reviews, but I think it's mainly from people who are comparing to the manga. Regardless, after seeing this anime get compared to Elfen Lied, I gave it a try since I was a fan of that anime.\r\n-Story:   \r\n~Pros:  When I started watching, I was just expecting exactly what the detail description says. I never would of guessed this anime would a harem. This anime is a combinationof sci-fi/ harem. As a harem anime fan, this was refreshing to watch because it is different from the normal ones you often see. (until it never picked up again.) Another thing that hit me by surprised was this story about these girls that have different powers, \"witches\", that escape from laboratories. As far as the story goes, I think it's good. It may not be original but it's different.\\n\r\n~Cons: The biggest problem with the story is, there are so many unanswered questions.  One: how did these girls end up in the labs. Two: how exactly did they get their powers. Three: why are only girls experimented. Four: how long were each girl there. \\n\\n\r\n-Art:  \\n\r\n~Pros:  The animation I would say it's decent. ONLY, because I expected more from an anime that aired in 2014. One thing I really liked about this anime was the first opening. That opening, I honestly don't know how to describe it, but unique and it really pulls you in. As the anime progresses, there are scenes where the girls are covered in blood. Honestly, after finishing this anime that's all I remember about the animation.\\n\r\n~Cons:   The fight scenes wasn't as appealing as I hoped. I didn't really care who would win.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: \\n\r\n~Pros:  For the sound, the only thing that stood out to me is the first opening song, and parts of the ending song. I really thought they fit the mood of the visuals. The first opening is another example of different since it had no vocals compare to other anime.\\n\r\n~Cons:  Murakami's Crying.\\n\\n\r\n-Character: This part of the anime is where I had so much problems with. ~Pros:    The only thing I liked was the different personalities of each character. I like how Murakami is such a nice guy. Like seriously, the man died twice, goes out of his way to jack pills for girls, almost died pulling girls up when they fall down a hill. I especially like Kazumi's pervertedness and Kotori's airheaded personalities.  \\n\r\n~Cons:   My Biggest problem was character development.  I somewhat remember how Murakami was tutoring this girl. What was the whole point of that, because she only showed up in two episodes and was gone. The character development was so poor done, I honestly barely even cared about the deaths. They never told us if the girls had any family, or even how their childhood are. We only know about Murakami and Neko's childhood but barely. I was sad only at Kazumi and Kotori's death because I liked them, but girls like Nanami or Hatsuna didn't really care. It felt like they added characters, and didn't know what to do with them so they killed them off. My personal problem: the romance never picked up! what kind of harem is this.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: Aside from the problems, with a open mind I really did enjoy this anime. When Kazumi is perverted around Murakami, those scenes were really enjoyable. I especially like when a new witch appears, I always wonder what their power is. Scenes where Neko gets jealous and explodes things that was also enjoyable. Also found the things Murakami did for the girls was enjoyable. (things in the character section) Biggest enjoyment to me was when Murakami kicked Chisato in the face. I was waiting for someone to teach him a lesson.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Even though, there are many problems; we need to understand they only had 13 episodes so they have to rush the story.  I still say this anime had a lot of potential.  If you can easily ignore these problems, go ahead and give this anime a chance.\\n\\n\r\n~ Pros:\\n\r\n- unique 1st opening.\\n\r\n-sci-fi/harem\\n\r\n-\"witches\" with different powers.\\n\r\n- likeable characters\\n\\n\r\n~Cons:\\n\r\n-rushed anime\\n\r\n-THE ENDING.\\n",

Brynhildr has events that take place within the anime with no reason, and they seem illogical even with the logic in the anime. Now don't assume that i hate Sci-Fi shows because i don't, but they at least stay within their boundaries and the \"super natural\" that occurs actually has an explanation. It started out great and i was loving every moment of it, though the comedy was provocative it was hilarious, and it had awesome characters. Butthey started destroying the plot in the end with situations that didn't make sense, and they then answered every question involving the plot with a completely absurd and ludicrous notion that was completely obtuse compared to the entire show and started trampling on all our basics beliefs, and started adding new things that were barely mentioned before and were almost out of thin air. Personally i believe that everything went downhill after episode 11. But that's just my opinion...",

            "content": "Brynhildr in the Darkness (holy hell is that name hard to type properly) is an anime that plays itself off as a dark, horror themed show... though it doesn't quite hit the mark.\r\nLike Elfen Lied, Brynhildr is a dramatic gore fest and both shows are written by the same author, going as far as sharing the same general circumstances - girl(s) with superpowers escape bad research facility, the first girl that the MC meets is related to some accident from his past, yada yada yada have to secure a safe haven for the girls yada yada yada you get the idea.\r\nSo, let's begin this review.\r\n1.Story\\n\\n\r\nBrynhildr's story is almost similar to Elfen Lied, as I have mentioned in the text above and I must say that it started off strong with a fairly interesting premise to keep me watching.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I find the wrapped idea of magic and witches very interesting, it is very hard for me to ignore the less than stellar decisions the characters make to advance the plot, putting aside the ridiculous amount of deus ex machinas as the story goes along (Kotori being the biggest culprit).\\n\\n\r\n2) Characters\\n\\n\r\nThe fact Murakami devolves from \"fairly okay guy that doesn't come off as an edgy self-insert protagonist\" to \"nice guy that is willing to risk his life for every girl he sees\" is just mind boggling. \\n\\n\r\nHe didn't grow as a character, he didn't grow a justifiable motivation for his actions at all and that makes it hard to understand why he bothers (excluding the shounen-esque \"I want to save my friends!\" reasoning because no, that's not a realistic reason).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the members of his harem (come on, you know it), they are rated from \"okay\" to \"why the hell does she exist at all\" in ascending order, starting from Kuroha and ending with Kotori. I get it, you want a shy big tits character that stumbles a lot, but honestly that is way too comical to be useful in any show that's trying to take itself seriously. So for the girls, they just sorta exist to be helpless without Murakami swooping in to help come up with some coherent plan.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some gripes with the backgrounds of some of the major characters, like why Murakami lives alone and all the other convenient plot devices, but we'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\n3) Art\\n\\n\r\nI'm not well-versed with aesthetics and the particular styles of studios, but I can say that Brynhildr sports a rather generic color palette as well as decently done animations that look rather dated.\\n\\n\r\n4) Sound\\n\\n\r\nNow the sound department has quite a few shortcomings, what with the sudden decision to replace the honestly well-done first OP with a metal song by Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I say that the actors did their job quite well. Kazumi's VA however, has this strange lisp that just irks me to no end. Maybe it's just me, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\n5) Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWith the rushed ending, the hastily introduced plot elements later on in the story as well as the rather botched attempt at recycling Elfen Lied's plot, this anime served to be a good time killer and honestly a good one at that, I have to admit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt has its numerous flaws and it did fail to live up to the hype, but I think this is a solid mediocre anime to watch when you have nothing else to do with your time. If you don't look too hard, you'll find yourself having a pretty decent time with it.\\n\\n\r\nBut who am I to tell you what to watch? Take this review seriously or with a pinch of salt, I don't really care. Cheers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm an avid reader of the Gokukoku no Brynhildr manga. It had me hooked, and I couldn't stop reading once I started. I was so excited to hear that an anime adaptation of the manga would be coming out. However, my excitement for the anime led to an even stronger disappointment when I watched the anime. \r\nThe similarities between Brynhildr and Elfen Lied aside, here is my 10 cents on the  anime. The first few episodes aren't bad. They're semi-interesting, and they keep you wanting to come back for more. They also stay pretty close to the original story in the manga and arepaced pretty well. Come episode 4, the pacing suddenly speeds up. From there on out, the story starts to unfold in each episode at a much faster rate than the manga. This normally wouldn't matter so much, but I started losing the urgency that should be conveyed by the situation that Murakami and the magicians are in. What felt like several days or weeks in the manga ended up feeling like one or two days in the anime. Murakami and the magicians are in the same situation with a different character everyday? and one episode is just dedicated to the encounter with that witch? C'mon, let the main characters, and me, pee their pants a little wondering what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\n That being said, I still didn't have too much to complain about it until the last 2 or 3 episodes. The last few episodes are just atrocious. It's like they crammed 50 or so chapters and most of the important events in the manga into 2 episodes, most of it occurring in the finale. I won't sugarcoat it; the finale was unbearable. I almost didn't want to finish it because it was so bad, and I often found myself checking how many more minutes were left of this atrocity. The anime gets rid of every important encounter and removes all the suspense, action, and emotion that is evoked in the manga. I'm just really disappointed that a manga I really enjoyed was turned into a giant turd when animated.",

That is to say, while the show had caught my attention with its flawless op and its interesting ideas, it was the most compressed anime i have ever seen. It was less than 20% of the length it should havebeen, based on the source material and I would recommend the manga over the anime, not that the manga is outstanding in any way but outside of the op if anything from this show caught your eye then you would be better off reading the manga... However if you have already read it or don't intend to get to deep into the story anyway you may want to see this because outside of the broken ending and questionable length it was quite enjoyable for the time it had.

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\n[Mini Review]\r\nBrynhildr is not just bad in the superficial sense, with its bland characters, unfocused pacing and general stupidity, it also lacks a certain understanding about what makes story-telling actually work. Missteps are evident in every aspect of its execution, turning supposedly serious moments comical and comical moments wince-worthy, a trend which only collects towards the anime's eventual finale, as this train-wreck continues to pick up more carnage as it runs down the track. The plot attempts to emulate dark supernatural mystery, but comes of more as edgy dribble that fails to bring any real emotion into its story. Astute viewerswill notice parallels to Elfen Lied and rightly so; both stories conceived by the same author. But while Elfen was poor in every aspect, Brynhildr takes it one step further; seemingly rejecting elements that could have improved the experience in favor of the same, tired cliches that the genre has adopted into its culture over the decades. For something that tries to be dark and mysterious and exciting, Brynhildr is dull; too obvious with mystery, too stupid for darkness, and any excitement you may have had for the plot burns out quickly in congruence with those other two details. When you pair that with the unbelievable amount of contrivance and contradiction of the story, even enjoyment on the most basic level eventually is replaced with the frustration of watching an anime so incompetent that it can't even seem to grasp how uninteresting and poorly done it really is.\\n\\n\r\nNothing is redeemed as you look away from Brynhildr's flawed core and examine the aspects that most bad anime incorporate. The constant fan-service is tiresome, especially when the anime decides its a supernatural mystery again, and patience is really pushed when it becomes apparent just how little effort was put into crafting the setting and details. Action is the only vehicle left to enjoy Brynhildr, and the aesthetic makes it decent, as battles between the supernatural forces of the anime become the only time when any sort of engagement could possibly be reached. Also, if you're able to completely turn your brain off, you may be able to enjoy the completely unexpected twists that the anime pulls out of its ass, so prepubescent and under-cooked that they hardly feel real. It's so \"out there\" and \"out of nowhere\" that it's almost enduring. Almost. \\n\\n\r\nBut when compared to the outright trash that the rest of the anime is, that has a vague air of grasping at straws, trying to find something, anything, that the anime does right. I mean, I feel as should be insulted as a fan of the supernatural genre, but I'm not. Brynhildr insults me as an aspiring writer, who is really doing his best to turn his ideas and experiences into stories that can be enjoyed, and seeing that something so tasteless, so dull, and so uninspired can not only be fully conceived but made into a full 13-episode anime... it's just disheartening. And it makes me feel ashamed. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n P.S: Moles before names.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)\\n",

The storyline sounds good but is rushed and poorly done. Pointless gore so don't watch whilst eating.\r\nMusic: Nice first opening, repetitive but cool and upbeat with nice animation. Bad second opening, ending pretty normal. Background music during anime was actually above average, but surprising at times, if anyone has seen 'An Inspector Calls' the moment where we see him in a rocking chair with that loud clashy music, well sometimes the music was a little much like then!!\r\nArt: Not bad, motion of walking abit awkwardly done. A nice sunset scene down at the water with the Kikako, animation really nice for her and background at that point, colours really vivid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Main character pretty lame tbh, cool that he's into astronomy but he was not amiable. Lots of fanservice, not appreciated, aside from that 'witches' were quite annoying showing weird emotions.",

            "content": "Let's get this out of the way: when I first watched Brynhildr, I hadn't seen Elfen Lied.  So I come in here with no context about how its similar or dissimilar and... I think that's probably a good thing, at least to have the perspective of analyzing it on its own.\r\nThe basic story involves a boy (Murakami) meeting a girl (Kuroha Neko) who happens to be both the spitting image of his dead childhood friend, and a \"Witch\" -- in this setting a young woman given seemingly supernatural powers through (initially) vague mad science-y means.  What it means to be a witch isessentially the hook for the whole story, because Neko and her witch friends are on the run from the lab that created them, and also need to acquire some resources in short supply if they are to survive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd from there... it's actually really engaging.  Essentially every episode, something happens or is revealed that shifts the dynamics of the story, keeping it moving forward without burning up the motivation of the characters the way a weaker show might.  The show evolves essentially all the way to the final two episodes, and while this does have some bad consequences for the climax, which is a little rushed, the road getting there was pretty great.  I also enjoy that this is a show where the protagonists are very active -- most of what happens is the result of them choosing to fight their fate or engage with the world, rather than just the villains knocking on their door, though that does happen as well.  The antagonists may seem to suffer for it, since they're not very good at hunting down Murakami and his ever-expanding club of witches, but they do make threatening plays (or counterplays, as the case may be) and provide ample additional challenges to the simple and ruthless rules of witch life.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good looking, with smooth animation and engaging character designs... and best of all, really good action.  The battles in this show, and there are quite a few of them, are generally excellent.  They're not just magical zapping and they're not just traditional combat, they're a solid mixture of creatively employed superpowers, melee fighting, cat-and-mouse dynamism, and once or twice even gunplay.  There's both intensity to the fighting and real cunning in the strategy, letting characters employ their brains and their brawn, both dramatically highlighted on screen, in order to win.  Further, the action is kept engaging and high-stakes because none of it is wasted -- neither the heroes nor their foes typically make a move that you absolutely know the outcome of going in, and characters can get hit, get hurt, and importantly for the art really sell the dire nature of those hits and hurts (or lack of dire nature) so that each attack feels like it matters, like it could be game-ending.  This is in stark contrast to shows that rely on the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy or make too heavy use of one-sided slaighters:  In Brynhildr, the action has meaning, and you want to see the outcome for yourself rather than assuming it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that the first OP might be one of my all-time favorite anime OPs -- it shows off action, expresses character, weaves in some pretty good symbolism achieved through quick and excellent visual metaphor, and the music that goes with it, though instrumental, is catchy as hell.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of the music and sound... it's all good.  I remember and like the voice acting for all the characters, they sound natural and easily express their different personalities while most of them also still have a good range.  It's not jawdropping, by any means, but it's very solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, I think, might be the show's strongest point.  There are a lot of them, and the show takes its time to explore most of them.  We see Murakami, Neko, Kazumi, Kana, and even Kotori go through a lot, both their highs and their lows, and in several cases we really get to explore what makes them tick, both how they deal with really bitter hardship and how they enjoy themselves.  I appreciate that we get to see this cast both at their high points and in their deep lows and trying moments, and that most of the characters remain really entertaining people who you can have a good sense for through all of it.  The villains aren't quite as strong; most of the ones you see in the first half of the show don't have a ton of character to them, serving more as monsters or obstacles to overcome than intellectual opponents for the main cast, but one of the things the otherwise rather weak conclusion does well is develop at least a couple of the baddies that have been built up over the course of the show, Chisato and Valkyria, though it does come a little too late.\\n\\n\r\nMentioning the ending brings us to the show's biggest problem: that ending.  The movements of the ending aren't bad, technically, but for a show that had been so well-paced, it suddenly has to rush ahead.  Every episode had thrown a new curve into the plot up until the last few, but every curve had also had the time and attention it needed dedicated to it, letting us really feel the weight and understand the consequences of what just happened or would be happening shortly.  When the climax kicks off, however, the pace of reveals increases and they don't get the time they need to have their impact.  A lot of threats are raised and defused in rapid succession, and it would be easy to lose track of what the stakes are right now, as opposed to ten minutes ago.  And for a show that I praised, and I feel rightly, for the intelligence and creativity of its action, the final conflict is largely lacking in it.  The first few steps of the scene have some of the weight, and there's a good *character* moment between Murakami and Kuroneko in the middle of it, but the finish is... no clever plan, no dynamic exchange of blows, no creativity to the use of their superpowers, just throw one godly powerful being at another and hopes what comes out of the all-concealing bright light is victory.  So what should have been the show's strongest point, the chance to really pull out all the stops and give us a massive, grand spectacle is... actually kind of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThat is sort of emblematic of my reaction to Brynhildr: it does a lot that's technically excellent, but I enjoyed it only passing-well for that.  And there were problems.  The evil witch-making lab seemed terminally stupid at times (even if, in retrospect, they were quite good about their contingency plans at least attempting to prevent... exactly what happened), and while some villainous characters got a little development we never did get an overarching \"why\" for the shadowy omniscient council behind that layer of villainy.  There are plot threads that don't quite have the scope they need to, and on the whole it feels like we shouldn't be finished at where the show ended.  And true, this is accurate, since the show ends well before the point in the story where the manga it adapts actually ends, so there is more story... though if my investigation into it after watching the show tells me rightly, the manga kind of fumbled its climax too, so I'm not sure how much anything would have been helped by having a longer, faithful adaptation rather than the truncated one we got.\\n\\n\r\nStill, though, I'd very much recommend Brynhildr.  It stands on its own well, and does enough technically right, especially in the first, oh, nine episodes or so, that it's absolutely worth watching.  Just be aware that the payoff is not going to be as strong as the setup and you should be fine.  I think the most critical argument for the show is that it mixes dark and light very well.  Both the abjectly awful scenarios and conditions the characters have to endure, and how they can laugh and smile while living their everyday lives despite those considerations, are handled very well, and it makes the subjects be more likeable and relatable, as well as more human, that even when there are dark clouds on the horizon, they don't fail to grasp a ray of sunshine when they can.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Brynhildr is carried forward by smart action, good characters, and an engaging plot, even if it ultimately does suffer in a few areas.  I'd very much recommend it.",

This review is not to be taken serious, afterall this is just a entertaiment like a fail comp. video on youtube.\r\nGood points :: Protagonist wasn't too stupid. Character's different personality and roasting each other was enjoyable, not too sad ending for show with multiple death. Believable friendship.\r\nBad ones :: Final battle was anticlimactic. Stupid mistakes or action made by supposed smart antagonists. The witches' magic seems stereotypical.\r\nP.S.: If you feel like it's mess up then you could just stop watching it.Comedy in this was biggest highlight in english dubbed version. Like others it can only be descirbe as unique as in one piece movie 6.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar show but obscure: Kemonozume by madhouse. ;-))",

Maybe this question will get answered when I read the manga, but because this anime caused me much confusion (or maybe I'm just really slow? lol) I don'tknow instead of convincing me to read the manga, it doesn't motivate me to do so unlike the others that I feel like I must read the manga to give me more content and to satisfy me more.

            "content": "First I'd like to say this review is purely my opinion and if you love this show I won't have anything against it, everyone has their preferences. Brynhildr in the Darkness or Gokukoku no Brynhildr is NOT a bad anime by any stretch of the means, it can be very enjoyable at the time. My score may come down to being nitpicky over everything but I just have to give my two cents just this once. I'll start with the good things:\r\nThe art style was very good, a lot of the character designs I thought were very good (Apart from Ryouta but I'll get tohim.. later.) the music wasn't too great but I didn't feel like I was listening to the same music over and over again, which is good especially for a 13 episode series. Once again this is my first review so it's gonna be very terrible and not very.. professional like. This unfortunately is all I have to say that was particularly good about the show.  \\n\\n\r\nI don't know where to begin with the negatives but I'll try explaining the story. The story itself wasn't bad per say but it was more to do with how the story was presented. I've never heard of the manga before watching this show, but after a couple of episodes I started feeling bits were left out or not explained enough, and surely enough I found that 100 chapters have been crammed into 13 episodes.. that's just ridiculous a chunk of information has clearly been left out or rewritten entirely and it shows. I could not get invested at all into the struggles of the characters, especially because the characters held no weight.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'm going to say this now I hate Ryouta with a passion, everywhere I read about this show he is labled as a smart male protaganist, but all I see is a bumbling fool who is too stupid to realise that KUROHA NEKO IS KURANEKO (I hope this is not counted as a spoiler because it really shouldn't be, anyone would figure this out just from reading the summary) now I'm no Japanese expert but if you're a genius this should not have been so difficult to figure out. This is even more annoying by the fact that he has photographic memory so he remembers details and he looks exactly like her.  My favourite characters in the series were Kogorou and Chisato and they had the least screen time. The anime also tries to pointlessly through nudity about just to keep the viewer interested, I'm a person who is all for fan service but it is done sooo very poorly to the point it hurts. Lastly over the characters I will say Ryouta earned immense bonus points at the end of the extremely rushed anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime couldn't even get the action to keep me interested because every single fight scene had to involve minutes of talking and flashbacks while the protaganists friends are having enemies trying to kill them with devastating powers, NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR A FLASHBACK YOUR FRIEND WILL DIE. There are also so many moments that could have been avoided if they acted instead of talking and staring at each other!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime just was Cliche! the series, I never really took notice of anime tropes until this show shoved them all in my face. The ditzy male protagonist that is not interesting but is still the plot device and hero that all the females fall in love with, anything remotely sexual is said all the characters start blushing like mad rather than saying something rational like any normal human being would. Now there is mild nudity in this anime, I'm not sure whether this was just censoring or how the anime is intended to be even on a blu-ray release or whatever. But when you have girls in bikinis and there's massive cleavage, don't bother taking off the bikini if you're gonna make a shine that covers 10x more than the bikini. It just.. it doesn't work? \\n\\n\r\nI really wish I could go over more because there is so much I have to get off my chest about this anime that jarred me, but any further information would turn out to just be spoilers. Overall this anime is not the worst albeit very frustrating, it wouldn't be something I recommend watching but at the same time you can't really argue for anyone wanting to watch it. If I had not watched as many anime as I have this would probably be a 7/10 at best but that's not the case. So it receives a 5/10 mediocre, average. Nothing new nothing groundbreaking just a heap of the same old stuff we see with any harem ever with a bit of gore.",

            "content": "Have you ever had a plate of fruit that was so delicious and then one unsuspecting bite you end up biting into a rotten piece and you end up forgetting the good pieces because that rotten piece left such a bad taste in your mouth? That's Gokukoku no Brynhildr in a terrible metaphor I just made up. \r\n  I'm writing this review immediately after watching Gokukoku no Brynhildr, and the two words I keep coming back to, to describe this show is 'rushed' and 'disappointing',  so lets go over why I keep coming back to these two words.\r\n  Disappointing -A show that started out so promising with its opening few episodes slowly devolves into an ecchi/harem, there's nothing wrong with ecchi and harem shows by itself, but when an anime leads you to believe it's one thing, then takes a 180 halfway through to be a completely different show, it feels misleading and ruins any investment I previously  had from that point. Even after I realized that this show was not what I originally thought it would be (and was described as) I decided to keep watching because I actually enjoyed the characters and comedy, even if they both fell under tropes that I've probably seen a million times. Little did I know that any enjoyment I would have gotten from this show would slowly be ruined as the show nears its end...\\n\\n\r\n  Rushed - Gokukoku no Brynhildr starts off as a pretty good show, episodes 1-3 introduce Ryouta, our \"I need to protect my friends even if it means sacrficing myself\" main character, Kuroha a witch with a similar mindset, and Kana who is a paralyzed witch who can look into the future and see when people are about to die, Kana helps Kuroha in her mission to help save people who are about to die, it's explained that witches rely on a pill cleverly named \"death supressants\" (Yes, I'm serious.) to stay alive or else they'll melt, after a series of events and a new character who is also a witch named Kazumi with the power of super hacking abilities is introduced, they manage to get more pills, and they all go to Ryouta's school and join the astronomy club so they can hide out in an observatory for the astronomy club. This is where things start to go downhill. \\n\\n\r\n  In episode 5 we are introduced to our final important character Kotori, and how is she introduced? Well she just transfers into the same school as our characters and also just so happens to join the astronomy club,(a club that literally nobody else in the entire school joined) wow what a set of uncanny coincidences! Anyway after Kotori is introduced the show quickly becomes an ecchi harem where each girl (besides Kana) falls under a certain trope, Kotori is the big boobed, dense always giggly girl, Kazumi is the insecure small boobed girl who has a secret crush on Ryouta that isn't really a secret because she literally throws herself at him multiple times in the show, Kuroha is the shy, 'girl next door' character that also has feelings for Ryouta but doesn't understand her feelings, and finally we have Ryouta who is supposedly a genius with a photographic memory but doesn't understand why Kuroha gets mad whenever Kazumi teases Ryouta with 'lewd' talk.  \\n\\n\r\n  So after all the characters are set up there is a reptitive formula to this show, that trys to make it seem like the plot is moving forward when in reality very little is happening, this formula is summed up as 'Evil scientist antagonist who created all witches sends out a witch (each one gets progressively stronger as the show goes on) that gets defeated by our characters. This goes on until about episode 9, when they go into full on \"rush the shit out of this show and make any enjoyable elements we had completely ruined\" They end up introducing TWO more characters that are only there for plot conveniences (one to guide the character in a later episode and one to revive the character), anyway our Evil scientist character finally says \"f*** it i'm done\" and goes into the council (a group of people that meet with evil scientist in a strange room that are never really explained = the council) to tell them he's going to release the strongest witch named Valkyrie, the council tell him not to but he already released Valkyrie. Valkyrie and evil scientist end up confronting our characters and out of no where a completely new faction (that was only ever hinted at) shows up to try and kill all the witches, out of sure plot convenience evil scientist, Valkyrie and the witch that the evil scientist was after teleport to some cabin.  From this point on the viewer is barraged with new information that makes very little sense. \\n\\n\r\n  The last episode alone makes this anime that I could have easily given a 6, a 4, I really can't explain why this last episode is so bad without spoiling it, but Kuroha ends up beating Valkyrie and looks up, and asks Ryouta one question, and this question is the end of the show. They literally ended the show with  more questions than answers, and there were ALOT of questions before this scene with Kuroha and Ryouta. \\n\\n\r\n  The sad thing is the last few episodes really didn't need to be rushed as much as they were, there was SO MUCH filler in the earlier episodes that they could have just sprinkled in bits and pieces as the show went on, to give an example of how much filler there actually is, there was an entire episode dedicated to the girls getting a high test score so they could go to the beach! If the show wanted to be a harem comedy, that's fine, but this show couldn't decide what it wanted to be and ended up suffering miserably for it.",

            "content": "You've been to Walmart before right? Well, you know how they have cheaper versions of products that you've grown used to -- and how those products never particularly live up to the hype of whatever thing they're supposed to be replacing? Yeah, well Brynhildr In The Darkness is basically that, but turned into a 13 episode anime. Now, I just want to note that discounted versions of reliable products aren't always necessarily \"bad,\" but that at some point, you just have to bite the bullet and be like, \"Man, I wish I bought the brand name one instead.\"\r\nBrynhildr is the latest animated series from LynnOkamoto, the original creator of the masterpiece that we have come to know as Elfen Lied. And while Elfen Lied may have explored many different themes and ideas that were, at the time, not very common to the anime community, this new series embarks on a new exploration of the same things and tries to make it look like it's discovering them all for the first time. Basically, Brynhildr In The Darkness is the Christopher Columbus of anime. Columbus showed up in America one day and was all like, \"I am the first person to find this!\" while all of the Native Americans who were already over there were just like, \"Dude, what about us?\" and then he killed them all. This is the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nBrynhildr focuses mainly on the life of Ryouta Murakami, a seemingly average dude with an above average intellect. After watching his best friend from childhood plunge to her death while they were trying to walk across a huge pipe thing (Or something), Murakami dedicates his life to astronomy because...well...that's what his dead friend liked and stuff. So one day, several years in the future, a girl looking exactly like her (Kuroneko) escapes from some lab thing and is ultimately discovered by Murakami, who is then like, \"Yo I thought you were dead,\" only to be greeted by, \"Wtf are you talking about? I'm a witch lol\". So obviously the correct thing to do in this situation would be to run away from this creature with ridiculously abnormal telepathic power. But, instead, Murakami helps her assimilate with the average high school kids because that's totally not dangerous at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs time goes by, we discover that Kuroneko and the rest of the witches must take some pill to suppress their power from leaking out and demolishing them. Obviously, though, this pill isn't sold behind counters and must be acquired directly from the lab the witches are from. Considering at this point in time our home team consists only of Murakami, Kuroneko, and the quadriplegic best-girl (Kana), more help must be recruited. You know what this group needs? A Tsundere. So they go find one (Kazumi) and apparently she is a super-hacker that helps Kuro and Murakami break into the lab and get some life-pills. All is fine and well until the dude who I guess owns the lab is like, \"Shit, we should get those witches back\" and starts sending better witches after them. So then some more stuff happens and Kuroneko gets cut in half. But that's cool because the witch they were fighting against has the power to rewind time and of course she ultimately winds up doing so because the main girl can't die before the halfway point of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAfter escaping from the evil laboratory for the second time, Kuroneko and Murakami realize they're in some deep shit. More witches keep being sent out to find them, each one stronger than the next. So the rest of the series is a bunch of rinse-repeat as the astronomy club repels their murderous attackers while slowly gaining more good witches to join their club. Eventually, the main evil guy from the lab is like, \"Know what? I'm just gonna unleash the super bad witch to track them all down.\" The super bad witch winds up being really mean and puts a serious damper on things when she [kind of] kills one of the good witches. Kuroneko gets really mad at this because she is also a good witch and then decides it's time to unleash her ultimate power and kill the evil super bad witch lady (Who is also her sister. Surprise!). Then yay, everything goes back to normal. Or does it?...\\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell by now, Brynhildr in the darkness is basically a slightly-tweaked retelling of Elfen Lied with more girls and fanservice thrown in. In fact, almost every single thing that happens in Elfen Lied also happens in this series. Here, I'll break a few down with this cool timeline.\\n\\n\r\nElfen Lied: Lucy escapes from the isolated evil lab and is taken in by the good guy.\\n\r\nBrynhildr: Kuroneko and Kana escape from the isolated evil lab and are taken in by the good guy.\\n\\n\r\nElfen Lied: Evil lab dude sends out Nana and Bandou to track down Lucy.\\n\r\nBrynhildr: Evil lab dude sends out like five different witches to track down Kuro.\\n\\n\r\nElfen Lied: We discover that the lab is genetically modifying cute girls to create superweapons.\\n\r\nBrynhildr: We discover that the lab is genetically modifying AND CLONING cute girls to create superweapons.\\n\\n\r\nElfen Lied: Woah, Lucy is actually Kouta's childhood friend!\\n\r\nBrynhildr: Woah, Kuro is actually Ryouta's childhood friend!\\n\\n\r\nElfen Lied: Lucy prevails and Nana now has no limbs.\\n\r\nBrynhildr: Kana's limbs don't even work in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nElfen Lied: Evil lab man gets fed up and sends out Mariko (Who, for some reason, loves evil lab man).\\n\r\nBrynhildr: Evil lab man gets fed up and sends out Mako (Who, for some reason, loves evil lab man).\\n\\n\r\nElfen Lied: Mariko's powers aren't enough to kill the protagonist. Evil lab man shows soft side and dies with her on a bridge.\\n\r\nBrynhildr: Mako's powers aren't enough to kill the protagonist(s). Evil lab man shows soft side and dies with her on a balcony.\\n\\n\r\nOkamoto couldn't even get creative with the names of the characters. Kouta/Ryouta are the protagonists. Mariko/Mako are the bad guys. Honestly, I think it might be possible that Okamoto was just trying to relive his glory days with this. After Elfen Lied came out, everyone saw him as this mastermind with a fantastic story to tell -- which, he was. Since that, though, nothing he did really took off the same way. It wasn't until he basically rewrote the story that he put into the spotlight again. And honestly, if he hadn't already created Elfen Lied, this would have been a lot better. The characters are actually extremely lovable and I was incredibly surprised by how much they grew on me. The fanservice is a little heavy in this series, but the comedy is actually the best part of the entire show. Some scenes literally showcased 10/10 humor and made the watching experience increase tenfold. I tore apart the series above, but it really wasn't THAT bad. There are still some elements that really make this a relatively enjoyable show. However, certain things like Okamato's new-found hatred toward permanently killing off his characters, I would definitely change. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series was enough to make me want to read the manga, so I guess it worked it the end.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nJust watch Elfen Lied instead.",

            "content": "Brynhildr is an anime based on a manga written and drawn by the same guy who did the Elfen Lied manga. The Elfen Lied manga was a lot like the anime though the anime tied things up at the halfway point of the manga. This led to a huge problem because the anime ended very early without explaining anything but the manga continued and made a little more sense after the anime\u2019s cut-off point (though went batshit and fell apart).\r\nEnter Brynhildr, an anime that is based on a manga that is ongoing and basically has every problem Elfen Lied had and then some. It endsabruptly, it doesn\u2019t explain things, it\u2019s basically some freaky fetish show for people who like their girls dead. It has all the awkwardness of Elfen Lied combined with an even stupider plot that isn\u2019t even the cheesy, enjoyable story of its\u2019 predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta Murakami knew a girl back in the day named Kuroneko who he loved to stargaze with. Things were going great until they decided to, of all things, climb around the side of a dam. Of course being dumbass six year olds they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re probably going to die and thus does Ryouta slip and drag Kuroneko with him to a squishy death fifteen stories below. He lives, she dies. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nShe winds up transferring into his class ten years later, joining his astronomy club, and getting him mixed up in some bullshit about witches and aliens and labs. Turns out she doesn\u2019t remember him at all and has telekinetic abilities thanks to a plug on her neck. There are quite a few girls like this Ryouta meets and, inevitably, he starts a harem with them. If they use up too much power the plug stops working, if a certain button is pressed on it they\u2019re unplugged and they melt into goo.\\n\\n\r\nBrynhildr seems pretty tame for the most part until it begins to talk about these pills the girls have to take in order to stay alive. If you don\u2019t take the pill, you melt. So some drama about getting pills comes up, Ryouta and his harem of witches fight against the lab that made them the way they are, and, as you would expect from the writer of the source material, a lot of girls die horribly.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s problematic about this show is the pacing is terrible considering how much is going on. Things are slowly revealed, with the final revelation being at the end, but we aren\u2019t given enough revelations throughout for the plot to matter. And once the final revelations of the series crop up they\u2019re so rapid fire and stupid you\u2019ll most likely groan rather than drop your jaw.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happens here is the problem of attempting to invest us in a harem of girls with no personalities. It does this through a variety of means that may work to the horny fanboys but not to people with a modicum of intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nIt uses nudity as a means to get us into the characters, same as Elfen Lied did. Boobs and lame personalities are the tools that are meant to invest us in the experience and sadden us at the end of the show. But it doesn\u2019t happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem of the characters is compounded with the fact the ending is abrupt and needlessly violent. It had no drama to it. The bad guy here has been looming over things but the girl who they fight has no personality and was introduced two episodes back. There\u2019s also a resistance movement that was introduced the episode before that (though did stand in the shadows a little). By the final confrontation we\u2019ve been told all about aliens and killing humans and this, that, and the other to a point where, as a viewer, I didn\u2019t give a shit. I say the cardinal sin of a first episode is boring the viewer and not pulling them in. The cardinal sin of a final episode is having no drama and not leaving you wanting more. And you\u2019ll have that problem when you introduce so many new characters and ideas in what is essentially the home stretch.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s jump back and talk about the pacing of this show though because it, to me, is the real issue. Brynhildr wants to be a harem but as a harem it sucks. Then it wants to be a depressing drama but, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not. It fails at both genres but maintains that it wants to jump between each. The beach episode is cute and all but does it belong in a show that ends with a possible apocalypse and is focusing on girls who can die at the flick of a switch? You can have comedy and general silliness in drama but it doesn\u2019t work as a counterbalance to the sad happenings. Instead it makes the entire show a slog to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a poorly written anime (but better than some recent shows I\u2019ve watched *cough*) with some of the most amateur directing I\u2019ve seen in a while (so many abrupt cuts and fades to black that you\u2019ll scratch your head wondering what the hell just happened).So as an entire package, it\u2019s the most underwhelming show I\u2019ve done a full review on in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nLet me give you a little insight into individual characters so you can see why I didn\u2019t care and where I was slightly weirded out.\\n\\n\r\nThe main girl and love interest is Neko Kuroha, the girl from Ryouta\u2019s past who doesn\u2019t remember him. She\u2019s cute and all but her personality is kind of flat. She blushes when she has to and acts like the typical partner in a lame romance so comes across as very two-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nKotori Takatori is the same way. Huge boobs, clumsy, and shy. Woop-dee-fucking-doo.\\n\\n\r\nKazumi *Unpronounceable German Name* is a sex fiend who just wants to fuck. Personally, as cardboard as she was I thought she was fun and added some silly moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we\u2019ll end this discussion with Kana Tachibana, the immobile girl who can\u2019t eat by herself or do much aside from type on a little device that spits out a computerized voice to speak for her. And somehow, that device manages to capture the voice of a tsundere\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEven more disturbing is how she\u2019s sexualized. Later we find out why she\u2019s the way she is but the occasional sexual scene with her is fucking disturbing to me. Who is getting off to the girl who needs help eating?\\n\\n\r\nThey all have a variety of powers such as hacking into computers or the classic \u201cpremonition of bad things happening only when convenient\u201d ability.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are more of the same, lame and poorly developed creatures of which I don\u2019t really care if they die or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is dated leading to some uninspired character design and wholly underwhelming action sequences. The first opening song was good but the visuals that go with it are too slow for the faster rhythm of the music  On top of that, the opening shows shit that doesn\u2019t even happen in the show which is pretty dumb. The second opening is Japanese screamo and not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nBrynhildr is occasionally funny and can be decent at times, but isn\u2019t decent enough of the time for me to care. It\u2019s pretty much the same shit as Elfen Lied and doesn\u2019t even try to distinguish itself from its predecessor. It looks generic, it feels generic, and it is generic. You\u2019d be a happier person without this show in your life and I\u2019d be a happier person if I could find a freaking 2014 anime that doesn\u2019t suck.",

            "content": "There are some ending spoilers in this review, but I honestly don't think it matters since to me this anime wasn't worth watching anyways. I would never wish these 13 episodes upon anyone, especially when it only ends in disappointment. \r\nI've never written a review before and I watched this anime quite a while ago, so this may not be the best in terms of memory or writing. I do remember, however, absolutely hating this anime.\r\nSure, it had its positives. I did find charm in some of the characters and this show's overall premisis, but other than that I can hardly say anything good aboutit. The openings in this series to me definitely make it seem a lot cooler and show more promise than the series actually has.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many moments in this series where I experienced second hand embarrasment, dreadfully so. The main character was an absolute failure in my own opinion and I could hardly stand him, let alone the other \"main\" female cast that was shown as well. \\n\r\nEveryone shown basically had no relevance to him in the end, only his love interest, who I believe was named Kotonoha. All of the characters working together was shut down in about the final episode, where these characters were killed off one by one in a series of reaching the final stage. I fondly recall being terribly at a loss for why I had taken the time out of my life to watch this animated series in the first place, and I also wondered why it had been brought into existence. \\n\r\nThe whole show was just so ridiculous to me, attempting to appeal to its audience while failing miserably all the same. It's just really not worth it, and I'd even say I enjoy a series such as School Days a lot more than this.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not the best writer or anything and my points are definitely not spot on, especially since it has been a while since I've seen this, but I would never ever risk rewatching this anime even to make a decent review. I would save yourself some time and not go through these episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to then I can't stop you, and if you actually enjoyed this then I congratulate you in being able to withstand or even find the good in something as truly mediocre as Gokukoku no Brynhildr.",
